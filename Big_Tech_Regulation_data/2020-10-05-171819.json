The primacy of the client attracted big techs, such as <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>that wants to enter Portugal in banking, but also fintech, which can be allied with the incumbent bank.  If we already see <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>asking for a bank license to operate in Portugal and Google investing heavily in fintech, then it's time to act, \"says Jo\u00e3o Freire de Andrade, president of Portugal Fintech.\" In countries where online retailing is \"tech players, such as Apple, Google, Amazon and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in the United States, and Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent in China,\" Fabio Panetta, governor of Italy. </p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/> For Nuno Fernandes, dean of the Catholic Lisbon School of Business &amp; Economics and Professor of Finance, this emergence of fintechs and big techs is related to the fact that, in the financial business, a \"customer centricity\" , which is also called the C2B era (consumer-to-business). <br/><br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Customer Experiences</emphasis><br/><br/><br/><br/> \"Big techs have two major differentiating factors regarding customer relationships and requirements,\" says Jo\u00e3o Freire de Andrade, who is also head of BiG Start Ventures. The first is recurrence, \"every day, in the course of your life, people pass in the way of these companies.\" Therefore, \"it is very easy for the end customer to choose one of these companies as their personal ecosystem, since they can do everything they need in one site already used every day.\" <br/><br/><br/><br/> The second factor relates to the fact that these companies have a very large \"user experience\" budget, \"becoming specialists in digital contact and the creation of an optimal experience, which contributes to a easier to attract the customer, \"concludes Jo\u00e3o Freire de Andrade. <br/><br/><br/><br/> Changing consumer profiles also helps. \"Consumers - especially those in their 20s and 30s - are increasingly receptive to their banking services being provided by a nontraditional financial services company,\" said an Accenture report, Beyond The Everyday Bank, on the transformation of digital banking brought about by big tech, or techfin. <br/><br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alliance against the giants</emphasis><br/><br/><br/><br/> \"As a result of the financial collapse and the serious consequences for the world economy, customers (both private and business) became more demanding, more informed, questioning the fees charged to them and the real added value of in the opposite direction, Fintechs appear much faster, dynamic, cheap and highly oriented to respond quickly and efficiently to customer requirements, \"says Nuno Fernandes. <br/><br/><br/><br/> The incumbents, the traditional banks, are going to have to change. The strategy that \"should be followed\", according to Nuno Fernandes, \"is the collaboration between banks and fintech. <br/><br/> This collaboration is essential for the future of innovation in financial services. In this way, traditional financial institutions can complete the talent and technology gap and fintech gain structure to develop their business. \" <br/><br/><br/><br/> \"More than 75% of fintech's businesses have as their primary business objective to collaborate with traditional financial services,\" said Anirban Bose, Head of Business UnitCapgemini Global Financial Services Strategy at the World FinTech Report 2018 presentation. <br/><br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Perfect combination</emphasis><br/><br/><br/><br/> \"For the incumbent bank, the strategy must be three-dimensional: to integrate, co-create and invest with technological companies,\" says Jo\u00e3o Freire de Andrade. In their view, \"start-ups often appear on the market not to replace but to complement incumbent service with a greater focus on the end customer and a specific problem. By integrating these services into the offering incumbents can solve many problems that the consumer detects in their relationship with the bank. \" <br/><br/><br/><br/> On the other hand, for fintech, \"incumbent banking can be a strong candidate for data storage as it incorporates a solid and secure structure,\" which solves one of the \"open API\" problems, which is where they should be stored data complying with the general data protection regulation. <br/><br/><br/><br/> They can combine the advantages of each partner. \"Fintech is redefining customer experience in the financial sector through a technology-driven and customer-centric approach, while Fintech can benefit from the greater level of confidence customers still have with traditional banking,\" he says. the director of Catholic. <br/><br/><br/><br/> The long-term success of fintech and financial institutions depends on this collaboration, even to find suitable business models \"in a context of greater customer demand and greater competition, such as big tech\", concludes Nuno Fernandes <br/><br/><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-4175611</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T94-2WY1-DY1K-83VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"759\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 18, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001ZX8</classCode><className>ACCENTURE PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

His work is immense, as it requires deep-seated knowledge of the wealth of interrelated factors that shape the highly complex and changing economic, political and social situation at present. As is also habitual for the author, he is successful in his venture: he presents a profound and well-structured analysis of the issue. And one that is, moreover, reader-friendly and comprehensible. Our congratulations, Emilio.</p><p>1. The book's main line of argument</p><p>As Professor Ontiveros rightly says, the globalisation and growing openness of economies to the flow of trade, finance, persons and knowledge, lauded by many just some years back as the fundamental driver of global economic development, is now questioned by significant economic, political and social agents, at least in its current form.</p><p>Among the causes behind this, the author highlights how the opening up and globalisation of economic relations has promoted the rise of new emerging powers - with China to the fore - on the global stage. These powers are significant not only economically, but also politically and geo-strategically. This has resulted in the growing complexity of global governance and in a rivalry that currently threatens to break the multilateral arrangements in force since the Second World War. We should recall that Chinese membership of the WTO was not accompanied by a parallel process involving its transformation towards a market economy. Indeed, China retained high export subsidies, was hardly open to foreign investment and pursued industrial and technological policies that distorted international relations. This has prompted continuous complaints by the Western powers.</p><p>Partly, one of the arguments behind the protectionist reaction led most recently by the United States has been the WTO's inability to correct these distortions. Yet it should be stressed that the US shift towards bilateralism in international relations has significant consequences, beyond merely trade considerations, that stretch to the struggle for leadership of technological developments and, more generally, to an effort to sustain a privileged position in the economic and political arenas. The United States is not an isolated case in the shift. And undoubtedly bilateralism, linked in part to free market economy constraints, has gained weight recently in how other nations operate globally. </p><p>In any event, as the author points out, what is true is that the shift to protectionist-style policies - commercially and geopolitically - threatens to break the multilateral global governance arrangements in force. Paradoxically, the United States had led these arrangements over recent decades. Now, there is a consequent danger for global prosperity. The redistribution of power among a growing number of players entails the replacement of the multilateral international cooperation arrangements with a new, more fragmented, decentralised and informal system as regards decision-making, in which bilateral and regional solutions trump multilateral agreements.</p><p>Another characteristic feature of globalisation recently has been the onrush of the digital revolution and the roll-out of new communication and information technologies. These are driving radical changes in the economy, in society, in how we understand labour relations and in investment and consumption decisions.</p><p>As the author indicates in the book, we are yet to fully discern the possibilities that artificial intelligence, robotisation and quantum computing can offer in the different facets of our lives. Professor Ontiveros also emphasises the risks and threats the application of these new technologies entails, e.g. the control of individuals, the invasion of privacy, the concentration of market power in the Big Tech companies, inequality and the exclusion of those who fail to adapt.</p><p>Adding to globalisation and technical change is the demographic challenge. This poses fundamental challenges to growth, productivity and the sustainability of public finances in numerous economies. Migratory problems and those arising from unstoppable urbanisation have also become priorities given their implications for economic, social and environmental development.</p><p>With all these ingredients, the author's main line of argument in the book is that globalisation, bound up with intense technological changes and the deregulation of economies, has contributed to generating uneven economic growth, a prevalence of the financial over the real economy, a concentration of market power in major corporations (which has stifled competition) and a deterioration in the environment.</p><p>These are the \"excesses\" to which the title of the book refers. And, according to Professor Ontiveros, they must be tackled by reformulating the capitalist system and the multilateral governance framework. With this reformulation, Professor Ontiveros suggests governments and public institutions should play a more active role when regulatorily mitigating market failings and oversee compliance with the rules. In his view, that would also serve to ensure the use and efficient, but fair, distribution of resources along with more inclusive and sustainable growth. </p><p>Disclaimer: The full PDF release can be found at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/GAP/Secciones/SalaPrensa/IntervencionesPublicas/Gobernador/Arc/hdc280120en.pdf\">https://www.bde.es/f/webbde/GAP/Secciones/SalaPrensa/IntervencionesPublicas/Gobernador/Arc/hdc280120en.pdf</url></p><p>Source: Banco de Espana</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INBNWS-0051602342</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INBNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y55-YJ21-JB5M-W0YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1021\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Contify Banking News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Thanks for joining. This is Sergio G\u00c3\u00a1mez, Global Head of Investor Relations at Santander. And obviously, thank you for attending our Investor Day.</p><p>As you can see from the agenda, we have a very busy morning ahead with presentations and fireside chats from the group -- some of the group's senior management. Obviously, we will kick off the Investor Day with the Banco Santander Group Executive Chairman, Ana Bot\u00c3\u00adn; and our Group CEO, Jos\u00e9 Antonio \u00c3lvarez; then we will have a Q&amp;A session to which our Group CFO, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cantera, will also participate. Then after the coffee break, in the second half, we will discuss some of the key issues shaping the growth of our business such as Latin America growth and our supertankers or core banks with Sergio Rial, CEO of Santander Brazil; and Dirk Marzluf, Global Head of IT and Ops. And obviously, as well, we will discuss on additional fireside chat the digital transformation with Lindsey Argalas, our Innovation Officer; and the CEO of Openbank, Ezequiel Szafir.</p><p>Just to let you know, we wanted to use today not just to give you a great PowerPoint presentation but also to take the opportunity about how our digital investments is capturing market growth and give you the chance to see the solutions and hear from the teams that are delivering them. And that's why you saw 7 booths in total. And you can get a couple minutes demo talking different market segment, all of them with a flexible and a scalable solution that actively is bringing to life our vision of becoming the best open financial services platform and earning the lasting loyalty of our customers. Please take the opportunity to go over to the booths during the lunch.</p><p>That's all for me now. So now over to Ana. Thank you.</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA, GROUP EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, BANCO SANTANDER, S.A.: So good morning, and welcome to our Investor Day. I will start by basically reviewing briefly our strategy. As we said, we are not going to be changing our strategy. We are going to be presenting you our next 3-year, 4-year plan, our medium-term plan. And so it's important to remind ourselves what it is that we set out to do 3 years ago when we presented in October 2015.</p><p>We are focused on earning the lasting loyalty of our people, our customers, our shareholders and communities. And we have refined our aim. As a bank, we want to be the best open financial services platform, and we want to do that and earn the lasting loyalty of all our stakeholders by doing everything in a way that is simple and personal and fair.</p><p>And really at the base of all we do and our success, not just today and in the past but going forward, is embedding this culture across the organization. And this loyalty strategy is paramount for our sustainable profitability growth over the coming years. It's a virtuous circle you can see in there. If our people are more committed, they will do an extra effort for our customers, who will give us their business more and more, and this will be good for you -- for us, for you, all of us, our shareholders, and would be able to support our communities in a better way.</p><p>So in terms of how we've been doing this over the last 3 years. As you know, we have an -- please take advantage of this because they're all here. We have incorporated a lot of new people over the last -- basically in '14 and '15, we have -- we put in place new CEOs in Brazil, Mexico, U.K., Spain, the U.S. We have a new Head of IT and Ops, new Head of Santander Digital, Head of Risk, Wealth Management, Openbank. And of course, as you know, we refreshed our board and our internal governance. And this is super important because this is what has truly given us support for the strategy.</p><p>And we have been focusing on 2 key fronts, earning the loyalty of our customers, becoming the bank of choice; but also very important and you'll hear more about that today, accelerating our digital transformation and providing our customers a seamless experience across all our channels, whether physical or digital. And all of this with a goal of growth, profitability and increasing strength of our balance sheet.</p><p>At the core of the strategy, as I said, you've seen this before so I will not spend a lot of time, but really at the core of our strategy is earning more loyal customers. We have a big customer base, lots of active customers. Earning the loyalty of more and more of these customers is essential because they're more profitable, they have higher revenues, and this is also true for digital customers. Very important, and this is a big difference with most of our European peers, we have grown our revenues over the last 3 years.</p><p>Second, profitability. And there is more to do. I will get on to that and Jos\u00e9 Antonio also. But we have done a -- we've made a big progress on the profitability front. You can see here all our geographies in the group. Our return on risk-weighted assets has gone from 1.2% to 1.55%. Very importantly in 2015, only 40% of our capital was invested above our cost of equity. Today, that is 90%. And obviously, we aim to do more than that. And very important, we have invested in value-creating acquisitions that help us in the transformation of our model. Buying back some core businesses that we had sold, but very importantly through some add-on acquisitions, obviously Popular is maybe a bit more than that, but -- and divestitures. So it's not just about acquiring, it's about selling when it's not core or they're not performing, and you have the list there. At the end, the net of those 2 is a net buying, and you'll see -- I will show you the numbers later.</p><p>We are focusing on the profitability not just of our countries, but we have been focusing a lot also on the profitability by segments. So this is the only way to maximize profitability. We're not going to invest forever even if the country is very profitable in segments or businesses that do not deliver within a period of time, and this is also helping us on this quest for profitability.</p><p>So you can see here, if you take the benchmark of the 1.2% we started in 2015, that we've gone from 80% to 30% of our risk-weighted assets being above this 1.2% cutoff. As an example, for example, within the U.S., we have shifted assets from SBNA in terms of growth to Santander Consumer. And in many other countries, this is happening, where we're actually investing more in certain segments than in others according to the profitability targets that we have set ourselves.</p><p>Finally, on strength, Jos\u00e9 Antonio will cover in more detail what we have done and what we intend to do in the future. We are generating a lot of organic capital. You can see over this period, EUR 25 billion plus. As I explained perimeter, ex Popular, we've invested EUR 2.3 billion. We have given back to shareholders and AT1 holders EUR 12.8 billion. And the organic generation after dividends would be a bit more than EUR 10 billion. So with the capital increase in 2015, we have added net to our capital base close to EUR 18 billion over this time period.</p><p>And finally, in terms of our final profitability to shareholders or returns to shareholders. As you know, the new team has focused and will continue to focus on earnings per share and tangible NAV per share plus dividend -- cumulative dividends. If you look at the returns without FX, which is truly what is under our control, we delivered 55% increase over this period and 41% tangible NAV plus cumulative dividends. If you look in euros at the end, it's 22% and 27%. Clearly, FX has been a drag on our results, and we intend to continue improving. We're not happy where our share price is, obviously, but we have outperformed in this period the benchmark of European banks.</p><p>I would like to spend now a few minutes, and this is important for the future, which is how is Santander as a group of businesses, where do we stand in terms of the competitive environment? Why can we succeed? And why do we have as a management team the confidence that our strategy will continue to work? And this is very important to understand for the future, so I am going to spend a few slides on this.</p><p>The first thing is that we have scale. It's not just global scale. It's in-market scale, and this is a key, I'd say, foundation for everything that you're going to be hearing in the next few hours.</p><p>The second is diversification. We have 10 core markets in Europe and the Americas. Not just that, across developed and developing markets. And this is what is leading to a more predictable and growing earnings profile than other banks. This is 20-year data, but it works for the last 4 or 5 years. It's Bloomberg. It's the EPS quarterly volatility, 9% for Santander, 140% for our peers. These are the best and biggest banks in the world. The net income increase for Santander has been 5x, and that is 3x the peer average. This is, of course, what is allowing us to deliver through the cycle.</p><p>So I'm going to spend some time on the scale question, why are we able to compete in this new digital world? This is how we manage the bank. If you look at the top of the house, it's the countries, the flags. We do have very strong horizontal businesses that sometimes do not get enough visibility, and we're adding to that. So commercial investment banking, Wealth Management and Consumer. Consumer, in this case, as you know, now it's a European business, but it's more and more coordinated with the U.S., and it already supervises a small business in China. These 3 businesses account for EUR 4 billion in 2015. In 2018, they account for EUR 4.9 billion. What's important is that this is what provides the group value. So a lot of the results you are seeing in the countries are already today benefiting from the network effects of being part of the Santander Group. I'm talking about revenues. So there are more revenues because you are part of the Santander Group. Obviously, CIB is a natural one; but more and more wealth, which is a new division; and more and more, Consumer Finance.</p><p>What we're announcing today, and it was in my Shareholders' Letter, is another big horizontal business, which is the payments-related businesses. This is the glue that really binds together our retail franchises. It's super important and also, our SME businesses. I will give you more detail on this now in a few minutes, but this is a big step forward in having Santander as a group work together and leveraging, not just the scale but the talent and the knowledge that we have across the organization.</p><p>And the third, the foundation of everything, of course, is our digital transformation, IT and Ops and procurement divisions, which are generating already big savings across the group and big revenue additions in the case of digital. In 2018 alone, this has helped generate efficiencies of EUR 700 million, around EUR 430 million of which from IT and Ops and digital.</p><p>So if we focus now just a bit more on those foundations that you just saw in the last slide, the knowledge in operations is a huge part of what we're doing together. And I just wanted to give you some context in terms of where does the Santander Group stand in this new global digital world.</p><p>These are the 4 biggest banks in the U.S., if you exclude the Chinese it means the world, the number of digital customers. And I don't think the market realizes how strong we are in terms of digital because, at the end, it's about the customers. And by the way, customers is not users. So many times, you hear hundreds and even billions of numbers of users. That's not the same as the customer. For the banks, these are customers. And the digital customers measure that Santander uses is more strict than the peers you see there. We use a 30-day active customer. The other banks on this chart, from what they say in their reports, is a 90-day. So let's assume the numbers are comparable. We would be the third largest bank in the world, at least in the U.S., with 32 million customers in digital.</p><p>In digital and technology expenditure, this is per year, you can see again we would be top 5. And in terms of digital investment, we'd be probably 3 or 4. A couple of the banks don't report this. So we do have the scale, and scale will be -- already is, but will be even more important to succeed in the next few years. So EUR 5 billion IT representing 10% of our total revenue, of which EUR 2 billion are digital investments.</p><p>So I would like now to cover our geographies. I will start with Europe. What is the scale we have within Europe? And Europe is Europe as a geography, not euro with Brexit or no Brexit and no currencies. This is Europe as a geography, all of it. You can see there we include Santander Consumer, the U.K., Poland. And of course, in Europe, we are present in what we believe, and I think objectively, are the most profitable overall banking markets. Here, we're going to focus on delivering the best customer experience in the most efficient way. There will be a lot of focus on achieving cost efficiencies. And in terms of growth going forward, we're going to leverage on Openbank. We -- I'll cover that in a few minutes. But our expansion into the rest of Europe will be organically and will be mostly through our digital banking, and we'll give you some targets in a few minutes.</p><p>Openbank has a 38% active -- sorry, loyal/active. This is as good a number as our strong European franchises. And again, if you measure that against other neobanks, it's a very different number, very different kind of customers with a 59% increase in transactions in the last 2 years.</p><p>If we go to Latin America. Obviously, we're the very -- I'd say the #1 bank in the region. This is a region with 600 million total population. It's 200 million unbanked and 300 million underbanked population. And very importantly, with a strong middle class expansion. This is exactly what we need as a bank, and this is where we believe there's a lot of potential for many years to come. The 60 million expected middle class by 2030, that's plus 20%, and that's really where banking can grow. So we're very -- and we continue to be very confident that we have a unique position in the region with a lot of potential.</p><p>Just as another fact, over the last 3 years, we have grown our market share in Latin America by 90 basis points. And as you know, we've done that by increasing profitability in a significant way at the same time. And this is what matters for growth, of course. We are among the top 3 banks in terms of market share in all our markets and top 5 in customer satisfaction. In some of them, we're obviously better than that.</p><p>So the other market I'd like to focus on a bit is the U.S. I'd like to start by saying again -- and remember, I'm trying to lay the foundation so I can then get on to what we're going to do over the next few years.</p><p>So it's an important market, the U.S. It's actually much more than an important market. It's actually the largest banking pool with continued growth in the world. It's 1/3 of the world's banking pool. It's a market with a consistently high profitability. Obviously, you might say, well, the direction can only be down. But the fact is that if you look at it through the cycle, the structure of the U.S. market has remained very attractive. It's concentrated. There's big 4 banks. Again, as you saw before, we can compete with those 4 banks in terms of scale of investment, and that in today's world is very important.</p><p>But the key point here is the last one, which is it's very closely linked with our core markets in Latin America. Not just Mexico, Chile too and Brazil increasingly so, and in Europe. So there's a lot of trade flows, a lot of connections that there is no other bank like us that can exploit with all types of customers, not just with the top, very large customers where there is much more competition but where -- by the way, we compete very effectively.</p><p>So going back to what Santander has today in the U.S. We believe we have the building blocks. Maybe they can be improved yet, but the progress we have made is very significant over the last couple of years. I show here SBNA. SBNA is the one piece of our business that I was referring to before that, on its own, would not cover the cost of equity yet. But you can see here, over the last couple of years, we have done a lot of convergence with our peers in terms of net interest margin. It's not just absolute, but relative performance has been much better than the peers. And in terms of attributable profit, once we did the cleanup, we now have a much more sustainable P&amp;L than we had 3, 4 years ago, which was a lot of financial results, data customer results. And it's an increase of 3.5x.</p><p>I will not go through the details on the right, but that is exactly where we should be focusing and we are going to be focusing. How can we get more value from our retail franchise? The retail franchise, the footprint of SBNA, is a country with the same amount of people as the U.K. roughly but with a GDP per capita of $70,000. So very interesting market, where we believe we can add a lot of value. By the way, we have been very limited in what we could do in terms of launching new products so we really could only fix the basics. We could not really have a growth -- organic growth strategy.</p><p>The commercial links with our core markets. I mentioned before we're doing a lot of work between Mexico and the U.S., between the U.S. and the U.K., and we have really very encouraging results, where the branch network is important because a lot of these customers are medium-sized customers. This is commercial. And we're generating very, very interesting increases in revenues from the strategy of really going to the network effects with our European and Latin American markets.</p><p>CIB. I mentioned 70% of the income in the U.S. is coming from international revenues. And of course, Consumer and wealth are also being managed more and more horizontally.</p><p>So to end with our existing businesses, we have these 3 global businesses, 2 of which, corporate and investment banking, Wealth Management, are truly global and are working as a global division. 42% of our client revenues in CIB across the group are cross-border. Jos\u00e9 Antonio will give more details, but this has been our -- one of our best performances in terms of the discipline in capital allocation, and you will see those numbers. Our return on risk-weighted assets here has gone from 1.3% to 1.8%. And our medium-term growth prospects are around 8%.</p><p>Wealth Management, a very high-return business. We have 4 million potential private banking customers in market, and this is a very attractive, again, opportunity for growth.</p><p>So it shows that when we collaborate across the group, we can really generate that increased growth and increased profitability with a limited investment.</p><p>To end this section, I'd just like to spend some time on our culture and what we're doing in terms of having a team that is more and closer to our customers. We want to be a responsible bank. We are measuring how our teams see us in terms of being simple, personal and fair. We have shown the least improvement. Well, I'd say we're not as well graded in simple, and I will say something about that and our organization later on.</p><p>We keep on supporting our communities and promoting financial inclusion and sustainable growth in everything we do and supported, in 2018 alone, 273,000 micro entrepreneurs.</p><p>So attracting and retaining the best talent, of course, is key for our success. This is not easy sometimes, being a regulated bank, and we're doing a lot of work on this. We want to be a top bank to work for. We're already a top 3 bank to work for in 7 of our geographies. And if you look at the group against the financial industry average, in terms of the degree of employees' commitment, we are 6 percentage points above the average. And of course, we want to keep on improving. We are investing a lot in our digital transformation area in terms of skills, and this is something we'll continue focusing on. And diversity and inclusion is a top goal for us and will continue to be going forward.</p><p>So looking ahead, we have a 3-pillar plan for increasing our profitability. The first one is a continuous improvement in our operating performance. I will go briefly into what this means for us in the U.S., in Latin America and in Europe.</p><p>In terms of Latin America, our aim for the medium term is to go from a 19% return on tangible equity in 2018 to a medium-term goal of 20% to 22%. And of course, continue growing our market share and our loyalty strategy.</p><p>In terms of the U.S., I gave some context earlier on. We are aiming 8% return on tangible equity. It's normalized for 11.3% capital because, as you know, we have 17%, 18% CET1. There are some tax considerations. Our aim is organically, and with the strategy I described earlier of networking within the group, to get to 11% to 13% market share over the next few years that's well above our cost of equity in the U.S.</p><p>In Europe, we are at 11% return on tangible equity. The goal here is to be at 12% to 14%. Again, we continue to aim to gain market share and to grow significantly the number of customers, though not as much as in the U.S. Jos\u00e9 Antonio will give more details again on this -- on the operating performance plans.</p><p>The second pillar is accelerating digitization and building an open financial services platform. We have explained before how we approach this digitization. It's our core banks, what we call it supertankers, be the best for our customers and deliver profitable growth. And yes, have some speedboats, which are faster, more agile units that will also compete against the main banks. Openbank competes against Santander Spain sometimes or Santander Spain is very, very good in digital also. But it's important that they can go faster, they can try new things. For example, we were the first full bank on the cloud in Europe. It takes longer to get our bigger banks approved. So there's many things where having a separate organization really helps us and by the way, really helps the supertankers because there's a connection there also.</p><p>What we're going to -- over the next few years, we are going to invest a lot more in our franchises, and this is one of the key competitive strengths, I believe, going forward is, of course, how much, of course, how you invest also. But we are planning a EUR 20 billion investment between -- in IT and digital to improve the customer experience and, at the same time, to improve the cost of delivery. This is the graph I showed you earlier. So it's basically for the next 4 years.</p><p>We're going to invest in the horizontal businesses, as I described, and the big area for us will be payments. These are businesses that if and we do well for ourselves, we should be able to offer for others. And this is very important for our scale and for our efficiency, but also for our returns. And we are going to build first for our own banks. In many cases, that is not happening today.</p><p>Going back to the scale, Santander as a group has 4 million SME customers with ranked top 10 in the world by acquiring business. We have over 80 million cards, and we do EUR 500 billion in payments across our markets.</p><p>So the 3 businesses we're going to target, they're all part of the payment strategy. One is global trade services. The goal here is to have one global platform providing integrated best-in-class solutions. We have a lot of these solutions across the group. Some are in commercial, investment -- corporate and investment banking. Others are in the SME side in the banks. We want to bring all of that together into a single global platform that we can then also offer to third parties.</p><p>And this is based on something which is quite unique. Our 3 biggest countries, U.K. is not there, it's getting there, but in terms of SME customers are Brazil, Spain and Mexico. In these 3 countries, we have over 20% market share in the SME market. Again, these are very strong relationships with the top customers, SMEs. And from there, we can build across the group and then beyond that.</p><p>We have the full product chain -- sorry, full product suite here already, as I said, within the bank. It's a matter of bringing it all together into a single global platform. It's going to take a few years, but this is something we're very excited about because, of course, these are businesses that are not just allowing to engage customers and part of our loyalty strategy, but the returns are very interesting with very -- a lot less capital than the lending business.</p><p>The second is global merchant services. Here, we also have a unique asset, which is GetNet in Brazil. That is already a platform which we need to take global, but it's all there. It's all together, and it's best-in-class. In a huge market, which is Brazil, it has grown 2x over the last couple of years. It has a 14% market share, and transactional growth has grown by 16x. We are already working to take GetNet to Mexico, which is obviously the second biggest potential market, and then to Europe and the rest of the group.</p><p>I have said before that we are top 10, we're #10. But as you can see, if you take out the specialists, which are the big tech platforms, we'd be the fifth bank in the world. And I just want to stress this again, a bank customer is not the same as a specialist customer. And if we can leverage this in the right way, this is a big advantage not just for us but for banks in general. We know this. We've done the POS, point-of-sale. We know that that's a key product to engage customers, and we know what it means in terms of customer revenue uplift when you have that POS relationship. We have 1.2 million merchants worldwide, as I mentioned, EUR 150 billion in global turnover.</p><p>The third leg for now in our payment strategy is One Pay FX. This is actually one of our speedboats. We're going to manage these 3 areas coordinated but separately because that's a way to build faster. One Pay FX, we have 2 angles, but it's a common platform. It's a global platform. One is for our existing customers. It's called One Pay FX. It's going really well. It has a 20% month-on-month user growth, huge increase in transactions, very high customer satisfaction. If you're a Santander U.K. customer today, you can already use this. We are very competitive for the smaller payments, as competitive as our biggest, let's say, nonbank competitors.</p><p>And we're going to be launching the open-market solution, will be called Pago FX, in a few months. I say a few months because with compliance and conduct, which we value very highly, it's taking us longer. But the good news is when it does come out, it's going to be best-in-class for -- these are the 3 key words: simple, fair and safe, in this case, because we are going to manage as a bank what many others manage as nonbanks. And we expect to be live in the U.K. It says there short term. I don't want to give a date because these compliance and conduct issues sometimes take longer, but hopefully by September you will see it in the open market. And the goal here is to reach 2 million customers in the open market solution and 5 million plus in the other one.</p><p>Openbank is Europe's largest full service digital bank. What's important here is that it's a business model, and I believe there is no other way in the medium term. We must, as banks, be able to service all our customers in all channels with cost incomes of 35%, and this would lead us to return on tangible equities of 20%. I'm not saying we're going to get there tomorrow, but this is super important. We can manage a full bank, full service bank, all products and services with these kind of numbers. And again, in Spain, we've only been live for 2 years, and the numbers in terms of loyal customers are very encouraging.</p><p>The second goal for Openbank is to build the model bank. So the goal here is that Openbank could be the platform for our big banks in the future. Maybe not for all of them, maybe not for all the services, maybe not for all the segments, but for a significant part of our business.</p><p>If this is the case, this would be a very transformational thing. And this is the mandate we gave when they built the tech stack. That it could be resilient, scalable, could take large volumes of transactions as we do in the big banks. We are already testing this in some markets. In the U.S., for example, the core for Santander Bank in Miami is the same as Openbank. So it would not be impossible to think that Openbank platform could be the U.S. platform in the future.</p><p>And the third, it's more into the medium term, is if we can do this for ourselves and our banks, we could actually do this for others. And I'm sure you've heard the term banking-as-a-service, but this is something which is a possibility maybe 2 years down the road.</p><p>The last piece what I want to mention briefly is Superdigital. This is a business that we call profit with purpose. It is self-funded. So it actually makes money while it grows. It's a nonbank bank account, if you allow me the term. We are now embarked on building a global platform. So you will see Superdigital being rolled out in all the Santander countries, so that part of the population that is either unbanked or underbanked. So the goals here are quite ambitious. Today, we're in Brazil, Chile and Mexico. In the medium term, we aim to be in 7-plus markets in all of Latin America. And actually, this is a product which could be very interesting for our developed markets also.</p><p>So there's a lot of numbers on this slide, and I will let Jos\u00e9 Antonio, you will see the same one, when he talks. But I'd just like to give you 2 numbers. One is that you are going to see a P&amp;L for Europe. Our businesses in Europe are totally undervalued right now if you look at our share price and valuation. So we're going to give you much more visibility across Europe as a region. Europe today is 50% of our profits. It's 70% of our balance sheet, and it's about 50% of our cost. So if you look at all of the European businesses ex the Corporate Centre, and that's about EUR 10.2 billion at the close of 2018. What we are announcing today, and this is very different to other competitors, is a net decrease in cost across our European businesses of 10% roughly. EUR 1 billion.</p><p>Again, if you look at the European business, a lot of this is about IT and Ops, a lot of this is about building things together. 10% net decrease in cost compared to 2018 close. So many banks give the numbers. They go up, then they go down, they always stay the same. This is not what we're doing. We're going to have a net decrease in cost of 10% within medium term. So we're giving ourselves a bit of flexibility in the timing, and that is the number.</p><p>The other number is that the total, EUR 1.2 billion in savings, of that EUR 1 billion is in IT and Ops and EUR 220 million. So the numbers are quite similar by coincidence. So Europe, 10% decrease net; total cost, EUR 1.2 billion.</p><p>In terms of capital allocation, this is our third. But obviously, we've been working on this already for the last few years. We're going to do much more here. We have a number of initiatives that we're going to continue to work on. The key message here is that we have taken, it's not something in the future. We've taken measures to bring the corporate and investment banking model to the next segment. A lot of our least profitable portfolios is not countries, it's segments. It's the mid corp segment. So what we've done is we've introduced the same profitability cutoff rates and thresholds for the mid corp segment across our franchise. We are also working very hard, and this is going to be very important on the capital tools. So having the tools to really understand bottom-up how we can maximize not just economic capital, we've been doing that for years, but regulatory capital, which until 3 years ago was not the focus. And we're going to align senior management incentives to make sure everybody has this common goal.</p><p>So I'd like to end here by saying that we're very confident on our strategy. It has delivered for us over the last 3 years. We will continue to focus on loyal and digital customer and customer excellence as our main goal. We have this very clear 3-point plan that Jos\u00e9 Antonio will give you a few more details now. And we continue to focus on increasing earnings per share and tangible NAV per share with dividends.</p><p>The return on tangible equity goals, you know already. We aim to be between 11% and 12% in capital. I would like just to point out that the goal is to manage around 11.5%. So we will aim to get to 12% as soon as we can as long as we can continue investing so we can deliver not just today but in the medium term. And the 11% to 12% is very important because we want to have some room for volatility in foreign exchange, especially. So that is why we say 11% to 12%. We could be below 11.5%, but our target is to be around that 11.5%.</p><p>Efficiency is a new target. We want to be 42% to 45%. This is quite ambitious, of course, for a bank that has -- have the business in Europe and with a dividend payout, which we are aiming and our intention is to have a progressive dividend payment, but not to have a lower cash dividend per share that we have had -- that we will have in 2018.</p><p>And we're convinced this will continue delivering for all our stakeholders in terms of profitable growth and increasing strength of our balance sheet. Thank you.</p><p>JOS\u00e9 ANTONIO \u00c3LVAREZ \u00c3LVAREZ, CEO &amp; VICE CHAIRMAN, BANCO SANTANDER, S.A.: Good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. After Ana went through the main points of our strategy for the next year, I am going to focus a little bit more in operational issues and operational levers that we have in our hands to improve our profitability in the coming years.</p><p>The presentation is going to be split in 3 main points: The first -- being the first one, the operational levers we have in our hands to enhance profitability; the second one, I will elaborate a little bit more in detail in capital, the capital allocation. And finally, I'm going to review the group medium-term goals that were already mentioned.</p><p>In operational levers, we have -- I'm going to go through 3 different dimensions: First, at the group level; second, elaborating a little bit more in detail in the core banks in the main geographies and the exercise we plan to do in those geographies to improve our profitability; and finally, I will go through the global businesses that are increasingly important for our strategy, as Ana mentioned in her presentation.</p><p>Going to the first item, how to improve our profitability. We have in our hands basically 3 tools to increase our profitability. The first one naturally is always operational efficiency. As you know, we are one of the most efficient banks already. The cost control has been -- is well established now already, and we plan to give this going forward.</p><p>The second one, we are in the middle of some integration, being the most important one, the Popular integration in Spain, but also Deutsche Bank in Poland and other integrations. We are going to elaborate on the overall performance in the synergies we expect to get from this integration.</p><p>Finally, this is new, this is the new cost paradigm in Europe. That means that we can make significant progress in our cost -- in reducing our cost base in Europe, just sharing services and products across the region.</p><p>Second is about revenues. In revenues, we have our loyalty strategy. That is already very well known for you. We have the advantages in this regard to build our presence in Latin America, where the growth is higher than in Europe. And the percentage of unbanked population gives us opportunities to grow, and we have the new revenue tools that were -- that we plan to get with our new global businesses.</p><p>Finally, in capital allocation. It's going to be in the coming years, so naturally we're seeing towards Latin America. Now we are deploying in Latin America around 25% of our capital. Risk-weighted assets in Latin America represent 25% of our total risk-weighted assets of the group. This number is going to grow not that fast, but probably goes into the low 30s in the coming years in the medium term, and this produce -- this is going to deploy more capital in the region.</p><p>So we have pricing as a tool. Particularly, Ana mentioned in the segments in which we are obtaining a return on equity above the cost of equity and the segments in which we are not. Pricing is the main tool. This affects mainly the mid-corporate segments in which the return on equity tends to be lower than the cost of equity. It's the main point, the very focused point. It's not the only one, but it's the main one.</p><p>And finally, we have -- we are monitoring and reducing unprofitable portfolios. Those are the levers -- the main levers we have in our hand.</p><p>If we look at the journey between the current return on tangible equity, 13% to 15%, we are targeting in the next 3 years, you have the levers there. The first -- being the first one, our -- that we are reweighting into Latin America. The second one is catching up in the U.S. Yes, so the profitability improvement in the U.S. The third one is operational efficiency in Europe that is above productivity gains in the way we operate the bank. The fourth one is more capital efficiency. And finally, we get the business as usual.</p><p>Why the range? You may say that the range is quite large, between 13% and 15%. We will be at the upper end of the range depending -- the main sensitivity point is improved rates. Yes, we maybe have the upper end of the range depending on the assumption on rates or be slightly lower if the rates remained negative or in 0. This affects basically in Europe, where the sensitivity is pretty high.</p><p>So the next slide is about costs. It is the same that Ana showed to you. So basically, what is important here, and we were discussing and what we're appreciating is the numbers for Europe is slightly different than the usual number in the market. These are net numbers. So this means that we are going to reduce and we're going to elaborate where later on we are going to reduce cost EUR 1 billion in Europe net compared 3 years -- from 3, 4 years compared with the end of 2018, and this is a quite ambitious target. Some of this comes from the uplift of synergies in Popular. Some other comes from doing the things in a different way than the one we were doing in the past.</p><p>So once -- I elaborate at the group level. I'm going to go by -- through the different areas of the group. I'm going to start with Latin America, a region that has a -- probably the only country in which if we compare it with the last 3 years, the macro is more supporting is Brazil, not because Brazil is in a great shape. And from the macro standpoint of view, just because the last 3 or 4 years, Brazil was in a deep, deep recession. So it used to be ranked by 10%, and we don't expect this to repeat again in the next 2 years. But all the other regions, we are facing this scenario that today looks quite different than it looks like 6 or 9 months ago. So now there is a significant deceleration in the growth in the economy, both in the U.S. and Europe, and this affects the business and this affects our business going forward.</p><p>Starting with Latin America. Well, features of the region, very well known, relatively high percentage of unbanked population, relatively low leverage compared with the mature markets. So organically, we tend to grow in the region double digits in local -- or more than double digits in local currency. And we have had in the last couple of years relatively stable quality. So you see our starting point, the cost of income is already below 40%. So the return on tangible equity is close to 20% and the RoRWA is north of 3%. So the numbers -- the starting point is already quite demanding, but we are targeting a little bit uplift in some numbers -- these numbers in the coming years.</p><p>We see a relatively high sustainable revenue growth, probably 10% -- around 10% CAGR is a number that we can keep in mind for the region as a whole. As a result of this, we reduced the cost income, and we improved a little bit not as much the return on tangible equity.</p><p>Looking at our business in the region. Basically, the region represents 25% of the balance sheet around the numbers and 40%, 45% of the profits of the bank. So -- and you see that our record has been excellent in the last 3, 4 years. You see in Brazil, the return on tangible equity went from 14% to 20%; Mexico from 13% to 20%; and Chile from 16% to 18%. So excellent execution in the last couple of years. But still, the region offers significant opportunities to grow.</p><p>Let me to go through this country-by-country. Brazil, our position in Brazil, I've been telling in the quarter results presentation that our franchise has improved significantly. It's true. We improved, I will say, pretty significantly in some areas like the -- Ana mentioned GetNet. Quite ambitious. We went from 3% market share 7, 8 years ago to 15% market share now. Cr\u00e9dito consignado, that is the company that is called Ol\u00e9, going about 4 years ago, the market share was 4%. Now it's 11%. So we did a tremendous catch-up in the consumer side of the business. Also in SMEs. We were delivering on ways. We are delivering in CIB. But still when I look at the business in Brazil, we still lack -- we still have plenty of opportunities in several areas. Let me name some of them.</p><p>On the liability side, we need to catch up. When you look at the asset side, we'll catch up on the retail side. CIB, corporate is not yet. SME is not growing too well. But on the liability side, plenty of room to grow. And we have an opportunity to gain market share in the coming years.</p><p>So where do we plan to go? You have here in the slide some of these areas: retail funding, clear; insurance, where we're going to launch out insurance in a couple of months that we are not growing; mutual funds, where our market share is well below our natural market share. And we intend to continue to grow in niche of the market that are extremely profitable. You have the samples there of GetNet and Ol\u00e9. GetNet is the acquiring business. Ol\u00e9 is the payroll-based lending businesses. But you have the SuperDigital, and I'll elaborate about this. You have ben, Pi, and we have another business, the auto business that we are launching, BSI investment platform. The auto business is a new business, and ben is related with the -- that in Europe we know as (inaudible).</p><p>So we have -- we were able to capture significant opportunities already. Our franchise cost improved dramatically. But still, we have plenty of space to keep growing and help capturing market share in Brazil. So it's an area of opportunity, a great area of opportunity, knowing that probably we're going to have some margin compression going forward. For that reason, the volume is going to grow faster than NII while the fee income, probably, we are able to deliver in double digit in fees. With goods cost control, we're now in line with inflation, around inflation. So probably, this is a big area of opportunity for us.</p><p>Going to Mexico. Our return on equity is equally -- has been very good in the last couple of years, the return on equity, 13% to 20%, outstanding execution there, the number of customers. But at the same time, we are in the middle of an extraordinary investment plan. So when you look at the numbers in the last 3 years, one feature that is different in Mexico than in all the other geographies is that you have been growing the cost around double digit.</p><p>This is because we are investing a lot in improving our operational capacities in Mexico. Why is that? In Mexico, we are extraordinarily strong in CIB. We have a very good position leader of the market in corporate and SMEs, but the area in which we are relatively weak is the area of households, individuals. And for that reason, we need to invest in this area, and we are investing. We are going to show -- to grow in this area, and we are growing. In 2018, for example, we grew the payrolls in the bank 600,000 a year. We got from 3.4 million payrolls to 4 million payrolls. We need to grow and rather external -- or still, we are going to take 2 million more to get to 6 million payrolls in the bank.</p><p>We'll change the very nature of the bank. We are relatively weak in deposits, retail deposits. That makes our funding a little bit more expensive than our competitors. Those are our targets. We are delivering. And at some point, after the investment plan is complete, there's going to be -- we are going to play with the operating leverage of the bank because income is good, but it can be better. Now we are keeping there, just because we grow revenues 11%, 12%, 13%, cost of revenue, 10%. We are keeping there. But going forward, we can improve that equation.</p><p>In Chile, well, we have the leading franchise in the country. As you know, it's more stable. The level of organization is higher, but it's not that high. It's significantly higher. The leverage is higher, but it's not -- there's still room to grow. And we expect to keep sustainable volume growth probably in high single digits in the country and expand the fee income, where we have significant space to grow. With this, Chile should be keeping return on equity and tangible equity in the region around 20%, where we already are, and to improve the loyalty of our customers. Probably, adding customers to the system is still a game to play in Chile. Yes, so I'll do -- it's more advanced in the other countries. It's still a game to play there.</p><p>When it comes to the U.S., Ana elaborated a lot of this well. We, in the U.S. -- in the U.S., we have a different business. As you know, we have the SCUSA business, where it's performing well. The return on tangible equity is well above the cost of equity. We have the private banking business, the offshore private banking business that is performing well. We have the bank, where we are improving. In the last couple of years, the first focus was regulatory issues. We made significant progress there. We're almost done. Not 100% but almost 100% done.</p><p>And now we're going to focus in improving the profitability of SBNA Bank that is the weakest part of the business, where our return on equity is still below cost of equity. The bank has 3 businesses. We have the CIB that is relatively new from the bank, the middle market and the retail. We are making significant progress in CIB -- both in CIB and middle market. You see the figures. We're growing. We are growing in a sustainable way. We improved our NII. We improved -- so we are improving this, and still, retail, we are working on the operational side. We improved the quality of our service. We improved -- when you see the ranks of quality, we are still relatively low compared with our peers, and we need to work more on there in order to get enough lift on our capacity to compete in the markets.</p><p>So retail, improved customer satisfaction as a first step to growth, of course. In middle market, we are already growing. We are showing good results. Consumer finance, we've been gathering momentum. We have high originations. The quality of the franchise has improved. And we are getting -- we are having good earnings momentum, and we expect to have this going forward. And wealth management is about our capacity to grow the offshore customers in Latin America. So we think that in the medium term, we're going to be above the cost of equity in our business in the States.</p><p>Europe. In terms of balance sheet, Europe is around 70% of the balance sheet, 50% of our risk-weighted assets and 50% -- north of 50% of our profits. So you see this equation in the last years, we got healthier numbers that, compared with the industry, are quite good. 52% cost-income in Europe with a return on tangible equity of 11%. And a RoRWA of 1.7% is a good number in relative terms in Europe, yes? For the sake of (inaudible).</p><p>So in the medium term, we want to go from -- to improve these figures. And I'm going to elaborate country by country how do we plan to do that, starting with the loyalty -- basically loyalties, increase in the digitalization of the bank and working all the time in customer satisfaction as we do in every market.</p><p>You have here Europe, and I would probably -- you have the numbers. Leading position in the markets in which we operate, Spain, Portugal, U.K. Consumer finance is an outstanding franchise, the best franchise in auto finance across Europe, working in 15 countries, extremely successful. And in Poland, where we, after the acquisition of Deutsche Bank, we got 11% market share for the consumer business, and we have a good position to stand.</p><p>You have on the right-hand side, on the bottom, the numbers. The gross income in Europe is in the arena of EUR 21 billion; operating expenses, EUR 10.7 billion; and net operating income is EUR 10 billion. What I'm mentioning is, before I'm going to focus on the cost side, that is one of the focus in Europe in the coming years, with this EUR 10.7 billion cost base in 2018.</p><p>So we expect to obtain EUR 700 million net cost reduction coming from 90 operations and shared services. So this is what I was calling at the beginning of my presentation, the new cost paradigm in Europe and it's the journey from the traditional data centers to the cloud and evolution of the core system, the traditional core system we have, along with the change, an increase, dramatic increase of productivity in the operational side of the bank, in operations. It will allow us to bring new efficiencies of EUR 550 million. And before the integration in Europe, I will say traditional way of integrating things, in doing more things in common, sharing services, products across the different franchise in Europe will provide us another EUR 150 million.</p><p>Popular in Spain. At the time we made the offer to Banco Popular, we said to you that our synergy plan was to get EUR 500 million cost reduction, so approximately, at this time, 33% of the cost base of Banco Popular. Now we think that we can deliver additional EUR 250 million on top of the EUR 500 million for cost synergies in Popular. So this means at the end of the process, we're going to be reducing 50% of Popular cost base at the time we acquired the bank.</p><p>Unfortunately, this doesn't change our expected return on invested capital. Remember, at the time, we told you 13% to 14% is what we were expecting to get. Those numbers, as you remember probably, were below the consensus. And what came different from the consensus was the revenues. At the time, the market was betting slightly higher rates, probably higher growth than the ones we see in the market. So we're going to end up with the same return on invested capital with different movements between lines, probably less revenue -- some less revenues, more cost reduction than the one that we announced at the time.</p><p>So going to the business in Spain. Well, fair to say, execution has been very good in the last 3 years. We increased the return on tangible equity from 9% to 11%. The significant advance in digitalization and the number of loyal customers, you see the numbers there and well, in an environment that has been challenging in terms of banking business. If the macro environment was good, was supportive, then we've been growing the line 2.5%, 3%. This helps on the credit quality side, but unfortunately, it didn't translate into growth in the lending, in the business that was relatively low or going down in some years.</p><p>So what we are seeing as a better outlook, probably we are starting to have a relatively better pricing in the market, along with a benign credit cycle. So the cost of risk is in the arena of 30 to 40 basis points. We bet that this is going to remain basically there. And the pricing is starting to become more rational, probably due to the effect of the different institutions to keep going with a profitability target.</p><p>When we look forward, what are our main targets? So now we are the market leaders in SMEs, north of 20%, 25%, more in the 25% area. We are growing well there. We are quite happy with integration of Popular. We're able to keep our market share, not only not to lose market share, to keep -- currently slightly winning some market share there. That is good development. We have still opportunities in insurance, plenty of opportunities in insurance, where our position -- we are launching -- we were not in several segments like SMEs. We were not there, and we plan to be there. We already reached an agreement with our partners to grow there. And along with different initiatives in digitalization, all these things, keeping in mind that we're going to have, all across the group, I will mention on the capital section, a capital-light approach more. We don't want to bet overall in volumes on the lending side if we don't achieve the level of profitability we require not in the lending alone, in the relationship with the customer.</p><p>With all of this, what we're seeing in Spain is customer revenues probably growing in mid-single digit, the costs to decline, significant decline in nominal costs. So probably, we're going to be mid-single-digit decline in cost. Cost of risk is stable. And in profitability, as a result of this, is going to go from the current 11% to the region of 14% to 16% in the medium term.</p><p>In the U.K., we have a, well, digitization will be -- during the whole 2018, ring-fencing, as you know, ring-fencing remains in the traditional bond. No ring-fence activities went to the (inaudible) branch. We will update you over due course of our -- the restatement we do of the numbers in the second quarter to guide you through this. So we've been more selective, cautious in some sense, in the last 2 years. We decreased our portfolios in the corporate segment in the U.K. On the other side, our underwriting in mortgages has been in the region of 60% loan-to-value, average portfolio 41%, low risk. We get this in an environment that has been fairly competitive. So our bet here is to beat -- to grow selectively in SME businesses, in businesses that are based in connectivity and relationship with our other franchise in other countries and working in operating efficiency, where we can get still significant gains.</p><p>In the midterm, we should be able to return to double-digit profitability. Currently, we are 9%. We think that we can go to 10%, 12% with a focus in cost management and continued risk discipline, keeping the cost of operations very low.</p><p>Consumer finance, as I said, I will say, is an outstanding franchise across Europe. It's the company of choice for automakers in Europe, the ones who don't have a captive play. Normally, with operations in (inaudible), we provide the services. The track record of the franchise, the current profitability is still pretty high. You will say, well, we are not expecting this to be kept. Competition is -- margin compression is significant in this business.</p><p>So in Europe, in the landscape with low revenues, is very difficult. We are having more competition coming from nontraditional players in this space, and you see this. But we want to keep growing the business. Positive revenue growth. We are doing cost savings, integrating process and doing some integration among our franchise across Europe. And well, we are not keeping in our assumptions that current cost of credit that is too low. Now we are between 30 and 40 basis points, and our projection is more in the region of 70, 60, 70 basis points in this space. That is closer to the expected loss for this kind of business across the cycle more than the one we have today. We don't have a hint to go in that way, but it's our assumption going forward.</p><p>In Poland and Portugal, 2 leading franchises in both countries, very good profitability, different kind of growth. In Poland, we keep growing in double digit. In Poland, unfortunately, we've been -- we haven't been able to show at the bottom line all the power of the franchise due to the taxation. Taxation has been very strong on banks, as you know, from the Polish government. But still, we have a 13% return on tangible equity, return on equity that is pretty high due to the regulation, (inaudible) regulation. We can get easily to 14% to 16% in Poland in return on tangible equity.</p><p>And in Portugal, although we've got 18% market share, we are gaining market share. So in the front book, we are north of 20%. The front book in mortgages, the front book in SMEs and corporate, we are north of 20%. So we are gaining share in mortgages and SMEs, and we can increase our profitability.</p><p>I'm going to go to elaborate on the global businesses. The global businesses, that existing global businesses that we have, the CIB, corporate and investment banking; and wealth management. Although we have all the others in different spaces of the (inaudible), I'm going to focus on these 2. In CIB, well, good track record, 1.3% return on equity -- return on risk-weighted assets in 2015 to 1.8% in 2018. We are generating a capital-light model. I will show you numbers of this. As a result of this, our goals, we think that we can grow revenue here 8% a year. Our CIB is more corporate-driven than institutionally driven. That is -- may surprise you, our performance here, but it's more companies and we have presence in some institutions, but it's less institutionally driven than others.</p><p>So our model is to serve our customers in the markets in which we are incumbent, and we are developing (inaudible) to distribute the model. And the performance has been very good.</p><p>In wealth management, we incorporate this division 1.5 years ago. Why? Because our share here is well below our natural market share. Our natural market share blended all across the areas in which we work is around 13%.</p><p>In these businesses, we are well below. In insurance, half of this. In the others, 30% below our natural market share. We lack some focus. We developed this division because, on top of this business, having superior growth on the other banking businesses, our natural market share, we are well below our natural market share. And we can grow here, and we have an opportunity. The reason why we target both mature and emerging markets have blended kind of 15%, 10% growth in this business.</p><p>Once I finish with the different countries and areas and global businesses, I'm going to elaborate on our capital. Ana already showed these numbers. Well, this is an exercise that tells you about the last few years that we've been doing an exercise quite demanding. That was growing the business, because we grew the business differently to many of our peers in Europe. So growing the business demands. Capital, we grew risk-weighted assets. We increased cash dividend year after year. That demands capital. And we were able to accumulate capital at average pace of 40 basis points per year. That is the guidance we gave you and we kept giving you in the last years.</p><p>So while the focus being the capital and demand on regulatory capital -- and I'm talking about economic capital because in economic capital, things look quite different. But in regulatory capital, we are working on -- we keep working and improving the capital allocation. I already mentioned that is going to be a natural reweighting towards Latin America due to the superior growth of the region compared with the other regions.</p><p>We established minimum thresholds to all the segments in order to get allocating capital to the segments. And I'm going to elaborate here the sample of CIB, what we've done, and we're going to apply -- we're starting to apply to the corporate segment. As I said, the mid corporate is the segment in which we think we have more opportunities for better capital allocation. And at the same time, the commercial transformation and operational efficiency will allow us to have a return on tangible equity of 13% to 15%, with a Common Equity Tier 1 of 11% to 12%.</p><p>Let's look at the sample of CIB, where we have a targeted capital allocation customer by customer. We grew revenues at 2% CAGR in the last 3 years. Risk-weighted assets went down 5% CAGR. As a result of this, the RoRWA went up 13% CAGR in the last 3 years. So we are implementing the same model to the mid-corporate, where we have probably the main opportunity in managing properly and allocating better our capital.</p><p>We are implementing capital tools, product-based tools to ensure that relationship with the customer creates value with every customer, and this is consistent across the group. If we are successful in this, and we think that we're going to be successful in this, this is the map of our return on risk-weighted assets look like in the medium term. So we have already 2 countries above 3% return on risk-weighted assets. We expect to have 4% in the medium term and having the mature markets in the region of 2% to 3% return on risk-weighted assets. And still, U.S. and U.K. lagging slightly behind the 2% threshold. This is our expectation for the return on risk-weighted assets on the different business.</p><p>What about capital building? So we -- in this 2018, 11.3%. So we are generating capital today due to results of 175 to 190 basis points a year. With 40%, 50% payout, we end up having an 80, 100 basis points consumption in paying dividends and AT1 coupons. This way because it's going to want to be in the region of 45 to 55 basis points per annum. And finally, we have the regulatory headwinds that are in front of us that I'm going to elaborate a little bit on those.</p><p>So the expected regulatory impacts, some are very well known for me. The IFRS 16, that came in the first quarter is just 20 basis points due to the leases. The TRIM, the Targeted Review of Internal Models that SSM is conducting along with other minor efficiencies is going to cost around 30 basis points. The Targeted Review of Internal Models is between 10 and 20 and other small business go to 30 basis points. And in 2021, this is differential with other place, due to the nature of our business, we don't expect material impacts coming from the CRD changes, CRR or the application of this.</p><p>So we think that we can -- must get the volume within 40 basis points pre-capital generation year-after-year with the tools I already mentioned, difference called from other settlements. Reducing profitable portfolios, we are already doing that and you're seeing some settlements as we reduced the portfolios, yes, because they are not profitable. Our presentation portfolios in IRBs are lower than our peers. We are doing -- we've been pretty optimistic with securitizations in the past, where we were doing securitization just for utility purposes. Now we're combining liquidity and capital in this. That is -- we are basically the same with reducing the risks. And the senior management remuneration is very much linked to return tangible equity as you see in our proposals to the shareholders in the next year that we're going to have next week.</p><p>So finally, on credits, because everybody speaks on capital solvency. So our liquidity position is very good. LCR and Net Stable Funding Ratio due to our very maintained and sure we are well above the minimum thresholds with -- and what is more important in MREL, we already comply, and we comply basically with sub debt. We don't rely that much in senior debt or corporate deposits to comply with this. So from this position, we are much more advanced than our competitors.</p><p>As a result of this, our issuance in the market in the current space is going to be mainly in the low end of the credit ranges we have, and basically covered bonds, senior debt. We already did that with non-preferred debt, sub debt and the AT1, we already did this.</p><p>So that's basically all of my presentation. Just remember, due to targets for global, the targets for the group, 13%, 15% return on equity, improving efficiency, building capital to be in the range of 11% to 12%. And if we're close to 12%, the more flexibility we have in margin in our FX and this flexibility is welcome. So this gives us this capacity efficiency in the region of 42% to 45%, and keeping our dividend policy between 40% and 50%. That will allow us to keep remunerating the shareholders in a progressive way, adjusting the dividend and operation along with the EPS.</p><p>That's all. Now we remain at your disposals. Ana, myself and Jos\u00e9 Cantera to answer the questions you may have.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Thanks, Jos\u00e9 Antonio. Thanks, Ana, as well. We have 45 minutes so we open now the Q&amp;A session. Alvaro, Morgan Stanley first.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ALVARO SERRANO SAENZ DE TEJADA, LEAD ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Alvaro Serrano, Morgan Stanley. Two questions, I'm afraid, on capital. Ana, you mentioned that you'll get to 12% as soon as possible in your presentation. But there's also, as you've outlined in Jos\u00e9 Antonio's presentation, some of the regulatory headwinds. Can you maybe talk about the timing, as soon as possible, when that might be? And also, are you going to be able to align the efficiency management actions to the headwinds? So are we now going to see maybe there's a risk of some dip there and just overall timing of the sequencing of events? And the second question relates to that is obviously, the capital build over the last few years has actually been very strong, but there has been sort of unforeseen events. So the question is, what visibility you have at this point on capital headwinds that might come that you don't have in the plan. Because this time last year, we probably didn't anticipate or investors didn't anticipate the deduction in, (inaudible) for example, things like that. So is the capital build really going to sort of go down to the bottom line?</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: Sure. In terms of the timing on capital, 2019 is the most difficult year in terms of the headwinds. As Antonio gave, our expectation is 50 basis points net. We do -- I mean, what I can say is that we will and this is, of course, subject to some uncertainty but our aim is to be above where we closed this year. So we do expect to be above 11.30%. I cannot be more precise right now but we are confident that we will do that, which basically obviously means generating more than 50 basis points during the year. As I said before, there's many internal measures where we were not only managing revenue through capital until 3 years ago, we started 4 years ago when the new team was in place. So there's still efficiencies across the group and we're taking measures all along, but there's still things we can do and we are doing to ensure that we can deliver above that usual 40 basis points on capital. It's very important, yes, and that takes into account the efficiencies we're planning, which are very ambitious. I will give some more comments in the closing in terms of organization. Strategy is important, planning is important, but to execute better, you need the right organization. And that's what we're going to do as of -- we're announcing today some changes there. And this will help a lot to execute faster, which is what we've been saying all along. You're right, in terms of the headwinds, we are as surprised as you. Sometimes, those capital add-on in the U.K. of 100 basis points, I think it's a year ago, that was 20 basis points at the group level. This was not expected so there's certain things that could be -- unfortunately every time, there's surprises. I don't think they ever surprise us in a positive way, so -- but at this point, we feel confident with what we are saying. And again, '19 is going to be the most headwinds, '20, '21 will continue to be building capital, probably. So we're going to get to 12% as soon as we can because that's going to give us the flexibility to be between 11.5% and 12% and even to have the flexibility to be below 11.5% because that would make it possible for us to increase profitability because of the hedging, which today, is causing us, I think, this year about 17, 18 basis points is our estimate. So we need to have that possibility to maximize profitability. I hope that answers the question.</p><p>MARTA S\u00c3\u00a1NCHEZ ROMERO, DIRECTOR AND ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Marta Romero from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. I've got a follow-up question on capital. In order to get to the 12%, what levers do you have apart from the ones that you've laid out in the presentation? You brought back the Scrip Dividend, can you bring back your strategy of listing minorities? We've seen some of your subsidiaries trading at hefty multiples relative to the group. Would you consider being opportunistic in that regard and making a placement in Brazil, for example? And the second question is related to the Corporate Centre. Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think I've seen any targets related to the Corporate Centre. In your previous plan, you were aiming for a 15% size relative to the group. Have you dropped that target? And since you've mentioned these cost savings but you left the Corporate Centre out, how do you expect generally, the losses at the Corporate Centre to progress?</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: So the main lever to increase capital is to increase profitability, right? But we also have to ensure, I could increase profitability by 50% by selling tomorrow a piece of one of our subsidiaries. That's not the plan, and we want investors that want results today, and I want to insist that we have increased cash dividend per share, you've seen the numbers. So we need to find the balance and one of you, investors, said and understands that this is our goal. When I get asked what is the most difficult thing in my job, is to find the balance between delivering today and in the future and between delivering for all my stakeholders. I need to deliver for the people. Sometimes, we need to raise salaries. We need to deliver for customers. Sometimes we take tough decisions and cut fees, but that's the right thing over time. Sometimes, we need to think about our shareholders that are not all the same. So in terms of the Scrip for example, and since you mentioned that, it gives us added flexibility. So we have said, I think I mentioned that we are not impending, this has to be approved at the shareholders' meeting next week, to decrease or at least we'll keep the same cash dividend per share. But our retail shareholders love the Scrip and it gives us some flexibility, not huge. If you consider that we're not going to decrease cash dividend per share, our intention is not to decrease it. It means that we might have some small Scrip. So I think this is very important. In terms of minorities, we -- as what we said as a new team, we're still not planning to list minorities. We are where we are and that is really where we intend to be, unless -- so basically that's it, we're not planning anything at the moment. So I'd say the main lever again, is the transformation of our model, increasing profitability, being very rigorous in the way we allocate capital and in the way we invest and stop investing. And we've been doing that over the last 3 years, we want to do more of that. In terms of the Corporate Centre, do you want to say something? There's -- I mean, we're quite efficient already because that has also the TLAC for the subsidiaries. So if you take the actual cost of the Corporate Centre, we are super efficient and we did a lot of that. We probably can do more but that's not what the main issue is. It's about sharing across the countries more, as I explained it.</p><p>JOS\u00e9 ANTONIO \u00c3LVAREZ \u00c3LVAREZ: Yes. Well, I did mention this, the Corporate Centre, our target for the Corporate Centre, but I gave you the main component of the cost of the Corporate Centre. This is also sub debt, senior non-preferred, all this stuff that goes straight to the negative NIM. And then interesting comment for Corporate Centre, and I said to you that we already done all this stuff. So basically going forward, we're going to have a pretty stable Corporate Centre in absolute volumes. The only volatility comes normally for our tactical hedging of the statutory results in the country. Yes, if we do have some and we have the currency appreciate or depreciate, they affect the Corporate Centre. The only significant volatility I see going forward in the Corporate Centre, they're already pretty straightforward is the cost base but with the ideas as switching as we gave, but it's not going to be a big change. An also the stuff related to the same price, it's already there. So those are the components, so you can do your math, yes?</p><p>CARLOS PEIXOTO, ANALYST, BANCO PORTUGU\u00c3\u00aaS DE INVESTIMENTO, S.A., RESEARCH DIVISION: Carlos Peixoto from Caixabank. Switching a bit on subjects. I was wondering, first, I noticed that on the U.S., the return on tangible equity targets are based on or are adjusted for the excess of capital at the U.S. I was wondering whether there is any specific plan for the allocation of that excess capital. And then on a different matter also, the interest rate scenarios embedded in your business plan, what are they? I noticed a sharp where you have a gap for different interest rate scenarios. Should the low end be flat interest rates in Europe and the higher end assuming some sort of increase? If you could give us some visibility on that.</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: Well, the U.S. excess capital, we're now allowed to pay dividends since about, I think, 18 months ago. The question is there's an extra tax to be paid, so it's less efficient than other subsidiaries in terms of dividend repatriation. So that is a main issue, it's not about anything else. As I said, we've been very limited. We're still a bit limited in terms of launching new initiatives so we could decide to launch Openbank in the U.S. for example. That would require some capital, so it's mostly about organic growth, but at the end, the more short-term reason why we are not repatriating more is the withholding tax on dividend because there's not a double treaty agreement between Spain and the U.S. Interest rates, yes, that's one of the reasons, but -- so if interest rates don't rise in Europe, we'd be more towards the 13%. Is that -- that's the main one, right?</p><p>JOS\u00e9 ANTONIO \u00c3LVAREZ \u00c3LVAREZ: Let me elaborate on this on the Popular case. I was saying that once we reduce -- increase our target in cost reduction, we'll remain with the same exercise, basically. In terms of return on invested capital, yes, because revenue is expected to the level of interest rates that compare with the ones we've had in the time of the acquisition, yes? And well, we have basically planned this is slightly up in the medium term, yes? So but basically what we have today.</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: So Popular is -- as you know, at the time of the acquisition and when we raised the capital, we said we will be in the 13% to 14%. We're still reiterating that today. At the time, we were expecting 2018 to have loan growth in Spain. The fact is it's been minus 4 at the time, not just us, but the market was anticipating a very different scenario. So we will be there in spite of a much more difficult context. And that's one of the reasons we are increasing the cost targets from 500 to 750, as we're announcing today, to make sure that we can deliver not just -- including the new more difficult context in terms of loan growth and interest rates.</p><p>FRANCISCO RIQUEL, HEAD OF RESEARCH, ALANTRA EQUITIES SOCIEDAD DE VALORES, S.A., RESEARCH DIVISION: Francisco Riquel from Alantra Equities. First question about the capital allocation at SCUSA. You are assuming 100% of the capital for the risk-weighted assets but you're already consolidating 70% of the profits and then you also have -- it also has some fiscal implications. So what's your stance regarding this capital allocation for SCUSA? And also, if you can update on the JV with Chrysler, where are we on that subject? And then second question on the capital allocation in the U.K. business. You have 1/3 of the capital tied to the commercial and corporate banking business in the U.K. and you have been struggling to obtain decent returns in this business. So what is the problem here and what is the plan for this 1/3 of your corporate business in the U.K.? And then also, helping us to understand the U.K. plan, your macro scenario that you are assuming, given the present uncertainties.</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: Sure. I will start with the U.K. So our plans for the U.K. are estimating approximately 1% GDP growth over the next couple of years. So that is -- could be better, could be worse, depends on what happens with Brexit. But I mean, your guess is as good as mine as to what's going to happen. I'm a bit confused, but so that matters not tremendously because we have a very high-quality portfolio, so the loan to value on our stock is 42%. The new business we are writing is at 63%, in London it's 58%, so we've been very conservative in terms of quality and that has been the case for some time. We have been very consistent. I cannot give you specific numbers in terms of our profitability targets, including in the U.K. portfolios. Clearly, the commercial and corporate business was one where to be much more competitive, we need size but we are focusing more on transactional banking services. We are focusing more -- I mentioned some numbers in terms of the U.S., there's a lot of business happening now and there is a U.K.-U. S. corridor where we -- the numbers are in the slide, we're actually generating, compared to 2 years ago, EUR 40 million in revenues that are new. So we're working on the group assets to bring that profitability higher and allocating capital to the businesses within the segment that do deliver a higher return. Again, the global trade services payments, that's one of the focus, is how can we be even more competitive across the group, bringing this best-in-class products that we have in the group but that are not always there in all geographies. So that is the way -- but we are being very disciplined on that. In terms of the JV on Chrysler, I'm not sure, so it's an ongoing conversation. I think in...</p><p>JOS\u00e9 ANTONIO \u00c3LVAREZ \u00c3LVAREZ: Well, it's about Chrysler, it's ongoing conversations. The conversations are constructive, I can say, so -- and well, we'll come to a conclusion relatively soon, I hope, yes. So but the discussion cycles, but yes. On the efficiencies in capital in SCUSA, I don't know if you want to elaborate.</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: Well, I think I mentioned that in my presentation. So there's a lot of things happening behind the scenes that sometimes you're not seeing. But for example, one of the ways where in the business in the U.S., first, you have to be not just at the regulatory requirements but at our own standards in terms of how we manage the business. And so one of the things we did over the last few years in SCUSA is really changed the way the businesses run. And we have here, Scott, who is an expert actually in consumer finance. And so we are running the business to bank standards. At the same time, we have -- within the U.S., we have allocated more capital over the last few years to SCUSA than to SBNA. In SBNA, what we're doing is, again, trying to improve the profitability in the commercial side by the network effects and this is what I mentioned with the U.K. But we have also cleaned up the balance sheet, and I'd say EUR 3 billion, EUR 4 billion risk-weighted assets have gone from one side to the other. So there's a lot of things happening under the surface in terms of managing the business in a most sustainable way. It's not the same to have big net interest margin because you have big portfolios and have increased your net interest margins the tough way, which is one customer at a time, opening current accounts, making sure those customers are real customers. And that's the work we've been doing because that's the only thing we could do in the U.S. So we are allocating capital within the geographies, not just between the geographies.</p><p>IGNACIO ULARGUI, RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Ignacio Ulargui from Deutsche Bank. I have 2 questions, one on the cost stuff, on the cost savings that you are saving together, the EUR 1.2 billion cost. Is that medium term? How far beyond 2021 we are looking to that? And the other question is on the securitizations, what is the role that you have from Santander Consumer Finance? How relevant is it going to be or which surely could be the one that is more relevant in terms of securitizing the portfolio?</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: Sure. Maybe I'm going to answer the securitization. So I mean, on the cost, I think we gave the details in terms of the one-offs also, right, in the presentation? So it's going to cost us EUR 300 million for Popular and EUR 300 million for the rest, that would be over the next 3 to 4 years. So we are giving ourselves a 1-year flexibility to execute properly, but that is the time frame that we are looking at. This is a big, big change. As I said, this is a net number in the case of Europe, it's not a net number in the case of the Americas. So a net EUR 1 billion reduction in cost has to be executed properly to ensure that we are also investing as we should be investing for the future. So again, this is the balance we need to find. In terms of the securitizations, Santander consumers is a big part of it.</p><p>JOS\u00e9 ANTONIO \u00c3LVAREZ \u00c3LVAREZ: What we have is very much in line with the size of the portfolio. The portfolio in consumer finance is around EUR 100 billion of which 1/3 is Germany, Spain, Nordic countries is like 12% to 15% each one. So it's very much aligned to the securitization, very much aligned with the size of the portfolios in the different countries. It's not that we favor some portfolios against others, no. The securitization has been between EUR 1 billion to EUR 2 billion. Each one depends on basically the size. The portfolios are highly granular, as you know. It's basically auto lending and it's where securitization from the cost of capital point of view. The equation between capital reduction and cost of this securitization is better. So the cost is well below the cost of equity, and this is the rule we use for securitization, yes. So we select those portfolios in which the securitization is more efficient in terms of cost of capital risks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: So there is not a target on securitizations per country or per unit. It's basically one of the tools we have to improve the overall profitability, okay? So we don't target a specific number per unit or per segment.</p><p>MARIO ROPERO, RESEARCH ANALYST, FIDENTIIS EQUITIES S.V.S.A., RESEARCH DIVISION: Mario Ropero from Fidentiis, and my first question is on the funding strategy in Spain. You have been pushing for years with the 1</p><p>2</p><p>3 account, and now you have a lot of loyal customers, but also very heavy retail base there and very expensive one, which is causing you a lot of trouble on lending. So I wonder whether you are going to change this strategy materially. Or whether you are still happy to maintain a high funding cost in Spain to eventually make more profits from this strategy? And then the second question is on the cost of risk in the U.K. and in Brazil. In the U.K., since, I guess, that market expectations are way more pessimistic than what you have shown in your presentation, I was wondering if you can give more color on the cost of risk assumptions that you're making. And then in Brazil, if you can maybe give a specific number or at least some coloring about whether you think you can get materially below 4% cost of risk?</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: So in the case of Brazil, our expectation -- remember, Brazil is coming out of a huge recession. We have 9% decrease in GDP. Last year was the first year that had positive growth. I think that the guidance for Brazil is stability in the cost of risk overall for the country, and that we feel quite comfortable with. In the case of the U.K., you're right. I mean, we're historically low cost of risk. It's around, I think, 7 basis points. That is going to go up in our plans, the guidance is that -- I'm not sure if we said this, but it should be maybe double that, 14, 15 basis points probably. We do have one of the best and if you look at the stress test of Bank of England, we do have one of the -- I think probably the safest mortgage book relative to our peers. At the height of the crisis, if I remember correctly, this cost of risk went to 40 basis points in 2009. And that was just after the integration of Alliance &amp; Leicester, which did not have as good a mortgage book. So I'm not saying -- and I mentioned what's important here is the front book, of course, right? And the front book, we're being very conservative also, and we are -- we're being -- focusing more on high-quality risk than growth even though we, I believe, we've grown a bit over the last 12 months in mortgages. 1</p><p>2</p><p>3, I'll just give a headline view and then maybe, Jos\u00e9 Antonio, you can give me some more detail, but 1</p><p>2</p><p>3 is a strategy, it's not about a product. And so as I said several times, I mean, sometimes we confuse users with customers. And the other point I'd like to make in Spain is that 4 years ago, we started from a very, very low point in terms of customer engagement in Spain. Just as a parenthesis, when I mentioned before the countries that were not covering the cost of equity in the group, that technically we have been very drastic with sort of -- so Spain. Spain was at 8% in terms of market share in transactional customers in 2014, so this is a huge goal for us. And again, it's this balance between delivering today and in the future, so we're trying to have real customers, and this is the strategy we followed. We have been quite flexible. As you know, we have changed the conditions as interest rates and the context has gotten, let's say, less favorable to what we expected. But the real, I think, important thing is that having a loyal customer is worth 3x more than a nonloyal. So this is where we're putting all our efforts. And Santander Spain even though the focus is on integrating Popular in a flawless way, this is not an easy job. This is a big bank. There's a lot of things happening behind the scenes. The teams are working every weekend in technology and operations, not just them, actually the commercial teams. So having that and at the same time improving the customer experience in order to have better customers is crucial. In terms of the net interest margin and how that's working, I think we're actually converging slowly.</p><p>JOS\u00e9 ANTONIO GARC\u00c3\u00adA CANTERA, CFO, HEAD OF FINANCIAL DIVISION &amp; SENIOR EVP, BANCO SANTANDER, S.A.: Going to the cost of funding. The cost of deposits that, basically, you mentioned, yes? So we're going to converge towards around 14, 15 basis points deposit cost maybe, of which 10 come from long-term commitments other than the 1</p><p>2</p><p>3. So the 1</p><p>2</p><p>3 actually has been a very good proposition in terms of building loyalty at a very low cost -- funding cost. The funding cost now is still relatively low and we don't assign the total funding cost of deposits in Spain to the 1</p><p>2</p><p>3. There are other long-term commitments, some of them come from several years ago that costs around 10 basis points compared with the total deposit rates. Naturally, it's not a big number, but 10 basis points, 200 billion deposits is not also a big number, yes? So the small numbers and long-term commitments matters in these days of negative intra rates.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Stefan?</p><p>STEFAN ROSENOV NEDIALKOV, DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Stefan Nedialkov from Citigroup. A couple of questions on my end. Looking at Brazil, more than 20% RoTE medium-term target, it was 20% last year. Peers are rerisking, the competition is increasing. What's your competitive advantage in the next couple of years? And a question on the new businesses that you're setting up, the global payment platform. So you guys are becoming a payments company. That's pretty good multiples going forward. Do you -- how do you see your scale in some of these products? So say, the emergent acquiring space, which is becoming more and more consolidated. Do you think the 150 billion of payments is enough to set you apart? And for you to benefit from scale? Or are you coming from such a low level of consolidation across your geographies that there's quite a few synergies to capture there? So just so you can give us some color around the strategic direction on that business. And I guess related to that would be the trade finance services. Right now, that looks like a 1% of group revenues on international SMEs. Obviously, that's a pretty small number. How should we think about synergies going forward at the revenue side of things?</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: Sure. So Brazil, we want to keep the profitability, but we also want to grow, right? It's a growing market, so we believe, again, balancing between growth and profitability being between 2022 and Brazil is the right combination. And the second thing I'd say is that, in the past, and this is, again, not something which is maybe as obvious, but the quality of our income in Brazil is a bit like in the U.S. but actually also in Spain and in many other countries. The quality is much more sustainable than 4 years ago. I can give you numbers, but if you look at the retail, for a long time, I was told as part of the group the retail business in Brazil is not profitable. Well, you know what? It is, you have the right team, the right strategy. So the underlying transformation in Brazil and you'll have Sergio in the Q&amp;A, he can elaborate, has been huge. And that gives us confidence that we do have the scale, we do have the assets and we do have the strategy to succeed in Brazil today and in the future. When I say the assets, our business in Brazil is not just a bank, it's going back to the payment question I will answer now, but GetNet is an amazing franchise. Do we have the scale? So just to finish on Brazil, we do need to balance growth and profitability, and we believe once we're at 2022, we don't want to become so small. We want to grow with the country. This is super important for the future. This is 220 million people, growing middle-class and so that is why we are going to be at that 2022. By the way, Brazil like every other country is being super disciplined and is actually one of, I'd say, one of the best countries in terms of managing capital, not just at the top end. So they're doing that as they grow. Very much focused on capital rotation, capital discipline within the country and the segments. On the payments, so we haven't just discovered payments. Payments have been at the core of Santander, I'd say, since the beginning, in the sense that when we talk about loyalty, what we are talking about being at the heart of our customers' payments and transactions. That is what the loyalty strategy is. That one we did in Banesco with the 1</p><p>2</p><p>3 strategy; in the U.K., with the 1</p><p>2</p><p>3 strategy. If you have your main account, if I ask you, Sergio, who is your main bank? Your answer is Santander. It's your main current account where you do all the payments. So payments is absolutely core. It's something we need to do not just for ourselves but probably for others to have that scale. But we have to organize it better. So what we are doing today is about organization but also focus, right? We're going to -- the fact that we're telling you all of this puts pressure on us to deliver on these businesses, right? You're going to have much higher visibility, transparency on what payments are at Santander, how we're making progress, how we're investing, how we're making returns on capital. So it's going to be -- we're going to be able to give you milestones. This is something we'll do in the next few months. But I'd say that the fact that -- and again, this is linked to our customers' core business. Acquiring business, I mentioned, point of sale is crucial. Now again, some of the new specialists, to call them something, have figured this out. But they do not have the customers we have. They don't know -- they don't have the relationships we have. And this is what we need to really leverage. So the relationship, we have 100,000 people across the group talking to customers every day. 100,000 people. We're not the telecoms that have great engineers. They were not talking to customers. We are talking to customers. Yes, we need to change the model, but the asset Santander -- by the way, banks that have these kind of SMEs is going to be the most sticky relationships. And a lot of these new payments, you have companies doing working capital at scale. Payments has always been at the core. And so we are very committed to having these businesses. What we're -- as I said, what we're doing is taking pieces we have, and we have all the products, corporate investment banking has Nexus. It's a cash management system for multinationals. There's no reason why Nexus could not be the cash management, which is being super successful. We are winning mandates across the U.S., across Europe, across Latin America, against the big guys. Probably nobody here knows that. That is a tool that can be brought down to the midsize market. These are the kind of things that are very exciting in terms of staying at the core of our customers' payments, which is core to our loyalty strategy and digital strategy.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Carlos?</p><p>CARLOS COBO CATENA, EQUITY ANALYST, SOCIETE GENERALE CROSS ASSET RESEARCH: Carlos Cobo from Societe Generale. A couple of questions, one on capital. I guess we've been discussing a lot about how you're going to build up capital and the headwinds, but I wanted to touch on why 11.5% to 12%? Because the target has been raising every year. We don't have enough visibility on what the Central Bank thinks here. What is the real calibration of the capital requirements for European bank, and we need to understand better. What's the point where a bank like Santander has a capital surplus? We struggle to understand that and it doesn't seem like it's getting clearer. So it will be nice if you could share us your discussions with the regulator. And the second one, on payments. So following up on Stefan is if this is a new division that you are creating as a point where you could leverage and merge it with all the competitors to gain the scale or eventually IPO it to sort of raise some value in the group? Or is it just a management focus in the payments segment rather than any other thing?</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: So on the right level of capital, you're right. Sometimes you -- and this happened to us, we thought being above 11% was the right level. Our sense now that given what others are doing, 11% to 12% is the right level. Now we've seen many banks with headline numbers that were higher than us that if you then look at the -- what's happening underneath, it's probably not comparable. So we do believe strongly that between 11% and 12% is the right place and that, as I said, between 11.5% and 12% is where we need to manage to have some flexibility and increased profitability. Why we believe this? Because it's not just about the headline number. It's about performance under stress. As you know, we are the bank that destroys less capita under stress at 140 basis points compared to, I think, it is 403 for others in the adverse scenario. I think the second -- probably the first point is the strength of our business model. If you look at the preprovision profit over loans or over NPLs rather, and the stability of that preprovision profit and even of the net profit, as I mentioned before, over the cycle, 20 years, that is, again, the strength of our business model and I believe it's today much stronger than it was before. This is obviously, the detail of this is much more apparent to our supervisors than to the market because they, as you know, they have armies of people talking to us every day. The third thing is leverage ratio. Our leverage ratio is 5%, that's 150 basis points above the minimum. One of the best in Europe and that creates an issue sometimes in terms of the density in mortgages in the U.K. We have a 16% density. Some of our competitors have 5%. A bit the same is happening in Spain, but obviously, on the capital side, that's a benefit. So I'd say, also the track record. What we've done over the last few years that also helps us. We've gone from 8.27% to 11.30% in 4 years, that's a big change. And of course, there have been regulatory headwinds there. So I think the combination of these things is what also the supervisors take into account. And finally, of course, if you look at the SREP requirement we have, which is 9.7%, we have today 130 basis points buffer. So all of that together is what not just us but the supervisors look at. So yes, we will -- our GCB charge is 100 basis points, just that one difference in some of -- means they would actually be compared -- 12 would compare with 13 at some of the other banks. And some of the strengths we have today in terms of density and mortgages is going to be mean. That's what Antonio said that when -- I don't know how to call this, CRD IV comes in, we're going to be much less affected than others. Having said that, I'm not going to say that the supervisors are not going to change because they've changed before. So you all need to help us. If you think the sector has enough capital in Europe, you should go and see, spend some time in Frankfurt and make your point. By the way, at the end, what's being penalized is European customers, right? SMEs. 90% of credit to the European economy comes from banks. So somebody has to make the point that, yes, being prudent, having more capital, we all want that. At some point, enough is enough. And if they keep on building buffers and buffers and buffers, Europe will not grow, banks in Europe will have increasing problems and you know what they do? They're going to have less inclination to lend, right? The cost of equity goes up even though rates are negative. So you need to help us because we are an interested party. You represent investors, you represent people that have pensions across Europe and so the more you could help us, if you believe, that there is enough capital in the system, obviously, there's always things to improve. But that's something I would ask you to help us on.</p><p>SOFIE CAROLINE ELISABET PETERZENS, ANALYST, JP MORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: Yes. It's Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan.</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: I didn't answer on the -- we're not planning to IPO the payment business. I mean, I'm sure a lot of investment bankers in the room would love to hear yes, but the answer is no. But by giving it more visibility, hopefully, you can understand the value of Santander in the nonregulated business. And this is, by the way, a key goal for us, is we have a business that's super regulated. We have a business that should not be regulated, or if it's regulated, then again, that's something you could help us. That's one of my big speeches. And that was when I go to Brussels all the time, not that I have better places to go, but I think it's a great investment from me for you. Well, we want fair competition. Either we get deregulated in payments and all these businesses or they get regulated. But we cannot have it as it is now. So we are -- that's the other reason we're separating these businesses. Even, legally, we're going to -- GetNet is already a separate company, but we're going to put them in a separate so they have visibility, you can understand better the value of Santander franchise, but at some point, we're going to continue fighting for either for fair regulation for everybody. That's all we're saying, same business, same regulation, doesn't matter who you are, that's our line. Sorry, I just forgot.</p><p>SOFIE CAROLINE ELISABET PETERZENS: Yes, no problem. So yes, it's Sofie Peterzens from JPMorgan. So I wanted to ask how do you think about M&amp;A and add-on acquisition opportunities. Which countries and you got a business there as would you be happy to growing? And my second question is, how do you see the banking business kind of in the long term? Where do you think competition will come from? Do you expect new players, more alternative players in the banking industry? How do you think we should see the banking business, let's say, in 10 years' time?</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: 10 years, are you serious? If you allow me, I am going to try for 5 or 6, maybe 7. 10 is very far away, but yes. So if you look at the chart I showed in terms of who are the players and merchant acquiring, I think you have the answer there. You're going to have some big banks and then you're going to have some very specialized banks. In the middle, you're going to have issues. And you are going to have specialist players because payments is such an important coproduct for us that it would require scale. It would require focus. It would require having a strong customer base and franchise where you start and they're not that many of the bigger banks. So I think you're going to see a very different scenario. And you're going to see nonbanking players having increasing weight. Now again, as I was saying before, we need to push in terms of fair regulation and fair competition, that's the other one, and fair taxes. That's super important for society, for banks, but for every single person to get to that so we can invest more. But at the end of the day, I think you are going to get a concentration because you're going to have -- in today's world, with the tools we have we didn't have before, you can be a real global player with the current technology. That was very difficult before, but now it's possible. So you're going to have retail players that can provide payments. It's going to be relatively easy. Now it's going to take time, again, to my point of customers versus users. Not the same thing. But there are enough big banks that have real customers like us and a few others that are going to be players and succeed there. You want to answer the M&amp;A?</p><p>JOS\u00e9 ANTONIO GARC\u00c3\u00adA CANTERA: Well, within -- we made clear on this. Our focus is in the core markets in which we are and we find opportunities in the business and we have competitive advantages vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis with the others, who will look at it. We can make it or not, but our starting relation with M&amp;A.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Fernando, Barclays?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: [Fernando Julio Santibanez] from Barclays. Just 2 questions, first one is Spain, the mortgage market and the real estate visibility that you may have, volumes, prices and especially, fixed rates mortgage, new production, how do you see this? Second, what the assumptions are on the FX currencies, mainly Brazil real, Mexican and the U.K. pound in the Poland?</p><p>JOS\u00e9 ANTONIO GARC\u00c3\u00adA CANTERA: Okay. The mortgage market in Spain as I said in the presentation, that we're seeing -- we were a little bit more constructive in pricing. So we are seeing -- I will not say that split half right now, but we are not seeing as big pressure as we were seeing let's say 6 month, 1 year ago, so this is the mortgage market. In relation with real estate, well, it goes by alias, yes? So there are some called alias, basically in the main cities, while the average of the market is still -- prices are going up, still in the low single digit, 3%, 4%, 5%, yes, so probably in this range. But with significant gaps between the main cities, some are small cities and still areas that are relatively depressed. And having digested the assesses of the real estate battle that happened 10 years ago. While the rates of the new production are slightly up, so the new production is coming -- the front book is coming better than back book, on average, it's getting better. Not at a fast pace, but it's getting better. And in FX, basically, as a rule of thumb, we are taking the forward rates, yes? So basically, if you take the forward rates, this is what we have in our numbers. When we tell you the numbers, we show the forward rates for all the currencies, yes? So basically, so when you ask Brazil, Brazil has a depreciation of let's say 6%, 7% a year. In Mexico, it's a depreciation of, roughly speaking, 8% a year, so basically the forward rates, yes?</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Filtri, Mediobanca?</p><p>ANDREA FILTRI, BANCA DI CREDITO FINANZIARIO S.P.A., RESEARCH DIVISION - RESEARCH ANALYST, MEDIOBANCA: Andrea Filtri from Mediobanca. I have 3 questions, what is the CET1 ratio behind the RoTE walk that you projected in the slides? Secondly, what is the appointment of heads of the micro geographies you communicated this morning aimed at? And thirdly, in your CET1 walk that you projected, what are you projecting for the dividend payment on the 40% to 50% payout? Is it a fixed EUR 0.20 in cash and the rest in script?</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: So I'm going to answer the -- on the organizational changes. Well, that is one of the key tools for us to improve and deliver on the continuous operating performance in all the regions. We need to share more across whether the legal entities, everything we're saying. We don't need to change our model of autonomous subsidiaries. We're not going to change the role of the local boards or the fact that our local country managers are responsible, let's say, for the relationships in the country. But we do need to manage in a more streamlined way. And I believe, one of the most important things, I will comment on that in my closing in more detail. So if you bear with me for a few minutes, I'll give a bit more detail on why the reasons. But at the end is, is what we've been doing for the last few years is a lot of that, but we need to do more and faster. So sharing services, actually, the global payments strategy is very much dependent on us being able to execute across the countries for everybody and sharing products, services. It's about cost, but it's also a lot about revenues. How do we share amazing tools we have? I gave this example, I think, maybe already, but it's just so we have the visibility of our -- how we do the -- what you see here in our mobile banking apps, which is this is going to be a condition necessary not enough to succeed, but if we don't have the best customer experience in all our mobile banking apps, everything else is going to be much harder. And so we, today, we have -- even though we have 10 core countries, we have 60, 65 different mobile banking apps. We put a group of people in place from all the countries and we figure out that we could share 70% of the cost, and that, that would really be applicable from Poland to Norway. Santander Consumer has also some front-end services, so we have a lot of -- from Brazil to the U.S. So 70% reusable is a big number. And there's a lot more examples of that. So that is really what's behind this. The autonomous liquidity capital doesn't change. The role of the local boards doesn't change, but we believe that this is going to be a huge transformational tool for us. And I'll give a bit more detail later, but obviously, it's for Jose Antonio and the teams to execute the strategy that we are the board and ExCo approved, having a 12-people management committee. By the way, we're 7 nationalities and I think 6, 7 businesspeople. This is very important. And the talent we have is amazing. We're not using enough, we want to use more of it. So on CET1 in the past...</p><p>JOS\u00e9 ANTONIO \u00c3LVAREZ \u00c3LVAREZ: Well, as a rule of thumb, here's the midpoint in CET1, they don't tell you. But you have some of your colleagues asked if the capital headwinds other than the regulatory, we may have the traditional ones that are typically they are available for sale mark-to-market that has some impact, and the FX hedging that as long as we approach the 12%, we're going to gain some flexibility as we've said for our fetching strategy that now is a policy, may become more a technical issue. So in relation with return on tangible equity, I already elaborated that the range very much depends on the level of interest rates at the end of the peak, yes, so higher the level, you go to 15%. If not, you go to the mid of the range, yes? Finally, in the dividend, 40% to 50%, and our intention is to have a progressive cash dividend that follows -- try to track the EPS, the evolution of the EPS, it's as simple as that. It's not -- nothing more than this.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: So it's 5 minutes to close the hour, but one last question from Jos\u00e9, and obviously the management will be available for your Q&amp;A and then lunch and the coffee break. Sorry for that.</p><p>JOS\u00e9 MARIA ABAD HERNANDEZ, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Jos\u00e9 Abad from Goldman Sachs. The first question is on Santander Consumer Finance. I think we have early indications of what could potentially become a significant slowdown in Europe. This slowdown is -- it seems the bulk of the slowdown seems to be concentrated in the car manufacturing industry, particularly in Germany. But this is cascading to all these countries with a significant producer or exporter car industry like Spain, no? You've cut your RoTE target by 100, 200 basis points here on the basis of a normalization in the cost of risk. Cost of risk is never normalized. You are above 4 or below, so could you help us a bit to understand the fundamentals of actually of this business based -- starting maybe with what you've seen year-to-date because the slowdown in that segment has been significant. And maybe not just talking about cost of risk, but also volumes. I guess the question here is whether there is any downside risk to the targets that you announced today for this business? Second question is on money laundering. There was an article in the local press a few weeks ago about top official from the Venezuelan government in a money laundering scheme, which involved north of actually 50 banks, one of them actually being Santander. I guess the question here is you've announced to date a strategy, which relies on growing significantly in Latin America in digital and businesses like varied banking. So what actions are you taking to prevent events like these in the future?</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: So the Santander Consumer Business is -- has been a great growth engine for the bank. As I mentioned, it's -- we're still managing Europe separate from the Americas. We are working in parallel, and one of the goals is to work increasingly together. So one of the goals of the reorganization is to really understand how do we manage this business, and a business that's truly transforming very fast. So at the moment, as a B2B business, it's increasingly, as you mentioned, the B2C business. Everybody in Santander Consumer and Consumer Brazil, everybody is already working on that B2C, so what are the things we can do together? By having 3 big areas, 3 big groups of countries in a much more streamlined management committee that can execute. We're going to be able to converge -- I mean this is not just about 3 areas. At the end, it's about a single, open financial services platform and you're totally right. The consumer business is one where a lot of things are happening and we want to be there. We have the scale. That's one of the things, again, that we need to work on. How do we -- and it's already happening, by the way. We have great -- Magna's team has done an amazing job. It's working with Scott's team in the U.S. We're actually working towards leveraging our relationships. We have 60, 65, I believe, relationships in OEMs at Santander Consumer that we have not been leveraging in the U.S. or Latin America, we're starting to do that. But there's a more profound change happening and we're absolutely onto it. And again, you need scale on this and that's why we're going to coordinate more on that. Look, I mean, specifically, on the issue you mentioned, I'm not sure we can say much. But I will say that this has been a huge focus for us. Obviously, we're in countries where these issues are especially relevant. But it turns out, it's not just in Latin America. It turns out, this is not an exclusive Latin American issue. It's actually a more European and worldwide. And so one of the most important things is that we can actually share best practices. And we created 2 years ago, 3 years ago a global division in cyber. Again, when we talk about being competitive in the U.S., if you cannot be a top -- at the top of the list in terms of cybersecurity, you cannot compete, right? And so we, today, have a global division and that has been the case and it's like all the way from the first to the last of the businesses. We have 1,000 professionals in cyber, investment plans of 300 million. I think it's over the next few years, and so we're very much focused on that. We didn't spend much time here, but believe me, internally, we spend -- they have the sense, most of the time on control and supervision and risk. And again, we need to focus more on the business and that's one of the reasons for the reorg. Is there anything you want to say more on the specific issues?</p><p>JOS\u00e9 ANTONIO \u00c3LVAREZ \u00c3LVAREZ: Well, we implement the same systems all across the group. And we have deployed in the past year in several countries and the most sensitive ones, armies to make sure that once we had the system, the system was able to calibrate properly. Otherwise, we generate a number of faults. That is impossible to match, yes? So we already got a reasonable calibration of the systems we have. The countries -- and we share the same system all across the board and the same we are doing with cybersecurity. So we have -- we take a lot of care of this. We invested a lot on this because it's a very sensitive issue. In relation with consumer finance, as a matter of fact, we're growing in Europe this year. The production is growing. Why is that? When the market is going down, it's because we depend upon our relationships with the specific OEMs. And in that sense, if you want to say we are lucky because our relationships -- our main relationships are with OEMs that are gaining market share. You know what our main relationships are, but as a matter of fact, we are growing the business in Europe this year. So last year, we got significant market share on behalf of our partners that could take market share. So for us, it matters a lot how they behave in the market. In the used cars, the market is fairly stable, yes, because you focus -- we have a significant used cars business in Germany, that is fairly stable, yes, compared with the new car market.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Okay. It's 10 minutes past the hour, I want it to leave it here. 10-minutes coffee break. And as I said, the management is available for your questions. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Hello, can you hear me? Yes. Ready to kick off now. Apologies for this 15-minutes delay, but it was a good excuse, more time for Q&amp;A. Although apologies for some of you that couldn't ask. Okay, so now we're going to address our core bank. We're going to address what the -- where's the new Latin America, the super growth potential out there, our recent outperformance. And with us here on the stage, we have Sergio Rial, CEO of Santander Brasil; and Dirk Marzluf, our Global Head of IT and Ops. I'll try to ask a couple of questions that I think most of you have for both of them. And then, obviously, we will have time, I'm sure we will this time, for more questions from you. Sergio? I was -- remember, the first time you presented here was at this venue as CEO of Santander Brasil, it was back in 2015, no? Part of the market, so back then that we have not just earnings as a big issue, but a book value issue on the back of what was happening, and we made a 14% return on equity. 3 years on the road, 4 years on the road, you published close to 20% ROE, with a SELIC at 6.5%. So in terms of shareholder value creation, it's even much better, right? And someone from the audience was asking, to Ana or Jose Antonio and Jose, what's next for Santander Brasil? So again, what's next for Santander Brasil?</p><p>SERGIO AGAPITO LIRES RIAL, HEAD OF BRAZIL, BANCO SANTANDER, S.A.: Okay, well, good morning. Yes, that's true, 3 years ago, 2015 was very different. It was actually the day where the real had gone over 4 at that time, so it was really the lowest point in recession. First of all, I think we, the team on the ground, has done a pretty solid job. I think Ana and Jose Antonio have expressed that, and you've seen the numbers. I think you made a very good point that 20% today is very different in 20% at that time, which we were 14%, so domestic interest rates are at 6.5% as opposed to 14.5% back in 2015. The second point is also related, that Brazil has never seen rates at 6.5% for a prolonged time. The last time Brazil had rates under 6% was in 1950. So we haven't really seen yet the potential benefits of a prolonged low interest rate environment and low inflation environment, and hopefully, this will definitely yield into growth, particularly in a country that certainly has a lot of opportunities, both at middle-class level, but also at the base of the pyramid from a social point of view. So what's ahead of us? I mean, we've made a number of progresses in consumer finance. I think it has been mentioned here also. We should be growing market share profitably. The car market has -- not only the car, but the whole mobility space in Brazil has moved quite dramatically from where we were. I mean, car sales have gone up over 20% already when you compare to the last 12 months. So we are seeing at least unemployment has stabilized, so I think we should not see big surprises as of yet, although things can always change very rapidly. But I would say, in terms of opportunities for us, it's going to be a variety of fronts, but we are well positioned to grow profitability in a marketplace. For those who are not following Brazil that closely, 50% of the Brazilian market is in the hands of public banks, 2 public banks. And I think if you look at the new government direction, where they do see the private sector taking a more significant role in what happens from a finance point of view in the marketplace. I think the private banks, so we're not alone, far from it, we have phenomenal competitors. The private bank should benefit in a marketplace that politically and economically is looking at private banks to take a bigger role.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: It is a great growth story yet to come. Dirk, welcome to your first Santander Investor Day, as I go ahead of finding you a house. And you just started on -- we announced some IT and Ops incremental costs and efficiencies, right, of around EUR 700 million. Although Jose Antonio and Ana explained where most of the bulk of these savings, efficiencies are coming from, more detail and the breakdown between Popular and non-Popular, so it would be great for the analysts and investors.</p><p>DIRK MARZLUF, GROUP HEAD OF TECHNOLOGY &amp; OPERATIONS, BANCO SANTANDER, S.A.: I think, in general, you would think cutting costs and the other side becoming more digital is a contradiction. And in reality, it's not. We are saving EUR 180 million as part of the Popular integration. We are pretty much turning off the whole IT infrastructure of Popular as part of the process. Now I think this is showing the strength of our business teams, the strength of the T&amp;O teams, but as well the strength of the technology platform we have in place to be able to really totally migrate and decommission a full-blown complex bank. And now let's look at the EUR 550 million. The EUR 550 million are coming from us modernizing the technology and operations teams and it is as well about scale. And if you look at scale, just in Europe, we have a new footprint all the way from the Nordics down to Spain. So we have all the means and ability and the vision to say we have the means and ambition to be very cost-effective. So when we now look at this one, let's first look at operations. Operations is all about investing in digital tools, process reengineering, automation. And this lowers cost, but not only because at the end of the day, it lowers operational risk and it improves as well customer service. So what are good examples? We already have more than 1,500 robots in the group. We know its message and it saves us money and improves the service as well. Another contribution in that aspect as well is our global scale. We see today that the global process is between 25% and 30% cheaper than if we operate the same process locally. An example we have today, globalizing the Swift service. You know Swift is an important one for us. There are savings in it. But it's a lot about resiliency and it's a lot about our ability to defend on the cyber side as well. So it's much easier to defend one global service than a fragmented service, that's very important. Now stepping back on the technology side, we are not reducing capability. We are increasing capability by investing very clearly in the relevant customer touch points, but as well in the relevant processes. And there are 5 key themes around which we are transforming our technology teams. First, it's continuation of adoption of agile, really small teams that are fully lined up with the business, very important. The second one, it's about cloud, mainly public cloud, which is a relatively new theme we are introducing. And if we combine, at the end, the best-in-class technology you have in public cloud with agile teams, we see today efficiencies of around 30% we can drive from that. So it's a very important efficiency, but as well speed and innovation driver for us as technology and operations. We as well are evolving our core systems. And now as I said, we have very solid ones and with Openbank, we even have a great secondary optionality. So I'm very happy with the foundations on which we can build. But clearly, the business need is changing and over time, we are, as well, changing and transforming our core systems. The fourth point is that we believe that technology and technology skills matter today and even more in the future. So it's about us having the right experts now. It's not always relying on third parties, so we are investing heavily into training our people and as well hiring the relevant talents for us to be world-class in artificial intelligence, in robotics, in blockchain and other relevant technologies. And then the last key pillar of the strategy is data. Data meta as data is a transformational engine for the group, so it's something we are investing heavily and we have a lot of focus on. As such, stepping a bit back, it's about integration. It's about modernization. It's about scale and joint innovation as well with our frontline leadership, like Sergio, truly making a difference for our customers.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Going back to Latin America, Sergio, and we touched on Brazil, but a bit more with Bradesco. I mean, we have top franchises in Argentina, in Chile, in Mexico, et cetera, what can you say with as well the structural growth opportunity for Santander in Lat Am?</p><p>SERGIO AGAPITO LIRES RIAL: I mean, we -- first of all, I mean, people tend to -- we are the really only regional franchise in a continent that has been growing up and down. It hasn't been linear, but it has been in one direction, which is good growth over time. So the uniqueness of being one and the only regional franchise with scale, I don't think we have optimized yet. We've done, and it was due to a number of things, on the back of cash for local and not-local companies. But if you look, for example, consumer finance, which Argentina is just starting a new effort, where we have already a very solid presence in Chile, where we have a very solid presence in Uruguay and also small businesses in Colombia and Peru and in Brazil, where we have a market share of 27%, I think there's quite a bit that we can do. And I'm sure Mexico will embark on the same. So it's just the consumer finance space for us in Lat Am, which is not just about vehicles, but vehicles too, can be a very significant growth opportunity not yet fully exploited, just to give one concrete example, not to expand more than that.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Thanks. Dirk, a follow-up on one of the key issues that our -- the questions that we get from investors and analysts is how the group makes better the decisions of series, right? So how the IT and Ops from Madrid improve the difference of series? What is the value added from you guys?</p><p>DIRK MARZLUF: So I am based in Madrid, and I have to say it's a beautiful city. But joke aside, I think, at the end, it's a global team. It's a global team which delivers global services, and we as well are one team with the local T&amp;O team. So I think that's very important. As well it's important to understand we do not have a central or decentral operating model. We have a mix. So we are decentral organization with very strong central components, which gives us the best out of 2 worlds. We are agile, we are humble, we are fast on the ground while we still can deliver significant savings coming from the group. Today, as Ana mentioned, we have over 400 million in benefits driven by group teams driving or delivering services towards countries. So what are examples of those services? So the first one that comes to my mind is on the cyber side. Cyber is a global threat, and we are globally jointly investing into defending against that threat. Not a single entity, not even Brazil, as a very large entity, could afford the same level of protection or investment on their own. So I think it's a very important one to show that the group really is creating value between us. A second one is more on the skill side. We have been able to attract some of the best talents in artificial intelligence in Madrid in the group and they are jointly working with Lindsey and myself. And that team is able to make, in a way, artificial intelligence, machine learning simple and helps countries to apply those ones towards the use cases in country. So again, a very good lever. And then the more traditional savings that's beyond is the mainframe consolidations, data center consolidations. So there are many areas where the group can create a lot of value. And jointly, with the teams in the countries, we are now accelerating that further. You've seen the challenges or the ambitions we have, and clearly, as one team, we can achieve much more than we can individually.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Let's open now the Q&amp;A for the audience. I'm sure they have plenty of questions. Alvaro? Mic?</p><p>ALVARO SERRANO SAENZ DE TEJADA: Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Just maybe a question for Dirk. I'm just trying to understand, over time, at a time back in the days with Jose (inaudible), it was all very, very centralized. And that gave you a lot of cost discipline, but maybe slower transformation. I think when Ana arrived, that was decentralized. And now it sounds like there's more flexible model. Maybe can you talk us how the whole -- how the model has evolved over the last few years of how you manage it? And has that created some divisions, non-execution on budget? Because obviously, if you have one centralized, you can play around with developments, budgets much better than if you have a localized. Is some of the cost overruns in the group related to that decentralization of development?</p><p>DIRK MARZLUF: I think we need to recognize that the world has changed. In the past, let's say 20 years ago, it was all about scale coming just from the group at the center. Today, if you look at cloud, you get scale on a different magnitude, which you can then help by which you can use in countries to really innovate with the frontline leadership. So in a way, we are coming from a world where it was all about repeatability cost like a factory model, a factory world, which was the best-in-class model 5 or 10 years ago. But today, it's much more about speed, innovation, as well security by design and cost. And to combine all of that one, the model is much more about deep skills in the group like cloud. We don't have 1,000 people in cloud in the head office. We have the best experts that help, say, our U.S. team to properly use the cloud in that sense.</p><p>So from a controlled perspective, we still have a very good visibility on budget. So it's not that the group has not that visibility. So we have very strong cost controls still in technology operations. We understand investments going on locally. But we as well acknowledge that the local leadership understands the local market better, and we help them to succeed and jointly innovate. So that's why I think the mix that we had is the best value creating one. I don't believe that central is right. I don't believe that decentral is right. Both have too many weaknesses. But if you find that middle ground, you can be very powerful around what you do toward success of the business while still having control, cost discipline, speed and innovation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: It's a question to Sergio. Sergio, on the Brazil, I mean, when your Chairman was asked about the local subsidiaries in the listing, she said, \"It's where we are.\" And my question to you is that when we look, Santander has 6 listed subsidiaries, 4 in Brazil. And of course, Santander Brazil accounts for EUR 38 billion of that. So it means that we have the holdings of all the listed subsidiaries, the non-listed part, it just was EUR 10 billion, which, even for a value investor like me, sounds quite cheap if we consider that is -- there is business like Spain and Portugal and, of course, U.K. So my question to you is that I -- on the last 20 years, I never saw the spread between Santander Brazil and Santander Holding Company at this level. So 2.7x tangible book value in Santander Brazil versus 1x for the holding company.</p><p>My 2 parts of the question, do you think that makes sense for Santander just with 90% of the listing when in other geographies in Latin America, I believe that you have between 2/3 and 75%? So is there any merit of doing incremental placement on Brazil? And if you were to do, I mean, where would you deploy capital in the group? So if theoretically Santander would sell Brazil at 2.7x tangible book, where do you think that capital could be redeployed in the group?</p><p>SERGIO AGAPITO LIRES RIAL: Certainly, it's a question for the shareholder, not for management locally. But I -- what I would say is 2 things. One, we are where we should have always been. I mean, we have underperformed as an organization in Brazil historically. So the fact that we are 2.7x, 2.5x, whatever it is, what the price book is, is relative to our local competition. That's point number one. So I think we are in the right range with the best performing banks in Brazil. That's good.</p><p>Second, I think you made a point around the other pieces of the bank. Remember, you got to be careful that Brazil, it is what it is in relation to the portfolio of the bank. But interest rates in Europe are what they are. So over time, we're going to have a completely different, hopefully, interest rate environment in Europe, which will trigger a different outlook from a portfolio point of view.</p><p>Third, I don't have a point of view on how much should the controlling company have in terms of stake. I guess as we are performing, more is better as opposed to less. But I don't think we take a pure trading view on a particular portfolio. I don't think it has been the way we look at it. And we continue to build the business. We have sufficient capital to grow because that's important. We have a core Tier 1 in Brazil around 12%, 12.5%. So that's in line with the rest of the industry. So we are not under any capital constraint. We can certainly deploy capital more intelligently each and every day. But overall, from a growth perspective, we're well positioned.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Ignacio?</p><p>IGNACIO ULARGUI: It's Ignacio Ulargui from Deutsche Bank. Question for Sergio. Could you help us just to understand what the Chairman said before on the 5 -- that the bank is a bit more than a bank, it's an ecosystem of companies, how that is integrated within the cabinets on all the other subsidiaries that you have, how that adds value in the bank in Brazil?</p><p>SERGIO AGAPITO LIRES RIAL: Yes, I think that we have -- so first of all, when you look at the infrastructure in Brazil as a combination of different businesses, they have identity, they have a very undivided focus what they have to do, but they are interconnected. I think the challenge of large companies is always how do you connect them horizontally in a smart way that actually adds value as opposed to bureaucracy, committees and nonsense. So in Brazil, what we have done reasonably well has been to ensure that an acquiring business is not only serving the market but it's serving fundamentally as a means of the bank. Very interconnected. When you look at, for example, the CIB product infrastructure, they're actually serving the bank overall. They're not serving segments. Challenges in big companies is that they tend to behave according to their organizational charts. And what we have to do is we've got to deconstruct organizational charts and serve customers. Beautiful said, difficult to be executed. We've been, so far, good at doing that horizontally very well. So we look at ourselves as a bunch of wild dogs. We hunt together collectively, and we can certainly kill big preys. We're not the biggest in town. It doesn't have to be, but we certainly should be the ones moving faster and more intelligently than competition. That -- what we have done so far on average, okay.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Second row.</p><p>MARIO ROPERO: It's Mario from Fidentiis again. One question is, before it has been mentioned above EUR 20 billion investments in IT, digitalization. And maybe, Dirk, you can comment on some of the main blocks. And then on cloud banking or the migration to the cloud, I wanted to hear your views on what is easier. Is it easier to move to the cloud, the existing bank or to work on the already digital platforms you have like Openbank and then migrating the customers over there? And in this sense, what is the preferred thing to do going forward?</p><p>DIRK MARZLUF: I think -- so let's first look at the EUR 20 billion. I think it's a joint exercise between Lindsey and myself. So this is a joint investment pool of the EUR 20 billion. EUR 2 billion per year going into the digital transformation. You see some of the good examples outside where the money is going with real progress in that space. But of course, what is true as well, what I see is that the joint innovation we are doing and the progress we do jointly with the business locally is key for me. I'm not claiming, like probably it was more the case in the previous time, to know better what the Brazilian business needs. What we do is we make sure that when we deliver, we deliver fast, agile, with the right performance, I would call it, behind it. So we make sure that with technology and operations perspective, we are the best, fastest executors on behalf of the leadership and division we have in the group with the group businesses like what we have in GMS and GTS, but, as well, what we have with Sergio, of course. We're investing in all of our multichannel capabilities. So everything, you can imagine, is happening, and we look where benefits are to do them jointly. But it's very clear that there is no -- I think there's a delivery strategy very strong to make sure we are the best executors. And then on the business strategy, we're very closely aligned with the global leadership for the global business and with the local leadership for the local business. I think that was the first point.</p><p>Now on the cloud topic, which is more a question of core systems. We do have very strong core systems from the times that -- where the group was very centralized. And they are still maintained. They work. It's not -- there's no burning platform for us like some other banks might be having. Now are those systems in 5 years, as they stand today, the perfect platform for business? Probably not. So what our strategy is we evolve those systems. They were architected. And sometimes, the most of the system serves very well the purpose and we just need to modernize a specific piece which is important towards the business, so we do not need to do 5-year type of big transformation programs and replace core systems as a sense of urgency, I would call it. So we can evolve jointly with leaders like Rami in Spain or like Sergio in Brazil and serve the business very well with what we have.</p><p>Now looking at what we have today with Openbank, it gives us optionalities for specific use cases because if you look at core system migration, it takes a long time, distracts the business for a long time. So it's not an option you do without real deep sense of urgency. But sometimes, a specific segment can be very well served by the technology. We can go easier with that technology into new markets. So we are looking always carefully in our core systems as our core strength, optionality coming from Openbank. But we always look case-by-case which of the 2 options makes sense because, as I said, we do not have the sense of urgency to replace systems because they're obsolete, they can't be operated anymore. They're solid. They run every day in a very stable and solid fashion.</p><p>Now what we do in public cloud, it's very important. Public cloud gives us a global platform, and I think that one is important. Every investment we are doing jointly between Lindsey and ourselves like on global merchant service, global trade services, we want to somewhere develop and then reuse globally. So for us, public cloud is almost a reusability platform. Yes, it's cost efficient, gives us innovation and speed. But the more important one is global. As such, all of our scale benefits we get from the group, we can leverage much better in public cloud than what we can do on our own footprint. So I would say public cloud is a real engine for reusability, for value coming from the group. And our core systems strategy, as I said, segment, they're carefully looked at case-by-case because there is no sense of urgency, which, I have to say, I feel quite lucky about that because I think core system replacement projects are not very value creating if you can avoid them.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Carlos?</p><p>CARLOS COBO CATENA: Carlos from SocGen. Just a quick follow-up on the IT budget. Could you -- I mean, roughly but could you break down the EUR 5 billion per annum that you invest between what you need to use for updating the infrastructure, the IT infrastructure of the bank and modernize it and how much is left for you to invest in new AI projects and more innovative projects? Do you have a lot of room for maneuver there or that is still like a secondary priority for you?</p><p>DIRK MARZLUF: So I think when we look at it, we normally -- as an IT person, you distinguish the business-as-usual part from the investment part. So yes, your question is very relevant. What we have today is we have EUR 2 billion in digital investments. That's really room for maneuver. And that one is shared between Lindsey and myself over-letting by EUR 1.3 billion between us. So EUR 1.3 billion of the EUR 2 billion is part of the IT budget but jointly driven based on the strategies coming from her and coming from the frontline leadership.</p><p>What we then have is something like -- I would say business as usual is normally the ratio is 60-40 in other companies I've worked before. We're a bit better. We are probably around 55% around change capacity, 55% or so around the business as usual. So we are in a good space around the split between running the bank and changing the bank. So I think this is a healthy ratio, and I feel very comfortable around that. If not, I would have been very much more careful around any of the commitments given today.</p><p>STEFAN ROSENOV NEDIALKOV: A question for Dirk from Stefan at Citi. Openbank runs on Temenos as far as I know. And I just wanted to get some color on how do you choose to go with Temenos rather than run Openbank on your own existing core banking systems. You've just made the comment that your existing systems are good, they're stable, they allow you to do whatever you want to do. So why go with Temenos and not put Openbank in your existing systems?</p><p>DIRK MARZLUF: So I think when -- I think there's first one step to be taken. Now Temenos is not, in a way, the platform for Openbank. Openbank is based on Amazon Web Services. Today, it has a very modern architecture around modules and reusability of APIs in a sense. So it has Temenos for some of the functionality and many other components as part of it. So it's a very modern architecture, I would say, for the -- for our bank. Now the same architecture we are deploying in all the other banks as well. So it's not like the other banks will remain on-premise and not having those type of flexible architecture. So I would say the Openbank architecture on the technology side is similar or the same architecture from the principle perspective we are implementing in Spain, we implement in Brazil.</p><p>So now that comes back to the one part of that architecture, which is the core banking system. I think the Temenos banking system is quite nicely tailored towards what we want to do in Openbank. It gives us the ability to deploy quickly in additional countries. It's a good building block, I would call it. Our existing Parthenon system is used today in Openbank. So it does work. But it would be more costly and less flexible for us to bring, for example, this Parthenon as the foundation to launch in additional countries. So in a sense, it is a bit more smaller. It's a bit, I would say, simplified versus what we have. But today, running a bank like Spain on Parthenon, which our -- is our own self-developed one, I'm very confident with the same. The volumes we have in Brazil and the scale we have in Brazil with our core systems, we do very well on this.</p><p>So I would say for me, it's same architecture between Openbank and the rest. Yes, there's a building block called -- across the core system, which either way gets smaller and smaller over time, the new architectural world of modularization. And yes, for Openbank specifically, Temenos is a good choice for a number of banking services in the context, helping us to be a bit fast and more flexible and a bit more cost effective around what we do in that space, yes? But there's no driver, for example, to migrate Spain, which works very well, but if you can have the same architecture, the same feeling, the same digitalization in a way as the heart of this one.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: We're running out of time, I'm afraid. So thanks, Dirk and Sergio. And now we have to move to the second fireside chat. So thanks very much for your contribution.</p><p>DIRK MARZLUF: Thank you.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Okay. So thanks, Lindsey and Eze. Lindsey is our Chief Digital &amp; Innovation officer. Ezequiel is our Openbank CEO. So both for them, thank you for sharing your views.</p><p>Openbank has been mentioned in -- this morning quite a few times. What is really what Openbank adds to the group?</p><p>EZEQUIEL SZAFIR HOLCMAN, CEO, OPENBANK S.A.: That's a very good question. Actually, I think Openbank adds to the group in different areas. And the questions they asked early, I think, go in that direction. The first one is when we talk about the platform. So Openbank is developing a full banking platform that is based on the new partings of machine learning, one single data lake for everything. It's cloud based. The core banking is new and modular. One of the modules, as Dirk said, is Temenos, but it's like 42 modules. And that's a bit the seed of the future for the group. It's a -- somehow, for Lindsey and Dirk, also a partner to develop the know-how and the R&amp;D that then we will be applying at the group. It's -- really if you would be a car company living on diesel sales every quarter, you want to have your own electric car built and properly done in-house that runs the right number of miles and that can charge in less than 4 hours. That's why we are doing well like the Tesla for the group in that sense.</p><p>Besides the technology, I think another very important thing we do is the -- there is this art of doing what others do without branches, right? This is -- if you think about it, for example, somehow, Amazon does what Tesla does, what Walmart does but without a store. So we are kind of doing what banks do without branches. And that means that we should be able to attract customers, engage them and retain them in a full digital way without branches. That's probably a lot how the future will look like and having within the group a bank that is doing that every day with already a 1.2 million customers and engage -- 38% engaged with a resulting EUR 9.5 billion deposits. That's, I think, a big added value.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Okay. Lindsey, one of the pushbacks that every now and then when I meet with investors we have on the speedboats is that the speedboat as such is a very nice concept. But in the bigger scheme of things for the group, they don't make the difference, right? So what can we tell to the audience on that? How long should be expect until this really -- speedboats make a difference for the group?</p><p>LINDSEY TYLER ARGALAS, CHIEF DIGITAL &amp; INNOVATION OFFICER, BANCO SANTANDER, S.A.: Right. Well, you're right, Sergio. Today, the speedboats relative to the core business are relatively small because they're fairly early stage. However, we think that there's huge potential. One of the ways that we prioritize the speedboats is we take very large problem phases that we feel are ripe for drastic improvement or disruption that we feel we're uniquely placed to solve. As you heard Ana talk about them, we see in the midterm we actually expect that we'll have 15 million active customers using these services. Most of those we anticipate to be new to the franchise. So again, if we think about driving customer growth, that's pretty significant to the bank.</p><p>Very importantly, though, is we don't just look at it in terms of acquiring new customers. We look very methodically at making sure that those are active customers, they're getting value from the service, they're transacting with that solution. And as a result, that they are not only getting value themselves, but it's delivering value for Santander as well. So that's very important and very different than many of the startups you see today which are just chasing user numbers and Ana mentioned that a few times.</p><p>The last thing I'll say is of course it takes time to build that very large, scalable digital business. But in the interim, as the technology comes online, we're taking some of those services and applying them to our core business. One Pay FX is an excellent example. We invested in the infrastructure and modern technology and modern services, and we put the One Pay FX, the international transfer capability, into the Spain mobile banking app, for example. Since we launched that, there has been a 120% incremental transactions and cross-border payments, right? So while we're incubating a stand-alone digital business that will allow us to acquire new customers, the core business is also benefiting as well.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: And Eze, what -- I mean, investors and analysts tell me or tell us that most of banks have some kind of a digital online platform. So the first question is, what does Openbank make different? So why Openbank is different versus other bank competitors? And the second one is, how does Openbank create or will create value to the group...</p><p>EZEQUIEL SZAFIR HOLCMAN: So let me answer the first question. It's -- I think it's more fun because it's a question I get asked a lot, and there was a difference between Openbank and other digital banks that we have across Europe. I think, first, there are a lot of similarities. So if you see European large digital banks, we have a lot of similarities. We are -- well, we're fully digital. We are razor-sharp focused on customer service and support. We have a beautifully looking app. We have a double-digit growth on mostly every KPI. But toward the end there, the 2 big differences are, on the one hand, the broad portfolio. Most digital banks would stop at having one app and, at current, take on probably a debit card or a credit card. Openbank has everything that your bank doesn't have or we have the same. You have a great looking app. You could do -- for example, if somebody here has an Openbank account, you are already probably keeping your passwords and your secret notes within the app. If we keep your money, why can't we keep, as a data bank, your data? You probably also are aggregating and seeing the balance of other banks. So we're making full use of PSA, too. So within our clients, within their app, they can see the balance of any other bank or even of PayPal, for example. So all these goodies that digital banks have, we have. But then we have the proper banking service, right? So you can get a loan, you can finance your payment. Your school keeps tuition right away from your app in 2 clicks. And we have a full broker. The brokerage is a open architecture. You can buy and sell stocks, futures, warrants, whatever you want. We have robo-advisory combined with micro-investing and similar-type things. I like it. So you do have all those services that are not just going to be deployed. They're deployed. They are working. We have already EUR 1.2 billion in assets under management. So that's a big difference.</p><p>And then this -- the big enabler for that, a difference, which is the business model. Our business model is banking, retail banking, meaning we do what other banks do without branches. So the result is that because having all those services, we have, for example, the average customer has about EUR 21,000 of balance, average balance. If you look at other digital banks, they probably are in -- or GBP 200 one, the other one is in what, EUR 1,000. So it's a real relationship we have with them.</p><p>We have mortgages. We have started the mortgages a few months ago. We're already over EUR 400 million in mortgages. Mortgages are, in average, less leveraged than the market, which is very good. So I think it's a big difference to other banks.</p><p>And that is why value-add stays in the group, because the whole technology development process is not isolated. It's done together with the technology group, with the digital group. Some stuff that we work at Openbank, for example, we -- I think AML is a big point. If you see what other digital banks are doing, because they are -- most of them are owned or -- by venture capital, so probably, I think, is -- they're investing in -- AML is very expensive. And you will not get a payback in the next 3 years, right? With our bank, we're a regulated bank. We're part of the Group Santander. We do the proper thing. But we're developing in parallel -- actually, it's Lindsey's team developing for us a whole machine learning base with our digital intelligence, AML tool. That AML tool was developed by Lindsey's team, deployed first at Openbank as an R&amp;D lab. It was run in parallel, worked really well. And now Dirk's team is rolling it out in 3 countries, including Europe and America. So that's how the value goes from one place to the other.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Thank you. And Lindsey, a similar question to the one that I asked before to Dirk, how does innovation add value from Madrid, the corporate center to the subsidiaries?</p><p>LINDSEY TYLER ARGALAS: Well, I think, as Eze just touched on a couple of them, I would say first of all, in terms of expertise, right, so it doesn't make sense for all of our countries to have deep expertise in data advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, Blockchain, a practice called conversion rate optimization. So there are certain disciplines where the expertise are high value adding. They don't need to be necessarily in-country. And so we have these centers of excellence at the group level. Dirk mentioned a couple on data artificial intelligence. Eze just gave one example as well. But we basically have 100 data scientists who work very closely with the country, looking for the highest-impact use cases. We have a global machine learning platform. We developed the algorithms once, and they get deployed locally, running on that country's data. So again, very high return on investment. If you think about the improvements we're seeing with 30% churn reduction, 20% improvement in cross-sells, 40% AML, reduction on false positive, so there's a number of things, again, where you take out expertise and we deploy it locally. Similarly, a lot of the tech companies and e-commerce players have a discipline that is well worn, which is called conversion rate optimization. It is a deep science and a deep practice that has huge implications as more of our customers shop online. And so over the last year, we've been working with most of the countries and now this year working with all the countries, where we've seen improvements of 2x in the conversion rate, which is driving a lot more of our sales and, again, efficiencies in our sales channel process, right? So the expertise is critical.</p><p>The second big theme is around shared development. And so Ana gave one example earlier of Globile, which is our code name for the mobile banking app. We saw about 9 months ago that most of our countries wanted to bring very similar functionality and innovations to their mobile banking experience so that they can have the best experience possible. We see now that an average mobile banking user is accessing and logging in 19 times a month. And that's a tremendous opportunity for us to engage and add value in those interactions. And so in a matter of months, a cross-country team basically built several components and functionality, and they're now deployed already in the hands of 9 million of our mobile customers with very ambitious road map for the rest of the year. And so again, we're going to see a lot more of the shared development where it makes sense. All of the new speedboats and the opportunities we talked about in global trade services, global merchant services, they will all be built as global platforms and shared across the country. So that's -- and that's a big change.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Thank you. I guess we'll open the Q&amp;A to the audience if they'll have some questions. Yes, Mario?</p><p>MARIO ROPERO: Me again, Mario from Fidentiis. On Openbank, from the figures that have -- that are publicly disclosed, the loan book is EUR 5 billion in Spain and the RoTE is below mid-single digits. But the target is to go to 20% in midterm, 3, 4 years. So I guess that the goal or the upside is now coming from efficiency here. So could you please tell us some of the implicit targets embedded in this 20% RoTE in terms of volumes and margins? Yes, that's it.</p><p>EZEQUIEL SZAFIR HOLCMAN: Actually, the growth does come from efficiencies. The difference in efficiencies in a digital company are the way the cost scales. So when you have a digital business, most of the part of the costs are fixed. And the variable is a smaller portion, thus the growth are slower than the revenue activity you generate. So that's why if you see most digital companies strive for size as the beginning of their growth, because that's what brings actually profitability. So in the case of Openbank, what we are still planning is to benefit from that scale from the digital infrastructure. That being said, the other difference is that today, if you look at our cost structure where we invest, we are anything but ideal or -- because we are investing a lot on stuff that then is there. For example, if you look at Openbank, we started approximately about 2.5 years ago. It was just a deposits-only bank. Today, we have a lot of services that we have been investing and developing, and all those resources that go to develop, for example -- I think we have one of probably the best robo-advisors in Europe with micro-investing, everything, those resources you've got to redeploy, and then it becomes -- it's more efficient. So I think there's 2 big levers, is that we have already paid for most of our rebuilding, and the other one is it scales by digital. And that's the magic of digital, right? You don't -- we are a -- we're going to open in other countries, and we need probably, in some countries, one person, a market manager. In other countries, we may need 50, 80 people. That's like a whole country. So that's how digital business works.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Alvaro?</p><p>ALVARO SERRANO SAENZ DE TEJADA: Alvaro Serrano from Morgan Stanley. Openbank -- another question for -- on Openbank. It's existed for a while, and I understand there's a lot of development. But what are you waiting for to launch globally or in markets like U.K., Europe, which is obviously the, it seems, the long-term aspiration?</p><p>EZEQUIEL SZAFIR HOLCMAN: It's a good question. So Openbank has more than 20 years as a bank. And the group has been innovating through Openbank. It was a direct bank, a phone bank when that was actually super new. The bank we took over was there already. We are turning it into a proper digital financial services platform, as we said, and we're not going to wait much to go international. We're going to be careful. We're going to be selective. We're trying to add value to shareholders not just to add users in different countries that are -- so we don't want to turn operating losses into customers like other ventures do. So we're going to go step-by-step.</p><p>We have 2 different ways to go digital for us. The first one is as a European bank, as you may know already in the news, we applied for an European license, which we got already. So we can start expanding in Europe using our European passport. That means that it would be the same team we are in Spain. We're only 146 people. This is very, very lean team for our 1.2 million customers that we have. So we can open a market, which we actually are opening as we speak with a marginal effort. We're going to go first for Germany. As of today, German customers can already go to Openbank DE, and they will find our website with a waiting list. We're already operating with real customers in Germany in a, for instance, family way. We'll keep that -- a waiting list open for a while. And other European countries will follow soon after Germany. As for non-European countries, we can operate. We have a full stack with our local license. We have applied for licenses in several countries already. Some of those applications became public. We have already started assembling a team in Argentina. We hired -- the country manager for Google is now our country manager in Argentina. We have a team already, 10 people in -- and we're going to open as well there. So it's happening, it's coming.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: Yes, Stefan?</p><p>STEFAN ROSENOV NEDIALKOV: It's Stefan from Citi. A question for Lindsey. Do you see digital as a way to increase fee generation? And how could that happen across the different countries?</p><p>LINDSEY TYLER ARGALAS: Yes, I think, of course, depending on the business, what you could see here is with our speedboat program, we're basically tackling what we think are the most promising spaces for, again, disruption and opportunities. So absolutely, we see that there are -- depending on the speedboat, there's opportunities for new fees. There's also new business models. That's a lot of the disruption that's happening right now. So you heard Ana reference a couple times that because of our scale, as we invest in these global platforms, obviously digital is a scale business. So we're not only going to take advantage of that ourselves and operate more cost efficiently, it allows us to go on the offense and serve other people. So I do very much believe that there will also be new revenue streams that come out of this as well. So in addition to serving new customers with new revenue streams of additional fees, there are also new revenue streams entirely because you think about monetizing, getting the value out of that customer relationship very differently.</p><p>BENJIE CREELAN-SANDFORD, BANK ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Benjie at Jefferies. Just a question on credit risk management. I mean, how does that work in terms of the information flow or how that's managed at the group level between Openbank and the traditional banks within Santander? And what implications also does that have in terms of your ability or your willingness to scale up quickly in new markets where the traditional subsidiaries aren't operating?</p><p>EZEQUIEL SZAFIR HOLCMAN: Yes, that's I think a very good question. And if I may start by a personal reflection. I joined Santander about 3 years ago. I came from Amazon. And from outside, you tend to see banks with large corporations like not expecting much on the digital side, right, or on the technology side. And when you come -- when I came at least to Santander, the surprise is that actually, if you go around countries, you will find extremely strong groups of data scientists working on machine learning algorithms, precisely on credit scoring and risk in countries like Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Spain. It's very impressive. So the first thing is it's not Openbank, it's the group that -- where the knowledge is as well and not just Openbank. Now the truth is that at Openbank, because of the data architecture we have, we are able to move very fast in testing a lot of algorithms, a lot of different machine learning algorithms to apply not just to credit risk scoring, to AML, to fraud detection. We have the best of both worlds. The group has a central know-how team for modeling, and we are running in parallel many times the old-fashioned rules based. We algorithm the new one. We test. We do testing. We do actually real-life testing. We take 2,000 clients. We try and we compare with pilot groups. And that can be directly applied into countries. And we work a lot together. There's just a -- so the only limitation you have is ensuring data because of the data protection lock. But most only to share data. I mean, an algorithm is actually a pen drive, and you can go and put an algorithm in any data and then you optimize it, right? So it's a joint work. And we are, as we speak, the -- there is a central function in Lindsey's team for machine learning, there is a team scientist at Openbank and we work together. It's sharing -- actually we met in Madrid last week. It's a club. They meet and they exchange algorithms, ideas, et cetera. The robot for machine learning development of Openbank is already working in Santander Argentina, for example.</p><p>SERGIO G\u00c3\u00a1MEZ MART\u00c3\u00adNEZ: No more questions, I guess, so I guess we can leave it here, and I'll leave the floor to Ana for her concluding remarks. Thank you.</p><p>ANA BOT\u00c3\u00adN SANZ DE SAUTUOLA Y O'SHEA: So thank you very much, everybody, for being with us today. I'll just be very brief so we can all have lunch and have a chance to talk some more. I hope you had enough time for questions, but you will have more time during lunch.</p><p>So as we have explained during this morning, the customer loyalty and digital strategy is working for us. It has allowed us to deliver on our 3-year plan. We have done that leveraging on our strong foundations, which we covered. And really, the whole focus and a lot of the focus going forward will remain in terms of net -- the network value, the knowledge, the talent and working more together as a single platform. This is super important, and we believe this is the way to deliver not just today -- and this is -- as I said in the Q&amp;A, it's finding the balance between delivering today and in the medium term. And we're aiming to deliver in growth, in profitability and, of course, as a bank, in increased strength as a whole.</p><p>So the focus today has been on how we're going to speed up this transformation of Santander to meet the challenges we face, the digital challenges, and the macro and so on. But one of the things that I mentioned briefly in response to a question was that organization is one of the key levers that we have to deliver on strategy and deliver on our plans. And we will continue to focus on robust governance. This is crucial. We have strengthened our internal governance systems and continue to do that. We also need clear lines of accountability, and this is important. And we need really a structure that allows the tough questions and then executes. And this is the reason why we are taking the step which is, for the Santander Group, quite an important one.</p><p>We need to continue to make the most of our geographical expertise. Our country leaders are hugely important to us. Diversity is hugely important to us. And we today operate across 3 regions where our business can work much better together. We're doing a lot of that as my colleagues explained a few minutes ago. We need to work in an agile and efficient way, building on each market's strength and innovation. At the end of the day, we do not need to invent the same widget 10 times, sometimes even 20 times. And this is exactly what it is that we are aiming to do.</p><p>I must say that one of the questions I often get, Jos\u00e9 Antonio, Jos\u00e9 and Sergio also, and one of the questions that really, let's say, I don't get upset because I shouldn't, but I take this on as a constructive challenges, but you're a federation of banks. You're a conglomerate. Well, to prove that we do listen, this is also our response. We want to be less of a conglomerate, less of a federation of banks, and unlock even more the value that we see that the market has not fully recognized. And this is the answer to that. So we are going from many different countries managed, I'd say, autonomously. We will continue, I said that very clearly, in terms of capital and liquidity and responsibility to the local regulators. But the reporting line will change, and this is important because we believe this is a more efficient organization. So we'll have 3 groups of countries, Europe as a geography, South America and North America. Each of the new heads will report to Jos\u00e9 Antonio, and each of the country heads will report to the new group heads.</p><p>Obviously, one of the key goals, and I want to stress this, is that we will not create regional structures. That's not what we're doing. We're going to leverage the group functions, which are very strong, to deliver better for the countries. And as my colleagues, Dirk and Lindsey, explained is, we will have certain centers of excellence in different countries. So this coordination between countries and the center will be strengthened. There will be no new functions being put in place. This will be complemented by a new management committee chaired by our CEO, which will have 12 members, I mentioned that already, 7 nationalities and very much more business focused, again with a very strong -- continuing strong compliance and risk functions across the group. So we believe this is one of the really new things and tools in terms of how we can deliver faster execution. I've been saying that for a while. We have done a lot these 3 years, but we do think Santander has much more potential, a huge opportunity going forward in this digital environment. We believe we will be one of the winners.</p><p>So as a summary, I would like to leave you with our medium-term goals. You've seen that already. We are going to collaborate increasingly in a smart way across the group. We're aiming to be the best for our customers. There's no other way in today's world. The best customer experience. This will lead us to the profitability and capital efficiency that we're aiming for and, of course, the simplified management structure to accelerate execution.</p><p>So thank you all again for being with us, and we look forward to talking to you. I hope you agree with me after listening to my colleagues we have more like them. We have an amazing team. We have an amazing combination of new talent with the traditional Santander bankers. I think Eze, he comes from Amazon, and I think his team reflects what you can see in Santander Spain or Brazil or the U.K., which is a very unique combination of traditional bankers with new skills. And this is what's going to make us succeed. It's our team.</p><p>And I would like to say thank you to everybody here. I'm super proud of what you've done, and I look forward to even more ahead. Thank you again.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Este grupo est\u00e1 compuesto por Google, Amazon, Facebook y Apple, entre las norteamericanas, y por el gigante chino Alibaba. En el mercado regional, Mercado Libre es una big tech. Este tipo de fintech se caracteriza por poseer una base de clientes, con informaci\u00f3n propia y relevante, que podr\u00eda ser y es utilizada para la provisi\u00f3n de servicios financieros, no estando disponible para el resto del mercado\u201d, esto dice en el documento realizado por FIEL que el presidente de Adeba, Javier Bolzico, le present\u00f3 a Guido Sandleris y al Poder Ejecutivo.</p><p><br/>Adicionalmente, a diferencia del resto de las fintechs, en particular las plataformas de marketplace, \u00e9stas pueden ofrecer servicios financieros tales como pr\u00e9stamos y tambi\u00e9n cuentas (virtuales) de dep\u00f3sitos al mismo tiempo. El paper se\u00f1ala que las jurisdicciones m\u00e1s avanzadas en materia regulatoria (por ejemplo, Reino Unido y Australia) han dise\u00f1ado esquemas ad-hoc para las fintechs, a trav\u00e9s de distintos instrumentos. Estos instrumentos son los areneros regulatorios (\u201csandboxes\u201d), los \u201chubs\u201d de innovaci\u00f3n, los aceleradores y el desarrollo de un modelo de Banca Abierta (\u201cOpen Banking\u201d).<br/>Los areneros regulatorios otorgan permisos a bajo costo a los innovadores para proveer nuevos servicios, en un contexto controlado de riesgos. Los \u201chubs\u201d de innovaci\u00f3n buscan facilitar la inserci\u00f3n en la actual regulaci\u00f3n de las nuevas firmas, a trav\u00e9s del di\u00e1logo y el conocimiento de las nuevas tecnolog\u00edas por parte del regulador. Los aceleradores intentan premiar las innovaciones, incluso con ayuda financiera, para incentivar la aparici\u00f3n de nuevos servicios. Finalmente, el modelo de Banca Abierta busca hacer competir a todos los oferentes, bancos y fintechs, a trav\u00e9s del intercambio digital de informaci\u00f3n de cuentas de los clientes, minimizando los costos de transacci\u00f3n o \u201cswitching costs\u201d para la migraci\u00f3n de los clientes hacia diversas instituciones.<br/>\u201cCabe se\u00f1alar que estos esquemas son mecanismos de transici\u00f3n, con lo que la regulaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda cambiar con el tiempo y en particular respecto de empresas u oferentes que dejan de cumplir con condiciones donde se les otorga cierto car\u00e1cter experimental. En la Argentina, el BCRA ha avanzado en forma importante en la creaci\u00f3n de un \u201chub\u201d de innovaci\u00f3n y en un modelo de acelerador. En cambio, no existen reglas que determinen c\u00f3mo deben introducirse nuevos productos al mercado ni mediciones del impacto en t\u00e9rminos de riesgos. Es decir, no se aplica el concepto de arenero que hoy la mayor\u00eda de los reguladores bancarios del mundo est\u00e1n adoptando o intentando adoptar. Tampoco se aplica un modelo de Banca Abierta en la Argentina, aunque debe reconocerse que el desarrollo de este sistema puede ser muy costoso y que podr\u00eda recurrirse a un sustituto como la portabilidad de datos en forma estandarizada. En t\u00e9rminos generales, deber\u00eda tenerse presente que, aunque las fintechs no son una parte significativa del mercado financiero, los organismos internacionales recomiendan a los reguladores del sistema financiero, en vista a su r\u00e1pida evoluci\u00f3n, tener en consideraci\u00f3n a estas firmas en sus evaluaciones de riesgo y en los marcos regulatorios\u201d, sugiere el estudio.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECC-7232059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB0-JDR1-JCMP-50NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>Derechos reservados</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 \u00a9 El Cronista, Buenos Aires, Argentina Derechos reservados</copyright><publicationName>El Cronista Comercial</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>11 junio 2019 martes</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Peri\u00f3dico</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>SPANISH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>ESPA\u00d1OL</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Finanzas y mercados</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0008WVM</classCode><className>Banking Institutions + Systems</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>Central Banks</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX000231</classCode><className>Business Forecasts</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N522110DC</classCode><className>Commercial Banking</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDIyQTAxOUNERDI4NDdFNjkyMEFDOTFFM0MwMTQzNjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI</classCode><className>Commercial Banks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>N523110EC</classCode><className>Investment Banking</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The country's open banking initiative is expected to increase risks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the Ciab conference in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, banking executives are clamoring to build upon the partnerships with financial technology companies that are becoming increasingly ubiquitous across the sector. Most say they are looking keenly at startups that can help their banks gain agility and client-knowledge.</p><p>Among those in attendance is Marcelo Clara, COO and chief information officer at Banco Votorantim SA, a Brazilian institution co-owned by state-run Banco do Brasil SA and Votorantim SA, the Latin American industrial conglomerate. The bank's fintech partnerships include Olvia, which uses artificial intelligence to provide financial assistance, as well as online student loan lender Pravaler and online auto marketplace Carflix. However, Clara believes that blockchain technology has the potential to have the greatest impact on the banking space in the future.</p><p>S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence recently sat down with Clara on the sidelines of the Ciab conference, where he is one of the keynote speakers.</p><p>What follows is an edited transcript of that discussion.</p><p>Marcelo Clara, COO and chief information officer at Banco Votorantim</p><p>What has been the bank's recent strategy regarding technology?</p><p>Marcelo Clara: It is impossible nowadays to think of an enterprise, whatever the size, without tech. Technology is at the core of every company in any kind of industry. We started 3 years ago with a huge investment from IT in infrastructure, architecture, and modernization of our legacy [business]. Besides that, we also invested a lot in culture from the C-level along with the HR department and we can now see the results. We are seen by fintechs and other institutions as a financial institution that has been modernized, and we have positioned ourselves as one of the banks that really partners with fintechs. We can now say it is an asset that we have created, an environment not only to retain talent but to attract it as well. Fifteen fintechs are either invested by us or connected to our business through our IT platform.</p><p>How does this process of picking fintechs work?</p><p>We launched our lab one year ago. There is an internal committee where the C-level discusses strategy and defines the priorities aligned to our vision. Once we have agreed on that, we give the challenge to the lab to understand and map the market and do the proof of concepts with fintechs. Later on, they show us what they have identified and tested and present us with business cases. Some of them are approved and implemented. And at that point, we have different ways of doing so. Sometimes it is just a partnership, and in some cases we invest in them through our own venture capital [fund]. We use these different tools to understand and maximize the value that we can get from the entire ecosystem.</p><p>What are the weak spots these companies are actually filling?</p><p>We have many cases. It's a very interesting marriage. We have a lot of knowledge and capability; we understand regulation and governance. A partnership with them allows us to interchange their ability to understand the customer in a different way, from a more flexible, less bureaucratic approach. Using different technologies that large organizations were often not allowed to use, more tied to big tech companies that could supply them. Nowadays it's different. We have to maximize their ability to understand the client's need.</p><p>Digital channels have consolidated in Brazil as the preferred channel for customers, with 60% of transactions in 2018 being carried out either by internet or mobile banking. What does that mean for cybersecurity concerns? Are incidents increasing?</p><p>Yes, they are. It is one of the issues the whole industry has to face every day. We have to rise to the challenge. Once you are more open   and we now have open banking coming   when you become more digital and hyperconnected, of course, you have a lot of new ports in terms of risk that you have to manage. This is already happening, and all the institutions like us need to invest in cybersecurity. It is a considerable cost, and we have also increased our investment there over the past years.</p><p>Is it your responsibility to educate customers?</p><p>Yes, we have to invest in education to prevent fraud and social engineering, since most of the cases that we've seen have come from the social aspect rather than the hard tech approach.</p><p>In your view, what is the correct approach for a bank in Brazil that seeks to remain technologically competitive?</p><p>The challenge is to have equilibrium in terms of control and flexibility. If you become more controlled, more risk-resistant, at the end of the day, you will be less flexible. On the other hand, if you are too flexible ... you will not be able to manage all the risk and compliance and regulatory issues. The banks that will succeed in the future will understand how to maximize these two aspects.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLLFD-52341058</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLLFD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC8-1PJ1-JDVW-N0VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">427793</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Latin America Financials Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 14, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000389F</classCode><className>BANCO VOTORANTIM SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC0009S76</classCode><className>VOTORANTIM SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>CC00099NZ</classCode><className>BANCO DO BRASIL SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>NAICS327310 CEMENT MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>BBAS3 (BOVESPA)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Operations &amp;

Ale na druhej strane, aj samotn\u00e1 spo\u013eahlivos\u0165 rozpozn\u00e1vania hlasu m\u00e1 limity.Napr\u00edklad?Mal\u00e9 die\u0165a si napr\u00edklad objednalo mno\u017estvo vec\u00ed cez Alexu. Preto\u017ee rozpozn\u00e1vanie hlasu nefunguje na 100 percent. Ale aj napr\u00edklad reklama be\u017eiaca v telev\u00edzii. K Alexe sa prihl\u00e1site, ke\u010f poviete \u201eAlexa\u201c. Syst\u00e9m sa vtedy spust\u00ed, no ak s\u00fa\u010dasne be\u017e\u00ed v miestnosti reklama, kde z\u00e1rove\u0148 nie\u010do pon\u00fakaj\u00fa na objednanie, stalo sa, \u017ee aj ke\u010f ste to k\u00fapi\u0165 nechceli, k\u00fapili ste to. \u010ci\u017ee e\u0161te nejak\u00fd \u010das to potrv\u00e1, k\u00fdm sa to \u00faplne vyvinie. Ale potom bude ve\u013emi jednoduch\u00e9 komunikova\u0165 aj s bankou. Budete sedie\u0165 v aute a nebudete po\u010d\u00fava\u0165 hudbu, ale vybav\u00edte si svoje finan\u010dn\u00e9 potreby. Pritom sa st\u00e1le budete koncentrova\u0165 na dopravu, preto\u017ee budete len rozpr\u00e1va\u0165. To by bolo pr\u00edjemn\u00e9.Od tohto roka mus\u00edte na z\u00e1klade smernice o platobn\u00fdch syst\u00e9moch otvori\u0165 pr\u00edstup do IT syst\u00e9mov aj tret\u00edm stran\u00e1m, ktor\u00e9 z\u00edskaj\u00fa po s\u00fahlase klienta mo\u017enos\u0165 namiesto v\u00e1s realizova\u0165 platby. \u010co to znamen\u00e1 pre v\u00e1s a trh?Je to ve\u013emi zauj\u00edmav\u00e1 situ\u00e1cia a aj preto sa sna\u017e\u00edme osta\u0165 pre klientov v\u00fdznamn\u00fdm partnerom. Oblas\u0165 platieb sa otvor\u00ed pre mno\u017estvo konkurentov. V minulosti sa platby sp\u00e1jali absol\u00fatne len s bankami. PayPal napr\u00edklad vyvinuli len pred dek\u00e1dou. Ak sa pozriete na trh fintechov v Eur\u00f3pe, okolo 60 percent invest\u00edci\u00ed smerovalo pr\u00e1ve do platobn\u00fdch syst\u00e9mov. Ka\u017ed\u00fd vedel, \u017ee prich\u00e1dza t\u00e1to zmena od regul\u00e1tora, a je ve\u013emi zauj\u00edmav\u00e9 z\u00edska\u0165 \u00fadaje o va\u0161om bankovom \u00fa\u010dte. Google u\u017e teraz mal ve\u013emi dobr\u00fd preh\u013ead o inform\u00e1ci\u00e1ch, ktor\u00e9 h\u013ead\u00e1te. Ale nevedel norm\u00e1lne, kam odch\u00e1dzaj\u00fa va\u0161e peniaze. No spolu s Facebookom vybudovali ekosyst\u00e9m, kde m\u00f4\u017eu tieto inform\u00e1cie spe\u0148a\u017ei\u0165. Ak sa pozriete na trhov\u00e9 pokrytie Googlu, Facebooku a b\u00e1nk, je to obrovsk\u00fd rozdiel. A rozdiel je aj v tom, \u017ee banka nikdy nepred\u00e1 inform\u00e1cie o v\u00e1s. Ja ich m\u00f4\u017eem zbiera\u0165, aby som v\u00e1m potom vyhodnotil finan\u010dn\u00fa situ\u00e1ciu. Pomohol v\u00e1m, ak sa rozhodnete nie\u010do urobi\u0165. Ale nem\u00f4\u017eem ich preda\u0165 \u017eiadnej inej spolo\u010dnosti. A ver\u00edm, \u017ee toto bude pre n\u00e1s nakoniec v\u00fdhoda. Preto\u017ee ochota spr\u00edstupni\u0165 inform\u00e1cie o sebe sa ve\u013emi l\u00ed\u0161i. Kontinent\u00e1lna Eur\u00f3pa bola v\u017edy konzervat\u00edvnej\u0161ia v zdie\u013ean\u00ed inform\u00e1ci\u00ed ako napr\u00edklad USA \u010di Spojen\u00e9 kr\u00e1\u013eovstvo. K tomu r\u00f4zne data leaks, odcudzenie d\u00e1t ako ned\u00e1vno Uber \u2013 uniklo 57 mili\u00f3nov kontaktn\u00fdch inform\u00e1ci\u00ed o klientoch. Yahoo \u2013 niekto prenikol k 450 mili\u00f3nom e-mailov\u00fdch adries. Nikto nechce, aby sa hocikto dostal k jeho kontaktn\u00fdm \u00fadajom.Ale aj oni maj\u00fa nieko\u013eko\u00farov\u0148ov\u00fa bezpe\u010dnos\u0165, nie s\u00fa v tomto porovnate\u013en\u00e9 s bankami?Vid\u00edm tam rozdiely.

The company is using AI technologies such as Amazon.com's Alexa for voice-enabled online banking and biometrics for customers to log into the mobile banking app,\" the paper says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have to strike a right balance between operating within a regulated bank, and bringing in innovation,\" Muthukrishnan told the paper. \"He wants to improve the user experience in its digital platforms and personalize financial tools for customers.\"</p><p>UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti has lowered the bank's financial targets, making them easier to clear for himself, \"and the four board members vying to replace\" him. On Tuesday Ermotti, who \"has been in post since 2011 and is expected to retire before the end of 2022,\" cut the bank's financial targets and dividend and buyback plans over the next three years.</p><p>\"Beating his targets would be a nice send-off. This seemsachievable at the reduced level- and with ambitious potential successors keen to prove their skills,\" the paper said. \"While an external candidate is always possible, investors should keep an eye on the internal race to beat the bank's targets. It won't just determine the stock performance, but will also provide interesting insight into who might lead the bank next.\"</p><p>Financial TimesNot their job</p><p>The heads of major international banks and financial companies \"rejected suggestions that they are not doing enough to combat climate change and resisted calls that they should refuse to work with clients that are major polluters.\" Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos Tuesday, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat \"said it was not the job of banks to ensure that companies were adopting environmentally friendly business models by unilaterally cutting off finance for polluting businesses.\"</p><p>\"I don't want to be the sharp end of the spear, meaning I don't want to have to be the one telling companies or enforcing standards in an industry or business,\" he said.</p><p>\"Should we not raise money for a company that is a carbon company or a fossil fuel company?\" Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon asked. \"The answer is no, we're not going to stop doing that.

We will continue to monitor the development of the Libra Association and do not rule out the possibility of future co-operation.\"</p><p>Mark Bailie, the head of Royal Bank of Scotland's newly launched digital unit B\u00f3, is planning to leave the bank later this year, the paper reports. Bailie \"had been one of theleading internal candidatesto succeed Ross McEwan, who resigned as chief executive last year. However, he was beaten to the post by Alison Rose, who became the first woman to lead one of the U.K.'s big four high street lenders.\" His departure \"comes less than two months after the formal launch of B\u00f3, the digital banking project that he had worked on for the past two years.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Monese, a U.K.-based startup digital bank, \"is in talks to raise \u00a3100 million from investors in a deal that is expected to make it the latest British technology unicorn.\" The company, which provides an app-based bank checking account to consumers and businesses, \"has differentiated itself from rivals by targetingpeople who struggle to access traditional banks, such as recent immigrants who do not have local credit histories.\" The company, which was founded in 2013, doubled the number of customers to two million in the second half of last year and is aiming to hit five million by the end of this year.</p><p>The risks to global banks have lessened somewhat due to more stringent capital rules, but \"there arenew threats on the horizon. They include a surge in loans to highly indebted companies that could quickly fall into difficulty in the event of a recession and struggle to make their repayments.\" A session at the World Economic Forum explores the question, \"With cheap money keeping fragile companies on life support, will a recession cause a reckoning in corporate debt?\"</p><p>ElsewherePapa's got a brand new bag</p><p>Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, \"who spins electronic dance music under the moniker DJ D-Sol, will be featured at a Sports Illustrated partytied to the NFL's Super Bowl,\" Bloomberg reports.</p><p>Quotable</p><p>\"A bank's job is to support the communities in which it operates.

The company is using AI technologies such as Amazon.com's Alexa for voice-enabled online banking and biometrics for customers to log into the mobile banking app,\" the paper says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have to strike a right balance between operating within a regulated bank, and bringing in innovation,\" Muthukrishnan told the paper. \"He wants to improve the user experience in its digital platforms and personalize financial tools for customers.\"</p><p>UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti has lowered the bank's financial targets, making them easier to clear for himself, \"and the four board members vying to replace\" him. On Tuesday Ermotti, who \"has been in post since 2011 and is expected to retire before the end of 2022,\" cut the bank's financial targets and dividend and buyback plans over the next three years.</p><p>\"Beating his targets would be a nice send-off. This seemsachievable at the reduced level- and with ambitious potential successors keen to prove their skills,\" the paper said. \"While an external candidate is always possible, investors should keep an eye on the internal race to beat the bank's targets. It won't just determine the stock performance, but will also provide interesting insight into who might lead the bank next.\"</p><p>Financial TimesNot their job</p><p>The heads of major international banks and financial companies \"rejected suggestions that they are not doing enough to combat climate change and resisted calls that they should refuse to work with clients that are major polluters.\" Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos Tuesday, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat \"said it was not the job of banks to ensure that companies were adopting environmentally friendly business models by unilaterally cutting off finance for polluting businesses.\"</p><p>\"I don't want to be the sharp end of the spear, meaning I don't want to have to be the one telling companies or enforcing standards in an industry or business,\" he said.</p><p>\"Should we not raise money for a company that is a carbon company or a fossil fuel company?\" Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon asked. \"The answer is no, we're not going to stop doing that. There's a transition that's going on, and my view is this isgoing to be a multi-decade transitionwhere we see changes in the way people allocate capital.\"</p><p>Vodafone, the U.K.-based phone company, has \"became the latest big tech company toabandon the controversial Libra project, inflicting a fresh blow to the Facebook-led digital currency initiative.\" The firm is the eighth company \"to pull out of the ambitious project, which has faced intense scrutiny from global regulators and politicians over concerns it could facilitate money laundering and hurt financial stability.\" Vodafone said it would \"instead redirect its efforts towards its own mobile money payments service, M-Pesa,\" the paper reports.</p><p>\"We have said from the outset that Vodafone's desire is to make a genuine contribution to extending financial inclusion,\" a spokesperson told the paper. \"We remain fully committed to that goal and feel that we can make the most contribution by focusing our efforts on M-Pesa. We will continue to monitor the development of the Libra Association and do not rule out the possibility of future co-operation.\"</p><p>Mark Bailie, the head of Royal Bank of Scotland's newly launched digital unit B\u00f3, is planning to leave the bank later this year, the paper reports. Bailie \"had been one of theleading internal candidatesto succeed Ross McEwan, who resigned as chief executive last year. However, he was beaten to the post by Alison Rose, who became the first woman to lead one of the U.K.'s big four high street lenders.\" His departure \"comes less than two months after the formal launch of B\u00f3, the digital banking project that he had worked on for the past two years.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Monese, a U.K.-based startup digital bank, \"is in talks to raise \u00a3100 million from investors in a deal that is expected to make it the latest British technology unicorn.\" The company, which provides an app-based bank checking account to consumers and businesses, \"has differentiated itself from rivals by targetingpeople who struggle to access traditional banks, such as recent immigrants who do not have local credit histories.\" The company, which was founded in 2013, doubled the number of customers to two million in the second half of last year and is aiming to hit five million by the end of this year.</p><p>The risks to global banks have lessened somewhat due to more stringent capital rules, but \"there arenew threats on the horizon. They include a surge in loans to highly indebted companies that could quickly fall into difficulty in the event of a recession and struggle to make their repayments.\" A session at the World Economic Forum explores the question, \"With cheap money keeping fragile companies on life support, will a recession cause a reckoning in corporate debt?\"</p><p>ElsewherePapa's got a brand new bag</p><p>Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, \"who spins electronic dance music under the moniker DJ D-Sol, will be featured at a Sports Illustrated partytied to the NFL's Super Bowl,\" Bloomberg reports.</p><p>Quotable</p><p>\"A bank's job is to support the communities in which it operates.

In einer Studie, welche die Auswirkungen digitaler W\u00e4hrungen wie der hochumstrittenen, von Facebook geplanten Libra auf das Bankensystem thematisiert, halten die Autoren das vom Internationalen W\u00e4hrungsfonds (IWF) skizzierte Szenario der Koexistenz am ehesten f\u00fcr plausibel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dass Anbieter elektronischen Geldes im direkten Wettbewerb um Zahlungssysteme und Einlagen st\u00fcnden, werde f\u00fcr die traditionellen Institute schmerzhaft sein, aber weitgehend verkraftbar, sch\u00e4tzt die LBBW. Eine starke Position hat sich zum Beispiel Alipay, der Bezahldienst des chinesischen Onlinehandelkonzerns Alibaba, erarbeitet, sowie der Internetkonzern Tencent, der per Wechat Bezahlfunktionen anbietet. Kreditinstitute verf\u00fcgten \u00fcber die bessere Marktposition und seien in der Lage, sich anzupassen und mit den neuen Mitbewerbern mitzuhalten, etwa \u00fcber Zinsen. Die sind n\u00e4mlich f\u00fcr Libra nicht geplant. Gleichwohl h\u00e4tten Banken unter anderem mit dem Verlust von Retailkunden und Einlagen zu k\u00e4mpfen, was mit h\u00f6heren Kosten und Volatilit\u00e4t bei der Refinanzierung einhergehen k\u00f6nnte.</p><p>Die ohnehin angespannte Lage der Kreditwirtschaft w\u00fcrde dies weiter versch\u00e4rfen, w\u00e4re aber im Vergleich mit den - wenn auch als weniger realistisch erachteten - Alternativen noch komfortabel. Denn im zweiten Fall k\u00f6nnten Banken gezwungen sein, Big Techs wegen ihrer h\u00f6her entwickelten Datenanalysef\u00e4higkeit Bonit\u00e4tseinstufungen von potenziellen Kreditnehmern abzukaufen. Oder, schlimmer noch, die Techunternehmen b\u00f6ten Kredite gleich selbst an. Das dritte Szenario des IWF, das die LBBW als am unwahrscheinlichsten einsch\u00e4tzt, w\u00fcrde das Ende des Bankensektors bedeuten: seine \u00dcbernahme durch Big Techs.</p><p>Erfolg von Wechat und Alipay</p><p>Welches Szenario sich auch immer bewahrheitet, die von der Digitalisierung, sozialen Netzwerken sowie den hohen Anspr\u00fcchen an Konsum und Bequemlichkeit angesto\u00dfenen Effekte, die zum Aufkommen digitaler W\u00e4hrungen f\u00fchrten, seien irreversibel, befinden die Studienautoren. Das zeige der Aufstieg der chinesischen Anbieter: Der Erfolg der integrierten Bezahlsysteme in den Social-Media-Angeboten sollte Banken auch in Europa zu denken geben, wie die Autoren schreiben. Trotz der Existenz staatlich gesch\u00fctzter und gef\u00f6rderter Banken laufe mittlerweile der gesamte Zahlungsverkehr von Privatleuten und Kleinunternehmen in China \u00fcber diese Systeme.</p><p>Auf die sch\u00fctzende Hand durch die Regulierer k\u00f6nne die Finanzbranche nicht mehr hoffen, glaubt die LBBW. Arbeitspapieren der Bank f\u00fcr Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich (BIZ) nach zu urteilen gingen diese \"im Zweifel eher davon aus, dass die Big-Tech-Firmen dann zu regulierten Finanzinstituten mutieren\", hei\u00dft es. Regulatorische Weichenstellungen wie die Zahlungsdiensterichtlinie PSD2, die Kontoinformations- und Zahlungsausl\u00f6sediensten Zugang zum Bankkonto \u00fcber definierte Schnittstellen verschafft, wenn der Kunde dem zustimmt, beschleunigten die Marktver\u00e4nderungen noch.</p><p>Die Autoren weisen auf die Gefahr von Fehleinsch\u00e4tzungen durch etablierter Akteure hin: \"Wir wollen davor warnen, die Geschwindigkeit, die hohe Bedeutung von Vernetzung und bequeme Handhabung (,Convenience') auch im Zahlungsverkehr zu untersch\u00e4tzen und die Bedeutung des Datenschutzes f\u00fcr Nutzer in au\u00dfereurop\u00e4ischen L\u00e4ndern zu \u00fcbersch\u00e4tzen.\"</p><p>Kontaktloses Bezahlen mit Karte und Smartphone werde weiter an Bedeutung gewinnen, die Verbreitung von Smartphones zu ver\u00e4nderten Einkaufsgewohnheiten und neuen Bezahlmethoden f\u00fchren. Die Akzeptanz von elektronischem Geld werde zunehmen, weil Big Techs in besonderem Ma\u00dfe von Netzwerkeffekten profitierten: Daten verhei\u00dfen mehr Nutzen, je mehr Daten hinzukommen und verkn\u00fcpft werden k\u00f6nnen. So wachsen die Zahlen der Nutzer von Wechat, Alipay und Facebook seit Jahren kontinuierlich (siehe Grafik). Die LBBW h\u00e4lt es gar f\u00fcr denkbar, dass Nutzer privaten Anbietern mehr Vertrauen entgegenbringen als Zentralbanken einzelner L\u00e4nder.</p><p>Sparen \u00fcber Facebook-Geld</p><p>In einer weiteren Analyse skizziert die DZ Bank vier Verwendungsm\u00f6glichkeiten von Libra, deren Effekte umso st\u00e4rker ausfallen w\u00fcrden, je weiter die Digitalw\u00e4hrung \u00fcber die Nutzung als reines Transaktionsinstrument hinausginge. In der engsten Variante beschr\u00e4nkte sich Libra auf die T\u00e4tigkeit als Krypto-Zahlungsdienstleister, \u00fcber den binnen Sekunden Geld in alle Welt verschickt werden k\u00f6nnen soll. Damit w\u00e4re Libra ein Wettbewerber von vielen. Eine zweite M\u00f6glichkeit w\u00e4re der Analyse zufolge, dass Libra als Wertaufbewahrungsmittel genutzt wird: \"Gerade f\u00fcr Menschen, die sich mit einer schwachen nationalen W\u00e4hrung konfrontiert sehen, k\u00f6nnte es dar\u00fcber hinaus attraktiv sein, Libra aus Gr\u00fcnden der Wertaufbewahrung zu halten.\" Voraussetzung daf\u00fcr w\u00e4re, dass Libra als stabil betrachtet wird und Wechselgeb\u00fchren gering ausfallen, wie der Bericht festh\u00e4lt.</p><p>Setzte sich Libra als allt\u00e4gliches Zahlungsmittel durch, etwa beim B\u00e4cker, im Supermarkt und Taxi, k\u00f6nnte drittens die eigene W\u00e4hrung mehr und mehr ersetzt werden - insbesondere dann, wenn die Lohn- und Preissetzung auf Libra-Basis erfolgt. Damit verl\u00f6re die Zentralbank an Schlagkraft, weil ihr die Geldmengensteuerung entgleiten w\u00fcrde. \"Schlie\u00dflich hat die Zentralbank lediglich Einfluss auf das Geldangebot der zugeh\u00f6rigen W\u00e4hrung, nicht aber \u00fcber den Umfang der in der Volkswirtschaft umlaufenden Libra.\"</p><p>Altw\u00e4hrung \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig</p><p>Im weitreichendsten, vierten Fall entwickelt sich Libra zu einem \"neuen \u00d6kosystem\" im Finanzdienstleistungsbereich. Die DZ Bank sieht das als von den Initiatoren durchaus angepeiltes und im Libra-Wei\u00dfbuch festgehaltenes Ziel, ein vollumf\u00e4ngliches Geld- und Finanzsystem zu schaffen. \"Im Extremfall w\u00fcrden Zentralbanken irrelevant und die eigene Landesw\u00e4hrung g\u00e4nzlich \u00fcberfl\u00fcssig. In einer Finanzkrise st\u00fcnde dann kein (heimischer) ,Lender of Last Resort` mehr zur Verf\u00fcgung, der die Banken und Finanzinstitute mit frischer Liquidit\u00e4t versorgen k\u00f6nnte\", gibt der Studienverfasser zu bedenken.</p><p>Auch treibt ihn die Frage um, was im Falle einer Libra-Krise passieren w\u00fcrde, die etwa durch den Ausfall eines wichtigen Mitglieds der Libra Association oder eines Datenskandals ausgel\u00f6st werden k\u00f6nnte. Obwohl Libra als Stable Coin ausgelegt ist, der an einen W\u00e4hrungskorb gekoppelt und \u00fcber einen Reservefonds, bestehend aus Bankeinlagen und kurzlaufenden Staatsanleihen, abgesichert sein soll, bestehe keine Garantie f\u00fcr einen stabilen Kurs. K\u00f6nnten bei traditionellen W\u00e4hrungen Notenbanken eingreifen, so sei das bei Libra nicht m\u00f6glich.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"67870801\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14219\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"67870802\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14219\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link zum PDF-Dokument</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2019209022\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14219\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BORZTG-2019209022</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BORZTG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XD2-HWP1-DY1C-70R9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253914</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1116\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Herausgebergemeinschaft Wertpapier-Mitteilungen Keppler, Lehmann GmbH &amp; Co.

Diese Bedenken sind sicherlich berechtigt, denn j\u00fcngste Entwicklungen haben dazu gef\u00fchrt, dass die Tagesordnung der Banken zunehmend von den Anforderungen anderer gelenkt wird.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Banken mussten oftmals die von anderen getriebenen Ver\u00e4nderungen umsetzen - unter gro\u00dfem Zeitdruck und mit hohen Kosten. Beispiele daf\u00fcr sind die Vorgaben der Regulierungsbeh\u00f6rden (PSD 2, Sepa) und des Handels (paneurop\u00e4ische L\u00f6sungen) sowie die Einf\u00fchrung neuer Technologien und die Herausforderung durch neue Wettbewerber (Fintech, Challenger Banks, Big Tech) im Zahlungssektor. Banken klagen oft \u00fcber die M\u00fche, Schritt zu halten. Vielleicht w\u00e4re es f\u00fcr Kunden und die Banken selbst daher hilfreich, die Agenda wieder mehr selber zu steuern und vorw\u00e4rts zu treiben. Damit w\u00e4ren Banken weniger getrieben, und Kundenl\u00f6sungen w\u00fcrden schneller auf den Markt kommen.</p><p>Nur beobachten reicht nicht</p><p>Viele Banken beobachten neue Entwicklungen und \u00fcbernehmen bewusst ausgew\u00e4hlte Ver\u00e4nderungen, die auf die Bed\u00fcrfnisse des Marktes reagieren und zu ihrer Strategie passen. Dies ist ein guter erster Schritt, er ist jedoch noch weit davon entfernt, auf diesem Weg \"die Kontrolle zur\u00fcckzugewinnen\", da dies die Branche nicht ausreichend pr\u00e4gt und formt. Dieses Agieren entspricht mehr der Rolle eines Mitl\u00e4ufers, bestenfalls einem freiwilligen Engagement, als der Rolle eines Vorreiters und Gestalters. Die auf diesem Wege identifizierten Themen werden in der Regel eher von einzelnen Banken oder Bankengruppen (zum Beispiel als regionale L\u00f6sung) aufgegriffen. Daher gibt es eine Fragmentierung der Branche, und es entwickelt sich keine gemeinsame Initiative.</p><p>Besser w\u00e4re es, die Entwicklungen gemeinsam mit den anderen Akteuren des Zahlungssektors aktiv und zeitnah zu gestalten. Allerdings ist dies f\u00fcr einzelne Banken mit begrenzten Ressourcen nicht immer einfach, und f\u00fcr Bankengruppen kann es aus Wettbewerbsgr\u00fcnden schwierig sein. F\u00fcr eine ganze Branche ist es bedeutend schwerer, sich gemeinsam zu bewegen, da sich viele Akteure miteinander abstimmen m\u00fcssen.</p><p>Um es mit einer Metapher zu sagen: Banken werden nie von der Schildkr\u00f6te zum Hasen werden - und das sollten sie auch nicht. Denn: Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit, Stabilit\u00e4t und Compliance sind ein wesentlicher Vorteil der Banken gegen\u00fcber den anderen Marktteilnehmern. Aber es w\u00e4re zu \u00fcberlegen, ob man die Initiative durch intelligente Ans\u00e4tze zur\u00fcckgewinnen k\u00f6nnte und weniger den Entwicklungen hinterherlaufen m\u00fcsste.</p><p>Dies erfordert einen strategischen Ansatz, der es schafft, potenziell gr\u00f6\u00dfere zuk\u00fcnftige Gewinne und strategische Positionen mit den aktuellen Unsicherheiten und m\u00f6glicherweise sogar anf\u00e4nglichen Verlusten in Einklang zu bringen. Es ist wichtig, das Gesamtbild zu betrachten, denn bei einer echten unternehmerischen F\u00fchrung geht es darum, Entscheidungen zu treffen, ohne alle Fakten - zum Beispiel, ob es einen kurzfristigen Business Case geben und worauf er basieren wird - zu kennen, und ohne die 100-prozentige Garantie, die richtige Wahl zu treffen.</p><p>Banken haben in der Vergangenheit gezeigt, dass dies m\u00f6glich ist. Ein Beispiel ist iDeal, vor mehr als zehn Jahren von niederl\u00e4ndischen Banken gegr\u00fcndet. iDeal ist eine erstklassige L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr Online-Zahlungen, die sich bis heute gegen alle Wettbewerber durchgesetzt hat und erstaunliche Wachstumsraten aufweist. \u00dcberdies sahen skandinavische Banken die Notwendigkeit und M\u00f6glichkeit, f\u00fchrende L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr bankbasierte Identit\u00e4t (BankID) und mobile L\u00f6sungen (Swish) zu entwickeln. Ebenjene Entwicklungen haben unter anderem daf\u00fcr gesorgt, dass Kundenbeziehungen, Daten und Gewinne auch weiter bei den Banken liegen.</p><p>Die Kontrolle zur\u00fcckerobern</p><p>Die Frage ist, wie ein solcher neuer, proaktiver Ansatz in der Praxis funktionieren k\u00f6nnte. Die folgenden Schritte bilden einen Anfang:</p><p>1. Diagnose</p><p>Ein erster Schritt ist eine offene Diskussion innerhalb der wichtigsten Bankengemeinschaften. Dabei sollte diskutiert werden, wie Banken durch eine proaktive Strategie, die neue und zuk\u00fcnftige Entwicklungen beinhaltet, die Kontrolle wiedererlangen k\u00f6nnen, bevor jemand sie in eine bestimmte Richtung dr\u00e4ngt. Au\u00dferdem w\u00e4re es sinnvoll, eine \"Koalition von Willigen\" aufzustellen, die alle dazu bereit sind, die weiteren Entwicklungen tatkr\u00e4ftig mitzugestalten.</p><p>2. Strategie</p><p>Als n\u00e4chsten Schritt sollten Banken eine gemeinsame Initiative aller Bankengruppen ins Leben rufen, um die aktuell anstehenden Zukunftsvisionen zu untersuchen und den Sektor gemeinschaftlich voranzubringen. Der neue Ansatz sollte beispielsweise auf aktuellen Entwicklungen wie Open Banking und Instant Payment aufbauen, denn dies sind Themen, bei denen Europa weltweit f\u00fchrend ist. Nat\u00fcrlich wird es zwischen den Gemeinschaften und unter Banken unterschiedliche Auffassungen dar\u00fcber geben, wie es diesbez\u00fcglich weitergeht, aber es ist unbedingt notwendig, lokale und individuelle Interessen zum Wohle des gesamten Sektors und Europas beiseitezulegen.</p><p>3. Umsetzung</p><p>Wenn der Wille zu mutigem Handeln vorhanden ist, sollten die Ergebnisse dieses gemeinsamen Ansatzes selbstbewusst mit Regulierungsbeh\u00f6rden diskutiert werden. Wenn die Regulierungsbeh\u00f6rden sehen, dass die Banken schneller Ver\u00e4nderungen vornehmen, werden sie weniger Anreiz haben, eine pr\u00e4ventive Regulierung zu entwickeln oder gegen das vorzugehen, was sie als (bevorstehendes) Marktversagen ansehen. Regulatoren k\u00f6nnen den Prozess noch st\u00e4rker moderieren und einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Anteil an der Probleml\u00f6sung haben. Es gewinnen alle - insbesondere Kunden und die Banken selbst.</p><p>----</p><p>Michael Salmony, Executive Adviser to the Board des Zahlungsabwicklers Equensworldline</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Link zum PDF-Dokument</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2019150023\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14219\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BORZTG-2019150023</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BORZTG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS4-WB01-JBJ9-H563-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253914</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"952\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Herausgebergemeinschaft Wertpapier-Mitteilungen Keppler, Lehmann GmbH &amp; Co.

Executives and employees at the nation\u2019s biggest banks are giving a boost to former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign for the White House, despite economic policies under President Donald Trump that produced record profits for the industry.    Contributions from individuals affiliated with the six largest lenders total $907,216 for Biden and $293,434 for Trump, according to a POLITICO review of campaign finance data. Biden has a significant fundraising advantage at every one of the banks \u2014 JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.      Their preference for the former vice president comes even as Trump's administration has delivered in a significant way for the banks \u2014 making them among the main beneficiaries of his 40 percent cut in the corporate tax rate and easing Obama-era regulations. Biden has pledged to repeal some of those tax cuts and impose new fees on large financial institutions.     But in an era of growing social and racial unrest, as well as income inequality, many bankers are voting beyond their wallets in the belief that Trump is stoking those divisions, industry experts say. Many in the industry are embracing Biden\u2019s approaches to racial equity, foreign affairs and other areas where his tone is more aligned with the leaders of global financial institutions.    \"These contributions speak to the deep unease Democrats and many independents have with national policy on personal priorities such as equality, civility and constitutionality,\" said Federal Financial Analytics managing partner Karen Petrou, who advises bank executives on policy. The bankers, she said, are \"expressing themselves as well as their company\u2019s priorities when they make contributions.\"       To be sure, Biden is also a known entity to Wall Street and benefits from his longtime closeness to the financial industry. While representing Delaware in the Senate, he supported bankruptcy legislation that made it harder for consumers to escape credit card debt. More recently, he attracted controversy for telling wealthy donors at a 2019 fundraiser that \"no one's standard of living will change, nothing would fundamentally change\" for them.    And employees at the megabanks also showed a preference for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016 \u2014 she outraised him by more than 10 to 1 among these same companies. But they put their money behind Republican Mitt Romney when he ran against President Barack Obama and Biden in 2012.    The figures, aggregated by the Center for Responsive Politics, cover not only high-profile executives but also other employees at the sprawling, international corporations. They underscore a view in the banking industry that Biden would govern as a moderate despite the influence of Wall Street watchdogs like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).    The contributions analyzed for this story came from individual donors at the banks and were not directed by the companies themselves, which operate separate political action committees that help fund congressional campaigns.    The wave of contributions has emerged as Biden, who will accept the Democratic presidential nomination during the party's convention next week, takes the lead over Trump in national and battleground state polls.    Trump campaign spokesperson Samantha Zager said the president is counting on ordinary voters to win reelection.    \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s campaign is powered by everyday Americans who have benefited from his bold leadership,\" she said. \"Joe Biden has Big Tech, Big Pharma, and Big Banks in his pocket, and the Trump campaign still outraised him in July \u2014 not to mention we have real voter enthusiasm in our corner. President Trump will continue to prioritize hardworking Americans while Joe Biden looks out for himself.\u201d    Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs at FreedomWorks, a conservative group, had another explanation for Biden's popularity with bankers: \"It's no secret that big businesses, including big financial institutions, tend to benefit from big government policies. They're able to insulate themselves from regulation to some degree because they can afford the cost of compliance that leaves smaller institutions out in the cold.\"    Several senior leaders at the big banks have contributed money to Biden\u2019s campaign, including Goldman Sachs CFO Stephen Scherr and JPMorgan general counsel Stacey Friedman. Goldman Sachs Japan Vice Chair Kathy Matsui contributed $54,600 to the Biden Victory Fund, Biden's joint fundraising operation with the Democratic National Committee. Morgan Stanley Vice Chair Thomas Nides and Wells Fargo Vice Chairman of Public Affairs Bill Daley \u2014 both former Obama administration officials \u2014 have also contributed to Biden's campaign.    While Biden has shied away from demonizing Wall Street like Warren and some other Democrats, he has pledged to raise taxes on large financial institutions and other corporations after Trump slashed the rate to 21 percent from 35 percent in 2017, helping deliver a 44 percent surge in banking industry profits in 2018. That\u2019s the top concern of bank lobbyists who are starting to game out how Washington would approach the industry if Democrats take back power.    Yet Paul Thornell, former managing director for federal government affairs at Citigroup, said banking executives aren\u2019t just focused on things like tax policy when it comes to showing their support for a candidate.    \u201cThey\u2019re looking at character and how these two conduct themselves as leaders,\u201d said Thornell, now a principal at government relations firm Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen &amp; Thomas. \u201cThey\u2019re looking at the issues that Trump has decided to align himself with versus the issues they think Biden would give voice to, which are probably more in line with where they are personally, the brand and reputation of their firms and the issues their employees care about.\u201d     Still, any perceived coziness between Biden and bankers is a potential political problem as the former vice president faces pressure from progressives to crack down on big business. One Biden official said teachers are the top profession that donates to his campaign.    \"Wall Street bankers and hedge fund managers didn't build this country \u2014 the American middle class did,\" Biden spokesperson Andrew Bates said. \"Donald Trump has turned his back on families struggling to get by throughout his presidency, passing a multitrillion-dollar tax giveaway to the wealthy and plunging manufacturing into a recession while creating new incentives for outsourcing American jobs \u2014 whereas Joe Biden is running to ensure that our economy rewards work, not just wealth, which is why his campaign is powered by small, grassroots donations.\"    Indeed, a Biden administration will likely pursue stricter banking regulation than has Trump, though it's not expected to be the kind of sea change that occurred under Obama. At that time, the global economy was reeling from a financial crisis created by Wall Street, and Democrats responded by overhauling bank regulation with the landmark 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.    Now, bank lobbyists say the Biden campaign\u2019s recent economic proposals, including those released in partnership with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), haven\u2019t been that surprising or threatening.    Bank representatives see lots of issues where they can have constructive conversations with Democrats. They include responding to climate change, improving corporate diversity and supporting small business.    Big banks have also joined the fight against Big Tech by lobbying to stop technology companies from obtaining bank charters. Lobbyists expect Democrats to put more pressure on private equity firms than big banks, which were public enemy No. 1 when Biden became vice president in 2009.    The dynamic was on display last month when Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) \u2014 who proposed breaking up the banks after the 2008 crisis \u2014 spoke on a Goldman Sachs-hosted Zoom call commemorating the graduation of entrepreneurs from the company's \u201c10,000 Small Businesses\u201d program. Brown, who would likely chair the Senate Banking Committee if Democrats won back the Senate, appeared with Goldman CEO David Solomon.    Brown scolded Solomon for stock buybacks the bank pursued thanks to the Trump tax cuts but he also praised the bank\u2019s small business efforts in Ohio.    \u201cI hope you\u2019ll follow up with a commitment to invest more of your, I would say, immense resources in the real economy and communities that often get overlooked by Wall Street,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis is an example of Goldman doing that.\u201d    Capital Alpha Partners director Ian Katz said there are competing forces at play when it comes to how the banking industry views Biden. Biden and his regulators would generally favor tighter regulation. But Trump has been harder for banks to predict because of his populist tendencies.    \u201cThere's also the possibility that while bankers prefer Trump on matters affecting their industry, they may prefer Biden on most other things,\u201d Katz said. \u201cIf that's the case, they could lean toward Biden because they prefer him on most matters, and while he may be less friendly than Trump is to banks, they don't think he'll be dangerously unfriendly. So when they take everything into account, they may lean toward Biden.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Staying relevant in this sector runs against the short term cost control mantra prevalent in banking today.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bankers hate missing out on a deal boom. M&amp;A in the global technology sector has seen more than $185bn of deals announced so far this year, the most since before the global financial crisis. But at the same time, acquisitive companies are relying on investment banks for advice less and less. Data from Dealogic shows that 70% of deals above $100m in 2014 have been conducted without advisers, compared with 27% 10 years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While big investment banks have enjoyed a starting role in the big tech IPOs, when it comes to deal making, there are instances this year when they were hired to play a bit part \"\" either coming in after the deal had been negotiated, or being asked to give a fairness opinion. In some case, they missed out on the action altogether. Oracle did not use any banking advice when it acquired Microsystems in a $6.5bn deal in June, the biggest transaction not involving advisers since 2011, when Microsoft bought Skype from SilverLake Partners for $8bn.</p><p>At the same time, the sector is also embracing the broader trend of firms using boutique advisers. The investment banking industry stood up and really took note this year when Facebook paid $19bn for WhatsApp in a transaction that was agreed between the two companies' founders. Facebook used Allen &amp; Company and Morgan Stanleyadvised WhatsApp but sources close to the deal say that both banks were brought in at a late stage after the company founders had negotiated the deal. That followed Google's $3.4bn acquisition NestLabs, for which it used Lazard for a fairness opinion, but did the nuts and bolts of the negotiations and execution using its own team. Nestlabs did not use an adviser. Disintermediation?</p><p>This has led some to suggest that banks are being disintermediated as tech firms rely on their own personal relationships to source deals and their growing in-house teams to execute them.</p><p>It is certainly the case that the tight knit community in Silicon Valley means that many private deals are negotiated between founders, with no need to use investment banks. Also, it's true that technology M&amp;A is not a business every bank can be successful in. The bulk of technology M&amp;A is US-based, where a handful of top bankers hold the relationships. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanleyhave slugged it out for the last decade, trading bragging rights on the biggest IPO and merger deals. While Goldman was lead on the Twitter IPO, Morgan Stanleyled Facebook's listing.</p><p>Goldman and Morgan Stanleyare streets ahead in the league tables. Morgan Stanleyis currently top, having advised on 24 deals with a value of $34.2bn, while Goldman has worked on 28 deals with a value of $30bn, according to Dealogic. Their nearest bulge-bracket competitor is Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, which has advised on 20 global technology deals worth $17.6bn. JP Morgan is one of the few top firms investing in its global technology team after identifying the sector as a growth business.</p><p>It is no coincidence that both of the top firms also have the best advisory franchises, which counts for something even in the maverick world of Silicon Valley. Being able to advise companies on high level strategic issues is crucial, rather than chasing deals once they have been announced like a dog after a butcher's van. Last year, Goldman Sachs won a starring role on Apple's blockbuster bond sale, scooping more fees than any of the other bookrunners because it was advising the board of Apple on calls by shareholders for a share buyback. This was clearly not an M&amp;A transaction, but it required advice, and that is what Goldman and Morgan Stanleysell in their corporate finance businesses.</p><p>Allen &amp; Company, which is third in the global M&amp;A rankings for technology, decided a decade ago that it was going to move into technology, and the move has paid off, although the time scale shows the patience that is required. The Facebook-Whatsapp mandate counted for a big chunk of the year's ranking, but Allen has also worked on other recent prestige mandates such as the LinkedIn and Twitter IPOs. Picking winners</p><p>Firms who adopt a half-hearted attitude to M&amp;A, whether by not covering clients assiduously enough, or offering M&amp;A as a bolt-on service, will fail. For banks to remain relevant, they need to spot future winners, as well as covering existing large firms and big deals. Goldman and Morgan Stanleyhave spent time and resources covering the venture capital firms active in Silicon Valley, treating them as proper clients in the way many banks treat financial sponsors. In a sign of the importance Goldman attaches to this, a year ago it appointed Stuart Bernstein, one of its long standing partners, as head of its venture capital coverage group.</p><p>The particular challenge posed by global technology companies is that success means banks picking the winners of the future and that does not necessarily sit well with the new pragmatism at work in investment banks. With the cost of capital rising in the new regulatory environment, banks are being more ruthless in prioritising the clients they already serve \"\" those which use the most services and pay it the biggest fees \"\" and are losing the tail of unprofitable ones. They are not chasing new clients or launching new costly sector initiatives.</p><p>Banks may find their ability to pick early stage winners may be impaired as bankers will be less prepared to stick their neck out and wage the battle internally for a bank to back a new client which may not immediately be profitable. Like Goldman, Morgan Stanleyhas a strong track record in the sector. The bank was an early backer of Patrick Drahi, the founder and chairman of French telecoms group Altice, a bet that has resulted in a long-standing relationship. Boutique drift</p><p>Then there is the matter of senior staffers leaving big banks. Many of the world's top rainmakers made their name advising on big deals in the technology, media and telecoms sectors, and the current generational shift means that big banks are losing some of their most experienced bankers either to clients or boutiques.</p><p>Top Morgan Stanleybankers Paul Taubmann and Scott Matlock, who represented some of the bank's biggest clients in TMT, have set up their own boutique, while Altice hired Johannes Groeller and Emmanuel Gueroult from Morgan Stanley. Meanwhile, Facebook has lured staff away from Credit Suisse and Jefferies to work in its corporate development teams.</p><p>Earlier this year, Goldman reshuffled its tech team in anticipation of a rise in deal flow, moving Dan Dees, who had run the firm's Asian investment banking business, forging relationships with Alibaba, to co-head the global TMT group in San Francisco with Anthony Noto. The timing turned out to be fortuitous because a few months later Noto, a senior partner who featured on the Twitter IPO, left the firm to join hedge fund Coatue Management LLC before being appointed CFO of Twitter in July.</p><p>In contrast with Silicon Valley, which is the centre of global technology and therefore the hub of the current M&amp;A boom, banks allocate fewer resources to Europe, and that means there is a smaller talent pool (and fewer deals to go around). Boutiques such as Qatalyst Partners and Alma Partners are grabbing a bigger share of small-cap deals, but they are also winning business higher up the food chain. For example France's Alcatel-Lucent uses Ondra Partners as its retained financial adviser. Alcatel's CEO Michel Combes knows Ondra Partners well, but the appointment is also further evidence of a dearth of tech-focused coverage efforts by big banks in Europe. Where are the deals?</p><p>This is perhaps no accident. Since the financial crisis, bank have become more adept at deploying resources to where they are most needed, and in Europe, the bulk of the M&amp;A action has taken place in the media and telecom sectors, where convergence has driven deal flow in the form of telecoms companies looking to provide media content and vice versa. While the outside world may perceive a bank has a weakness in technology, the bank itself will not be concerned as long as it is punching its weight in telecoms M&amp;A, for example.</p><p>This does not alter the fact that some banks will baulk at making the necessary investment to make them winners in technology M&amp;A, because it just looks like a lot of cost for very little reward. Outside of Morgan Stanleyand Goldman Sachs, the stars are thinly dispersed \"\" Philippe Cerf at Credit Suisse is highly regarded by clients, as is Jean Tardy-Joubert at Qatalyst. There has been little in the way of hiring, with some bankers leaving firms in frustration at a lack of deal opportunities. Last year Mark Fisher, who was co-head of technology at Jefferies, which has expanded its technology footprint, left to join boutique Quayle Munro because \"there simply weren't enough deals to go around,\" according to one source familiar with his plans. A maturing market</p><p>As the global technology sector has undergone a transformation, so too has the banking structure that supports it. Boutiques are on the rise, and some companies have the resources to handle more deals in-house. But as the industry moves towards the next phase of maturity it will embrace more banking products \"\" witness bond deals by Apple and the IPO of Facebook as milestones of corporate development. And the CEOs of these behemoths will gradually shed the mentality that led them to blaze a trail as they adopt a more considered view of dealmaking under pressure from public investors.</p><p>The Facebook acquisition of Whatsapp took the market by surprise, and was executed by a public company at an eye-watering valuation. Speaking on a panel at a bank conference earlier this year, Jeffrey Ubben, founder of activist investor ValueAct Capital, offered his opinion of the free-spending tech M&amp;A boom as \"just a bunch of 26 year olds throwing their money around and making their friends rich.\"</p><p>As tech tyros grow up in public they will rely more, not less on investment banks. Those betting on a long-term decline of big banks' tech practices are wide of the mark. Bankers say they expect more public deals featuring a full roster of advisers to be announced before year-end and that the proportion of non-advised tech deals will revert to the norm.</p><p>The specialist nature of the tech industry means that only those banks that can offer valuable advice and have the commitment to unearthing new industry winners will thrive. And that is as it should be. Banks will ignore this at their peril or the tech giants will take their business as well as their staff.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIAMO-mytpfh1r3pfy</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIAMO2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5F40-SKV1-JD35-2124-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1765\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global Capital Asiamoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"09\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>September 2014</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0009QBX</classCode><className>MORGAN STANLEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001TWF</classCode><className>MERRILL LYNCH &amp;

The level of competition and price discovery that we see today has its roots in 1994, when six banks in the private sector were licensed to operate: they are the major competitors of state-run banks today. Further, the Narasimham Committee of 1991 and 1998 and subsequent reform measures have changed the landscape of Indian banking.Some of these reforms include the lowering of the CRR and the SLR; framing of prudential norms for income recognition and asset classification; introduction of capital adequacy norms; deregulation of interest rates; strengthening of legal and institutional framework for speeding the process of recovery of debts; fostering competition by giving licences to new banks in the private sector; access to capital markets for banks; structural reorganisation in the banking sector; strengthening banking supervision; and regulatory oversight of banks.The Indian financial sector is dominated by banks. </p><p>For a growing economy like India, there is a huge requirement of credit in almost all the sectors. To meet the financing needs of the economy, Indian banking needs to be healthy and robust. The continuous disintermediation effort by the government has boosted the growth of non-bank channels (including corporate bond market and capital markets) to meet the partial funding requirement of corporates.Credit penetration (Credit-GDP ratio) of the banking sector has substantially increased to 51.42 per cent in 2017-18 from only 20.20 per cent in 1992-93. Similarly, deposit penetration by the banking sector (Deposit-GDP) has grown from 35.7 per cent in 1992-93 to 68.12 per cent in 2017-18. These statistics clearly portray the importance of the banking sector to the Indian economy.VulnerabilitiesIn the absence of any credible term lending institution, banks have taken up the onus of providing short-term as well as long-term funding to projects and industries. However, excessive reliance of the economy on the banking sector for long-term funding requirements has made it vulnerable to economic and geopolitical contagion. However, owing to tight regulatory and prudent measures, Indian banking proved resilient to the sub-prime crisis of 2007-08, but a prolonged economic slowdown and weak corporate balance sheets have clouded the Indian banking sector in the past few years.The introduction of niche banking and the entry of non-bank fintech and big-tech companies in the banking domain have further intensified competition in the sector. In the technological advancement process, Indian banking has worked to optimise customer experience. As a favourable demography will reshape the future of Indian banking, banks are already in the process of understanding the mindset of new millennial and Generation-Z customers who are less loyal and demand omni channel seamless service.The emergence of newer capabilities such as data analytics, cloud computing, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, cyber security, robotics, automation, NLP and language support, humanoids, holographic banking and robo-advisory, voice and chatbot are the new reality. To meet the banking and non-banking requirements of these young customers, SBI has launched the country's first integrated lifestyle and banking digital platform 'YONO'. Other banks are also working on enhancing customer experience and customers' life cycle requirements are getting integrated with CRM applications.Challenges, opportunitiesOn the other hand, India is home to 11 per cent of globally unbanked adults. (According to the World Bank's, Global Findex Database 2017, among the 1.7 billion unbanked adults globally, 187 million are from India.) The role of Indian banking in driving the financial inclusion agenda of the government has been lauded in international forums. As on January 2, 2019, about 33.73 crore PMJDY accounts have been opened, and the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile) initiative of the government has been able to bring the mass unbanked into the financial services net. These newly boarded customers have opened up a plethora of opportunities for banks to expand their profitable retail business as these new customers deserve numerous other services from banks apart from opening bank accounts. To meet the requirements of this vast customer base, Indian banks need to equip themselves with the latest technology to serve the needs of those unbanked as well as under-banked segments.The consolidation of state-run banks has been one of the most discussed topics in the past two-and-a-half decades. Consolidation, by its very nature, is challenging. In the past, not all mergers and consolidations have been successful. Some of the important challenges in human resources, technology and regulatory fronts need to be properly evaluated in advance to avoid any pitfall for a successful consolidation going forward. The government has identified and is stabilising some of the weak state-run banks by resolving their bad-loans issue and adequately recapitalising them before embarking on a consolidation plan.The Indian banking regulator has been vigilant in maintaining the health of the sector. However, a prolonged economic slowdown has led to the twin balance-sheet problem as banking is no more an isolated sector. The banking sector has to constantly upgrade and re-orient itself to tide over the balance-sheet mismatch crisis. The introduction of the long-awaited Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) 2016 has facilitated faster resolution by offering a time-bound resolution through the NCLT. Going forward, prudent management and economic recovery are likely to bring cheer to the system.In these years, many positive developments have happened in relation to governance aspects of Indian banks. Effective corporate governance, so critical to the functioning of the banking sector and the economy as a whole, has shown remarkable and sustainable coming of age. We are entering an exciting and challenging phase of banking in India, and fortunately the major players and various stakeholders appear eminently ready for the challenge.The author is SBI Chairman </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-HIN1042561548637553282251762900173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HIN-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V95-MMD1-JCMN-Y29W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1047\"/><timeReceived>1:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Hindu Business Line</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 28, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>OTHERS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

That question is obviously different for the unbanked community in developing markets.\"</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/disappointing-rba-slam-big-banks-on-payments-20190613-p51xae\">Reserve Bank last week urged the banks to put more payments volume through the real-time payments system</url>, which the banks spent more than $1 billion to build, in part to protect them from disruptive forces including blockchain-based payments systems like the one being built by Facebook.</p><p>\"Australian consumers can access their bank accounts in real time through NPP,\" Mr White said. \"Such real-time payments have significant value to the underlying Australian economy because the receiver can use funds immediately, this is a value add of NPP compared to existing payment rails.\"</p><p>Mr Healy, NAB's chief customer officer of business and private banking, said all of the banks \"will be keeping a close eye on [Facebook] as it develops and will be watching to see if it emerges as a real threat and imposing proposition''.</p><p>\"Developments like this give us the opportunity to learn and also reinforce the need for us to continue innovating to provide our customers with the best experiences,\" he said.</p><p>Sources inside other major banks said the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/facebook-s-new-digital-currency-explained-20190618-p51yr4\">technology giant's technical white papers published on Tuesday night</url> were being closely scrutinised by internal strategy teams.</p><p>\"People are very aware of the threat of big tech platforms and have been more concerned about that than neobanks or P2P lenders,\" said one bank insider. \"We aren't sure they will be successful, but we have thought for a while that the platform companies like Amazon, Google or Facebook will be the ones that disrupt us - and here we are.</p><p>\"As a bank you don't want to lose control of payments.\"</p><p>Investment bank <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/22b-of-bank-revenue-at-risk-from-smartphone-wallets-morgan-stanley-20190529-p51sde\">Morgan Stanley said earlier this month that on top of the direct payment fees received by banks, payments influence $22 billion, or 20 per cent, of banking industry revenue and this is under threat</url> by the emergence of digital wallets on smartphones offered by global technology companies.</p><p>Another banker in one of the big four was more sanguine about the crypto-currency threat. \"It's too early to know what the impact of Libra will be. This could just be a clever way for Facebook to sell more on their platform. Clearly it will be watched, but we aren't sure it's a threat. Time will tell, but the announcement hasn't caused any tidal wave of response in here.\"</p><p>Banks' revenue from payments is already under pressure from caps to interchange fees, which are paid by merchants, and ongoing scrutiny of credit cards by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.</p><p>Morgan Stanley said if credit card interchange commissions and fees, and revenue from foreign exchange and merchant fees, were to fall by one-third, Commonwealth Bank's group revenue would fall 1 per cent, and profit would fall 2 per cent.</p><p>\"The success of Afterpay, Zip, PayPal and others demonstrates that the current regulatory settings are pushing innovation in payments outside the regular bank and credit card channels,\" Morgan Stanley said.</p><p>Rocky Scopelliti, a futurist who sits on the Australian Payments Council, described Facebook's entry into payments as \"an inevitable move, due to the role that social media is now playing throughout our lives\".</p><p>He said the rise of Chinese fintech giant Alibaba Group, which owns Ant Financial, \"shows what can happen when there is a diversification of service offerings across lifestyle processes. Millennials in China have shown the explosiveness of social media and payments coming together. There is a clearly a demographic appetite for the use of both services.</p><p>\"Facebook's move will be one of the first global micro-payment services that may emerge, although I think it will be harder for them to translate it to point of sale in a store, because infrastructure needs to change to enable that to happen.\"</p><p>Facebook said on Tuesday that Mastercard and Visa are foundation partners in the Libra Association because they are keen to support merchants using their infrastructure who want to accept payments in Libra.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520144793</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCG-14N1-DY19-C160-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><timeReceived>05:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Some collaborative efforts this past week appeared as a FinTech-FinTech partnership model: Contis and Currencycloud recently announced a tie-up to streamline cross-border payments, while eBay Australia and Zip have revealed their partnership to integrate buy now, financing for small- and medium-sized businesses using the online marketplace.   But when it comes to bank-FinTech collaboration, this week's initiatives are all about providing small businesses with an elevated view of their financial positions. Plus, one open banking startup landed seed funding for its payments application programming interface (API) technology. PYMNTS rounds up the latest additions to the B2B FinServ collaborative ecosystem below.   KeyBank Partners With Bill.com   Business payments FinTechBill.com struck a new banking partnership last week with KeyBank . Together, the companies are launching Key CashFlow, a small business cash flow management solution that KeyBank will offer to its SMB customers via online banking. The solution integrates with businesses' existing back-office accounting portals to obtain a holistic view of finances, with Bill.com providing the technology to integrate end-to-end payments functionality within the portal.   \"As we continue to collaborate with innovative financial applications companies across the country, such as Bill.com, we strive to make it easier for customers to get business done,\" said Megan Kakani , head of emerging products with KeyBank Enterprise Commercial Payments, with regards to the value of industry partnerships.   Metro Bank Taps Clear Books   In the U.K., Metro Bank secured a collaborative deal with Clear Books to introduce a new accounting solution for small- and medium-sized business customers. Available via Metro's online and mobile banking portals, the solution connects small businesses to a suite of tools that include invoice generation and financial reports.   \"We worked alongside Metro Bank to carefully design a customer experience that provided small businesses with access to Clear Books accounting tools through Metro Bank\u2019s online banking platforms,\" Clear Books CEO Ruth Fouracre said of the collaboration. \"This partnership provides users of both Clear Books and Metro Bank with great tools, a more aligned experience between the two products, and amazing discounts.\"   Open Payments Lands Seed Funding   Open banking startup Open Payments announced a $3.5 million seed funding round last week led by Industrifonden, while existing backers Brightly Ventures and Luminar Ventures also participated. The startup operates an API aggregation platform compliant with PSD2 regulators, enabling third-party platforms and businesses to link directly into bank accounts and other financial institutions. With the new funding, Open Payments said it plans to expand its team and broaden its market presence across the Nordic and European regions.   In a statement announcing the funding, the firm's founder and CEO Jonas Kjellin said that collaboration will be key for the future of financial services: Big Tech firms \"will have a big impact on how we perform financial services in the future, but also requires traditional FinTechs, and by bridging the gap between them, we have a great position to offer our customers a flexible solution,\" he said.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    LIVE PYMNTS AND AMAZON PAY CONVERSATION: POWERING THE DIGITAL SHIFT \u2013 CONSUMER TRUST     From tiny Main Street shops to the tech giants of Silicon Valley, companies are working fervently to revive and reinvent the economy.

The Report examines the potential benefits of Big Tech presence in financial services, as well as the risks and regulatory implications it entails. Big Tech's Expansion Into Financial Services The BIS observes that the activities of Big Tech companies in finance are a subset of broader financial technologies ('Fintech') innovation. While Fintech companies are set up to operate primarily in financial services, Big Tech companies offer financial services as part of a large set of activities. </p><p>The Report notes that their entry into finance reflects strong complementarities between financial services and their core non-financial activities.An essential by-product of tech companies' business is the large stock of user data, which they use as input to offer a wide range of services that generate further user activity and yet more data. Building on the advantages of this 'data-network-activities loop', Big Tech companies have ventured into financial services including payments, lending, insurance and money management (see for example Facebook's recent Project Libra[2]). As illustrated by the Report, financial services represent only about 11% of Big Tech's revenues, as its core businesses remain focused on information technology and consulting. Nonetheless, given their size and customer reach, the BIS conceives that large tech companies' entry into finance has the potential to spark rapid change in the industry.As noted in the Report, Big Tech's move into financial services has been most extensive in Southeast Asia and other emerging market economies ('EMEs'). Payments were the first financial service large tech companies offered, mainly to help overcome the lack of trust between buyers and sellers on e-commerce platforms. Services like PayPal and Alipay are fully integrated into existing e-commerce platforms. Big Tech payment platforms currently fall under two distinct types: Overlay systems, which rely on existing third-party infrastructures, such as credit card or retail payment systems; and Proprietary systems, where payments are entirely processed and settled on a system proprietary to the tech company.The Report's findings suggest that overlay systems are used more commonly in advanced economies, as credit cards were already ubiquitous there by the time e-commerce companies came to prominence. Proprietary systems are more prevalent in economies where the penetration of other cashless means of payment is lower.Expanding upon their e-commerce platforms, some Big Tech companies have ventured into lending, mainly to small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers. Loans offered are mainly credit lines and small loans with short maturity. The Report points out that Big Tech credit provision has made its most significant advances in EMEs, where a considerable proportion of the population remains unbanked. The BIS recognizes that, despite its substantial recent growth, Fintech credit (including Big Tech) still constitutes a very small proportion of overall credit. Potential Benefits of Big Tech Presence in Finance Data analytics, network externalities and interwoven activities are key features of Big Tech companies' business models. According to the Report, those features could lower barriers to provision of financial services by reducing information and transaction costs, and thereby enhance financial inclusion.To limit losses in cases of default, banks monitor borrowers' business activities or require collateral, which can be costly. Large tech companies' access to and reliance on big data can reduce the costs relating to monitoring activities and the taking of security over collateral, and improve the efficiency of providing financial services.In the case of credit assessment, information costs can sometimes be so prohibitive that banks refrain from offering services to borrowers who, in some cases, lack basic documentation like audited financial statements. The Report suggests that, by taking advantage of information relevant for credit quality assessment available through their digital platforms, Big Tech companies could serve enterprises that would otherwise remain unbanked. Recent BIS research also indicates that tech companies' credit scoring, when applied to small vendors, outperforms models based on traditional credit bureau ratings, but it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions.The Report summarizes Big Tech and banks' competitive advantages and disadvantages as follows: Big Tech companies have access to data on a large number of users and have access to technology built to collect and merge such data, while banks have data on a smaller number of users and are occasionally hampered by legacy IT systems they use to process their data. On the other hand, banks have more verifiable customer data and have access to longer data history; Big Tech companies enjoy significant network externalities due to the broad set of non-financial activities they engage in, while banks are subject to strict regulatory limits on the activities they carry out as well as the use of the data at their disposal; and Big Tech companies can provide services at lower marginal costs to a larger number of users, but are limited in funding sources and risk management expertise compared to traditional financial institutions. Risks and Implications on Financial Regulation The BIS signals that Big Tech's expansion into financial services provision raises various competition risks, as platforms that will have consolidated their dominant position could raise entry barriers into the sector by increasing user switching costs, hence excluding potential competitors. Another risk is tech companies' potential anticompetitive use of data, which gives rise to 'digital monopolies'. Big Tech companies could engage in price discrimination and use their data not only to assess a potential borrower's creditworthiness, but to also identify the highest rate the borrower would be willing to pay for a loan. User data review could also lead to the exclusion of high-risk groups from credit and insurance markets.The Report advocates that Big Tech's activity in finance warrants a more comprehensive approach that encompasses not only financial regulation but also competition and data privacy concerns. The Report advocates for a functional approach to financial regulation ('same activity, same regulation'), noting that 'if big techs engage in activities that are effectively identical to those performed by banks, then such activities should be subject to banking rules.'The BIS also suggests that new regulation may also be necessary where Big Tech's activities have resulted in significant structural changes that take them outside the scope of existing financial regulation. In addition, regulators ought to examine to what extent they should encourage new entry of Big Tech companies into financial services and how user data should be treated in light of property rights.As policy choices in connection with the entry of Big Tech in financial services involve decisions by various financial regulators, competition authorities and data protection authorities, effective achievement of regulatory objectives will be challenging. The Report envisions that coordination among different regulatory authorities, at both the national and international level, will be essential to avoid conflicting actions and regulatory arbitrage.For more information about our firm's Fintech expertise, please contact the authors and see ourFintech group page[3].

The moratorium on Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approvals would provide Congress time to close the ILC loophole and ensure ILCs and their parent companies don't pose unnecessary risks to consumers and taxpayers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"ILCs offer banking products and services that are functionally indistinguishable from those offered by banks, but the ILC loophole allows the parent companies of ILCs to avoid oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and to engage in commercial activities, thus introducing risk to the banking system and to taxpayers, the groups wrote. Legislative action to close this loophole is necessary to eliminate these risks.\"</p><p>ILCs are FDIC-insured, state-chartered institutions that can generally engage in the full range of banking activities, such as taking deposits and making loans. But unlike banks, their parent companies are not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act, which means those companies are not subject to any federal supervision, regulations or standards. For this reason, there has historically been considerable opposition to the charter, and both Congress and the FDIC have placed temporary moratoria on ILCs.</p><p>Big Tech company ownership of an ILC introduces a new concern: that consumer data, including sensitive personal financial information, will be inadequately safeguarded and used in inappropriate and unauthorized ways. With global e-commerce giant Rakuten recently joining tech firms such as Square and Nelnet in applying to form ILCs, the risk associated with this legal loophole is greater than ever.</p><p>\"In the era of dominant Big Tech, we should be cautious before giving technology companies even greater reach into the economic life of Americans by allowing them to own banks, the groups wrote. The integration of technology and banking firms would not only result in an enormous concentration of financial and technological assets but also would pose conflicts of interest and privacy concerns to our banking system.\"</p><p>The groups further noted, \"A growth in ILCs poses broader consumer protection risks as well, because non-bank lenders, including very high-cost lenders, view the ILC charter as a far easier way to obtain banking privileges than obtaining a traditional bank charter and, consequently, becoming subject to consolidated Federal Reserve supervision.\"</p><p>In March, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking related to parent companies of industrial banks and industrial loan companies. BPI, CRL, ICBA and a coalition of civil rights groups wrote to the FDIC requesting that the FDIC not approve ILC deposit insurance applications until its ILC rulemaking is final. However, in recent months, the FDIC has approved some ILC applications and is reviewing others, including some whose parent companies engage in commercial activities.</p><p>-30-</p><p>About Bank Policy Institute.</p><p>The Bank Policy Institute (BPI) is a nonpartisan public policy, research and advocacy group, representing the nation's leading banks and their customers. Our members include universal banks, regional banks and the major foreign banks doing business in the United States. Collectively, they employ almost 2 million Americans, make nearly half of the nation's small business loans, and are an engine for financial innovation and economic growth.</p><p>About The Center for Responsible Lending.</p><p>The Center for Responsible Lending (CRL) is a nonprofit, non-partisan research and policy organization dedicated to protecting homeownership and family wealth by working to eliminate abusive financial practices.</p><p>About ICBA.</p><p>The Independent Community Bankers of America creates and promotes an environment where community banks flourish.

The strategy is sound and solid but success lies in the execution\u2014and speed of execution. Barriers still remain.</p><p>The reality of banking today is that it is moving more rapidly into the digital world than traditional banks are able to follow\u2014 conservative regulations, obsolete banking infrastructures, digital savvy populations and aggressive competitors are all challenging the core business model of the traditional banks.</p><p>CHASING THE CUSTOMER</p><p>Can the banking industry overcome the barriers and leverage the opportunities of combining digital technology with financial services? This is a critical question because customers are embracing digital banking solutions way ahead of banking boardrooms and the regulatory roadmaps.</p><p>We are now seeing a very strong technology push into the banking sector and within banks, as they now increasingly compete with 'Big Tech', mobile operators and the new fintech start-ups for younger, tech savvy customers.</p><p>Already the internet provides digital wallets, cheap transfer of money, crowd- funding and peer-to-peer consumer lending. Social media channels (Whatsapp,</p><p>Facebook, WeChat, etc) will soon be facilitating mobile money transfers, following successful pilots. All this is happening because customers and 'Big Tech' are finding their own use cases faster and faster, forcing regulators and the banking industry to adapt and play catch-up fast.</p><p>Interestingly, we now see HNWIs expecting real-time wealth management services and personalised dashboards\u2014 all from the mobile phone or the tablet. Expensive wealth relationship managers are being replaced by zero-costs chatbots (algorithms) that offer 24/7 self-service.</p><p>In digital banking, 'hyper-personalisation' is the new keyword, and agile infrastructures are the main challenge.</p><p>As all local bankers in the Middle East will know, as their clients become wealthier they start looking for new and added value private wealth management services and this usually leads them to start looking at other alternatives: banks around the region or international banks; local banks are running the risk of losing their clients who will shop around to get a higher return on their investments.</p><p>LOOKING EAST FOR INSPIRATION</p><p>Digital banking in Asia-Pac is compelling and provides us a with a glimpse of the future of the banking sector in the Middle East. Banks there have mastered platform-technologies in re-creating 'banking-as- an-ecosystem' to the point where they are now in a position to tap into additional revenue streams through adoption of cloud technology and widespread use of APIs.</p><p>In Asia, we see social media companies and car-sharing players rapidly building financial (banking and insurance) ecosystems - platforms that will facilitate billions of financial transactions - and now applying for a banking licence from the regulator. Their technology stacks are dominated by cloud platforms. More and more digital payment service providers are moving into offering mobile financial services, with companies now applying for banking licences. Again, all using cloud-based platforms.</p><p>And this is where the regulatory environment comes in; cloud is not yet permitted in most banking sectors across the Middle East region and so the banking sector is constrained in its ability to launch new innovative digital ecosystem banking services and benefit from the attractive economies of scale that can drive down banks' marginal costs and increase the banks' profit margins.</p><p>Here in the Middle East, cloud offers huge potential for the banking sector and the opportunity to break away from the limitations of the traditional IT infrastructures and create a new API-economy.</p><p>As examples from the Asian banks are showing, customers want to do more with mobile ecosystem banking and we expect over the coming years that this new business model will be replicated and tested within the Middle East banking sector as well.</p><p>We still have a way to go. Cloud is a great untapped opportunity for the Middle East banking sector. Retail banks themselves are piloting private cloud infrastructures, gaining experiences and putting pressure on the regulators. Major cloud service providers worldwide, including Amazon Web, and Microsoft Azure, are only just arriving now because of the pressures on the regulatory environment.</p><p>The future focus for Middle East banks is on 'banking-as-a-platform' and 'channel\u2014as-a-strategy' banks can no longer monopolise all the digital touch points for customers and so need to work with new ecosystem players; banks also need to learn to partner and collaborate more aggressively, in a similar way to the retail banks in Asia-Pac. This will require new investments, mostly in agile digital banking platforms.</p><p>'Network-as-a-service' (using new innovative SD-WAN technologies) is already being deployed by large banking companies, freeing up CAPEX to pay for these new investments in digital ecosystem banking platforms.</p><p>'Banking-as-a-platform'\u2014the ecosystem play to manage near-zero marginal costs with hyper-personalisation\u2014enables banks to use data to identify profitable niche markets and segments. If Middle East banks can get this right then there is a strong business case (as well as a growing customer expectation) to accelerate their digital transformation and be ready for the competition with the 'Big Tech' challengers.</p><p>THE REALITY OF BANKING TODAY IS THAT IT IS MOVING MORE RAPIDLY INTO THE DIGITAL WORLD THAN TRADITIONAL BANKS ARE ABLE TO FOLLOW. \u2014 Pieter Zylstra</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BANMID-143622914</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BANMID2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1D-9CF1-F11P-X3G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">356945</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"994\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 CPI Financial.

Sundararajan</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Digital transformation within the banking sector has disrupted conventional banking practices. While some individuals in India still choose to log in to their online banking portal to make payments, check balances, reconcile accounts, apply for a loan or a credit card, most Indians now use their banks' mobile apps or digital wallet platforms like Google Pay and PhonePe for these activities. It wouldn't be farfetched to speculate that in the coming years we wouldn't even need to visit a bank branch as all banking needs would be met through our smartphones. But how did it all start?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technological integration at banks in India started in 2013, when YES Bank and RBL Bank exposed their API to other developers to build innovative financial services. Subsequently, ICICI, RBL Bank, Kotak Bank, DCB Bank, and several others adopted this approach. Today, the 'ICICI Bank API Banking portal', that comprises 250+ APIs, enables developers of prospective partner companies around the globe to seamlessly sign up on it, create an application, select the application, test it out, and get the code. With this, businesses, fintechs, corporates, and e-commerce start-ups can easily partner with the bank and co-create innovative customer solutions in a frictionless manner, all from the convenience of a single portal.</p><p>Banking as a service (BaaS) can be defined as the end-to-end process that allows fintechs and other third parties to connect with banks' systems directly through application program interfaces (APIs). By connecting through APIs, technology companies can build banking offerings on top of the providers' regulated infrastructure. As banks evolved their business, they focused on creating separate analytical practices, such as operations analytics, compliance analytics, and credit risk analytics. Eventually banks realized that these practices shouldn't be siloed and needed to communicate with each other. With the need for integrated banking analytics and services, big tech companies like IBM started gaining more prominence in the financial sector.</p><p>Back in 2013, API banking was limited to powering few of the leading wallet providers who didn't have a PPI (Pre-paid Payment Instruments) license. Soon enough, many other banks like ICICI Bank, DCB Bank, and Kotak Bank followed suit. Then came demonetization in November 2016, where Quikr started operating CashNoCash, an application that directed users to the nearest ATM where cash was available and even told them how long they would have to wait in the queue. Quikr did this through an API which was crowdsourced. Like Quikr, the banking industry must become even more agile in API integration with backend legacy systems, in order to fast-track BaaS in India. The Indian banking sector should pay heed to the BaaS developments in the West in order to learn and adapt faster. Companies that provide BaaS solutions start as neo-banks (banks that are digital only, that reach their customers through mobile apps and personal computer platforms) and go on to become challengers. A prominent example of this is Atom Bank, one of the first mobile-only banks in the UK. Since obtaining a bank license is time-consuming and expensive, such companies choose the route of BaaS in view of reinforcing their future and even serving other banks.</p><p>Cloud adoption complements BaaS</p><p>Cloud-based core banking is still at a nascent stage of adoption. In fact, it has been prevalent in the U.S. for about three years. According to Adobe's 2018 Digital Marketing Study, only seven percent of financial institutions have implemented a cloud-based technology stack. In India, the adoption of cloud-based core banking is just picking up. Newly licensed Small Finance Banks and Payments Banks are increasingly taking on cloud computing for their core and surround banking solutions. This is because cloud computing is helping them to decrease their capital investments on IT infrastructure. To give an example, Nelito, an Indian software solutions and service provider offers financial institutes the ability to migrate from existing legacy systems to cloud core banking platforms.</p><p>Mini-Banks</p><p>With the advent of BaaS, banks are now able to expose their services to other fintechs and big tech companies to offer personalized products and services. Take for example Apple's partnership with Goldman Sachs to offer, Apple Card. Through this partnership, Apple was able to launch a 'mini-bank' so to speak on top of the BaaS infrastructure provided by Goldman Sachs. Goldman then announced its partnership with Amazon where they're developing technology to provide lending through Amazon's lending platform, potentially reaching thousands of enterprises that sell through the e-commerce giant. In the future, cloud-based applications like Uber, Amazon, or Apple iOS will be the primary way many consumers will choose to bank. Within the next ten years we probably won't ever need to visit a bank, or even their website, to utilize and engage with a financial service. Digital platforms will be able to offer us the banking services we need natively within whatever application it is we are using.</p><p>The Road Ahead</p><p>Besides the push for integration of APIs with legacy backend systems, there's a dire need for advocacy on open APIs. This is where the collaborations between financial institutes, fintechs, and big tech companies are crucial. Financial institutes can leverage the niche expertise of technology companies to offer newer and more innovative services to their customers. Thus, the only way to fast-track the BaaS model in India is the increased partnerships between all the stakeholders.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNSWLD-0053312118</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNSWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YYB-S1V1-DXMP-K0B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365035</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Business World, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 20, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

What are the main forces determining these changes? What group of banks in the retail banking sector has had more intensive changes during the last three to five years? Are banks feeling competition from the FinTech companies and realising a more flexible and focused policy or are they continuing to believe on traditional banks' domination?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This paper explores this process by analysing banking products and services in Latvia. How advancements in technology continue to transform the lives of banking customers? The study shows that digitalization guarantees the development of banks. Banks are looking at new avenues such as mobile application and mobile marketing to provide value-added services to customers and increase revenues by charging nominal fees for the services. Latvian banks are getting more flexible in customer services and banking products like crediting and financial resources transferring.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We divided Latvian commercial banks into two significant groups: banks more specialized in international customers servicing and banks more specialized in domestic customers servicing. Financial indexes have been compared in conformity to these two groups. The CIR, ROA, ROE estimates point out the profitability and efficiency of commercial banks. LIQUIDITY shows that banks in Latvia have an adequate stock of unencumbered highquality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately into cash.</p><p>The profitability and efficiency indicators are more predictable and stable in banks servicing domestic customers. Banks servicing international customers specialize in focused retail, but banks servicing domestic customers provide a wider range of products and services. As a result, banks servicing domestic customers are more flexible.</p><p>Keywords: banking business model, products and services, profitability and efficiency.</p><p>JEL code: G21, O16</p><p>1. Introduction</p><p>Every day the World becomes more and more digital. Digitalization is the future of all business industries. Banks have a significant role in our daily lives and the digitalization of the banking sector is no exception.</p><p>The Latvian banking system consists of many commercial banks: according to LCA date on December 31, 2016 the number of commercial banks was 23. Commercials banks in Latvia can be divided into two parts: banks more specialized in international customers servicing (BI) and banks more specialized in domestic customers servicing (BD). Both sectors are large enough. In 2015 the number of capital and reserves in the BD sector was 1.9 billion and in the BI sector- 1.0 billion (The Association of Latvian Commercial Banks, 2017). In 2015 the number of active customers in the BD sector was 2.02 million and in the BI sector- 0.03 million (The Association of Latvian Commercial Banks, 2017). BD provide a wider range of products and services, but BI specialize in focused retail.</p><p>The aim of this study is to compare the two groups of retail banking and fix the banking business model in Latvia's digital future.</p><p>This study will examine bank performance to isolate the factors that influence changes of banking business models in BI and BD in Latvia. What group of banks in the retail banking sector has had more intensive changes during the last three to five years?</p><p>Research starts with literature review and hypotheses promotion. The hypotheses show three directions of the research: the main force in the banking environment, FinTech influence on the banks development and the need for banks to digitalize.</p><p>Next step is to analyze banking products and services in Latvia such as: settlement and cash services, account management, savings and investments, loans. What products and services do customers prefer to use? How advancements in technology continue to transform the banking products and lives of banking customers?</p><p>Further the financial indexes would be compared. The CIR, ROA, ROE estimates point out the profitability and efficiency of commercial banks. LIQUIDITY shows the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold in the market.</p><p>Finally, the future banking business model of Latvian banks has been shaped.</p><p>2. Research results and discussion</p><p>2.1Literature review and hypotheses</p><p>The banking industry is going through digital changes. New devices, technologies and FinTech are changing the banking business models.</p><p>Digital transformation is a huge opportunity for the financial sector. Digital transformation will help financial companies in customer acquisition, retention and revenue generation. Increasing competition and decreasing customer loyalty has made customer relationship management very useful for banks. Banks need to earn the highest level of trust to retain existing customers, acquire new ones, create genuine loyalty and maximise customer lifetime value. Digital technologies will help banks to provide knowledge of customers and target them with customised products and communications remotely all day (Ernst &amp; Young, 2015). The importance of being easy, credible and secure to keep existing customers and acquire new ones is fundamental to banks (Thalassinos et al., 2013; Thalassinos, 2008). Reducing the gap between the customer expectations and delivered service will enhance the customer loyalty and bank's profitability (Thalassinos et al., 2015). It is cheaper to keep loyal customers than to acquire new ones (Bj\u00f6rk, 2015). Customer migrated to digital channels. Mobile channels are far more likely to delight and less likely to annoy than the branch or call centre experiences. It is leading to increase loyalty with higher customer retention, repeat purchases and referrals. Customers increasingly expect to follow up with bank staff through digital chat, video or other real-time options and banks actively develop them (Bain &amp; Company, 2015; Vlasov, 2017; Hes and Jilkova, 2016).</p><p>Hypothesis 1: Customers are the most important force in the banking environment. Banks must thoroughly research their own customers.</p><p>FinTech received a lot of attention and a lot of funds for the last five years and they are on the rise now. FinTech have entered the market and they are competing with banks. Sabine Lautenschl\u00e4ger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, considers that FinTech will change banks and could be three scenarios: banks might team up with FinTech, FinTech might break up the value chain of banking and FinTech could be swallowed up by big Tech companies and deeply transform the banking business (Lautenschl\u00e4ger, 2017). FinTech can transform banks positively and negatively. Digital challengers and FinTech giants present a threat for banks and will not go away soon, but at the same time, a wave of innovation in the financial sector offers many opportunities for banks, who able to move quickly (Finnegan, 2016; Vovchenko et al., 2017; Xanthopoulos, 2014; Suryanto, 2016). The banks will gain from many new innovations. Square, for instance, is a system that makes it easier for small businesses to take card payments; it will boost banks' transaction volumes. The FinTech revolution will reshape finance and improve it (Financial services, 2015).</p><p>Hypothesis 2: FinTech effect the banks ' development.</p><p>After crisis authorities have tried to make banks more industrial by imposing waves of rules and banks have developed in more deliberate shape as a result. Now the pressure is coming from the consumer. In the digital age, banks are looking for outdates. Facing pressure from consumers and regulators, banks must embrace digitalization. The smartphone is the main choice for the banks' customers of today. New banks are operating digital-only models and giving to their customers a full range of banking services in smartphone (Barnes, 2015). Customers prefer to access their bank using mobile and online channels and pay for purchases with cards rather than in cash. Digital experience let users to see all their balances anytime and anywhere. App in smartphone can offer advice on wealth building, spending habits and money saving tips (Ogden, 2017). Enabled by technology, customers expect the easy control and the variation of their money whenever they want. Customers' needs would be satisfied. Customers move at different speeds and make different decisions, every customer is a digital customer now- someone more and someone less, from the traditional customer to the digital-savvy one (Accenture, 2015).</p><p>Hypotheses 3: To satisfy customers' needs, banks should digitalize.</p><p>2.2Types of payments systems and instruments in Latvia</p><p>Payments systems were developed out of a need to facilitate the exchange of goods or services for another. The most common payment methods in Latvia are: payment cards, cash payments, bank transfers and mobile payments.</p><p>All payments systems and instruments can be divided into two big parts: traditional and electronic, as shown in Table 1.</p><p>With the FinTech development in the world, electronic payment instruments are growing and traditional cash payments have decreased in Latvia. Payment cards issue 11 BD and 7 BI in Latvia. From 2012 Latvian commercial banks had issued 2.32 billion payment cards. BD are leaders in the number of issued cards, but since 2012 till 2015 the share of issued cards has decreased from 98.1% till 97.8%. In 2015 BD kept 2.27 billion payment cards, but BI only had 50 thousand payment cards (The Association of Latvian Commercial Banks, 2017).</p><p>The banks customers' habits are changing and every year the banks customers use payment cards more and more. According to the Latvian Commercial Banks Association (LCA) data payment card transactions has grown by 21.2%, reaching 246.6 billion in 2014. In 2016 the number of payment card transactions reached 296.6 billion. The trend is to choose non-cash payments. The rapid growth was observed in the use of payment cards for purchases. In 2016 year the number of payment card purchases increased by 8.8% to 4,554 billion euro. Payment cards play an important role in today's marketplace as a ubiquitously accepted payment instrument (The Association of Latvian Commercial Banks, 2017).</p><p>Banks in Latvia have created many variants on the basic value proposition of convenience, acceptance, and safety. To increase the number of payment cards, Latvian banks offer to their customers' additional Loyalty programs such as: travel insurance, cash back, discounts in the shops, point accumulation system, free usage period and presents for achieved turnover. Also, Latvian banks modernize payment cards. In 2016 BD started to produce payment cards with contactless function and customers can pay for goods and services without entering their PIN.</p><p>The increase of the number of payment card purchases has necessitated a rapid increase of the number of POS terminals, as shown in Figure 1.</p><p>BD are technologically developing in Latvia and started to set POS terminal with contactless technology in 2016.</p><p>Secured cards are a particular type of market innovation. While there are dozens of product comparison websites and sites instructing consumers on the basics of secured cards- including how they differ from checking account-linked debit, prepaid debit, and unsecured cards- secured cards have received little attention in the trade press or academic publications. However, as banks, regulatory agencies, and consumer advocacy groups continue to focus on efforts to bring marginalized consumers into mainstream banking, interest in secured cards is likely to grow (Santucci, 2016).</p><p>Since 2006 more and more credit institutions in Latvia are implementing the highest security system to safe shopping on the Internet. Banks are using Internet 3D secure protection system developed by international companies VISA and MasterCard. American Express cards were added to the additional security technology in 2015 in Latvia. Confirming purchases on the Internet, in addition to inputting data from the payment card, the buyer also must enter login and password from online banking.</p><p>With the increase of purchases of payment cards and the expansion of POS terminal, the number of cash transactions has decreased in Latvian banks. A greater proportion of cash operations are provided by BD. With the reduction of cash transactions, the number of customer service centers in the BD sector has decreased, as shown in Figure 2.</p><p>The remaining customer service centers are actively modernizing. For the last three years several banks have gradually refused to work with cash and are offering to their customers only non-cash transactions or advisory services. The branches' employees stopped using WEB kiosk and begun to use tablets to learn new technologies in online banking and mobile banking.</p><p>FinTech disrupted the financial industry and branches are destined to become the alternative channel for customers to conduct their banking, integrating electronic payment systems and instruments such as: online banking, mobile banking and App. Personalized service provided in a different manner, leveraging digital technology to achieve a better buying experience. For the last four years all banks carried out online banking modernization. Latvian banks expanded the range of services in online banking and built strong cybersecurity.</p><p>BI sectors provide a professional banker with an opportunity to work more closely with customers. BI customers generally receive a highly personalized service such as: private manager availability around the clock and phone banking. BD had more intensive changes and became closer to their customers. Last year BD call centers introduced a new service- call back to customer. This year they open a new communication line to their customers, such as Skype, WhatsApp and Norvik Chat.</p><p>The popularity of using mobile banking and phone applications are growing every year in all banking sectors. In 2016 Citadele developed and set up a new mobile application with integrated exclusive code calculator function. The last traditional payment system is ATMs. The number of cash transactions and POS increased, therefore the number of ATM decreased, as shown in Figure 3.</p><p>The cash payoff services from ATM in Latvia provided only BD sector. The new modern technology services gradually replace the ATM services.</p><p>2.3Transformation of savings and loans in Latvian banks</p><p>Commercial banks and savings and loans (S &amp; L) associations provide many services to customers, including deposits and credits. Both these institutions are quite similar in terms of the basic banking services they provide. They accept deposits from investors providing safekeeping of the money an interest payment. Both institution types use deposits to make loans, which are funds provided to investors for the promise of repayment of principal with interest. One of the primary sources of revenue for all banking institutions is the interest spread between the rate they collect on loans and the rate they pay on deposits (Csiszar, 2010).</p><p>Deposit rate is the interest rate that a bank pays the depositors for the use of their money. In Latvian banking institutions, it can be either fixed for a certain period, or it can be variable. In Latvia, it has decreased since 2009 and amounted to 0.13% in 2013, as shown in Fig. 4., according to the World Bank data on world development indicators.</p><p>According to Trading Economics global macro models and analysts' data the interest rate in Latvia is expected to be 0.00 percent by the end of Q1/17. It will stand at 0.00 in 12 months' time. In the long-term, the interest rate in Latvia is projected to trend around 0.50 percent in 2020 (Trading Economics, 2017).</p><p>Despite the low deposit interest rate in Latvia, the number of the attracted deposits has grown in both sectors, as shown in Fig. 5. Latvian banks did not change the savings policy for last five years and continue to work like traditional banks. Interest rate of loans is decreased starting with 2010 and was reported at 5.92 %, as shown in Fig. 6., according to the World Bank data on world development indicators collected from officially recognized sources.</p><p>Bank lending rate in Latvia is expected to be 4.15 % by the end of Q1/17, according to Trading Economics global macro models and analysts' expectations. It will stand at 4 % in 12 months' time. In the long-term, the Latvia Bank lending rate is projected to trend around 4.15 % percent in 2020 (Trading Economics, 2017).</p><p>The interest rate of loans is stabilized in Latvian banks. The loan receiving became less expensive, but the number of issued lending decreased in universal banking sector, as shown in Figure 7.</p><p>The decrease of lending in BD is associated with bad credit history of many customers after the crisis in 2008, with the competition of the fast credit companies and government policy. Due to these effects, BD became flexible. At first, in 2016 BD started to offer the individual interest rate. Customers with high credit capacity may get reduced interest rate and customers with low credit capacity may get increased interest rate. Secondly, the credit issuing process in BD was facilitated and accelerated in 2016 by lowering the consideration of the credit assignment till 15 minutes. The customer also can apply for a loan using internet banking. Third, now Latvian banks faster adapt to changes in government policy and in 2016 started to issue the mortgage credit with nation guarantee.</p><p>3.Financial indexes in Latvian banks</p><p>Nowadays companies face the challenge of evaluating the potential loss of transactions, especially considering the recent financial crisis that showed what can happen as a result of poor risk management policy (Rupeika-Apoga &amp; Nedovis, 2016). We identify three key dimensions on bank performance - profitability, efficiency and liquidity. Profitability and efficiency is measured by the return on assets (ROA), the return on equity (ROE) and the capital adequacy ratio (CAR).</p><p>ROA captures the aspect of performance of a bank in terms of its profitability, it is the ratio of net income to total assets. It is a ratio that is directly affected by internal factors of a bank (financial conditions), as well as external factors to a bank (economic conditions and government policies) (Saganga &amp; Gwahula, 2016).</p><p>ROA index is higher at BD and it grows stably every year, as shown in Fig. 8. BI are more dependent from internal and external factors of a bank.</p><p>ROE measures the rate of return of ownership interest of common stock owners. It measures the efficiency of profit generation from every unit of equity ownership. It shows how effectively a company uses investment fund for profit growth (Saganga, Gwahula, 2016). ROE indicator is almost identical at both banking sectors, but the growth tendency decreases in BI faster, as shown in Figure 9.</p><p>CAR is the ratio which indicates the protection level of banks against excess leverage, insolvency and keeps them out of difficulty. The European prudential regulation has encouraged banks to hold such safe and liquid securities that may help to cushion losses on riskier assets (Allegret et al., 2016). It is defined as the ratio of banks capital in relation to its current liabilities and risk weighted assets. Risk weighted assets are a measure of the amount of banks assets, adjusted for risks. An appropriate level of capital adequacy ensures that the bank has sufficient capital to expand its business, while at the same time its net worth is enough to absorb any financial downturns without becoming insolvent (Nakhat, 2014).</p><p>The degree of protection of depositors' money is on the high level in both bank sectors, as shown in Figure 10.</p><p>A liquidity ratio is an indicator of whether a company's current assets will be sufficient to meet the company's obligations when they become due (Q&amp;A, 2017).</p><p>BI ability to pay debt obligations and its margin of safety is higher, but it is within the Latvian norm 30 % in both banking sectors, as shown in Figure 11.</p><p>4.Conclusions, proposals, recommendations</p><p>The retail banking sector has had intensive changes during the last three to five years. Despite the crisis in the financial sector, the total income of banks in Latvia increased from 85.5 billion in 2008 till 415.9 in 2015 (LCA data, 2016). Latvian banking sector adapted to the new conditions with the help of new digital tools, of which the most powerful was the transition to the electronic payment system. With the FinTech development in the world, electronic payment instruments are growing and traditional payment instruments have decreased in Latvia.</p><p>Payment cards play an important role in today's marketplace as a ubiquitously accepted payment instrument. In 2014 the number of payment card transactions reached 246.6 billion. After two years the number of payment card transactions increased by 20% to 296.6 billion. The trend is to choose non-cash payments. BD are leaders in the number of issued cards and in 2015 kept 2.27 billion payment cards. It is 97.8% from the total amount of the issued cards in Latvia in 2015. The new digital tools like loyalty programs, payment cards modernization and protection systems' development help to increase the number of payment cards in Latvia. The number of POS terminals grew up for 46% from 2010 and dialed 35683 in 2015.</p><p>Traditional payment instruments, such as customer services centers and ATM, have lost the leader position in Latvia. In 2012 the amount of customer service centers in the BD sector was 377 and in the BI sector- 14. After four years the BI sector had 11 customer services centers. BD sector has had more changes and the number of customer service centers decreased by 26% to 278. Consequently, the BD sector actively changed the customer service model. The remaining customer service centers were modernized. The part of BD banks canceled to work with cash and offering to their customers only non-cash payments or advisory services. The customer service centers now are only the alternative channel for customers to conduct their banking. With FinTech development electronic payment systems and instruments such as: online banking, mobile banking, call back, App and new communication line with customers (Skype, WhatsApp, Norvik Chat) have integrated in Latvian banks. The cash payoff services from ATM in Latvia provided only BD sector and the number of ATM decreased from 1359 in 2010 till 1015 in 2015.</p><p>The number of the attracted deposits has grown in both sectors every year from 17.7 billion in 2012 till 21.4 billion in 2015. Therefore, Latvian banks did not change the savings policy in spite the low interest rate. It has decreased from 8 % since 2009 and amounted to 0.13% in 2013.</p><p>On the contrary, after crises in 2008 the interest rate of loans is stabilized in Latvian banks and the loan receiving became less expensive. It decreased from 16.2% in 2009 till 5.9% in 2013. From 2012 the BI sector was stable and increased the amount of the issued loans from 2.3 million in 2012 till 2.7 million in 2015.</p><p>ROA, ROE, CAR index is higher at BD, because BI are more dependent from internal and external factors of a bank. BI liquidity is higher, but it is within the Latvian norm 30 % in both banking sectors. The gain of mentioned indicators in BI sector has a negative tendency to decrease from 2013 till 2015. BI should reconstruct the banking business model in Latvia.</p><p>In total FinTech development in the world affected the retail banking sector in Latvia. BD actively digitalizes. They became more flexible and have a focused policy to the new customers attracting and the deduction of existing customers by new digital tools. The BI sector in Latvia believes more in traditional banks' domination and change more slowly the banking business model.</p><p>References:</p><p>Accenture 2015. Banking Customer 2020.

One is online banking, where all the financial institutions go online; the other is internet finance, which is purely led by outsiders. \u2013 Jack Ma</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The banking industry is experiencing disruption at an increasing pace. Over the past few years, traditional financial institutions and non-traditional fintech firms have begun to understand that collaboration may be the best path to long-term growth. At the same time, big tech firms are offering financial services, creating techfin solutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rationale for collaboration is the ability to bring strengths of both banks and fintech firms together to create a stronger entity than either unit could bring on their own. For most fintech organizations, the primary advantages are an innovation mindset, agility (speed to adjust), consumer-centric perspective, and an infrastructure built for digital. These are advantages that most legacy financial institutions don't possess.</p><p>Alternatively, most banking institutions have scale, a stronger brand recognition and established trust. They also have adequate capital, knowledge of regulatory compliance and an established distribution network.</p><p>According to the World Fintech Report 2018 from Cap Gemini and LinkedIn, in collaboration with Efma, \"Most successful fintech firms have focused on narrow functions or segments with high friction levels or those underserved by traditional financial institutions, but have struggled to profitably scale on their own. Traditional financial institutions have a vast customer base and deep pockets, but with legacy systems holding them back.\"</p><p>The challenge will be the ability to establish an environment where collaboration can flourish as opposed to stifling the beneficiary attributes of either partner.</p><p>The difference between Fintech and Techfin is based on the origin of the underlying organization. Fintech usually references an organization where financial services are delivered through a better experience using digital technologies to reduce costs, increase revenue and remove friction.</p><p>A basic example of a Fintech offering is the mobile banking services that most traditional banks offer. More commonly, fintech refers to non-traditional financial offerings such as PayPal, Zelle and Venmo in the U.S. and digital-only Starling Bank, Monzo and Revolut in the U.K.</p><p>Alternatively, Techfin usually references a technology firm that finds a better way to deliver financial products as part of a broader offering of services. Examples of techfin companies include Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple (GAFA) in the U.S. and Baidu, Alibaba &amp; Tencent (BAT) in China.</p><p>A couple of years ago, Jack Ma, technology visionary and co-founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group, described the difference between Fintech and Techfin.</p><p>In both instances, success of these organizations in finance will be based on the ability for the institution to collect and analyze massive data sets, learn from the insights to improve personalization and digital engagement in real-time, and expand offerings in response to consumer needs.</p><p>A New Competitive Landscape</p><p>Even with the best collaboration, the Techfin powerhouses will challenge the ability for legacy financial institutions to compete in the future banking ecosystem. Built on digital platforms, these huge technology organizations are efficient and have already found ways to reduce operational costs and monetize their business models.</p><p>According to Bain, \"Many of the tech giants possess the ingredients of success: digital prowess, large customer bases, organizations well versed in improving the customer experience, and ample leeway to extend their corporate brands into banking.\" More concerns may be that some of these firms are generating a level of trust previously reserved only for traditional banks and credit unions.</p><p>It is expected that demand for products and services from Fintech firms and large tech companies will only increase as more consumers become familiar with new digital offerings. This is especially true for younger consumers, who have grown up with digital devices.</p><p>\"Techfin firms start with technology and wonder how that can be used for commerce and trade. Alternatively, Fintech firms start with existing trade structures and wonder how to make them cheaper and faster with technology. I liken it to Fintech firms are making faster horses whereas Techfin firms are working with airplanes\". \u2013 Chris Skinner</p><p>More and more, people will get annoyed when they're forced by bank policies and processes to use non-digital channels for everyday banking business. Traditional banking organizations cannot rely on providing checking accounts and loans only. Competitors are already eating away at significant parts of the banking value chain with the potential of limiting banks to becoming nothing more than utilities.</p><p>The future of the banking industry will depend on its ability to leverage the power of customer insight, advanced analytics and digital technology to provide services that help today's tech-savvy customers manage their finances and better manage their daily lives. As financial and technology organizations embrace a broader view of banking, offering both banking and non-banking services, the ultimate winner will be the consumer regardless of which provider they select.</p><p>**Forbes Media LLC \u2013 Jim Marous, owner &amp; publisher of Digital Banking Report</p><p>The writer is a Banker &amp; an Investment Analyst/Researcher.

It's money. Money is about control - something I blog about regularly - and men control societies, economies and the world. </p><p>Women are subjugated in that world, which is why there is a minority of female founders of FinTech firms and female executives in the leadership team of banks. But it's more fundamental than this, as illustrated by tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson[1], co-founder of Basecamp and Ruby on Rails, who was shocked that Apple Card gave him a twenty times higher credit limit than his wife even though his wife had a better credit rating.The @AppleCard[2] is such a fucking sexist program. My wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time. Yet Apple's black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does. No appeals work. \u2014 DHH (@dhh) November 7, 2019[3]That got headlines - after all, it is Apple Card - and when Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak laid into the discussion The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019. \u2014 Steve Wozniak (@stevewoz) November 10, 2019[4]It got news headlines with Bloomberg[5], the BBC[6] and more. But what is the surprise here? Banking is inherently sexist. Money is inherently sexist. Women are controlled by being unbanked or by being a hanger on their partner's bank account. This has been shown year on year on year, country by country by country. According to the World Bank's Global Findex report[7], women are generally less likely to have a bank account and the gap between men and women having bank accounts has generally remained unbudged since they started studying the subject. Women are still less likely than men to have bank accounts, despite an extra 1.2 billion people joining financial institutions over the past seven years, a new report from the World Bank has found. Worldwide, 72 percent of men have an account compared to 65 percent of women - a gap of seven percentage points that has persisted since the organization first began collecting data on financial inclusion in 2011. The gender gap in developing countries is 9 percentage points, also unchanged over the past seven years. Today there are 980 million women globally who do not have an account. A bit like men and women not having equal pay, men and women do not have equal access to financial services. And, even if they get a bank account, women are more likely to pay more for it[8]. Women pay nearly 20 percent more in bank fees and charges than men due to the gender pay gap which leaves them earning less and overdrawing more frequently. Oh, and if you want a job in banking, it's run by men[9], so don't try too hard. So, I hate to tell you this, but if you are a Miss, Ms or Missus, you are definitely going to get treated worse in banking and finance than if you are a Mister. All the better reason to be a Mx.Postnote I can't mention Apple Card without adding this line[10]: According to regulatory filings, Apple Card\u200c customers had $736 million in loan balances at the end of September 2019 and a $10 billion line of credit has been opened by Goldman Sachs in just the one month since the card's launch in the USA.

In 2020, the number and nature of these regulations will force leading banks to fundamentally adapt their operations to new regulations, as trying to implement these regulations on existing workflows will only increase costs, reduce efficiency, and increase operational risk. Already in wealth, the likes of MiFID have driven some firms to exit the industry entirely, conferring an advantage on some startups, while disadvantaging others that don't have a mature compliance function. </p><p>Point being: the actual impact of any regulation depends on how individual firms respond. To deal with spiraling costs, banks will engage further with regtech firms and outsourcing. Regtech firms are focused on developing solutions in data collection and reporting, decision-making, predictive analytics, and risk identification and management. However, because regtech can be highly specialised, best-in-class regtech in a given 50-step bank process might require 10 different regtech partners. Incumbent banks aren't set up to work like that. Integration issues will afflict regtech partnerships much like they did fintech partnerships before them. Regtech providing simple dashboards to stay on top of multiple initiatives will gain most traction. ING and Commonwealth Bank, for example, are working with Ascent, which uses AI to update clients on regulatory changes impacting their business and automatically generates audit reports and dashboards. The cost of getting it wrong was so painfully demonstrated by Danske in 2019, which set aside $8bn to cover likely fines for a $235bn money laundering scandal. This resulted in the resignation of CEO Thomas Borgen, its share price more than halving, and the closing of its operations in Estonia, where the scandal occurred. To get ahead of things, banks will work less on traditional regulatory lobbing and more on ecosystem strategies, working with other banks, regtechs, and regulators worldwide to form global, regional, and national consortia to better manage regulatory compliance. As banking goes deeper into data-driven business models, 2020 will see data management become the biggest compliance issue across open banking and GDPR. Rather than to minimise compliance, leading banks will develop a strategy that clearly articulates appropriate (and inappropriate) uses of data. This is somewhere that banks will seek to win the moral, legal, and thus consumer argument against Big Tech. These companies are forging pure ad business models for the collection, sale, and use of personal data and which are designed to optimise the user's attention to the detriment of data privacy. In the European Union, data privacy has been the main focus of regulation over the last year, with adfunded platforms like Google and Facebook being targeted. Banks will stay ahead of this.

Members will discuss data privacy during a hearing Tuesday with a GAO official and a privacy expert. The House Antitrust Subcommittee plans a hearing that day on big tech's impact on journalism (see 1906060065).</p><p>\"People are increasingly concerned about the power of these companies that have so much of our data and make money from it,\" Brown said. He said Republicans are concerned about government mishandling data, while the private sector has gotten Democrats' attention, but \"we hope we can come together on this.\" Brown and Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, urged collaboration between the Senate Commerce and other committees on privacy (see 1905160021).</p><p>Commerce's privacy group held a staff-level meeting last week, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, told us: There continues to be \"goodwill.\" Separate members have had conversations, but the six lawmakers haven't all gotten together since the initial meeting in April, Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., told us. He said the group is \"socializing some of the ideas\" to include in the bill. Federal pre-emption, FTC authority and a private right of action are among divisive issues.</p><p>Government doesn't regulate news industry content, but somehow Facebook and Google do, said News Media Alliance President David Chavern, who will testify before House Judiciary members. The committee's recent decision to probe tech industry competition (see 1906060032) shows there's bipartisan consensus for exploring antitrust issues, Chavern said. He urged support for a bill (see 1904030064) from ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., and House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., that would allow news publishers to negotiate collectively with the tech industry over content production and revenue. Silicon Valley determines everything about the \"news experience,\" Chavern said: \"We at least need the chance to organize and fight for a digital future for news.\"</p><p>Chavern is expected to tell Congress of the need for \"sustainable business relationships that actually return value to the great and important journalists who create the news content.\" His prepared testimony says Google received $2.1 billion in U.S. revenue in 2004, compared with the newspaper industry's $48 billion of advertising revenue. In 2017, Google's U.S. revenue jumped to $52.4 billion, while the newspaper industry's ad revenue fell to $16.4 billion.</p><p>Google collected about $4.7 billion in 2018 revenue from \"crawling and scraping news publishers' content -- without paying the publishers for that use,\" the NMA reported Monday. Google search results are about 16 to 40 percent news, the organization said. \"News publishers need to continue to invest in quality journalism, and they can't do that if the platforms take what they want without paying for it,\" Chavern said.</p><p>The study's \"back of the envelope calculations\" are inaccurate, a company spokesperson emailed, saying the \"overwhelming number of news queries\" don't show ads. \"Every month Google News and Google Search drives over 10 billion clicks to publishers' websites, which drive subscriptions and significant ad revenue.\"</p><p>Tuesday's Banking witnesses are GAO Financial Markets and Community Investment Director Alicia Cackley and World Privacy Forum Executive Director Pam Dixon. The U.S. should establish voluntary privacy standards as an alternative to enacting federal pre-emptive privacy legislation, Dixon said. She plans to push World Privacy Forum's discussion draft. It calls for \"a fair, inclusive, and transparent process to govern the collection, use, maintenance, and disclosure of personal information.\" Dixon noted the FDA has been successful using such standards, for example. WPF pushed back on suggestions the draft amounts to industry self-regulation. \"They are standards that are rigorously defined and ensure due process,\" the organization said.</p><p>The U.S. needs a federal privacy bill that pre-empts state law, said Software &amp; Information Industry Association Senior Director-Technology Policy Sara DePaul. SIIA was one of several groups to offer the Senate Banking Committee advice on its data privacy effort (see 1904040073). The association opposes private right of action but supports FTC authority over common carriers and nonprofits, to fine companies on first offenses and to establish narrow rulemaking. A private right of action raises concerns for small businesses because of litigation costs, DePaul said. It would mean a sharp increase in private settlements over technical matters, instead of public agreements with implications for the entire market, she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB8-VKH1-DYRJ-01WN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"796\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

It was progressing towards and preparing itself for the next wave of disruption with blockchain and AI-backed technologies as its epicenter.    However, in January, the world was hit by COVID-19, a pandemic no one ever saw coming, let alone being equipped to mitigate it. The crisis resulting from a total lockdown scenario changed the face of businesses and everything else around the world, including the banking industry. It threw the banking sector into the spotlight, coaxing it to accelerate digitization overnight.    The pandemic, undoubtedly, has become the turning point for the banking sector as well as its workforce and its customers. The ones who have been resistant to going the digital way have been compelled to adopt and embrace digital banking at full throttle.    The shining moment of this transformation has been the observation that more people are realizing the convenience of digital banking and are now reconsidering their bank branch visits altogether. Some of the banks and financial organizations have come to daunting realization about their archaic processes and the urgency of developing meaningful digital banking experiences, while the others are contemplating to decrease their branch budgets and networks and reinvest in digital channels.   The digital transformation of banks   World Economic Forum in its recent report hinted on the dire state of the world economy; indicating that the containment measures are having an inversely proportional effect on the economies where the \u2018economists cannot even begin to predict the end of the recession that is now underway.\u2019    The banks have been playing and will continue to play the lead role in the recovery of the global economy. Some important points to keep in mind are:    Worldwide, the banks have been operating with limited staff and have tirelessly worked towards making work-from-home possible to ensure the continuation of seamless financial transactions, showing that they too are the front-line heroes who are determined to fight against the virus with all their grit.  The authoritative banking regulatory bodies in most countries streamlined the measures regarding easing-out debt obligations and extending leniencies, such as moratoriums on funded facility repayment.  Globally, the banking sector proactively addressed the need for better and more secure digital banking solutions to help their customers to carry out essential financial transactions without risks.    In short, the focus of banks around the world during the pandemic-led lockdown has been to offer essential services and extend support solutions with optimum attention to quality, customer experience, security, and risk control, with the safety of their workforce and customers as their priority.    After withstanding these times of crisis, the banks have also realized that it cannot dwell more on the subject and will have to rapidly start creating a smarter digital banking framework if they want to sustain themselves in the immediate and long-term future.   Considerations for the digital journey ahead   As the digital transformation of the banks takes the center stage, they need to gain deep insights into its multiple variables. The aftermath of COVID-19 will present completely transformed customers and customer demands. Robust, secure, and fast digital banking solutions will be the key drivers of customer experiences.    To retain their existing customer base and stand their ground against the neo banks and the challenger banks, traditional banking institutions will need highly integrated and scalable digital solutions. While cutting costs may become more pressing than ever, the banks will have to reprioritize their spending and dedicate adequate resources for digital transformations, cyber security, and data protection.    Another important pre-requisite while mapping the digital journey is to develop better operational capabilities. A transparent strategy along with an AI-powered operating model inclusive of clear-cut consumer-driven policies is what the banks need to prepare for a successful digital future.   The banks after COVID-19 \u2013 what will they look like?   The major transformation the banking sector will be experiencing is in terms of their radical shift from dragging legacy technologies to embracing more agile and scalable tech solutions fueled by artificial intelligence through varied collaboration approaches with fintech, big tech and ecommerce companies. When customers would prefer to operate their account online all the time, they would demand better designed, intuitive, and secure applications from the banks.    Digitizing the entire banking system will require a high-performing, interactive, secure, and UX-focused design. A prim and proper UX design guides the customer to complete their intended tasks securely, quickly, and easily. Trust is the core factor in banking and a good UX design would aid in achieving greater customer satisfaction ensuring enhanced customer loyalty.    So, the prime question becomes, how to architect an ideal digital banking solution with UX as its focal point. I believe, for building an impressive, engaging, and resilient digital banking system there are many customer-centric factors the banks will need to consider. The most crucial ones include:    Simplicity of the UI: The aversion towards adopting online banking is majorly due to the complexity of online experiences, making navigation challenging for the users. Simplified and easy-to-comprehend systems are critical to incorporate when digitizing the future banks.    Ease-of-use: Banks are now innovating and trying to make it as easy for users to get connected with them and operate their accounts. Apart from simplifying the apps or web-interface, they are starting services like online chat with bank agents, AI-based chatbots, digital identity verification without requiring users to visit branches,  etc., enabling more customers to go digital with ease.    Attractive UI: The digital space is highly driven by the visual aesthetics and is key to make the right first impressions on the customers. This applies to the banking sector, too. The more compelling and friendly your UI design; the better the customer experience.    Personalization: From fashion to information consumption, the customer is demanding and embracing personalized experiences and will have the same expectations from digital banking solutions, too. To achieve this, the banks will need a robust AI system for analyzing customer journeys and custom-suit banking products that they need. Personalization will be the key driver for meeting the online sales targets for the banks.    Transparency and security: Transparent banking processes and the seamless security systems will be the vital principles forming the base of a good UX design. The effective measures to ensure data and transaction security, along with efficient communication will be key to engaging and retaining the customers with more digital products.    Mobile-first approach: The future of digital banks is in the palm of the people. A Deloitte survey found that out of 73 percent of people globally who use digital banking at least once a month, use mobile banking apps as well as access the bank\u2019s websites through their phones. Taking into account the growing number of mobile users worldwide, banks should be building mobile-friendly apps and responsive websites with customer-focused personalized solutions.    Digital banking ecosystems : With increased competition from the new entrants in the banking space, the development of ecosystems connecting banks, fintechs, marketplaces, other digital platforms into a single environment, with services being available seamlessly in a few clicks, is inevitable. The customers will soon demand an integrated banking platform and it is the right time to prepare for it.   Be at the forefront of the digital revolution   By the time the world recovers from the aftermath of COVID-19, banking institutions would have seen a vast transformation in their systems, processes, and customer relationships. New future-ready, digital banking solutions will offer as secure, as easy, and as welcoming customer experiences as the brick-and-mortar ones provide. At Maveric, we help banks accelerate their transformation initiatives by integrating domain, UX design, technology, strategy, and execution. We have been enabling banks to achieve their customer satisfaction goals and accelerate their digitization journeys with modern technology solutions. A calculated and well-thought plan and collaboration with the right fintech solution providers will help get you ready for this dynamic and ever-evolving journey of going digital and help you to rise above such extreme situations, now as well as in the future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42561691103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60B0-PJ01-F07F-807F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Emerging Payments Association</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>Authority of State Agencies</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Nzc4MzRFMzEwMEEwNDZEMTgzMjZFMjg1N0M2Q0FENTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUFDOEJBNTMwMzE5NERBQjk4MUM3QjI0QjdCRTYyRTI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

In her first interview with international media, she talks sandboxes, blockchain and the challenges of regulating bank ecosystems.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Olga Skorobogatova, the central bank of Russia's first deputy governor</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Russia's central bank is one of the most active in the world in terms of digital innovation. Over the last six years, it has launched a series of big infrastructure projects including national fast payments and biometrics systems, as well as a regulatory sandbox, a financial technology association and a blockchain platform.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The driving force behind all these projects is Olga Skorobogatova, the central bank of Russia's (CBR) first deputy governor and digital supremo.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unusually for a central banker in the former Soviet Union, Skorobogatova has strong commercial banking credentials. She moved to the CBR in 2014 after an 11-year stint at Rosbank, Societe Generale's Russian subsidiary, where she started as director of retail sales development, cash services and remote services. She joined the management board in 2007 as head of the banking and IT committee.\u00a0</p><p>In that role, she was responsible for the creation of a unified IT platform for Societe Generale's multiple Russian operations, as well as the creation of a department for projects and process organization.\u00a0</p><p>The call to join the CBR came shortly after Russia's annexation of Crimea. After the first round of Western sanctions was announced in March 2014, Visa and Mastercard restricted service to some banks and clients in Russia, raising fears that the country could be cut off from international payments systems.\u00a0</p><p>In response, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would develop its own card payment system, charging the CBR with the task.\u00a0</p><p> I came to the central bank deeply believing that we can do everything. To quote Mark Twain: \"~They did not know it was impossible, so they did it.'\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Olga Skorobogatova, CBR </p><p>Skorobogatova was tapped to lead the initiative and joined the central bank in July 2014. In the same month, the national payment card system (NSPK) was registered as a company. By the end of the year, a payments platform was in place and the first Mir cards were issued in late 2015.</p><p>\"The NSPK was quite a tough and ambitious task,\" says Skorobogatova. \"It normally takes three to five years to set up a company of that scale, while we had to do it in seven months.\"</p><p>By December 2019, around 70 million Mir cards had been issued and the system accounted for nearly 25% of total payments in Russia. This figure was boosted by the introduction in January 2018 of legislation requiring all state welfare and pension payments to be made through the NSPK.\u00a0</p><p>Skorobogatova is keen to stress that the system is not just for government-related payments.\u00a0</p><p>\"It is a full-fledged business instrument that we provide for market participants as well,\" she says.\u00a0</p><p>She admits, however, that further increasing the system's reach \"\" as targeted by the Russian authorities \"\" will be challenging.\u00a0</p><p>\"Each successive 1% of the market is harder to secure than the previous one,\" she says.</p><p>From the start, there has been much talk of rolling out the system internationally. So far, however, take-up has been mainly limited to members of Russia's Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) \"\" Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.\u00a0</p><p>The CBR is trying to persuade leading Russian tourist destinations to accept Mir cards, with some success. Vietnam and Cyprus have signed up for trials, while Turkey and Bulgaria have expressed interest in joining the system.\u00a0</p><p>Skorobogatova acknowledges the difficulties of international expansion.\u00a0</p><p>\"Obviously, implementing a project of this kind requires intense cooperation, not only politically but even more so on the technological and financial level,\" she says.Digital banking</p><p>Back in its home market, however, the CBR has been able to push ahead with a series of ambitious digital banking projects. Last year it launched the faster payments system (FPS), a national platform that provides cheap peer-to-peer (P2P) payments for Russian retail bank customers.</p><p>The initiative was designed to address imbalances in the Russian banking system, most notably widely varying levels of banking service across different regions and the dominance of large state-controlled lenders.\u00a0</p><p>Although Russia has around 450 banks in total, a third of sector assets and half of retail customers are held by market leader Sberbank. Fellow state-owned banks VTB and Gazprombank account for another 24% of the market by total assets.</p><p>It is a situation exacerbated by what Skorobogatova calls \"salary slavery\", whereby staff are obliged to receive their wages via accounts at banks with which their employers have corporate banking relationships.\u00a0</p><p> P2P systems became very popular very fast in Russia. To get access to innovative services, however, customers had to open accounts with the biggest bank or its closest competitor, which cut off the rest of the banks from the market\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Olga Skorobogatova </p><p>In 2011, Sberbank moved into digital banking with the launch of an online platform for consumers; within five years it counted around 80% of all Russians banking online or by mobile as customers.\u00a0</p><p>Fears that Sberbank might leverage its dominant market position, deep pockets and technological sophistication to gain a monopoly in retail digital banking were increased when the lender launched a mobile P2P payments service in 2018 in conjunction with smaller rival Tinkoff Bank.</p><p>The product rapidly gained traction.\u00a0</p><p>\"P2P systems became very popular very fast in Russia,\" says Skorobogatova. \"To get access to innovative services, however, customers had to open accounts with the biggest bank or its closest competitor, which cut off the rest of the banks from the market.\u00a0</p><p>\"Even worse, the dominating banks used their power to steadily raise their tariffs. We believe such operations should be a natural part of the daily routine and should be affordable for everyone.\"\u00a0</p><p>Hopes of persuading Russian banks to follow the example of their Swedish counterparts and collaborate on the creation of a universal faster payments platform, however, were quickly dashed.\u00a0</p><p>\"They said: \"~It's a good idea, but we are not ready to invest in what will benefit our rivals,'\" says Skorobogatova.</p><p>The CBR therefore decided to take matters into its own hands. Developed as part of the NSPK, the faster payments system (FSP) was launched in January 2019. It currently allows instant P2P payments via mobile for retail customers, as well as payments to businesses via QR codes.\u00a0</p><p>Further expansion to cover the full range of payments between consumers, businesses and public-sector entities is planned.</p><p>The platform is available to all banks in Russia, and by the end of last year 31 had connected. Sberbank was late to the party, however, incurring a fine from the CBR for failing to meet a requirement for systemic lenders to connect by the start of October.</p><p>\"Some monopolists are obviously not happy with the introduction of the FPS, but the feedback from most of the banks has been very positive,\" says Skorobogatova.  </p><p> Biometrics</p><p>Promoting competition and creating a level playing field for Russia's banks was also the main driver behind the CBR's decision to create a national digital biometric identification platform.\u00a0</p><p>\"Biometrics is a very expensive technology to implement,\" says Skorobogatova. \"Most banks in Russia cannot afford to invest in it.\u00a0</p><p>\"But if a market features multiple biometric systems, customers will simply never move from one organization to another, because their biometric samples will be different due to different requirements. The Russian market needed a single, secure, high-quality platform.\"</p><p>Launched in mid 2018, the CBR's platform allows banks to open accounts, make money transfers and provide loans to retail customers remotely. Around 200 banks in Russia now collect biometric data through more than 11,000 branches.\u00a0</p><p>Take-up of the service, however, has been slow. By mid December, the number of users registered in the CBR's unified biometric system stood at just over 100,000.</p><p>\"It will take some time for biometrics to gain traction among the wider population because it is a novel concept for most people,\" says Skorobogatova. \"Nevertheless, we are absolutely sure that it is the right way forward.</p><p>\"Today, the platform works for individuals, but we also want to make it available for legal entities, so they can open accounts and carry out operations in a convenient and affordable way. I believe it will take another two to three years before we develop this system to a level we would be satisfied with.\"</p><p>The CBR is also pushing ahead with the development of a digital profile platform. According to Skorobogatova, this will enable secure and fast data exchange between citizens, the state and companies online through a single interface.\u00a0</p><p>\"It will also provide citizens with the ability to manage their data online \"\" transfer it on request or withdraw,\" she adds.\u00a0</p><p>A pilot involving 20 banks, four insurers and government agencies, including the tax service and the state pension fund, was launched in December.\u00a0Regulatory sandbox</p><p>All of these big infrastructure projects were included in the CBR's first digital strategy, which was unveiled in 2017. Even before that, however, Skorobogatova had set the ball rolling on financial technology with the launch of a regulatory sandbox.\u00a0</p><p>Initially, the CBR took a cautious approach to the concept, eschewing the \"~fully open' model adopted by the UK and Switzerland in favour of a more limited facility in which businesses submit innovations to the central bank for testing.\u00a0</p><p>\"Fully open sandboxes have been showing better results, but we stuck to the testing sandbox model in order to minimize risks,\" says Skorobogatova. \"A real sandbox with real customers and real operations requires considerable human and organizational resources to keep everything in check.</p><p>\"We are going to switch to the real sandbox model when the testing sandbox project fulfils its objectives. We have been paying close attention to the Swiss experience, which we consider to be the most relevant case for us.\"</p><p>Applications to the current sandbox are assessed by two committees, one made up of representatives of key state departments \"\" including the finance, digitalization and economy ministries \"\" and the second of market participants.</p><p>Technologies deemed to be sufficiently innovative and to have broad market appeal are tested by the CBR. To date, 46 applications have been received, of which 10 have been successfully tested. These cover areas including electronic signatures, crypto assets, insurance technology (insurtech), digital banking and payments.</p><p> Lots of Russian banks are highly innovative because they are young and ambitious, and the Russian financial market is still highly profitable compared to developed markets\u00a0 \u00a0-\u00a0Olga Skorobogatova </p><p>Surprisingly, given Russia's reputation for technological sophistication and a rapidly growing fintech sector, most applications for the sandbox have come from banks. Skorobogatova says this reflects the unique structure of the Russian banking market.\u00a0</p><p>\"In Europe and the US, numerous fintech companies emerged to fill the gaps in financial services that remained out of reach for traditional banks,\" she says.\u00a0</p><p>\"Russia is different. Lots of Russian banks are highly innovative because they are young and ambitious, and the Russian financial market is still highly profitable compared to developed markets. These banks' models are closer either to big techs or to startups, depending on their size.\"</p><p>In theory, the CBR has been working to encourage the development of the local fintech sector. In January 2017, it launched the Russian Fintech Association \"\" however, the organization is also dominated by large lenders such as Sberbank, VTB and Alfa Bank. The tech sector if represented by the likes of payment services firm Qiwi.</p><p>The association has, however, provided a useful focus for collaboration between its members and the CBR on digital projects.\u00a0</p><p>The two sides have been working together for three years on Masterchain, the first Russian blockchain platform eligible for use in the financial market. It is already in use for electronic mortgage accounting and there are plans to expand it to cover trade-finance functions.</p><p>\"Blockchain is a great fit for things like letters of credit and guarantees because it is essentially a technology of trust,\" says Skorobogatova.</p><p>She is well aware, however, of its limitations.\u00a0</p><p>\"Blockchain is not the universal solution that many people believed it to be five years ago,\" she says. \"I remember being told by some tech companies back then: \"~Olga, in five years everything will be powered by blockchain, there will be no other technologies.'</p><p>\"I responded that this technology would work in cases when it would create additional value but not as a substitution for everything. Time has proven me right.\"\u00a0</p><p>Skorobogatova and her CBR colleagues have been particularly sceptical about cryptocurrencies.\u00a0</p><p>\"We do not believe in them as a means of payment,\" she says. \"They produce major risks for customers due to their high volatility, lack of guarantees for savings, widespread use for money laundering and financing of terrorism, and other aspects.\"</p><p>The CBR has taken a hard line on the issue from the start. Other parts of the Russian government, however, have been less consistent. A draft bill that would have banned cryptocurrencies was scrapped in early 2017 as initial coin offerings became a hot topic.\u00a0</p><p>Three years later, legislation on blockchain, smart contracts and crypto assets has yet to make it to parliament. When it does, it will likely now also cover stablecoins such as Facebook's Libra and Gram.\u00a0</p><p>Skorobogatova takes a more positive view of stablecoins than of cryptocurrencies.\u00a0</p><p>\"We consider them to be a more reliable type of crypto asset,\" she says, \"since they are backed by real assets and provide certain guarantees for individuals and legal entities.\"</p><p>Nevertheless, she is clear that effective regulation of the sector at a global level is essential for consumer protection.\u00a0</p><p>\"We are actively interacting with other regulators on issues of global stablecoins,\" she says. \"At the moment, they see more questions than answers in initiatives such as Libra.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, like many of its central bank counterparts, the CBR is mulling the creation of a national digital currency. Again, Skorobogatova takes a cautious approach.\u00a0</p><p>\"For me, the big question is if there is any added value in using central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) \"\" for the economy, for individuals and for businesses,\" she says. \"Clearly, people want fast digital payments, but this can be implemented with a national fast payments platform.\u00a0</p><p>\"What can CBDCs bring to the table? So far, no one in Russia or elsewhere has been able to give a convincing answer or even to explain the difference between electronic payments and CBDCs.\"Open banking</p><p>Whether a national digital currency will feature in the CBR's digital strategy for 2021 to 2023, which will be published later this year, remains to be seen. Areas that will likely feature prominently include open banking, cloud technology, security and ecosystems.\u00a0</p><p>The CBR has already started work with Russia's banks and other financial institutions on setting standards for open application programming interfaces (APIs).\u00a0</p><p>\"We are analyzing the experience of countries such as Canada, Singapore and the UK,\" says Skorobogatova.\u00a0</p><p>\"We have not decided yet what standards should be obligatory and what should be recommended, but the main idea is that there should be a standardized framework, otherwise market participants will not be able to communicate with each other. We hoped that the market would elaborate such standards, but unfortunately that did not happen.\"</p><p>On cloud technology, Skorobogatova is keen on the concept \"\" the CBR already uses it internally \"\" but is wary of issues around data protection and security.\u00a0</p><p>\"This is one of the key topics for regulators today because it is a fantastic technology, but it also has to be properly managed,\" she says.\u00a0</p><p>\"Clearly, a lot of companies outsource their cloud technology needs because they cannot afford their own cloud storages, so we need to think about how that affects their security. I think it is not clear yet what is the best way to do that.\"</p><p>More broadly, Skorobogatova adds, data protection is a priority for the CBR.\u00a0</p><p>\"The technology used in new products and services is developing incredibly fast, and data protection must keep up,\" she says.\u00a0</p><p>\"Companies have their own policies, but what we see so far is that those are not enough. There have been a few cases of unsatisfactory data management in our country. It is fairly clear that only regulators and governments can set the standards for the whole industry.\"</p><p>The CBR is particularly concerned about the implications for both security and competition of the rapid rise of ecosystems in Russia offering an increasingly wide range of both financial and non-financial products.\u00a0</p><p>Unlike in Asia, where development of the concept has been led by big tech, in Russia it is being driven by banks such as Sberbank and Tinkoff. VTB has also recently entered the fray as part of a big ramp-up of digitalization, launching an online car marketplace in February.</p><p>Some have questioned the viability of the \"~walled-garden' ecosystem in Russia, but Skorobogatova is convinced that it will be successful.\u00a0</p><p>\"People are ready for comprehensive digital services, because the most valuable thing now is time,\" she says. \"But there must be competition in this market, which would not just guarantee the quality of the products but also provide consumers with a variety of options to choose from and ensure better prices.\u00a0</p><p>\"Competition is also necessary for technological development because any monopoly becomes an obstacle for progress sooner or later.\"</p><p>As Skorobogatova notes, however, bank ecosystems present unique challenges for regulators.\u00a0</p><p>\"They do not fit into the existing model of financial market regulation because they combine financial and non-financial services,\" she says. \"This blind spot in regulation can carry significant risks for the financial stability of nations and even of the global economy.\"</p><p>The CBR is therefore mulling a move away from the traditional regulatory model based on licensing institutions towards regulating specific financial activities.\u00a0</p><p>\"The development of ecosystems really forces us to focus on the activities of organizations rather than their names,\" says Skorobogatova.\u00a0Digital marketplace</p><p>Meanwhile, the central bank has become involved in the development of a marketplace for financial services. Another initiative designed to increase competition in the banking sector, the digital marketplace will enable Russian financial institutions of all sizes to reach a broad spectrum of customers.</p><p>\"Many small or medium-sized financial institutions are not able to offer their products and services nationally, particularly in the regions where only the dominant players are present,\" says Skorobogatova. \"But the digital space levels the playing field.\"</p><p>The digital marketplace, which is currently entering the pilot phase, has been developed by the Moscow Exchange with support from the CBR. Initially it will only offer deposits, but the plan is to expand it to include the full range of financial products and services.</p><p>Again, Skorobogatova has been the driving force behind the project at the CBR, adding to the already long list of achievements since her arrival at the central bank.\u00a0</p><p>She says her success is partly down to her commercial banking background.\u00a0</p><p>\"Basically, I do not think that anything is impossible: my mind just ignores obstacles,\" she says. \"I came to the central bank deeply believing that we can do everything. To quote Mark Twain: \"~They did not know it was impossible, so they did it.'\"\u00a0</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1l0tlv3z9q6d0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YPR-4181-JD1P-T04B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3289\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00083FD</classCode><className>SOCIETE GENERALE SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC000515A</classCode><className>ROSBANK OJSC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000266V</classCode><className>VISA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

Let's imagine: Heavy competition, all these companies are making headlines daily with new updates or \"schemes\". But were banks built to handle bits and clicks through Facebook or Google?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to a recent poll by Fujitsu (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fujitsu.com/in/),which\">http://www.fujitsu.com/in/),which</url>, 20 percent of respondents out of 7,000 surveyed consumers said they would use Facebook, Google or Amazon to buy banking or insurance services if available. The reason is simple- they expect big banks to keep rolling out technology innovations at the same pace that tech companies do and if that doesn't happen, 37 percent would leave their banking or insurance provider.</p><p>The study revealed, \"Consumers are showing they are open to innovative services to make their lives easier, with 32 percent already embracing mobile device payments; while 22 percent have adopted wearable technologies and 20 percent crypto-currencies, the latter driven by Eastern Europe usage where 44 percent say they use the technology.\"</p><p>Francois Fleutiaux, senior vice president and head of sales, EMEIA, Fujitsu said, \"Today's customers are no longer guarded. When it makes interaction more convenient they are willing to embrace innovation. They may not know where they need it until it is offered, but this is where technology comes to the fore - it is the engine that is driving consumer expectations forward and the financial services sector has to live up to this new pace of change.\"</p><p>Well, way before the study report, Google has been philandering with the idea through a series of small, but significant financial services.</p><p>The Great Bank of Google Ltd?</p><p>Google already has Android Pay, a simple and safe way to pay with your Android phone at over one million store locations across the US and within mobile apps. It is essentially an interface between your existing credit and debit cards, your phone and NFC card readers in stores - Google Wallet, which is an older, clunkier version that Pay was supposed to replace.</p><p>You can send money through Google, too and Facebook does the same. However, Amazon has taken a different step by offering loans to thousands of invited sellers in its marketplace.</p><p>But, why is it that these ideas are not transforming into formal financial services from these tech companies. First and foremost are regulations. The procedure is so long that it will take a small private bank more than four years to get its license in the UK.</p><p>In America, you have to go from state-to-state applying for a contract to do business. Now imagine doing that from country to country. The outcome will be a slow, cumbersome business, unlike Google, Amazon or Facebook.</p><p>The business of Banking</p><p>Giant financial institutions can twist these \"giant tech companies\" within few minutes; all they have to do is remove support. Financial institutions like Barclays can easily tell its 48 million global customers that it will no longer let them send money through the social network, which will definitely create a big hole of loss for tech companies.</p><p>In comparison with the financial industry that spends more than a billion dollars promoting the US government, the tech industry spends 100 times less.</p><p>Other options than banking</p><p>Google can learn from Curve, which allows users to combine all their existing cards from different banks into one card that is accepted everywhere. It presents all of that data on your phone, in real time. Mondo, a British startup which has created a card that you can use like the one a bank would issue but without the hassle.</p><p>In March 2015 the Economist Intelligence Unit, when conducting a survey of the retail banking sector, found 25 percent of respondents felt technology could most effectively help banks know their customers better, and knowing people is Google's business already.</p><p>According to the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, cash reserves and assets will become less important than the digital movement of money online because of the ongoing growth of non-cash payments.</p><p>These big tech companies are in prime position to offer smaller, more constrained financial services without ever becoming what we'd traditionally think of as a bank. Compared with the banking industry, Google already knows what you tap into its search engine. Facebook knows what ethnicity you are purely by what you like. Amazon knows what you want before you'll buy it.</p><p>Where most banks fall in categories like UX (User Experience) and customer service, Amazon could easily roll out a service that is, quick, easy to use and offers more one-on-one guidance to better money management as it prides itself on these two things.</p><p>Peter Simon, head of information at Barclays says, \"It is more likely, like you see on Amazon, about being able to offer installment credit, because you can make a 20-30 percent return on that with the data you have, without necessarily having to open a branch.\"</p><p>It simply means, a more exciting future waits for us!!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CIOL-0017487636</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOL2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JPT-PWW1-JB5M-W132-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365403</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"841\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 CIOL, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CIOL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 7, 2016 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002LC4</classCode><className>FUJITSU LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>6702 (TSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp;

This was trickling into the financial industry. People would talk about incorporating \"~lean' or \"~agile' thinking into bank's innovation processes, without understanding what it really meant.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fintechs, he felt, might have come to dominate the digital consumer banking debate, \"but they had challenges scaling to wholesale banking. Over the next five years a number of banks... started talking about self-disruption.\"\u00a0</p><p>Slowly, traditional lenders stemmed the drift and rediscovered their sense of purpose.\u00a0<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Victor Alexiev,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Citi</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>In a former life, Alexiev, a Bulgarian national living in Singapore, was a serial entrepreneur, founder of technology firm Hacker.Works and a digital consultancy called Innovator. But in February 2018 Citi called and asked him to head up the Asia arm of D10X, its internal incubator. The US bank wanted to invent, pursue and integrate so-called \"~moonshot' digital ideas that actually worked. Alexiev signed up.\u00a0This in itself is important. In recent years, lenders such as Citi \"\" and Singapore's DBS and Spain's BBVA \"\" have started to reassert control of the debate about digital disruption in banking.\u00a0\"They got their mojo back,\" says Alexiev. \"They worked out how to absorb and co-opt the best talent, and how to manage the disruption they were facing, mitigate it and lobby to dictate the speed and nature of change.\"\u00a0Alexiev is a prime example of poacher turning gamekeeper.\u00a0\"I didn't expect to end up in banking,\" he admits. \"But I've had a positive experience in Citi. Banks finally got around to asking themselves how startups could successfully launch a product at a fraction of the cost and time, and scale it rapidly to compete for market share. Their response was to hire the right staff \"\" entrepreneurs, engineers and digital agency folks \"\" incubate and innovate and start internally disrupting.\"Banks don't have all the answers. At every level of scale and geography, you still find over-staffed institutions only dimly aware of the dangers of disruption. Even big lenders, warns Standard Chartered's Singapore chief executive, Patrick Lee, face a permanent threat of disruption by one another, big tech and new tech.\u00a0Banks \"are all operating off legacy platforms that are like mazes, like a bundle of things interacting with each other,\" he says. \"Disruption will come on the wholesale side when new financial providers come in with new technology stacks, new banking stacks, built from scratch.\"So, we have to invest. It's very expensive, but we have to upgrade our existing technology.\"\u00a0That's what everyone is doing in a desperate race to stay ahead of peers and abreast of the rapidly changing needs of customers.\u00a0This reflects the relentless intrusion of digital into every aspect of banking. If the 2010s were all about retail and the emergence of fintech, neobanks and challenger banks, this decade will be a whirlwind of change impacting everything a financial institution does.\u00a0Focal pointSingapore is a geographic and regulatory focal point of this change.\u00a0Lee says the city is the bank's \"global centre for technology and innovation\", a place where \"strategy, thought leadership and ideas are [all] incubated\".\u00a0Last summer, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced plans to issue five new virtual banking licences by June 2020. Two are full-service digital licences; the other three will allow successful bidders to set up new digital wholesale banks to serve local companies.\u00a0Why MAS chose this approach is unclear. One informed Singapore banker says it was \"stung by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) getting a jump on it.\"\u00a0The HKMA disbursed its first batch of virtual licences in March 2019.\u00a0\"They wanted to do something different and attention-grabbing, thus its move on wholesale.\"Because this is Singapore, the financial regulator has been careful to moderate the impact and speed of change.\u00a0<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dennis Khoo,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TMRW Digital</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"This approach is a balanced one that will drive some innovation and competition, but not so much that it sends the industry into hyper-competition,\" says Dennis Khoo, regional head at TMRW Digital Group, Singapore lender UOB's first fully digital bank.\u00a0The trio of winning wholesale providers will at first be encouraged to serve small and medium-sized enterprises.\u00a0SMEs make up 99% of local companies and account for 72% of all jobs. But many, particularly in technology and the creative industries, are ignored entirely by traditional lenders.\u00a0One banker describes the city state as a \"sophisticated financial market with pockets of the underserved\".\u00a0What wider impact will the successful licensees have, each of which has stumped up S$100 million ($71 million) in paid-up capital? Probably very little at first. The winners won't be announced until June 2020. They will then carefully roll out new services and products under the watchful eye of the regulator.\u00a0<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Eugene Tarzimanov,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Moody's</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>If the MAS likes what it sees, it will expand a licence-holder's ambit. Over time, says Eugene Tarzimanov, Asia senior credit officer at Moody's financial institutions group, the new providers will aim to start \"hooking up SMEs to innovative products \"\" cash management budgeting, supplier financing. If you create a one-stop-shop for an SME and you are good and reliable, they are never going to leave you.\"Any immediate pain is likely to be incurred by smaller foreign-owned banks with \"modest domestic franchises\", says Tarzimanov.\u00a0He tips Malaysia's Maybank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) to feel the immediate squeeze as the new lenders grow in scale and confidence.\u00a0\"[Some] banks will need to rethink how they operate in Singapore and how they fund themselves and price their products, as a new entrant will just jack up the deposit rates to get more funding in.\"The regulator, insiders say, will likely reward applicants that offer something new. That could mean digital excellence in combating money laundering and helping clients meet compliance demands. Or it might stem from the ability to crunch the numbers to reveal good and overlooked but unbanked enterprises.\u00a0Being able to \"~moneyball' digital data better than one's rivals will help new banks compete with much larger but locally peripheral lenders.\u00a0To that end, it is \"perhaps no surprise\", notes StanChart's Lee, that \"a lot of the applicants for the new wholesale licences are from China, given their firms are able to use algorithmic technology to determine credit decisions. That is a clear area for disruption.\"\u00a0'Ripe for disruption'So is a decision by a canny regulator keen to get a jump on other jurisdictions the tipping point, the moment that disruption begins to encompass all levels of non-retail banking?<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tan Su Shan,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">DBS</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Yes and no. It's hard to argue when Tan Su Shan, head of institutional banking at DBS, describes the entire wholesale banking space as \"ripe for disruption\". Or when her colleague Han Kwee Juan, group head of strategy at the Singapore lender, adds that the \"next phase of digital disruption will be everywhere.\"But when the book is written on digital disruption, this particular chapter won't start with a bidding war instigated by Singapore's financial regulator.\u00a0Wholesale banking, says Debopama Sen, Citi's head of treasury and trade solutions for Singapore and Asean, has already \"been changing for a number of years. It's not always a noticeable process as it doesn't impact thousands of consumers.\"What services, products, platforms and divisions face the greatest or gravest threats over the next few years?\u00a0The answer depends who you speak to.\u00a0DBS chief executive Piyush Gupta notes that in \"some ways the large corporates have been disrupted. They all went electronic a long time ago, using algorithms on trading flows. Look at FX: two or three of the top five global players didn't exist a few years ago.\"\u00a0<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Joris Dierckx,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">BNP Paribas</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"Now, it's all about high-frequency providers,\" adds Joris Dierckx, head of southeast Asia at BNP Paribas. \"FX was a big earner for banks. It isn't any more. You have to do volume instead.\"\u00a0That's disruption at work. The complex and costly know-your-customer (KYC) process is slowly being mutualized, as banks and corporates recognize the value of outsourcing it to specialist industry bodies.UOB's Khoo reckons there is still a \"huge opportunity\" for banks looking to help large corporates to grow their business and to improve productivity.\u00a0\"We are already doing so in areas such as digitizing cash management and operational processes, as well as offering them seamless connectivity and specialized expertise through our FDI [foreign direct investment] advisory and sector solutions group to help them expand across the region.\"Most banks \"\" and UOB is no exception \"\" are looking to help the CFO,\" he adds. \"That might mean better forecasting, hedging or supply chain management.\"In turn, Citi's Alexiev points to the daily machinations of any well-staffed treasury team.\"Many of [a corporation's] cash-management flows are predictable,\" he says. \"If a treasurer always pays salaries on the last Friday of each month, well, this is a process that can be automated and digitized. You don't have to action everything. Disruption in wholesale should make banking less visible and intrusive [and] more naturally integrated in the business workflows. That is one of the key reasons you are seeing corporates outsourcing their treasury functions to banks.\"As is so often the case, DBS is ahead of the curve. Its 2018 annual report promises to make banking invisible, while executives already describe their employer as the \"~Disappearing Bank of Singapore'.\u00a0Alexiev neatly breaks down disruption into short, medium and more distant time horizons. As well as the treasury function, he points to lending, where change is \"already visible\". He adds asset management to that list.\u00a0\"There is so much interest in blockchain,\" he says, \"in what it can deliver to institutional investors and large-scale banks, in terms of separating income streams from assets and reaching small investors with smaller ticket sizes, resulting in a larger market with more liquidity.\" [Raof Latiff] came in and banged [a book] on the table. He said: \"~My father Ibrahim wrote this 30 years ago.' So I read it cover to cover and, guess what, it's still totally relevant today. Trade hasn't changed\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Tan Su Shan, DBS Lee points to payments, transaction banking and forex as \"three areas that will see a lot of disruption\", allowing banks to \"come in and automate and move very quick and offer better cost-efficient services for clients. We are already seeing it \"\" FX margins have come down and blockchain technology will further bring down costs by aggregating large blocks of payments and flows.\"A little further ahead, Alexiev tips trade finance, once impervious to disruption due to the sheer weight of paperwork, to be next to face the winds of change. He points to the example of Geneva-based Komgo, a platform that uses blockchain to digitize letters of credit, speeding up KYC checks and streamlining trade and commodity finance. Its shareholders include Citi, MUFG and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\u00a0\"It reduces the quantity of paper that can be tampered with or forged,\" Alexiev says. \"Given the shaky nature of geopolitics these days and the changing nature of rules, more companies are treating supply chains as networks, which helps boost their resilience. For banks, the ability to visualize entire supply chains and networks is imperative, and Komgo lets us track every shipment and money flow. It's the kind of friendly disruption that helps us and our clients to understand risk.\"Many banks are walking the same path. In January 2019, Standard Chartered completed its first blockchain-enabled cross-border trade in Singapore.\u00a0The transaction for local firm Agrocorp involved the purchase of agricultural goods from Australia's GrainCorp, which were resold to a customer in Bangladesh. StanChart said it cut the transaction time to 24 hours from a typical five to seven days.\u00a0TradeTrade is the venue where disruption is perhaps most greatly coveted by banks and the corporates they serve. When DBS's Tan was promoted to run institutional banking in February 2019, after nine years overseeing consumer banking and wealth management, she was immediately handed a book by Raof Latiff, group head of digital and institutional banking.\u00a0\"He came in and banged it on the table,\" Tan remembers. \"He said: \"~My father Ibrahim wrote this 30 years ago.' So I read it cover to cover and, guess what, it's still totally relevant today. Trade hasn't changed.\"\u00a0And yet it has, as she reveals when talk turns to the nature of shipping goods from source to completion, via any number of trucks, container vessels and aeroplanes, not to mention lawyers, bankers and inspectors.\u00a0Tan points to an open-source blockchain trade platform developed by, among others, DBS; commodities trader Trafigura; the IMDA, a Singapore government body that sits under the information ministry; and distributed-ledger developer Perlin.Launched in November 2019, the ICC TradeFlow platform \"allows every participant to talk to every other participant on a global mother-of-everything open-sourced platform, entirely powered by blockchain,\" she says. \"I can see where the tax is paid and where a shipment is at a given moment. It cuts costs, time and a lot of fraud, and gives everyone a common language and legal framework. It is a purely and positively disruptive experience.\" [Avatec.ai] is exclusive to us. If it's successful, we could open it up. Who knows, if it is gets really big, it could be a unicorn\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0Frederick Chin, UOB When we speak in mid February 2020, the first shipment has just been completed: $20 million of iron ore, moved by Trafigura from Africa to China. It took 20 days door to door, cutting the average transit time by more than half.\u00a0That it is open source means that \"everyone, including other banks, can opt in and use it\", says Tan. \"We wanted to jump-start the industry and get our anchor clients onto the platform. We were guinea pigs, but we were willing guinea pigs.\"The same month, DBS completed its first trade-finance transaction on Singapore's Networked Trade Platform (NTP), a two-year-old state-backed system that aims to make the city a global leader in trade finance. The transaction involved a $3.5 million letter of credit, issued for Audi Singapore and local firm Premium Automobiles.\u00a0Several global lenders, including HSBC, China's ICBC and BNP Paribas, have signed up to CamelOne, which connects to NTP, and is described by Sofia Hammoucha, head of transaction banking southeast Asia at BNP Paribas as \"Singapore's first multi-bank trade finance portal\", designed with a \"full range of customers in mind, from small and medium-sized companies to large corporates.\"<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Frederick Chin,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">UOB</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Another of Singapore's big three lenders, UOB, is busy \"building a trade supply-chain platform that aims to capture business flowing across two corridors: intra-Asean and China-Asean, accounting for $1.3 trillion worth of annual trade,\" notes group head of wholesale banking Frederick Chin.\u00a0Products available on the platform on its launch, he says, will include account opening, invoicing, factoring and trade finance.\u00a0UOB is also working to offer digital pre-shipment finance and has built a credit engine called Avatec.ai in partnership with Beijing-based software firm Pintec.\u00a0\"[It] is exclusive to us,\" says Chin. \"If it's successful, we could open it up. Who knows, if it is gets really big, it could be a unicorn.\"Disruption beyond retail is a moveable feast, with services and divisions more or less open to positive dislocation, depending on a bank and its customers' ability and willingness to embrace change.\u00a0Citi's Alexiev points to a few areas he deems more resistant to change. One is M&amp;A advisory, while private banking, certainly at the higher end of the spectrum, is another.\u00a0\"If you are talking about a personal fortune of billions of dollars, you are going to want to talk to a relationship manager, even if you are a millennial,\" says a senior Singapore banker. \"As a rule, disruption is easier when you have a larger market with similar needs or well-established with niches that are un-serviced or under-serviced.\"Customer needsBankers say disruption across wholesale is driven increasingly by the needs of the customer. Many see the present day as an inflexion point, a moment when corporates stop waiting for disruption to happen and start to demand it from financial providers.\u00a0<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Debopama Sen,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Citi</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Citi's Sen points to the example of a treasurer processing personal transactions on her cell phone in the morning and then expecting corporate life to be just as helpfully and simply digitized.\u00a0</p><p>\"You are naturally going to expect the same level of digital service you get from your retail provider,\" she notes.</p><p>At one level, that can mean helping clients to reach customers with greater speed and efficiency by giving them more payment options. But the whole treasury process \"\" how a firm pays suppliers, manages liquidity and does cross-border payments \"\" also needs to move in that direction.\u00a0</p><p>Sen points to the example of a Chinese or Indian multinational keen to expand into southeast Asia: \"They'll be looking to access other markets in the region and will want to be digital on day one. They don't want to be analogue.\"</p><p>Typically, the first questions clients ask are also the most straightforward: how fast can they open in a new market, when can they start selling and how wide a net can be thrown over their customer base.\u00a0</p><p>\"They don't want to approach each market separately \"\" they want the same e-banking and mobile banking experience in each of them,\" says Sen.</p><p>Not long ago, that was a sticking point.\u00a0</p><p>\"Banking has traditionally taken a long time to open accounts, several weeks,\" Sen adds. \"We made that process faster and more seamless. In the 10 markets in Asia where Citi has digital on-boarding, our clients don't need paper documents or signatures to open an account. It can be done digitally in as little as two days.\u00a0</p><p>\"It doesn't sound exciting, but it's actually a huge change. It impacts how fast you can enter a market, how fast you can start doing business and how fast it can take to pay employees.\"</p><p>Citi intends to introduce the same speedy on-boarding process wherever it operates across Asia, she adds.\u00a0</p><p>\"We are connected to instant payments schemes in 10 Asian markets, which offer domestic payments 24/7 online and in real time.\u00a0</p><p>\"Over time, our cross-border payments networks will plug into our domestic instant payment platforms wherever possible.\"</p><p>While banks have wrested back control of the disruption debate, they still face three types of pressure.\u00a0</p><p>One is the client's expectation of better and more streamlined service.\u00a0</p><p>The second is the need to convince talented graduates and seasoned professionals that joining a bank, or remaining on board, is the best way to a better future.\u00a0</p><p>Number three is the challenge of adapting to a world where disruption will happen at an increasingly rapid pace and in ways no one can fully foresee.\u00a0</p><p>This might involve, say, a sudden and widespread adoption of blockchain, or the positive threat of a bank building a \"~black-box' of client, market and transactional data so valuable, it comes under pressure from investors to spin it off.\u00a0</p><p>More immediately, banks will need to adapt as some products become so cheap to run they are provided for free, much as telecoms firms now bundle a landline into an internet package.\u00a0</p><p>BNP Paribas' Dierckx notes: \"Revenues from payments will be zero at some point \"\" it will be provided by payments banks who will offer that service but won't ask clients to pay for it.\u00a0</p><p>\"Across wholesale banking \"\" in corporate, investment and institutional banking \"\" the revenue pool has been shrinking for five years. So for us to grow, we either have to take market share or cut costs, or both,\" he adds. \"Banks can make disruption work for them, but you have to be a top-10 global player by revenues for that to succeed.\"\u00a0</p><p>We are not at the start of disruption in wholesale banking, but it is fair to say we are probably at the end of the beginning.

David Heinemeier Hansson, a tech entrepreneur, said he had been offered 20 times more credit than his wife.</p><p>The Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak said he and his wife, who share all the same assets, faced similar problems with the Goldman Sachs-run algorithm, which is now under <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/30/apple-earnings-beat-third-quarter-predictions\">formal investigation by a US regulator.</url></p><p> The same thing happened to us.

McAteer said technology could amplify bias.</p><p>\"A lot of the business models are built around standard males with average earnings, with certain predictable patterns of earnings growth. There's a risk that those that exhibit different behaviour end up being discriminated against,\" said McAteer, who now runs the Financial Inclusion Centre, a thinktank.</p><p>In the UK, firms are not allowed to segment customers based on gender, race or physical ability, but it has become easier to identify customers based on technical analysis of data such as spending habits and income.</p><p>\"The whole point of this tech is to allow very, very precise profiling to people's behaviour.

Some firms decided to scrap the use of that data after the regulator said it contained information that could identify race or ethnicity.

Diversity is therefore imperative at all levels of all companies, from those who work in engineering through customer-facing roles and in the leadership team.\"</p><p>Responding to the Apple Card controversy, Goldman Sachs said all its credit applications were evaluated on income and creditworthiness factors such as personal credit scores and debt levels. \"Based on these factors, it is possible for two family members to receive significantly different credit decisions. In all cases, we have not and will not make decisions based on factors like gender.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-57751217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGF-C4H1-F021-62NF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"650\"/><timeReceived>4:23 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Or at least that's what many banks, credit card issuers and merchants hope.</p><p>Big banks like Bank of America, Chase, Citibank, and Wells Fargo are running pilot programs in major metropolitan areas like New York, Washington, Atlanta and San Francisco. Even though contactless cards are still officially in testing phase, users already number in the millions.</p><p>Users can wave these cards around today at more than 30,000 shopping establishments, from local cafes to national chains like McDonald'sand Arby's. That number is small compared to the total number of U.S. shopping establishments, but the number of merchants accepting contactless cards will surely increase, said Mike Friedman, director of emerging technologies at Mercator Advisory Group, a research firm focusing on the payments industry.</p><p>\"Contactless lets merchants speed up transactions, take smaller payments . . . and push more customers down the checkout line,\" he said, adding that flashing instead of swiping the card reduces transaction time by 25 percent.</p><p>Some contactless systems are connected to credit cards, adding purchases to account balances. Others work like gift cards, with specific amounts loaded into each card or key fob. Some are reloadable, carrying a value that can be replenished as it is used up.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cost and security issues </emphasis><br/>The major drawback is the cost of the terminals. Many smaller merchants are reluctant to shell out for the machines when the cards are not yet widespread. \"It's a chicken-and-egg scenario,\" said Friedman. \"The cost of a new terminal in just one store can be tremendously expensive, especially when this technology is not yet proven as a sure thing.\"</p><p>Another issue is security. A recent survey of Generation X and Y members by research firm Market Platform Dynamics found that more than 60 percent said they wouldn't use contactless fobs or cards because of security concerns. Dave Kudrna, vice president of business development at Dataflo Consulting of Omaha, a data collection technology firm, said contactless cards could embolden identity thieves. \"They don't have to hand a stolen card to a cashier or even show it. You walk up and it never leaves your hand. It's far easier than a fake ID.\"</p><p>The security issue revolves around the technology used in contactless cards called radio frequency identification, or RFID. It is used mostly in the warehouse and distribution industry to track goods because of its radio signal that can broadcast widely and at high speeds to track inventory all over a warehouse or store.</p><p>The RFID in contactless cards has a far weaker radio frequency, which reaches no more than a few inches from the card reader. And each transaction is encoded with its own special dynamic pass code when connecting with the reader, meaning no one else can pull the number out of the air and use it without the card. \"The RFID chips are not broadcasting info but they are providing security to the card,\" said Friedman. \"And if the card is used for anything over $25, the merchant must still take a signature.\"</p><p>And as with any type of credit or debit card, a contactless cardholder is not responsible for unauthorized purchases if the card is lost or stolen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hold the deposit envelope </emphasis>Banks are also introducing advanced ATMs with no-envelope deposits. The benefits: Your receipt shows a copy of your deposited check and the numbers and denominations of deposited cash bills. Plus, you get faster access to deposited funds.</p><p>\"It's an easier process and there's a greater comfort level because you can see the image of each check on your receipt, said Bank of America spokesperson Betty Reiss. Bank of America has tested 250 of these machines in the Carolinas, Phoenix, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. over the past year and will continue to roll them out nationwide this year and next.</p><p>The new ATM technology is expanding rapidly because of the new Federal regulation popularly known as \"Check 21\", which allows the image of a check to be as legally valid as the check itself. Now when consumers deposit a check, the check image can be electronically transferred to the issuing bank, which will clear the funds in much faster time.</p><p>The new machines also quell legal concerns about the one-sided receipts from standard ATMs, because they only reflects information you keyed in on the keypad and fail to legally prove you actually deposited that actual amount.</p><p>With the new technology, you don't need to key in an amount. Just insert your money into a slot and the machine sorts, counts and verifies it. The scanned check images and your total deposit amount appear on the ATM screen. You must confirm whether the amount is correct. If not, you can cancel your transaction, and the machine quickly spits out your cash. If you experience a mechanical failure or another problem while making a deposit, the ATM logs a record of your information as well as the machine malfunction.</p><p>Like contactless credit card readers, these new ATMs are not cheap to install, but banks are betting they're worth the cost. In its year-long pilot, Bank of America found that the number of new ATM deposits increased an average of 50% per day.</p><p>Friedman thinks the new machines will replace the standard ATMs. \"Customers are finding it much easier and more convenient. And banks don't make big tech decisions without proven business cases.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSNBCM-15389063</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MSNBCM2006</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4M6P-HRP0-TXCJ-G3BR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">298480</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1046\"/><timeReceived>11:59 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 MSNBC.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MSNBC.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>October 26, 2006 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001YS7</classCode><className>MCDONALD'S CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp; CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>MCD (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>WFC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>BAC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>BAC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>8648 (TSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CUO5</classCode><className>CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000781</classCode><className>GENERATION X</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST00096SA</classCode><className>BRAND EQUITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp; SURVEYS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX000205</classCode><className>BRANDING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000424</classCode><className>CREDIT CARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CUO5</classCode><className>CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XSL</classCode><className>RETAILERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N722211SS</classCode><className>FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000959L</classCode><className>PREPAID CARDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST00096SA</classCode><className>BRAND EQUITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX000205</classCode><className>BRANDING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

BankMobile, BBVA USA, BMO Harris, The Coastal Community Bank, First Independence Bank (a federally designated minority depository institution) and SEFCU will join Citi and Stanford Federal Credit Union in the offering beginning next year.   \u201cWe are thrilled to be collaborating with Google to offer our student customers enhanced digital bank accounts,\u201d Luvleen Sidhu , BankMobile\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said on Monday (Aug. 3) in announcing the bank\u2019s agreement with Google.     Google\u2019s banking services strategy is an effort to reinvent the banking experience for consumers by enabling them to connect commerce to their customers underlying bank accounts via Google Pay . These \u201csmart DDAs\u201d leverage the Google Pay front end and existing compliant bank account infrastructure to provide consumers with an end-to-end view of their money to more efficiently budget and plan their spend. Consumers get to keep their existing banking relationship, but receive real-time, value-added financial management services based on spending patterns and goals.   BankMobile said in a statement that such a system will enable both the firm and Google to \u201cbring the best of their respective strengths to the table. Google\u2019s expertise in building great user experiences and a highly-scaled and secure infrastructure is a great complement to BankMobile\u2019s financial and regulatory expertise and its unique customer acquisition funnel in the higher education segment.\u201d   BankMobile, a division of Pennsylvania-based Customers Bank, serves about one in every three U.S. college-bound students through relationships with 800 campuses nationwide. Sidhu said the firm\u2019s new contract with Google will allow millions more U.S. students to access the Google Pay app.   \u201cMany of our student customers today are struggling to manage their money as they work part-time and attend school,\u201d she said. \u201cThrough our collaboration with Google, we believe we can provide these students with the appropriate financial tools to help them navigate through these difficult situations successfully.\u201d   Felix Lin , vice president of payments ecosystems at Google, said partnering with BankMobile will enable a digital experience \u201cthat is equitable for all and meets the evolving needs of a new generation of customers. We believe that we can use our technology expertise to benefit users, banks and the entire financial ecosystem.\u201d     A Google spokesperson confirmed that the tech giant has also reached similar deals with the five other institutions.   \u201cThese digital banking experiences [and] built-in partnership will help simplify how users manage their finances,\u201d the source said. \u201cBy working with a diverse group of financial institutions, we hope to make the benefits of digital banking accessible to a wider group of people.\u201d   The Google spokesperson added that the new digital bank accounts \u201cwill leverage Google Pay\u2019s expertise in consumer tech and secure digital infrastructure to complement the banking partners\u2019 financial and regulatory expertise. Financial institutions will be able to reduce their servicing costs, fight fraud and enhance their consumer offerings. Bank customers will benefit from useful insights and budgeting tools while keeping their money in an FDIC- or NCUA-insured account.\u201d   According to PYMNTS research , although the vast majority of consumers are satisfied with their banks, nearly 40 percent of them would be \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d likely to exploring a primary banking services relationship with a Big Tech or FinTech.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    New PYMNTS Study: Subscription Commerce Conversion Index \u2013 July 2020     Staying home 24/7 has consumers turning to subscription services for both entertainment and their day-to-day needs. While that\u2019s a great opportunity for providers, it also presents a challenge \u2014 27.4 million consumers are looking to cancel their subscriptions because of friction and cost concerns. In the latest Subscription Commerce Conversion Index , PYMNTS reveals the five key features that can help companies keep subscribers loyal despite today\u2019s challenging economic times.

The company selected the nonprofits for their work in North Texas to address issues fundamental to economic mobility, community revitalization, and affordable housing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The awards are part of the $4 million Bank of America has contributed to local nonprofits so far in 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As an awardee, each organization receives a $200,000 grant, a year of leadership training for the executive director and an emerging leader at the organization, a network of peer organizations across the U.S., and the opportunity to access capital to expand their impact.</p><p> Over the past 15 years, Bank of America has invested $240 million in 49 communities through Neighborhood Builders, partnering with more than 1,000 nonprofits and helping more than 2,000 nonprofit leaders strengthen their leadership skills.</p><p>BofA announced the awards at the 2019 North Texas Bank of America Foundation Celebration at the Gaylord Texan on Nov. 7.</p><p> \"Through a program like Neighborhood Builders, nonprofits have the power to grow strategically and advance sustainable growth in the area. Bank of America has invested over $1 million in South Dallas through partnerships with organizations like Jubilee Park,\" said Jennifer Chandler, Dallas market president, Bank of America.</p><p> Jubilee Park and Community Center is a catalyst for community renewal and enrichment in the Jubilee Park Neighborhood, a 62-block area in southeast Dallas.</p><p> \"We see every day the impact that organizations like Jubilee Park and 6 Stones are making in DFW and we are excited to contribute to their successes,\" said Mike Pavell, Fort Worth Market President, Bank of America.</p><p> 6 Stones, based in Bedford, will launch a mentoring program to help people it serves achieve economic mobility. 6 Stones spurs hope that transforms lives, homes and communities by building a coalition of churches, businesses, and others that provide solutions to meet residents' needs in the area.</p><p> \"Many of the people who come to us for help with food, clothing, school supplies and other basic needs have been entrapped in generational poverty,\" said Jennifer Leney, executive director, 6 Stones. \"Our current programs help to cover their immediate needs so that they can stabilize. Now, with support from Bank of America, we will be able to lead our neighbors into the next chapter of their lives: security that leads to growth. We believe that leveraging our amazing volunteer base to address communitywide issues through personal mentoring will not only empower the families we serve but also build a thriving community: one household at a time.\"</p><p> Since 2004, through its Neighborhood Builders program, Bank of America has partnered with nearly 50 nonprofits in Dallas-Fort Worth, investing $9 million to provide financial education and economic mobility opportunities in North Texas.</p><p> Paul Quinn, JP Morgan partner on work college</p><p> As part of its expansion into Plano, located 32 miles north of its campus in southern Dallas, Paul Quinn College has partnered with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. to give 22 students an opportunity to work at the state's largest bank.</p><p>Paul Quinn College (PQC) is the first Urban Work College in America and the only minority-serving federally-funded work college in the Work College Consortium. PQC created the Urban Work College Model in 2015 to provide students the opportunity to gain paid, real-world work experiences while completing their academic requirements.</p><p> \"We are so proud to partner with JPMorgan Chase. Through our partnership with JPMorgan Chase and their Advancing Black Pathways initiative, we are able to provide our students with opportunities that they have dreamed about and expose them business, finance, and technology at the highest levels,\" said Dr. Michael J. Sorrell, president, Paul Quinn College. \"We have created a new version of higher education that guarantees its students a way out of poverty. We are thankful that JPMorgan Chase believes in our program and our students.\"</p><p> By requiring residential students to work 20 hours per week and allowing them to use part of their compensation to defray the cost of attendance and cutting tuition and fees by almost $10,000, PQC has created a model where its students graduate without accumulating insurmountable debt.</p><p> The partnership with JPMorgan Chase is a major step forward in enlisting new corporate partners in the program, which currently has 138 student participants.</p><p> \"Growing up in Harlem, an internship like this would have been a life changing event,\" said Plano Mayor Harry LaRosiliere. \"These Paul Quinn Scholars are from all over the country \u2013 New York, Detroit, Oakland, Chicago \u2013 and they are going to be employed, build their business network and acquire a first-class education right here in Plano. This partnership is going to make an incredible difference in their lives.\"</p><p> LaRosiliere sponsors the Plano Mayor's Summer Internship Program. Approaching its seventh year, it gives outstanding public high school students an opportunity to work for some of the area's most prestigious businesses, including JPMorgan Chase. To date, 562 students have participated in summer internships. Forty percent of the students are first-generation college-bound.</p><p> This effort is part of a broader plan by JPMorgan Chase, the state's largest bank, to hire 4,000 black students over the next five years through the firm's Advancing Black Pathways program, which is investing to help black people make gains in three key areas: education, careers and wealth.</p><p> \"We're committed to expanding our partnerships with historically black colleges and universities and are being intentional in our work to cultivate black talent,\" said Sekou Kaalund, the Head of Advancing Black Pathways. \"As America's largest bank, it's our responsibility to make sure we're hiring from the most diverse pool of candidates possible while creating pathways to long-term success for traditionally underrepresented groups.\"</p><p> Additional foundational partners of the PQC-Plano expansion include:</p><p>   Aimbridge Hospitality</p><p>   Ampex Brands</p><p>Bank of America</p><p>FedEx</p><p>   JCPenney</p><p>   Liberty Mutual</p><p>McDonalds</p><p>   NTT Data</p><p> - FWBP Staff</p><p>Google plans to offer checking accounts</p><p>Google plans to add checking accounts from Citigroup and a credit union to its Google Pay digital wallet in 2020, the tech company said Nov. 13.</p><p>Google confirmed an earlier report by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p> Big tech companies have been pushing into other arenas such as finance and health care to gain more access to consumer data. Google launched Google Wallet in 2011, now called Google Pay, which lets users store credit and debit card information and use them to make mobile and digital payments.</p><p> Now the Mountain View, California-based tech giant wants to add checking accounts.</p><p> \"We're exploring how we can partner with banks and credit unions in the U.S. to offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p> The move would let users use Google Pay but keep money in accounts that meet the federal regulatory standards for banks. While Google is working with Citigroup and Stanford Credit Union now, it hopes to add more partners in the future.</p><p> In the U.S., more than 2,000 banks already offer virtual card transactions via Google Pay, Google said.</p><p> The push comes at a time when regulators are looking into privacy practices by firms including Google and Facebook so the deals are likely to be scrutinized.</p><p>Citigroup did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p> \u2013 Associated Press</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTX-e8fa7ceb6d748617d458b749944194623ae264</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899E9F9D8920D NWBKTX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XHV-GYF1-JBCN-4377-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401983</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1277\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fort Worth Business Press<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Schlagartig wurde deutlich, wie abh\u00e4ngig die Banken von den gro\u00dfen Internetkonzernen bereits sind (Vgl. dazu: Das Ende der digitalen Souver\u00e4nit\u00e4t der Banken #2[1]). Das w\u00e4re noch zu verschmerzen, wenn die Amazon .... nicht schon selber im Banking aktiv w\u00e4ren - mehr noch: Sie dehnen ihren Aktionsradius kontinuierlich aus. Mit PSD2, die Amazon als Grund f\u00fcr den Alexa-Stopp angibt, bekommen sie mehr oder weniger freien Zugang zu den Kontodaten der Bankkunden, sofern diese zustimmen. </p><p>Bereits im Jahr 2013 bescheinigte ein Beitrag Amazon hohes Potenzial im Banking (Vgl. dazu:\u00a0Amazon hat Banking-Potenzial[2]). \u00dcber seine Lending Service hat Amazon bereits 3 Mrd. Dollar an kleine und mittelst\u00e4ndische Unternehmen ausgeliehen (Vgl. dazu: Amazon Is Secretly Becoming a Bank[3]); eine Entwicklung, die durchaus ernst zu nehmen ist, wie aus dem Beitrag\u00a0Why Amazon's Growth in Small Business Lending Threatens the Banking System[4] hervorgeht. In Gro\u00dfbritannien k\u00f6nnen die Kunden \u00fcber Amazon Cash ihre Eink\u00e4ufe bezahlen (Vgl. dazu:\u00a0Amazon Is Secretly Becoming a Bank[5]). Unterdessen hat auch McKinsey erkannt, dass die Internetkonzerne dabei sind, die Banken sukzessive aus ihrem Stammgesch\u00e4ft zu verdr\u00e4ngen (Vgl. dazu: Big tech firms like Amazon are eager to eat the banking industry's lunch[6]). Einige Autoren sprechen bereits in Anlehnung an Schumpeter von der kreativen Zerst\u00f6rung des Bankensystems (Amazon, Klarna, And The 'Creative Destruction' Of The Banking System[7]). Zu den Banken, welche die Bedrohung erkannt haben, z\u00e4hlt die Erste Bank aus \u00d6sterreich (Vgl. dazu: Erste Bank: 'Unser Konkurrent ist Amazon'[8]). Vor wenigen Monaten sorgten Treffen von Amazon und PayPalmit der amerikanischen Regulierungsbeh\u00f6rde Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) f\u00fcr einige Irritation (Vgl. dazu:\u00a0Why are Amazon, PayPal meeting with bank regulators?[9]).

This is first move and here is your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The beat goes on. Bank of America's earning show a solid consumer, but rate cut clouds are gathering. Off balance. Facebook is back on Capitol Hill after Tuesday's lashing for cryptocurrency, Libra. And read my mind: Elon Musk's latest venture involves planting a chip in your brain. It's Wednesday, let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE, a huge tech focus in the show again today and of course earnings. Bank of America just out; Netflix after the bell as well. And I can tell you stranger things have happened. It doesn't look like we've got a pretty flat open for stock markets here in the U.S. following yesterday's pullback.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was a decidedly summer feel yesterday, I have to say sideways trading, light volumes, right up until the moment President Trump warned that the U.S.-China trade deal is still a long way off and he threatened more tariffs.</p><p>Bottom line, guys, trade it still matters; and it's having an impact on global economic data. Take a look over at Singapore. Non-oil exports plunging more than 17 percent year-on-year in June. That was the biggest drop in six years. Export oriented economy, remember this, so expect, I think more easing from the Central Bank. They're just one of the many global Central Banks making dovish noises right now, including, of course Fed Chair, Jay Powell reiterating yesterday that the international outlook remains a key concern.</p><p>Another sign that despite some of the recent stronger data here in the U.S., the Fed is set to cut rates in July and he wasn't alone actually yesterday. The Chicago Fed President hinting two rate cuts might be necessary this year. The bank also warning of course, that this will mean lower profits and perhaps less lending to the real economy.</p><p>Bank of America, meanwhile, though, having a pretty solid quarter, despite the risks, let's get to the drivers and those numbers. Matt Egan joins me now. Matt, once again, strengthen the U.S. consumer. It was the retail bank here that was the real outperformer for Bank of America.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: Right, Julia. You know, Bank of America really painted a very optimistic picture about the economy, despite all of this talk about a slowdown and Fed rate cuts. And as you mentioned, it's really about the consumer.</p><p>Bank of America's consumer bank profits were up solidly. They reported growth in loans and in deposits. CEO Brian Moynihan said all of this points to a steadily growing economy and healthy consumer trends really across the board, which really jives with what he told me last month when we interviewed him and he said that he didn't really think that a recession was in the cards.</p><p>It also supports those strong retail sales numbers that we saw for the United States for the month of June that were reported yesterday. And you know, it's not just about the consumer, though, Bank of America reported healthy numbers when it comes to businesses as well.</p><p>It said that corporate lending and corporate leasing rose, but like the other big banks, one of the concerns continues to be markets. Bank of America's global markets, profit fell seven percent; equity trading volume was down 13 percent, fixed income off by eight percent.</p><p>So Julia, you know, this looks like another example of a bank that is benefiting from the real economy. But you know, it's being held back a bit by the market forces.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the muted trading activity that we're seeing from clients warning concerns, among them, of course, about what kind of trading environment we're going to have going forward offset by businesses and consumers that continue to show some strength here.</p><p>Another point, I know that you discussed with him when you interviewed him as well, but also that we saw in these numbers, is the ability to make profits here, the net interest income, another key feature of all of these bank earnings with bank saying, look, actually, it's simply going to get tougher to make money here as rates come down.</p><p>EGAN: That's right, Julia. So, Bank of America's net interest income actually increased year-over-year, but it was down from the previous quarter. And that is, of course, because interest rates have already fallen very sharply due to the Feds really dramatic pivot from very hawkish to very dovish, and those rates could continue to come down or at least stay low, because the Fed is thinking that it may in fact, lower interest rates.</p><p>And so the problem for banks is that it's going to hurt their margins. And we've seen all these different banks, including Citi and JPMorgan, which lowered its net interest income outlook yesterday. They're all talking about this as a potential headwind.</p><p>So it's another interesting factor that the Fed while it is trying to actually support the real economy by lowering rates, it is going to potentially dent bank profitability -- Julia.</p><p>[09:05:08] CHATTERLEY: Yes, absolutely. Matt Egan, thank you so much for that on banks watch for us this week.</p><p>All right, let's move on to our next driver, Amazon getting hit by another E.U. probe. This time, looking at how it uses other retailer's data. Hadas Gold is on this story. So Hadas, what we're looking at here is how Amazon operates both as a retailer itself, but also as a host for other retailers and doesn't use those -- that data and that advantage to serve its own purposes. Talk us through this.</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: That's the question the European Commission plans to probe in this investigation, this antitrust investigation, and it comes actually, towards the end of Margrethe Vestager, the Competition Chief of the European Commission, the end of her five-year term, but it's been a probe that's been long expected.</p><p>Vestager has been talking about it for some time, but now, it is officially launched. And as you noted, they will be looking into how Amazon, both as the marketplace and the retailer, because it sells its own products on Amazon. But then there's also the place for third-party independent sellers to sell their products. And the question is whether Amazon is inappropriate using some of the data from those third-party independent sellers, really their competitors that that it is somehow being used to an unfair advantage.</p><p>This is everything like the Buy Box, which is the box you might see on your Amazon search results that automatically that you can click on it and puts the product into your cart without you having to go through the product page.</p><p>Now, I want to read a bit of what Vestager said today in the announcement. She said, \"We need to ensure that large online platforms don't eliminate these benefits through anti-competitive behavior.\" She said, \"I have therefore decided to take a very close look at Amazon's business practices and its dual role as marketplace and retailer to assess its compliance with the E.U. competition rules.\"</p><p>Now this could be one of the biggest antitrust competitive investigations into Amazon that we've seen so far that Amazon said in response, \"We will cooperate fully with the European Commission and continue working hard to support businesses of all sizes and help them grow.\"</p><p>Now, this obviously comes on the heels of a lot of action we're seeing in the sort of regulate Big Tech space. We've got the hearings going on in Washington. We've got a lot of investigations and potential, for example, digital taxes being talked about here in Europe.</p><p>But it's clear -- it's not clear how long this probe will take. They actually said there's no specific deadline. But if Amazon is found to be violating any of these competition rules in the European Union, they could be liable for up to 10 percent of their global revenues in a fine.</p><p>And if you look at the 2018 revenues for Amazon, that could be around $23 billion of a fine -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, what you've got to prove here ultimately is that the consumer is being hurt here. And even Vestager agreed that, look, this gave us better choices. It brought prices down for consumers. The question is, now, given the sheer scale and the power that Amazon has, is that working in reverse? And this is the question that we're asking here.</p><p>I mean, I know Amazon, the pushback here would be, look, if we look at the United States, fine. They've got what? Around 40 percent of the e- commerce market share here, but it's less than five percent of overall commerce.</p><p>The question is, is that a powerful enough argument, Hadas? What about in the United States? Because when we were looking at those hearings yesterday, what we heard in Congress was them zoning in on Amazon of all the Big Techs, and asking exactly the same questions here that the E.U. is asking.</p><p>GOLD: Right. And well, that's the argument that we heard from Big Tech in those hearings yesterday in Washington. It was them saying, \"Yes, we do have a lot of power, but our competitors are especially China,\" and that they were trying to get China really into the conversation yesterday in Washington to sort of alert to the politicians that look, you might want to be monitoring us, but keep in mind who we're competing against. We're competing against a lot of these big websites from China that a lot of people don't think about, but they are huge, huge platforms in those other countries.</p><p>But I do have to say the conversation in terms of investigating and regulating Big Tech, it's much further along here in Europe than it is in Washington.</p><p>We are seeing some action in Washington, like those hearings we're seeing this week. But in terms of actual action, actual announced probes, we are not quite there yet. We might get there because we know that the F.T.C. and the D.O.J. in Washington have sort of split up the looking into all the different FAANG, the Facebook, Apple, Amazon, as they're investigating possible antitrust violations.</p><p>But we haven't seen anything publicly from that yet. We might be seeing the politicians yesterday in Washington said that at the end of some of these hearings, at the end of this top to bottom probe of tech, we might see some new legislation come out.</p><p>But they are all looking at Europe and seeing what Europe is doing in these fines that Europe is starting to put out to kind of see what the roadmap might look like.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. You're definitely on the front foot on this in this regard. Hadas Gold. Thank you for that.</p><p>All right. Next one, not the only company getting lashed yesterday in Congress. Facebook, of course, faces further hearings today on Capitol Hill. Their cryptocurrency, Libra got a pretty hostile reception yesterday. Clare Sebastian has been tracking this story for us. Clare, my favorite quote was from the Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown. He compared Facebook to a quote, \"toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches.\" Ouch.</p><p>[09:10:14] CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it was a really frosty reception, Julia. You know, this really felt like more of a dressing down in parts than an actual hearing. Clearly, the big takeaway is just how little Congress trusts Facebook.</p><p>Sometimes, it wasn't even about Libra that they were dressing them down. But, you know, really, this is something that unites politicians on both sides of the aisle. I want to play some of the more colorful moments here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D-OH): Facebook is dangerous. Now, Facebook might not intend to be dangerous, but surely they don't respect the power of the technologies. They are playing with like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches.</p><p>Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience.</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): Isn't it true -- and I really want your opinion that Facebook has chosen to advance a set of values in which truthful, truthful reporting has been displaced by flagrant displays of [bleep].</p><p>DAVID MARCUS, VICE PRESIDENT OF MESSAGING PRODUCTS, FACEBOOK: I don't have to answer that question, sir.</p><p>KENNEDY: Okay.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So Julia, some colorful language there from Senator John Kennedy, and clearly you can see they veered off topic on occasion. But Facebook's David Marcus, who is the head of the Calibra unit, which is the unit that's going to build a digital wallet to use the Libra currency, he said repeatedly that this isn't just about trusting Facebook, there are 28, founding members, all of which are going to have equal power.</p><p>He said that Facebook are going to keep the financial data that they have in Calibra system separate from their social media apps. And he did promise that they're not going to launch this project until all of the regulatory concerns have been addressed.</p><p>But like, he heads to the House today. He is going to be in front of the House Financial Services Committee. I think, if possible, that reception might be even frostier. Maxine Waters, the Chair of that Committee is advancing draft legislation that will try to keep Big Tech out of finance all together. So it'll certainly be interesting to see what happens there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, I go back to what Carly Fiorina said to us yesterday, this is inviting a level of scrutiny at Facebook that the company simply didn't need at this moment.</p><p>But Clare, I totally hear exactly what you're saying here. I just wonder whether a lot of the pushback that we got was about Facebook and Facebook's involvement in something like this, or pushed back more broadly on cryptocurrencies themselves? Because I think if I was an ether or a Bitcoin investor here, I'd be looking at this and going, \"Wow, the sentiment right now in D.C. for this kind of opportunity is negative to say the least.\"</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Definitely, Julia, and we've seen that reflected in the price of Bitcoin and various other cryptocurrencies, particularly overnight. Bitcoin, down below $10,000.00 now. It has lost about a quarter of its value in the last week.</p><p>I think it was interesting because when Libra was first announced, there were a lot of people who are, you know, diehard fans of Bitcoin, who were really happy about this. They thought it would bring this finally into the mainstream. It might bring together some of the patchwork of regulation that we already have into something more comprehensive.</p><p>I think now that the publicity has become so negative, there are concerns, but look, they do want Libra to get off the ground because of that regulation, and because if you go even deeper into the diehard Bitcoin community, there are those who feel that Libra is really essentially a useful detour that will eventually bring people back to Bitcoin, because of the backlash against Facebook and because Libra isn't really as Bitcoiny as Bitcoin.</p><p>It is because of the backing by Facebook that is seen as less decentralized. So it's a kind of a nuanced view of it from the crypto community, but we are seeing those prices fall.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I am sure some people will be scooping them up at these levels for that. We shall see. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. My favorite story of the day now. In the battle of man versus machine, Elon Musk sees a potential ways to win, merging man with machine. He has unveiled bold plans to connect our brains with our devices. Anna Stewart has the lucky prize of reporting on this story for us today.</p><p>I mean, the details on this are pretty astonishing. It's not specifically new science, but Elon Musk just make several dramatic advances. Talk us through the science here.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: It is easy, the science, yes, like all Elon Musk announcements, this one hurts my brain thinking about the possibilities, Julia.</p><p>Now in terms of the science itself, as you said, the technology isn't necessarily new. That's what scientists were taking to Twitter and saying last night, but the device itself is cutting edge. What it is, is a thread like device thinner than a human hair, it gets inserted through our skull and on it are thousands of electrodes which monitor brain neurons and transmit that data back.</p><p>That means, because it's so thin, it's much less invasive than similar procedures at the moment. Plus, what's really different about this company and the fact that Elon Musk has backed it is that his ambitions are far beyond medicine, for instance, far beyond just helping someone who can't speak to communicate.</p><p>[09:15:11] STEWART: They are looking to create symbiosis with artificial intelligence to superpower a healthy human brain. And, you know, this is something that Elon Musk has discussed before, his fear of AI, which he once called humanity's biggest existential threat. Take a listen to what he said last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELON MUSK, FOUNDER, NEURALINK: I think even in a benign AI scenario, we will be left behind. And so hopefully, it is a benign scenario. But I think with a high bandwidth brain machine interface, I think we can actually go along for the ride. And we can effectively have the option of merging with AI.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART: So as robots about become more human like, we can become perhaps more robot like -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I have to say, when I was reading the story, I was imagining downloading a language overnight or maybe even studying a degree overnight. This would be so great. Testing on humans next year, according to Elon Musk, Elon Musk time scale here admittedly.</p><p>STEWART: Exactly. So we discovered last night in the Q&amp;A that they've already tested this on a monkey. And I will quote Elon Musk here, so don't get it wrong, \"The monkey was able to control the computer with his brain, just FYI.\"</p><p>Next up human trials, they need to get that through the FDA. That could be a pretty big hurdle, to jump. And then of course, even if they get the technology, and they can superpower a human brain and do all the things that we'd like it to do. What about consent? What about equality? What about privacy? It raises a whole host of issues.</p><p>What if CNN implants a chip into your brain, Julia, and you have real time stock market data, and they don't give me one, it just wouldn't be fair.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We don't need that kind of technology. We're all over it. Anna Stewart, come on. To be fair, and I just want to make one point, the President of the company that's doing this Neuralink, basically said, look, this is not about hype. This is about recruitment. We want more scientists coming in to help us work on this.</p><p>So I will make that point, but for now, Anna, we will continue to look at the boards and their good work. Anna Stewart. Good job. Thank you for that.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that are making headlines around the world. In Washington, the House of Representatives has voted to officially condemn Donald Trump's racist tweets targeting four Democratic Congresswomen of color. All Democrats voted yes, but only four Republicans and one independent supported the measure. President Trump says he doesn't have a racist bone in his body.</p><p>In Sudan, the opposition and the military have signed a preliminary political agreement. It stipulates the military will rule for the next 21 months, and then civilians take over for another 18, after which the transition period will end. The agreement comes after months of tensions between the military and civilians.</p><p>Mexican drug lord, El Chapo is to be sentenced in New York later today. He was convicted in February of all 10 charges against him. They included engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise and drug trafficking. U.S. prosecutors are seeking a life sentence.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but still to come, debt deal or no deal. The clock is ticking in D.C. to raise the debt ceiling as another U.S. government shutdown looms, and we have lift off. We will talk to one company that took the moon landing to infinity and beyond. That's coming up on FIRST MOVE. Stay with CNN.</p><p>[09:16:43] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE, still looking at a pretty flattish open for U.S. markets a day after a bit of a pullback yesterday amid concerning trade headlines from the President, of course, a long way to go to get a trade deal.</p><p>Also keeping an eye on the banks of course this week, Bank of America shares set to open a touch lower in the session reporting record profits for the quarter, of course, but broader concerns about bank profitability amid lower rates. Of course, with the Federal Reserve in focus.</p><p>Let's talk this through. Joining us now Scott Minerd. He is the Global Chief Investment Officer at Guggenheim Partners. Scott, fantastic to have you on the show.</p><p>SCOTT MINERD, GLOBAL CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, GUGGENHEIM PARTNERS: Oh, Julia, it's always fun.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you're anticipating the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points, a quarter of a percent in July?</p><p>MINERD: July.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But three times this year.</p><p>MINERD: Probably, a couple of more times. I think that -- look, the Chairman made it very clear that he is concerned about the prospects of a recession. And so he has jumped into this cutting rates thing by both feet.</p><p>Now, the risk to my forecast is the risk we faced back in December, which was, if you remember that December meeting, everything was on autopilot. And then and then suddenly, we reversed course.</p><p>So you know, I can only be as certain as you know, as Powell is. But right now, he is sending signals and the market is pricing for three rate cuts. If they don't give the market what it expects, a disappointment, then they're basically you know, running the risk that they're going to increase the probability of a recession if they don't give it to them.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, you make such a great point here as well about the sort of ping pong that we've played with the Federal Reserve here. Is the bar now really high to disappoint the market or at least to confuse the market again, given as you said, we have gone from being on autopilot as far as monetary policy is concerned to being okay, now we're having insurance cuts here to prevent a broader slow down.</p><p>MINERD: You know, it seems, at least for the Chairman, the bar is pretty low. That is that, you know, he is willing to change his mind and look to his defense, he'd say, you know, I'm looking at the data and things changed, and I'm being flexible.</p><p>The reality though is when you look at the data, and what we would have expected in December for the database playing out this year, with continued rate cuts, it's playing out just as we expect. Inflation starting to accelerate, the economy is doing just fine.</p><p>Europe is sort of bouncing off the bottom here, it seems like we're going to get stimulus there. I mean, the trade war was always on the radar screen. But you know, China is going to do whatever it has to do to avoid a recession.</p><p>So the bottom line is the liquidity spigots are on full force around the world. And I think we're in for some interesting times ahead.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, the President warned again yesterday that a trade deal is still a long way away. He could slap China with yet more tariffs on the additional $300 billion here.</p><p>I mean, you could argue -- a cynic could argue here that there's opportunity here for the President to hold off on signing a trade deal. Get those three cuts from the Federal Reserve. Then he will sign a trade deal. And, you know, you've got maximum stimulus in the monetary side and some of the uncertainty goes away longer term.</p><p>MINERD: Well, you know, it's very -- it is interesting if you thought that the President really wanted the Fed to cut rates, which he did. He has played this brilliantly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, he has.</p><p>MINERD: Now, did he do it intentionally? I don't know.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Ask him.</p><p>[09:25:05] MINERD: But he has basically forced to handle the Fed. And, you know, I think the President may be a bit smarter than we give him credit for.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So you've been warning that we could touch your recession indicators, at least, your equity model has suggested that we could see the December lows before the end of the year. But you've also said we could see 3,500 in the S&amp;P 500. How does that play out given everything that you've just said?</p><p>MINDERD: You know, it's really interesting. The allegory for what we're going through today is the 1998 experience. And that is, you know, there was -- there were forces overseas in Asia that caused the Fed to reduce rates by 75 basis points, the stock market took off, and, you know, liquidity just pushed risk assets higher.</p><p>So, you know, I've always felt this was a risk that we were going to do this, but the downside to that is, as we all know, in the 1998 experience, the follow on was the crash in the market that came later.</p><p>And so, you know, are we just setting ourselves up for a run up with stocks that ultimately will get reversed and more? You know, when the Fed ultimately, if it is successful, has to turn around and start fixing rates again.</p><p>And so, you know, I think the Fed would like that. I mean, I don't think they want to crash the market prices, but I think they'd like to get the economy to essentially overheat a bit more and then come back in and have to raise rates so you can get further away from the zero bomb.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, we've got the market open next. We're going to continue this conversation. And I'll be asking you what investors should be doing in order to handle that kind of situation. Yes, that's a good reaction.</p><p>MINERD: That's a tough question.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The market opens next. Scott Minerd back with us very shortly. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and Wednesday's opening bell here at the New York Stock Exchange. Pretty much unchanged for stocks right now. Still trading very close to those record highs, of course. So a bit of a pause in light of all the earnings that we've got coming this week and next makes sense here, I think.</p><p>We're also going to get the Fed's Beige Book, which will give us a sense of how the trade impact is having on regional areas around the United States, too. So we're certainly be watching out for that particularly given how, and the focus ahead of those great cuts.</p><p>Also keeping an eye on what's going on in the energy market. Take a look at oil prices right now. We are seeing a stabilization after that sharp drop in Tuesday's session. Brent trading at that $65.00 a barrel level. U.S. crude trading around $58.00 a barrel.</p><p>John Defterios joins us now. John, a bit of confusion I think going on in the oil markets. Comments yesterday that perhaps there's progress, at least heading towards talks between the United States and Iran.</p><p>But the Iranians suggested that they weren't willing to compromise on their ballistic missiles. So what are you hearing, John, because you're always the man in the know on these things.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Well, on two fronts, I think the Trump administration has jumped the gun here both on China willing to negotiate. And the same thing could be said about Iran.</p><p>But I think the message coming from Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, and also President Trump in that Cabinet meeting was we're willing to sit around the negotiating table, if ballistic missiles are part of the equation, and then we had Foreign Minister Zarif as you're suggesting, Julia, pour cold water on that concept.</p><p>Now a senior Gulf source was just telling me over the last three or four days, they don't want the U.S. to push Iran too far to have these unintended consequences, and then stumbling into conflict. And that's the biggest worry.</p><p>So we know a win-win would look like the both sides put down their guns, sit down at the table and see if they can find common ground. A no win, of course, that you have an accidental conflict, and that's what the Gulf neighbors there in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, clearly do not want to see, but we know what risk means to the markets, Julia.</p><p>The first hint of a potential compromise, we have a sell off of three to four percent when we had those tanker attacks taking place around Fujairah, we saw spikes up four to five percent when the pumping station in Saudi Arabia was hit.</p><p>Also later in the day, we should take a look at how deep the inventories are in the United States and whether the trade tensions in China and the slowdown we're seeing outside the United States is also going to keep the inventories very high and keep downward pressure on prices.</p><p>But we see the spike up about one to one and a half percent, with now the talks with Iran and the U.S. not proceeding at least in the latest hours that we've been talking.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, the fact that U.S. producers are going gangbusters here that the concern about demand going forward between the U.S. and China really is the dominant theme.</p><p>But interesting to hear the Iranian Oil Minister saying irrespective of what's going on that those guys are going to be pretty militant about providing exports to nations. Talk me through this because this was pretty punchy from him, too.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Yes, you know, we had that interview with Minister Bijan Zanganeh at OPEC and he took a fairly firm line, I would suggest as a much tougher line because he was speaking before the Iranian Parliament.</p><p>Now, there's some domestic issues here. He's seen as a reformer back at home. So he has to kind of line up with those from the Revolutionary Guard and the Supreme Leader fighting the national cause. He is not giving any clues on where these exports are going. But one has to think that both Russia and China are supporting the cause.</p><p>Now, I was looking at the latest OPEC report that just came out this week, suggesting that their production dropped another 142,000 barrels last month. But those aren't official reports from Iran, but from a collection of secondary sources. It is costing them $50 billion a year and exports.</p><p>But it's also interesting, Julia, the harder line comes because their budget now requires just 30 percent from oil revenues, and there's no reason to negotiate while President Trump is an election cycle. They'd rather wait. There's no advantage of them sitting at the bargaining table. So they're tightening their belts. And I think that's the harder line we hear from the Oil Minister Zanganeh today.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, fascinating. John Defterios, thank you so much for making that clearer for us.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Nice to see you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Lots to watch. All right, let's bring it back to markets now because Scott Minerd of Guggenheim is back with us. And he is hiding his crystal ball behind his back.</p><p>Continuing the discussion of what we were saying before about so many uncertainty points here and the calibration of policy, both, I think from the White House, but also on monetary policy in the monetary policy front here. How do investors approach these markets?</p><p>MINERD: Julia, the bottom of the market was 300 percent and if you've been investing, you've made a fair amount of money. And you know, I've been advocating for the last year or so that people really should try to de- risk, move toward cash. I was in favor of you know, bonds for quite a while I think with the run up we've had in bonds now. Even they don't really look very attractive.</p><p>[09:35:12] MINERD: So, you know, it's probably not a time to try to preserve capital.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Capital preservation here. The problem is, that's a tough call to make. And it's tough to say that to investors when they look at something like the S&amp;P 500, and they say, \"Wow,\" but that's up 18 percent, if I would have been sitting on loads of cash, I wouldn't miss lots of opportunity here.</p><p>MINERD: Well, you know, look, I turned bullish in October of 2008. I was too early. The load didn't come until March of 2009. But you know, I tend to be early. And so you know, I've said many times, Baron von Rothschild, when asked the secret of his great wealth said, \"I sold early.\"</p><p>So you know, being early is not such a bad thing. I mean, if you look at where we've come in the market since January of 2017 to where we are today, it's kind of not very interesting.</p><p>And so you would have been better off owning bonds, or things that people would have looked at and thought were unattractive.</p><p>But today, I mean -- but if we are in this liquidity driven market, which I think we are from the Central Banks.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: There's so many Central Banks now making noises that they'll provide more stimulus.</p><p>MINERD: Right. And that's why, you know, if you probably see an opportunity in risk assets, but candidly, I think precious metals, especially silver, probably for the next year or so is probably a great place to up the allocation for investors.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Interesting. We just need to be a bit more careful about how you're putting money to work here.</p><p>MINERD: That's right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: If we go back to conversations that we've had this week, Krishna Memani of Invesco said that the rate cuts that we've got coming from the Federal Reserve, the global liquidity, the stimulus support that we're talking about could extend the U.S. business cycle for several years. Can you can you imagine that happening?</p><p>MINERD: Well, I don't think so. I mean, we have a -- I go back to the 90s again. In '95, there was a similar sort of rate cut experience like we're anticipating now. But we were well above full employment. Unemployment was much higher, there was a lot more slack in the economy.</p><p>When we get to 1998, we were -- had a situation like today where we're beyond full employment. Today, there are more job openings than there are workers. So you know, the minute this thing starts to heat up again, and we -- and the Fed steps on the accelerator, if they've got limited runway before constraints start to show up in the system, and they'll probably get what they wish for, which is more inflation, and so ultimately --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wage growth perhaps because people are struggling to hire people.</p><p>MINERD: Well, that's right, and possibly, if minimum wage increases. And then on top of that, you know, the people who are getting the most wage growth are the people who have the highest propensity to spend the money. And so I think it will be the very stimulant to the economy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow, the U.S. government might have to try and get more immigrants into the United States to take up all those jobs. Wouldn't that be an interesting policy?</p><p>MINERD: That would seem to be an interesting twist to the story. But you know, I've been an advocate of a more rational immigration policy that we need. We need foreign workers to come into the country to help the economy grow.</p><p>You know, the President's plan to be, you know, very selective. I don't think that's such a bad idea. But at the same time, the place where we really need workers are people to build houses and to pick the crops. And these are low-skilled jobs that American workers don't really want, and they don't pay very much.</p><p>So of course, the argument is that drags down wage compensation. But if you talk to somebody who is producing food in the Imperial Valley, the last thing they want to hear about is that they're going to drive the price of food up by increasing wages dramatically.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's an interesting conundrum. Final question here on the debt ceiling. We have seven legislative days. We're going to talk about later on in the show, how worried are you once again, particularly in light of the economic concerns that we're heading towards a shutdown? Or do you think both sides understand here that we don't want to have a repeat of earlier this year?</p><p>MINERD: I never want to predict that Washington will choose the path that doesn't have drama attached to it. But at the end of the day, politically, it's in nobody's interest to have a big fight about this thing.</p><p>I think the plan, which is interesting now to talk about a two-year extension, it is clearly an attempt to avoid having to do this in an election year. So I think Washington, the odds are I think, they'll come up with a deal sooner than later, but never count it out. This is a cliffhanger of the story.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Never say never. Very quickly, a little birdie told me that somebody may have tapped you to join the Federal Reserve.</p><p>MINERD: Well, they haven't asked me to join this week, so --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Not formally.</p><p>MINERD: Yes, exactly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But you'd be up for the request at least?</p><p>MINERD: Look, I think it would be a great honor and privilege to serve at the Fed. You know, I would -- I would say it would probably suit me more when I'm kind of 70 than like when I'm 25, as I am today.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Exactly.</p><p>MINERD: So you know --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You have so much time.</p><p>[09:40:08] MINERD: So you know, maybe I should wait a bit longer.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But you're in favor of rate cuts. That's probably the biggest advert. Scott Minerd, don't answer that -- of Guggenheim Partners.</p><p>All right, I've been naughty now taking too much time. Plenty more on FIRST MOVE to come. Stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:43:30] NEIL ARMSTRONG, NASA ASTRONAUT: It's one small step for man, but a giant leap for mankind.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Those are the historic words spoken by Neil Armstrong 50 years ago as he became the first man to walk on the moon. Among the many technical wonders of Apollo 11's lunar landing, one of them is the crystal clear transmission of those words. That feat is down to the communications company Poly. It made Neil Armstrong's headset for the extraordinary mission.</p><p>And joining me now is the company's CEO, Joe Burton. Joe, fantastic to have you with us.</p><p>JOE BURTON, PRESIDENT AND CEO, POLY: Thank you for having me.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'll never tire of listening to those words. Explain to me how this came about because you actually produce the headset that Neil Armstrong was wearing there and obviously we heard him speak those words as a result of.</p><p>BURTON: Well, you know, it's a really amazing story. Plantronics, now Poly was started in the early 1960s by two airline pilots that wanted to have a better headset that was lightweight for long haul flights.</p><p>As NASA was developing the communication system for the astronauts, they contacted Plantronics, which was what Poly was called at the time and asked about adapting our MS50 headset for use by the astronauts.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And that's exactly what you did. In fact, you did it in 11 days and you made it fit their sort of Snoopy hats that we see them wearing, the black and white hats.</p><p>BURTON: Absolutely. So literally from the time that NASA contacted Plantronics to the time that we were actually back in Houston with the two microphones sticking out of their Snoopy hat, was literally 11 days.</p><p>[09:45:07] CHATTERLEY: I mean, the idea was brilliant, but the technology has been pretty revolutionary. I mean, versions of this is still being used today.</p><p>BURTON: Indeed literally. The headset was the MS50 headset. One of the questions I actually asked our team the other day is when did we make the last MS50 headset? And the answer was last Wednesday, it's still in production today.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. So if you get back, it wasn't just the Apollo missions, as pivotal is this was of course, and we remember it, there were a whole host of missions where this technology was used as well. And it was kind of revolutionary.</p><p>There have been issues with communication in prior fights. I mean, the Mercury Redstone 4 mission, I believe, was actually where NASA realized, we need to do something about this fast because we simply can't communicate properly.</p><p>BURTON: Indeed, there was an early mission with Gus Grissom, where they the door blew off the capsule, the capsule almost sunk and he almost drowned. Thankfully, he didn't.</p><p>But they went looking for a lightweight communication system that could fit on the astronauts, contacted a couple of companies, including Poly, and literally every Gemini mission, every Apollo mission, the Space Lab and beyond, were all done with Poly headsets.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Kind of what you're wearing now. This is like the latest edition as the technology has improved. You're actually wearing one now.</p><p>BURTON: You know, in many ways, it is indeed a direct derivative of that. This is actually the Poly -- the Poly Voyager 6200, a lightweight headset, it hangs around your neck. I can put it in one ear or two ears and so forth, and just have crystal clear communications with my mobile phone, my desk phone to literally anywhere in the world.</p><p>In fact, we like to say we're on the same mission we were on their creating instant, meaningful voice and video communications anywhere in the world or even to the moon and back.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. And why do you think it has taken so long? I mean, it's fascinating? We're talking about the 50-year Anniversary of Apollo 11's landing. Why do you think it's taken so long for us to sort of recapture the excitement, the investment, the sort of potential of space travel? Why has it taken so long?</p><p>BURTON: Well, I have to say, as a technologist and of course, a space buff, it's deeply frustrating to me as well. It's terrible. You know, I think that after several successful moon missions in a row that were very, very expensive.</p><p>In today's dollars, each mission ran into the hundreds of billions of dollars. There was a real feeling that they had been there and done that. I'm just delighted that we're back in public and private partnership now and really looking at going back to space, the moon and beyond finally.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, is the likes of Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, the guys that are launching the private companies now and working with NASA in many cases that actually are transforming this technology and the ability that we can to, to sort of go back to space travel of old?</p><p>BURTON: They really -- they really are. It's an incredibly exciting time over the next few years for space travel, I think.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I am always bouncing off of my chair when I start talking about this. Fantastic to have you on and congratulations. That's an incredibly rich history, I think your company. Joe Burton there.</p><p>All right, let's move on. Washington also marketing the anniversary with this amazing tribute to the Apollo 11 mission. The Washington Monument lit up to look like a rocket blasting into space complete with the Kennedy Center's, countdown clock at the base if you could see it.</p><p>Incredible images. For two hours every day, I believe. I was very excited when I saw that. CNN's coverage of the 50th Anniversary of the moon landing is just beginning on Saturday. Our Dr. Sanjay Gupta host \"The First Steps\" with Michael Collins, one of the Apollo 11 astronauts. That's on at 8:30 a.m. in New York, 1:30 p.m. in London right here on CNN. Don't miss that. I can tell you, I will be watching.</p><p>All right, out of money and out of time as the clock ticks down towards the summer holidays for U.S. lawmakers. Last minute talks are on to keep funding the machinery of government. Stay with us. We've got the latest.</p><p>[09:51:23] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. The U.S. government is running out of money and there are just seven legislative days to fix it before the summer holidays begins.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been trying to find a solution. Lauren Fox is in Washington. Lauren, we should be clear, it's twin budgets and debt ceiling negotiations, and therein lies the key. What concessions is House Speaker Pelosi asking and is progress being made?</p><p>LAUREN FOX, CNN POLITICS U.S. CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER: Well, the fact that they have talked almost every day for the last week or so is really a promising sign, another promising sign. They're starting to sort of expand who they're talking to about their conversations.</p><p>You know, the fact that this is House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Steve Mnuchin reveals just how high level these talks are at this point. But yesterday, I saw Nita Lowey who is the Appropriations Chairwoman going into Pelosi's office. I'm told that there are conversations happening with top leaders.</p><p>They're trying to make sure that any agreement that Pelosi and Mnuchin would come to could be agreed upon by of course, the President of the United States and Senate, Republicans and Democrats. So that's something to be watching, Julia, that's really positive</p><p>But I'm told that one of the key sticking points is over how to pay for the VA Mission Act, which passed in 2018. Essentially, it gives more money for Veterans Healthcare. The question, of course, how do you pay for that? Which bucket of money do you put it in? Does it come out of domestic spending or defense spending? And that's been a key sticking point. They're still trying to figure that out. It's unclear exactly whether or not that's been figured out at this point.</p><p>But that's just one of the key sticking points, and as you can imagine, when you're coming up with a massive budget, and you're trying to come up with these top line numbers, there are more things beneath the surface that can come up and become distraction.</p><p>So nothing's agreed to until this is agreed to wholly, and I think that that's what all the negotiators are keeping their eye on at this point. But obviously only a few legislative days before this congressional recess in August.</p><p>Whether or not this is all going to come together in time, given how much time it takes to actually put this budget deal together is still pretty unclear -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Do you think, Lauren, that lessons were learned earlier this year with a partial government shutdown? It hurt, in terms of economics, it hurt in terms of politics for both the Democrats and the Republicans here. Do you think calm heads prevail here when we do reach a deal?</p><p>FOX: It's always hard to predict, you know what the sticking points are going to be whether it's going to be Republicans or Democrats. If you remember, just a couple of weeks ago, liberals in the Democratic Party were torn with their moderate colleagues over that border of supplemental emergency deal that they had to come up with.</p><p>So I think that another key sticking point that we're going to have to be looking at is whether any deal Nancy Pelosi comes up with, with the administration can actually pass muster for some of the liberals in her caucus.</p><p>You know, Democrats have the majority in the House, but they don't have that many votes. So is Nancy Pelosi going to be able to get both the liberals and the moderates in her caucus on board is still a big question.</p><p>And that's before you get to whether or not Pelosi can agree with the Trump administration on an overall budget agreement -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, Lauren Fox over in D.C. there, thank you so much for that update.</p><p>All right, so let me give you a look now at today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" Amazon made more sales during its Prime Day event than last year's Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. It sold a total of 175 million products over the two-day sale this week. The event with open to Prime members in 18 different countries.</p><p>[09:55:03] CHATTERLEY: Step aside Bill Gates, the CEO of luxury goods maker, LVMH, Bernard Arnault is now the world's second richest person. He overtook Bill Gates on Tuesday with a net worth of around $108 billion. That's according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.</p><p>Amazon's Jeff Bezos, of course still holds the number one spot. Wow. Imagine how much trouble you could get into with $180 billion. And you could do a lot of good as well, which of course is what Bill Gates has done to the tune of $35 billion, I believe.</p><p>All right, let me give you a look at what we're seeing for the markets this morning of course. Still trading very close to record highs. Keep an eye on what we're seeing right now. Pretty much unchanged summer markets. I think that's the broader point here, but plenty of earnings to come this week, and next, of course, to keep an eye on for now.</p><p>All right, that just about wraps up the show. You can also listen to our podcast if you go to cnn.com/podcast. If you can't wait until tomorrow, of course, you can listen to the show again, but for now, I'm Julia Chatterley, you've been watching FIRST MOVE, time to go make yours.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019071701cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKP-J281-JB20-G283-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8017\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002PWF</classCode><className>BANK OF AMERICA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002RQZ</classCode><className>FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF CHICAGO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6712 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The FTSE 100 has closed 6 points lower at 7,416 points. Mark Carney's concerns about no-deal worries hurting the economy weighted on the market, with the pound hovering below $1.27 still. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cityindex.co.uk\">www.cityindex.co.uk</url>, says trade war optimism was limited too: Comments from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that a US - Sino trade deal was 90% done has fuelled optimism that the two sides could finally achieve a trade agreement. US equities have moved higher in early trade on the news, paring some of yesterday's Fed inspired losses. Any good news on trade is good news for the equity markets. However, the reaction is actually fairly tame to the attention-grabbing headline, both the Dow and the S&amp;P are up around 0.2% and parts of Europe remain in the red. Investors are not getting carried away opting to sit on the side-lines as they look cautiously ahead to the G20 summit this weekend. A side meeting between Trump and China's President Jinping Xi could give vital clues as to whether the two powers are onside to resolve the ongoing trade dispute. Wall Street has opened higher, as investors are cheered by Stephen Mnuchin's claim that the US-China trade deal is 90% complete. Tech shares are among the risers, despite Donald Trump's threat to sue the likes of Twitter and Google.... Donald Trump attacked tech companies today, because he reckons they discriminate against him because he's a Republican. He told Fox that social media firms such as Twitter are unfairly throttling his follower numbers (a claim he's made before). He also cites a recording released yesterday of a Google executive discussing plans to prevent another \"Trump situation\". The president says: \"Twitter is just terrible, what they do. They don't let you get the word out. \"I'll tell you what, they should be sued because what's happening with the bias - and now you see it with that executive yesterday from Google. The hatred for the Republicans: It's not even like 'Gee! Let's lean Democrat.'\" \"These people are all Democrats, it's totally biased toward Democrats. If I announced tomorrow that I'm going to become a nice liberal Democrat, I would pick up five times more followers. Take a deep breath before watching this clip of Donald Trump rubbishing America's top central banker on Fox News today: Back in the UK, Bathstore, the country's biggest bathroom specialist, has collapsed into administration after failing to find a buyer, putting more than 500 jobs at risk. Just the latest in a string of retail failures that have cost tens of thousands of jobs this year. Here's the full story: Wowzers. Donald Trump has suggested he could widen his trade war to include Vietnam. Here's a clip from his Fox News appearance: The Financial Times have a good take on Mark Carney's criticism of investment funds built on the \"lie\" of instant redemptions. Here's a flavour: The Bank of England governor said that all fund investors should expect to have redemption terms that were in line with the liquidity of the assets that underpinned them and should not be able to assume they could get their hands on their money daily. \"These funds are built on a lie, which is you can have daily liquidity,\" Mr Carney told MPs on the Treasury select committee. For assets that \"fundamentally aren't liquid\" or might become illiquid in a market downturn, he said the damage of that \"lie\" for financial stability is that it \"leads to an expectation for individuals that it's not that different from having money in a bank\". \"We do have to be very deliberate about the types of measures that need to be taken - something that better aligns the redemption terms with the actual liquidity of the underlying investment is infinitely preferable to the situation we have today,\" the governor said. Donald Trump has used an interview on Fox News to blast a range of targets - from America's top central banker to its largest tech companies. He also took a swipe at Japan, shortly before heading to Tokyo for the G20 summit: Newsflash from America: Durable goods orders fell sharply last month, raising new fears about the health of the US economy. New orders for durable goods (such as transportation and machinery) fell by 1.3% in May, led by a drop in airline sales. That follows a 2.8% tumble in April, and is weaker than expected. Demand for capital goods (expensive equipment) fell by 3.3%, and computer-related orders slid by 2.4%. City experts say Mark Carney is correct to predict interest rates would be cut after a no-deal Brexit. Joshua Roberts, associate director at JCRA, says investors had already worked this out for themselves: \"Carney's comments are hardly a revelation for the market, which has been judging a rate cut as more likely than a hike for over a month. The logic is inescapable: if the flow of goods and services between the UK and its most important trading partner is severely disrupted, the Bank of England has a duty to try and stabilise the resulting economic shock.\" Oliver Blackbourn, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, says the Bank is in the hands of Westminster: Carney made it clear that he and some others on the MPC favour more support in the event of a no-deal Brexit. With the Brexit forecast assumption dependent on government policy, we are back to awaiting the new Prime Minister and their ability to manage parliament for indications of future BoE decisions.\" Mark Carney has given his strongest hint yet that the Bank of England could cut interest rates back toward record lows, if Britain crashed out of the EU without a deal. The BoE governor told the Treasury committee that many policymakers, himself included, believe they would need to protect the economy through a new stimulus package. Previously, the Bank has suggested it could hike interest rates to prop up the pound and fight inflation, if no-deal caused a sterling crisis and made imports expensive and hard o obtain. But today, Carney said: In the event that there is no deal, the response would not be automatic, it would depend on demand, on supply and where the exchange rate went. Some of us, myself included, have said it is not equally weighted. However, if Britain leaves with a 'smooth Brexit', the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee expect to raise rates in a gradual, limited way. Carney also warned that fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen recently, dragging business investment back and hurting the economy. Financial markets are also anticipating the risk of a disorderly Brexit. Carney said: The path of interest rates, in the markets judgment, is lower because they are ascribing some possibility to no-deal. And in the event of no-deal, that interest rates would be lower than they otherwise would be. The governor reiterated that Britain couldn't rely on \"Gatt 24\" to insist on tariff-free trade with the EU after a no-deal Brexit. This WTO rule could only be used as part of an agreement between London and Brussels, Carney explained. He also slapped down suggestions that Britain should just get Brexit over with and leave on 31, pointing out that a transition period is crucial to help companies adjust. The Bank also denied that there are too many 'zombie companies', propped up by low interest rates. On world affairs, Carney said that trade war tensions have risen since the Bank issued its latest quarterly inflation report in May (just before Donald Trump announced new tariffs on China). But he remains confident that the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, despite political pressure from Donald Trump. He also chastised fund managers who invest in illiquid assets but offer their customers instant redemptions, saying they are \"built on a lie\". This is a hot issue, since Neil Woodford blocked investors from quitting his equity income fund after a wave of redemptions. Carney warned: \"This is a big deal. You can see something that could be systemic. \"These funds are built on a lie, which is that you can have daily liquidity for assets that fundamentally aren't liquid. And that leads to an expectation of individuals that it's not that different to having money in a bank.\" Mark Carney finally turns to another issue -- investment funds, which are in the spotlight since Neil Woodford locked down his equity income fund to halt a wave of redemptions. Some funds are \"built on a lie\", says Carney severely, the idea that you can have daily liquidity from a fund that holds illiquid assets. That encourages small investors to treat such holdings as 'money in the bank', which you can get instant access to, the governor tells the Treasury committee. Woodford investors now know the truth.... That's the end of the session. Q: Are low interest rates allowing an army of zombie firms to \"stagger on\", endangering financial stability, asks Steve Baker MP. Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders isn't too worried. He says the number of firms with low profits compared to their interest payments are stable. Yes, there would be more of them if interest rates were higher -- but that could also drive firms to the wall, hurting the wider economy (and creating another wave of zombies)..... Q: Young people are growing up in an era where interest rates have been extremely low for a decade - isn't that a problem for the future? Umbrella's don't cause rain, shoots back Mark Carney (quoting his MPC colleague Gertjan Vlieghe) There are structural reasons why borrowing costs are so low - central banks are providing support to help economies. But yes, there are macro-prudential risks from such low interest rates, Carney says. Q: Back in 2014, you told the committee that monetary policy was at \"extraordinary, if not emergency\" settings. Would you agree that it still is? Carney does not -- even though interest rates (0.75%) are barely higher than five years ago (0.5%). He argues that 'equilibrium' interest rates (the point where you're neither stimulating nor strangling the economy) are lower than in 2014. So borrowing costs today are 'accommodative', but not extraordinarily so, the governor insists. Mark Carney warns that \"crystallising\" businesses' concerns over Brexit, by plunging out of the EU without a deal, would cause economic damage. It would lead to some 'capital scrapping' as firms canned equipment, which would also hurt skilled workers, he adds. Back in Westminster, Mark Carney has warned MPs that pay growth will probably slow this summer - having clawed its way up to 3.5% per year. He says the 'tightness in the labour market' has pushed earnings up recently, but Britain has still suffered the worst decade for real pay growth since the 1850s. George Osborne never managed to balance the books as UK chancellor, and he's not doing much better following his switch to journalism. Osborne's Evening Standard lost more than \u00a311m before tax last year, but did achieve a 2% rise in revenues in a tough market. Jack Maidment of Mail Online suspects that Mark Carney and Boris Johnson aren't poles apart on Gatt 24, following the governor's comments earlier. The issue, though, is whether the EU would go along with Boris's Plan B, if it didn't provide a solution to the Irish border question, or settle Britain's outstanding financial liabilities.... Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe has warned the committee that the international economy is providing less support to the UK than in 2018. Q: Don't we need to conclude Brexit by Halloween, and end this nightmare, one way or another, asks Brexiteer MP Charlie Elphicke. Mark Carney does his best impression of an Oxbridge don, telling the committee dryly that: There's a reason that that 40-plus trade deals stuck between advanced economies in the last quarter century have always had a transition from the status quo to the new arrangement.... I would underscore that it is highly desirable to give businesses enough time to adjust to the new reality. Of course, it also matters what that new situation is, adds MPC member Silvana Tenreyro. Worryingly, Mark Carney doesn't expect the weak business investment to recover soon. Survey data suggests it was weak in the current quarter (April-June). MPC member Michael Saunders chimes in, reiterating that market fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen. The outlook for the economy would be very different now (ie better), if we knew now that we'd see a smooth Brexit, rather than face rolling deadlines and uncertainty, Saunders adds. Mark Carney adds that the housing market has suffered from Brexit uncertainty, as the deadlines for Britain's departure have been pushed back. [prices in London and the South East have been falling for several months] Q: Isn't it \"unreal\" for the BoE to still be assuming a smooth Brexit in its forecasts, then? Carney replies that the markets don't believe no-deal is the most likely outlook - it's not the official policy of the government, or either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt. But the Bank is working constantly on its no-deal preparations, in case. Q: Do you think the risk of a no-deal Brexit is growing? Carney turns the question deftly back onto the Treasury committee -- pointing out that it's the government's job to plot the path forwards, and parliament's job to approve it or not. There has been a \"notable increase\" in market expectations of no-deal, he adds. This uncertainty is hurting business investment, and hurting the UK's short-term economic performance. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe weighs in too -- telling MPs that \"we look to you\". The BoE is only a central bank, after all.... Q: The Westminster Village have been frantically googling \"Gatt 24\" (after Boris Johnson suggested it could be used to guarantee free trade with the EU). You have suggested otherwise.... [Reminder for any MPs baffled by Google: Gatt 24 allows tariff-free trade for up to 10 years while a permanent trade agreement is negotiated]. Mark Carney explains that the UK cannot 'unilaterally' used Gatt 24 - there has to be an agreement in place too. If other WTO members agree that both are sides working towards a free trade deal, then tariff barriers can be lowered. The governor then explains that you can't have 'no deal and Gatt 24', joking that it may all come down to symantics -- but as a Canadian, he understands that 'agreement' means 'deal' in English. Q: So Gatt 24 can't apply in a no-deal situation? There has to be an agreement, yes, Carney confirms. Not necessarily the Withdrawal Agreement, but something. Q: Is that Bank of England worried by Donald Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve (demanding interest rate cuts)? Mark Carney explains that central bank independence is important. He reassures the committee that \"monetary policy hasn't been compromised in the UK\" (although I do remember some criticism of the BoE by Theresa May in 2016). He adds that he isn't worried that the Fed will be knocked off course from pursuing low inflation and full employment, saying: I have full confidence that the Federal Reserve will conduct a policy to achieve their dual mandate, and that the timing and extent of any policy changes will be determined by how they think they can achieve that mandate. Q: At the May inflation report, governor, you said that global trade tensions have eased? Does that still hold true? It held true for about 48 hours, Mark Carney grins, before Donald Trump tweeted he was hiking tariffs on Chinese imports. Q: Has the threat to economic growth from a trade war increased? Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe agrees that tensions have increased, with America also threatening Mexico with tariffs and targeting European car sales. Markets are more sensitive to trade developments, Cunliffe says, warning that there are now \"more ingredients\" for a full-blown trade war. Q: What advice do you have for your successor, Mr Carney? Carney (who is due to leave the Bank next January) says being governor is an \"honour and a privilege\". It's also a unique role, as the Bank is responsible for financial stability as well as monetary policy. It requires a particular background and set of skills, Carney points out. Q: If Britain's next prime minister decides that leaving the EU with a deal is impossible, your next inflation report will look very different than the May one.... Carney replies that this isn't the Plan A of either candidate, but yes, in that scenario the forecasts will change. MPC policymaker Michael Saunders tells the committee that the UK economy could do \"a little better\" than the Bank forecasts, if Britain leaves the EU smoothly. In that scenario, he argues that interest rate rises will be needed. Q: But what if the Bank of England is wrong, and Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal? We would change our forecasts, Mark Carney replies. He argues that it's not \"automatic\" whether the Bank would raise or lower interest rates, but several policymakers (including Carney) believe some stimulus would be needed. That's a hint that interest rates could be cut, to protect the economy, in a no-deal situation. Over in parliament, the Treasury Committee is holding a session with the Bank of England over its latest Quarterly Inflation Report. In the hot seats: Dr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England , Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, and monetary policy committee members Silvana Tenreyro and Michael Saunders. Nicky Morgan, chair of the committee, asks why the financial markets haven't believed the Bank's claim that interest rates will rise faster than investors think. Carney says the Bank's forecasts are based on the assumption that Britain will leave the EU smoothly, while the markets are factoring the risk of a disorderly no-deal Brexit. In the Bank's view -- a smooth Brexit will allow interest rates to rise. As Carney puts is: When we set out the forecast... we're saying that in the event of a smooth transition to a deal, it would require limited and gradual interest rate increases [to keep inflation on target]. Newsflash: America's Treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin, has told CNBC that the US-China trade deal is \"90% complete\". That may bolster confidence ahead of the G20 meeting (although, obviously, the agreement won't work without that vital last 10%...) Ouch! Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's have just slashed their forecast for Italian growth this year to virtually zero. S&amp;P now expect Italy to only expand by 0.1%, down from 0.7% previously, extending a long period of weak growth (or worse). The Financial Times's Daniel Shane says Bitcoin is \"hurtling towards the $13,000 mark\", for the first time since January 2018. He writes: Recent enthusiasm for bitcoin has been stoked by Facebook's foray into the world of cryptocurrencies, launching its own currency called Libra. The coin is designed as a means of payment and for international money transfers. Analysts are optimistic that Libra will help cryptocurrencies generally gain more mainstream acceptance. World leaders haven't even set foot in Tokyo yet, but the draft communique from the G20 meeting has already leaked. According to Japanese media, the statement will urge support for free trade to achieve strong global growth. However, this could be queried by the US delegation, who are pushing a more protectionist, 'America First', agenda. My colleague in Beijing, Lily Kuo, reports that few experts expect a substantive agreement at the G20 to end almost a year of trade tensions and months of deteriorating ties between the world's two largest economies: In the City, clothing retailer Bonmarch\u00e9 has been forced into a screeching u-turn over a takeover offer. Bonmarch\u00e9 had previously rejected a bid from retail billionaire Philip Day, claiming that it undervalued the company. But this morning, it admitted to shareholders that recent trading had been \"poor\", meaning it now recommends accepting Day's offer! Bonmarch\u00e9 blamed \"continued weakness in the underlying clothing market, and a lack of seasonal weather\" to counteract this trend. So, given the danger that trading doesn't improve, Day (who owns the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group) suddenly looks less of a threat and more of a savour. Or as Bonmarch\u00e9's board put it: Whilst the Board's view remains that the Offer does not adequately reflect the potential longer term value of the business, the increase in uncertainty that has developed reflecting the trading and financial position of the business during the first quarter of the financial year makes the certainty represented by the Offer potentially more attractive in the short term. Shares in Bonmarch\u00e9 have promptly slumped by 20% to 11.5p, the level of Day's offer, as hopes of a rip-roaring takeover battle fade. European stock markets are subdued this morning, after America's top central banker dampened hopes of hefty interest rate cuts. Yesterday, Fed chief Jerome Powell gave a speech in New York in which he appeared to push back against Donald Trump's demands for lower borrowing costs. Powell declared: The Fed is insulated from short-term political pressures - what is often referred to as our 'independence. Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests. Central banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence. Powell also reiterated that the Fed will act \"as appropriate\" to sustain America's economic expansion. But this still left traders disappointed - and worried they've been too confident in expecting a Fed rate cut in July. Stephen Innes of Vanguard Markets says Powell:... walked back some of the market overly zealous dovish inference. This has pushed the main European indices down a little: FTSE 100: Down 8 points of 0.1% at 7,413 German DAX: Down 35 points or 0.3% at 12,192 French CAC: Down 9 points or 0.2% at 5,504 Neil Wilson of Markets.com also reckons Facebook's move into digital currencies is helping push bitcoin up (as it gives the whole sector more legitimacy). He also believes nervous investors are trying to spread their risk, in case other asset prices tumble. The biggest players are looking at cryptocurrencies afresh and don't want to miss out. There's a 'haven' play too as nominal and real yields have retreated sharply, reducing the opportunity cost of holding (or HODLing) bitcoin. And the liquidity injection from central banks has forced a range of assets like gold, bonds, the yen etc, so bitcoin is just being swept along by those macro currents. Whatever the cause, the momentum is powerful right now. Bitcoin has now surged by around 150% in the last two months, from around $5,100 in late April to over $12,700 this morning Marcus Swanepoel, CEO at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, says bitcoin's in a bull run, for several reasons: The bullish signals for bitcoin have been present for some time, with greater buying and interest from major banks, institutions and groups of specialist buyers adding liquidity to the market. This led to increased speculation and the price rise from April. Then the Facebook announcement of Libra showed to many financial services sectors that altcoins are going mainstream. Finally, as the geopolitical situation remains so uncertain, strategic investors are still looking at Bitcoin and Ethereum as uncorrelated with centralised assets, so provide a quasi safe-haven option. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It's another jittery day in the markets, as geopolitical tensions and trade war anxiety give investors plenty to think about. Oil is the big mover this morning - Brent crude has romped to $66.25 per barrel for the first time in almost a month. This follows a report from the American Petroleum Institute showing that US crude stockpiles fell by 7.55 million barrels last week. That bigger-than-expected decline may indicate higher demand than expected. But tensions in the Middle East are also driving oil up. Relations between Washington and Tehran deteriorated further yesterday as Donald Trump threatened to obliterate parts of Iran, after president Rouhani suggested the US leader was \"afflicted by a mental disorder\". This sort of \"jaw-jaw\" antics only increase worries of military action, disrupting supplies. No wonder oil is up 10% since two tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman two weeks ago. Investors are also getting nervous about this week's G20 meeting of world leaders, which kicks off on Friday. Trump is due to meet China's Xi Jinping on Saturday, for a crucial meeting on trade. American officials say their aim is to restart negotiations, suggesting the two sides could agree not to impose more tariffs while talks are underway. Bloomberg is reporting that the U.S. could suspend the next round of tariffs on an additional $300bn of Chinese imports. But nothing's guaranteed. And in such turbulent times, some traders are turning to cryptocurrencies for protection. Bitcoin has continued its recent strong rally, hurtling through the $12,000 mark for the first time in 15 months today. It's currently up 8.4%, or $986, at $12,737. And with Facebook's new Libra currency getting plenty of attention, some analysts are predicting that digital coins will keep climbing. Also coming up today Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is being quizzed by MPs on the Treasury committee. Officially it's about the Bank's last quarterly inflation report, but Brexit and trade rules may also come up too (especially as Carney shot down Boris Johnson's Brexit idea last week). Plus, new US durable goods and trade data will show if America's economy is suffering from the trade dispute with China.

It expects GDP to be 1.5% lower as a permanent impact but uncertainty still prevails and as such we can't be sure how exactly the economy is going to respond. Live data points provide some comfort but it is right to remain cautious on how the recovery will play out.</p><p>\"What is clear is that the economy is going to need to be reshaped in order to recover. A sharp rise in unemployment is expected when the furlough scheme ends, while businesses will increasingly look to automation in order to plug gaps in their workforce and help control costs.

Goodnight! GW Travel on Britain's rail network was still more than half its usual levels yesterday - another sign that businesses agree with the Bank of England. Transport correspondent Gwyn Topham explains: Three million fewer passengers travelled on Britain's trains on Tuesday than a year ago, with only a slight increase in commuters rather than the widespread post-Covid return to offices that the government had urged. Figures from train operators indicated that total journeys were just 38% of the equivalent day in 2019, a proportion that had been steadily increasing over the last two months but is only marginally higher than last week. An average 5 million passengers a day were travelling by rail in late 2019. Network Rail said footfall in its managed stations, the busiest in London, England and Scotland, was 6% higher than the same day last week but still 60% lower than usual..... Here's a video clip of BoE official Alex Brazier explaining why MPs can't expect a 'sudden and sharp' return of office workers to their desk, despite pressure from the government to dial back home working. Here's a quick recap of the main points from the Treasury Committee hearing. The Bank of England has warned MPs that it isn't possible for all workers to return to their desks yet. Alex Brazier, the Bank of England's executive director for Financial Stability Strategy and Risk, told the committee that the return to normality must be gradual - due to health worries, and the challenges of making offices safe. Brazier explained: The first is people have a caution about the public health issues. I feel safe coming to work, but I quite understand why many people might not. Public transport capacity is a related factor there. It's not possible to use office space, particularly in central London and dense places like that, with the intensity that we used to use it. Fellow policymaker Dame Collette Bowe also reminded MPs that it's very hard for parents to return to work: That is a major issue for a great many parents. They have to feel that their children are being properly cared for, and that their children's education is being taken care of. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden revealed that the Bank staff had run its latest stimulus package from their homes - a sign that central banking has adapted to the pandemic. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told MPs that while consumer spending has picked up, credit card usage in London is weaker than the rest of the country. He also warned that business investment is weak, due to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. The committee were also warned that the economic scarring caused by Covid-19 could be more serious than the Bank currently forecasts. Commercial property companies, and traditional retailers, are at particular risk. Incidentally, our main Covid-19 blog is here: While the Treasury Committee was quizzing the Bank of England, the UK stock market closed higher. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares ended 78 points higher at 5940, a gain of 1.3% That's a recovery from yesterday's three-month low. Housebuilding stocks led the rally, after this morning's news that prices have hit a record high and demand has surged. Paul Craig, portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, hopes the government will heed the Bank of England's warning that Covid-19 will scar the UK economy. \"The Bank of England has spelled out pretty clearly that this crisis will leave a scar on the UK economy. It expects GDP to be 1.5% lower as a permanent impact but uncertainty still prevails and as such we can't be sure how exactly the economy is going to respond. Live data points provide some comfort but it is right to remain cautious on how the recovery will play out. \"What is clear is that the economy is going to need to be reshaped in order to recover. A sharp rise in unemployment is expected when the furlough scheme ends, while businesses will increasingly look to automation in order to plug gaps in their workforce and help control costs. As such some sectors and industries could be decimated despite consumption returning to pre-pandemic levels. It is becoming more and more obvious that the government will need to step in with more targeted fiscal support and provide more support for jobseekers. Finally, Dave Ramsden tells MPs that Bank of England officials managed to deliver its Covid-19 rescue package from their homes. Ramsden, who has responsibility for a lot of the BoE's operational functions, says the Bank learned the 'prosaic lesson' that people don't need to be in the office to do important jobs. Instead, BoE staff have been running its \u00a3745bn quantitative easing scheme, and its package to help businesses borrow (the Covid Corporate Financing Facility or CCF) from home. The deputy governor explains: We've learned in the Bank of England that, in a crisis, we can run all our critical functions away from the office - whether it's Threadneedle Street or our Moorgate offices. All interventions we've made, the creation of the CCFF, the QE, all the market activity to support the bank's interventions have all taken place from people's home offices. That's not necessarily at all sustainable, it's not where we want the new normal to be. but it does suggest more flexibility of how we run our key operations. That's true of us, and other parts of the financial sector. That's very interesting, and explains why Alex Brazier was so confident to tell MPs that workers can't come back to the office. The Bank itself has learned that you can rescue the economy from your home office, kitchen table or bedroom PC. Conservative MP Anthony Browne replies that it's an \"extraordinary thought that people have been spending tens of billions of pounds\" from their home office. \"As you say, that shouldn't be the new normal,\" Browne adds, mindful that the government wants workers to return to their desks (and ideally buying a coffee and a sandwich on the way). That's the end of the session. Reuters have filed a report on the Treasury committee hearing - here's a flavour: Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden and another interest-rate setter, Gertjan Vlieghe, warned on Wednesday of risks that Britain's economy could suffer more damage than spelt out by the central bank last month. Ramsden told lawmakers that the BoE had estimated the level of Britain's economic output would permanently be about 1.5 percentage points lower than it would have been without the pandemic. \"For me all the risks are really that that number will be greater than 1.5%,\" Ramsden said. Vlieghe said there was \"a material risk\" that it could take several years for Britain's economy to return to full capacity after its coronavirus shock. More here: Bank of England policymakers warn UK economy facing bigger risks The session now turns to the role of the banking sector in the pandemic. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden says the commercial banks are well-capitalised, and in a position to lend to help customers. If they all do that, then the recovery will be stronger - and their credit losses will be lower. Ramsden says that the banks are resilient, and helping - unlike 12 years ago. What's really striking about this crisis and the recovery phase, is that banks are part of the solution. They were the problem in the financial crisis, they exacerbated a real economic downturn and the meant that the recovery was more prolonged. This time round banks are playing their part, as part of the solution. Back on Brexit, Andrew Bailey criticises the EU's approach to equivalence in financial services regulation. The BoE governor insists that the UK has submitted all the information sought by the EU, but is concerned that Brussels is still seeing London as a rule-taker, he tells the Treasury Committee. Bailey adds that 'equivalence' between the UK and EU's financial sectors is worth having, as it would mean open, well-regulate markets. But, it's not worth having on any terms. Alex Brazier, director for financial stability, weighs in too - saying that forcing the UK to stick extremely closely to an equivalence regime can undermine financial stability and be inefficient. Given the size of the City, London needs to be able to tweak its rules to prevent damaging problems. The Treasury Committee are also tweeting some key points, including the Bank's warning that the return to work will be gradual: More highlights from the Treasury committee session: Q: Onto the housing market. Are first time buyers being squeezed out because lenders are demanding high deposits or imposing higher interest rates on them? MPC Gertjan Vlieghe says that it's true that the rates offered to those with large deposits, and small ones, have widened recently - back to the levels seen a few years ago. But lenders are reflecting the higher risk that comes when you lend to people with small deposits, he adds. With the economy weakening and unemployment rising, these high LTV mortgages are riskier, and being priced accordingly. Q: But the housing market addresses a basic need - should lenders really be prioritising buy-to-let lenders over people trying to get onto the housing ladder? Vlieghe says that's an issue of social priorities , not a monetary policy issue. Governor Andrew Bailey darts down the pitch, saying that the 'batting average' of LTV mortgage costs has gone up because some cheaper offers have been withdraw (as we've seen with HSBC today). Q: Will the loans made to small businesses to help them through the crisis have a long-term negative effect on investment? Bailey says there will be companies who come through the crisis with higher debt levels than they expected. Some of those firms have quite high cash balances, so will be able to repay those precautionary loans quite quickly, he predicts. But others may need a 'delicate' workout procedure to get debt levels down. For medium and large companies, that could include 'equity provision' (I think he means issuing new shares, eg: though a rights issue, to bring debt down) Q: So are there zombie companies out there who will have a damaging impact on the economy? Deputy governor Dave Ramsden says this question has been rumbling since the last financial crisis - is productivity being dragged down by struggling firms who are just keeping afloat thanks to low interest rates? Some of the firms who have taken on debt this time will not be 'viable', he predicts. Policymakers need to develop more targeted measures to support struggling sectors - such as the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. Q: What does the Bank of England see in business investment? It is weak, in comparison with consumer spending, governor Andrew Bailey replies. That's, sadly, not surprising, he adds -- there is a close relationship between economic certainty and investment. The pattern is uneven, as well as weak. Some sectors which are faring well in the pandemic, such as online retailing, could see higher investment. Restaurants, though, are less likely to see investment. Deputy governor Dave Ramsden weighs in too, saying there is a limit to what the Bank can do to address disruption at the ports after a no-deal Brexit. But, the Bank can step up the pace of its QE scheme significantly, he adds, if there is financial market disruption [QE means buying government bonds, and some corporate debt, with newly created money]. That could prevent damage feeding from the markets to the real economy, Ramsden adds. Q: What would the Bank do if the UK economy suffers a no-deal Brexit this winter and a second wave of Covid-19 cases? Governor Andrew Bailey repeats his earlier point that the impact of a no-deal Brexit all depends how much trade is disrupted. He cites a Bank survey that found 60% of firms thought they were well prepared for Brexit. Calculating the hit from Covid and a no-deal Brexit is complicated, he points out (they both disrupt trade). The short-term downside risk from Covid-19 is much bigger than Brexit, though, he adds. Dame Collette Bowe, an external member of the Bank's Financial Policy Committee - says there's another important reason why people haven't returned to work -- children, and the return to school for the autumn term. She tells MPs: That is a major issue for a great many parents. They have to feel that their children are being properly cared for, and that their children's education is being taken care of. Q: Why are many City of London employers, such as big financial institutions, reluctant to bring their workers back to the office? Alex Brazier, the Bank of England's executive director for Financial Stability Strategy and Risk , tells MPs that it simply isn't possible to get everyone back to their desks. There are two factors holding people back, in lots of cities not just London, he explains to the Treasury Committee. The first is people have a caution about the public health issues. I feel safe coming to work, but I quite understand why many people might not. Public transport capacity is a related factor there. The second reason, Brazier adds, is that offices need to comply with Covid-safe guidelines. It's not possible to use office space, particularly in central London and dense places like that, with the intensity that we used to use it. It's not possible to bring lots of people back very suddenly. Brazier adds that he's seen the benefits of being in an office himself - such as higher efficiency and improved collaboration. Many people may want to return to their desks. But... Because of those constraints, I don't think we can expect a sudden and sharp return of lots of people to the very dense office environments that we were used to. We should expect a more phased return, depending on the public health outcomes we see in coming weeks and months. That feels like a significant comment from the Bank, at a time when the government is trying to encourage workers back to the office: Q: How has the economy picked up since the pandemic lifted? Andrew Bailey says it's an uneven picture. The recovery in consumption has been very fast, with household spending close to pre-pandemic levels and mortgage approvals very strong. Investment has been weak, though. The governor also cites data showing that credit card spending is weakest in London. That's firstly due to the slow return of workers to their offices, and secondly due to the fall in tourism due to Covid-19. Q: Are you worried that the move to online shopping will hit employment? Bailey says this is one of the issues the Bank is considering, when it looks at the structural changes caused by the pandemic. Onto Brexit, and the risk of a WTO-style no-deal at the end of this year. Bailey says the key question is how much disruption is caused to trade. Labour MP Angela Eagle challenges the Bank about its prediction that unemployment will hit 7.5% by the end of the year. Should it do more to prevent this? Governor Andrew Bailey says no-one wants joblessness to rise, and the Bank is using its tools to fight it where possible. He argues that the unemployment threat from Covid-19 is now focused on certain parts of the economy, rather than being a broad threat earlier this year Q: You backed the chancellor's decision to unwind the furlough scheme in a BBC interview - why did you do that, and make that support public? Bailey argues that the furlough scheme has done its job, calling it \"A scheme that was designed, very sensibly, for a situation when 30% of the workforce couldn't work.\" Q: So doesn't that mean that more focused support is needed for some sectors? Bailey agrees that the nature of the challenge has changed. Q: What is the price of gold telling the Bank of England about the economy, and inflation? MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe swats this question away. It's a \"terrible idea\" to look at the nominal price of gold, because you'd expect a perfectly stable asset to hit fresh record highs each month in nominal terms. The fact it's at all-time high tells you nothing. Vlieghe also slams gold as being a \"terrible predictor of inflation.\" It peaked in the 1980s, which was start of a long decline of inflation Q: Is the Bank more worried about inflation, or deflation? Deputy governor Dave Ramsden says disinflationary risks gone up since January. Q: Do your brakes work faster than your accelerator? Governor Andrew Bailey says the Bank slammed the accelerator down pretty hard in March (by slashing interest rates to record lows and increasing its QE programme) BoE deputy governor Dave Ramsden fears that the UK economy will suffer deeper economic scarring from Covid-10 than the Bank currently forecasts. He warns the Treasury Committee that the commercial property sector could suffer a semi-permanent, or permanent, hit, due to the move towards home working. We could find there is less demand for real estate in city centres as currently configured. Ramsden also cites the retail sector as another casualty. If the shift to online shopping this year doesn't reverse, then more investment could be focused on capital stock rather than on labour (ie, retailers will invest in e-commerce infrastructure rather than hiring workers). As such, he fears that the permanent economic cost of the pandemic could be higher than the 1.5% loss of GDP currently pencilled into the Bank's forecasts. Unless the adjustment is very quick and happens easily, the chances are that the scarring effects over time could be larger [than 1.5%]. The session is underway, with committee chair Mel Stride asking the Bank of England about the downside risks faced by the UK economy. Governor Andrew Bailey says the 'fan chart' in August's Monetary Report showing the various paths for the UK economy is wider than ever before, due to the huge uncertainty over Covid-19. There are different views at the Bank about this uncertainty, in particular over two issues, he explains: 1) the 'natural caution' people will face about re-engaging with the economy 2) how much structural change will there be in the UK economy, and how much scarring will be left by the pandemic. That scarring can lead to higher unemployment, even once the pandemic is over, Bailey explains. The Bank has estimated it could mean GDP is 1.5% lower - but there's much uncertainty over this. Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, will testify to parliament's Treasury Committee about the economic consequences of Covid-19 shortly. He'll be joined by four senior colleagues: Dame Colette Bowe of the Financial Policy Committee, executive director Alex Brazier, deputy governor Dave Ramsden and Dr Gertjan Vlieghe of the Monetary Policy Committee. The session starts at 2.30pm. More reaction to the payroll report: Today's underwhelming ADP Payroll report raises the possibility that Friday's non-farm payroll (NFP) will miss forecasts. The government's own employment report is expected to show that 1.4 million new jobs were created in August. If ADP are right, and there were just 428,000 new private sector hires, then the NFP could fall short. One proviso, though -- last month the NFP was much stronger than the ADP's own count of payroll changes (which is odd, as they're counting the same thing...) ADP's payroll report also shows that small US companies created the fewest new jobs last month. In contrast, large companies had the strongest job gains, with the highest job creation in the leisure and hospitality sector. Wall Street financier Steven Rattner says this highlights the need for a new US stimulus package to help the economy. Just in: Fewer new jobs were created in America last month than expected, according to payroll operator ADP. ADP has reported that private payrolls rose by 428,000 last month -much lower than the 950,000 which economists expected. July's data has been revised higher, but not by very much -- it now shows that 212k new hires were made during the month, up from 167k. This could worry investors; except that ADP's report hasn't been a very good guide to the official jobs figures (the non-farm payroll), which are next due on Friday. Over in the US, two retailers have beaten forecasts with their latest results. Macy's, the department store, posted a loss of 81 cents per share, much better than the $1.77/share which analysts had pencilled in. Sales fell 35% year-on-year - a major fall, but not as bad as expected. Chief executive Jeff Gennett told investors that sales had held up better than feared: Macy's, Inc. performance for the quarter was stronger than anticipated across all three brands: Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, driven largely by the sales recovery of our stores.\" Macy's shares have surged 8% in pre-market trading. Handbag and accessories firm Vera Bradley did even better - posting a surprise profit for the second quarter. It's shares are up 20% in pre-market trading. Time for a quick recap, while we wait for the latest US jobs data (the monthly ADP Payroll report). UK house prices have hit a record high, as the end of the Covid-19 lockdown triggers a sharp pick-up in the property market. House prices jumped by 2% in August, the fastest rise since 2004, or 3.7% on an annual basis. This lifted the annual property price to \u00a3224,123. Nationwide, which compiled the data, said \"behavioural shifts\" were one factor, with people looking to change their lifestyle due to the lockdown. Property experts said the UK stamp duty holiday was also driving demand, but some are concerned that rising unemployment will undermine the market. HSBC has responded to the surge in demand by cutting the number of mortgages available to borrowers with small deposits. UK housebuilder Barratt confirmed that the market was picking up, by reporting a jump in reservations and sales in July and August. Global stock markets have rallied, on optimism that a Covid-19 vaccine could be rolled out soon, and signs that the global economy is picking up. The FTSE 100 is currently up 97 points, or 1.7%, at 5959, with housebuilders among the risers. Unemployment in Spain has jumped, as the latest Covid-19 travel restrictions hit its tourism sector. Wall Street is expected to hit fresh record highs today, as the rally in Big Tech continues. The European Union's securities watchdog is worried, though, that the stock market is overheating. Virgin Atlantic's rescue deal has cleared another hurdle, by being approved by a judge in London. It now needs a rubber stamp from US creditors tomorrow. Lego has reported a jump in sales, as families stocked up on new sets to see them through the lockdown In other political/economics news, work and pensions secretary Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey has argued that her colleague Rishi Sunak shouldn't raise taxes to cover the cost of the pandemic. In a move that would cheer Arthur Laffer, Coffey argued that cutting taxes would actually raise more money. She told Times Radio: In the past, when we have actually cut tax rates, we have seen taxes increase. Tax rates are a very dynamic situation, and we need to make sure the chancellor has the best opportunities when he announces to the country. There's been speculation in recent days that Sunak could raise certain taxes in this autumn's budget, to address the UK's soaring deficit (likely to exceed \u00a3300bn this year). But with borrowing costs at record lows (just 0.25% per year for a decade!) there's no sign that investors are shunning British gilts, so no need to fret about this year's deficit.... Over in parliament, Boris Johnson has rejected calls to extend the UK's furlough scheme. During Prime Minister's Question's, several MPs urged Johnson not to end the job retention scheme at the end of October, warning that it will lead to higher unemployment Johnson, though, argued that an indefinite furlough scheme was 'not the answer'. It's already cost \u00a340bn, and (he says) keeps people in suspended animation. My colleague Andy Sparrow's Politics Live blog has all the action as MPs return to the Commons (although physical distancing rules mean few are actually in the chamber). Reuters are reporting that Virgin Atlantic's \u00a31.2bn rescue deal has been approved by a London judge, at a court hearing this morning. This restructuring, which includes \u00a3200m from founder Sir Richard Branson, should give the grounded passenger airline breathing space to return to profit in 2022. The deal was approved by creditors last week, with Virgin warning that it could run out of cash next month if it was blocked. Anyone who stuck in cash and missed out on the stock market recovery since March should take comfort that at least they didn't bet against it. Some of the companies which speculators have bet against, such as Tesla, have rallied strongly in the last few months - meaning burnt fingers in the hedge fund world..... Shares in UK housebuilders are continuing to rally, following the jump in house prices and the pick-up in demand reported by Barratt Developments. Barratt is now up 8%, with Taylor Wimpey 5% higher, as the market holds onto this morning's gains. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, says investors are encouraged by rising sales in July and August, and ignoring Barratt's slump in profits in the year to June. \"Markets continue to seek the positive and ignore the negatives, but it is odd to see such relentless positivity in US markets when the pandemic has yet to subside, the economic impact is only just being felt and we have a US presidential election just a few weeks' away. \"The reaction to Barratt Developments' full-year figures is a case in point of the market being as forward-looking as possible. \"The dire numbers for the past 12 months have been entirely disregarded, investors choosing instead to look at the admittedly-promising recovery in sales levels. \"With the Nationwide HPI pointing to strength in house prices too the outlook for the sector seems quite bright, or at least much brighter than a few months ago. But those hoping for a smooth ride know that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is rising, casting a huge pall over Barratt and its peers.\" Terry Smith, chief executive of Fundsmith, isn't concerned that markets are out of kilter with the real economy. Speaking on Sky News, he says that record low interest rates are helping investors to look through the current steep downturn and plan for the recovery. As Smith puts it: Movements in economies and markets aren't coterminous. People will tell you that the only market that ends in a recession is a bear market, because markets are a bit forward looking. Smith also points out that Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 was followed by the roaring 20s, and an enormous stock market boom in America. Could we see the same again?... Heads-up, investors. The European Union's securities watchdog is worried that the stock market is overheating. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said there has been a \"potential decoupling\" between the recent gains in the financial markets, and the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, ESMA said its latest \"trends, risks and vulnerabilities\" report continued to see very high risks in markets, suggesting that the market rebound which began in late March may not be sustainable. More here. On that subject, the CEO of Deutsche Bank has warned that the economic recovery from the pandemic will take time. Christian Sewing told a banking conference in Frankfurt that there will be \"serious consequences\", as the economy would not return to normal this year or next year, meaning lower revenues for companies. Looking back at house prices, Nobel Francis of the Construction Products Association has shown how UK house prices climbed as mortgage rates fell steadily after the financial crisis: Over in Spain, unemployment has jumped as the Covid-19 pandemic hits its economy hard. The number of jobless people rose by 0.79% in August, pushing up the national total to 3.80 million. That ends a three-month run of falling unemployment, as Spain unwound the strict lockdown imposed this spring. Joblessness rose after travel restrictions were imposed by neighbouring countries, such as the UK, which had a serious impact on the Spanish tourism sector. Reuters has more details: The heavily tourism-dependent Balearic Islands were the hardest hit region, registering a 3% rise in unemployment. The pace of job creation in Spain stagnated in August, with only 6,822 more people with a formal working contract and contributing to social security in that month, compared to an increase of 161,000 in July, the social security minister said on Wednesday. Overall, Spain had about 740,000 more jobless people in August than in the same month a year ago. The lockdown prompted by the coronavirus erased some 900,000 jobs in March alone. The Office for National Statistics has also reported that house prices have hit a record high. Unfortunately, its new data only runs up to May, but it confirms the message from Nationwide earlier this morning (see opening post). According to the ONS, prices jumped by 2.9% in the year to May - up from 2.7% a month earlier. That lifts the average price across the UK to \u00a3235,673. The ONS adds: Average house prices increased over the year in England to \u00a3252,000 (2.9%), Wales to \u00a3169,000 (4.8%), Scotland to \u00a3155,000 (2.1%) and Northern Ireland to \u00a3141,000 (3.8%). London's average house price increased by 3.3% over the year to May 2020. Alas, Lego don't make a model stock market. But in the actual City, shares are continuing to rise. Britain's FTSE 100 is now up 1.8% or 105 points at 5967, recovering all Tuesday's fall. European markets are also buoyant, with Germany's DAX up 1.9% - and nearly positive for 2020. Strong factory data from America, the UK and China yesterday may be bolstering optimism. Currency moves are also helping - both the euro and the pound are down around 0.4% against the US dollar today. Investors are also anticipating (yet more) stimulus measures from central bankers to get growth and inflation higher -- meaning more easy money to pump up asset prices. Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at XM, says the eurozone's drop into deflation yesterday should also concern investors: A strong batch of US manufacturing numbers resurrected the dollar from the ranks of the dead and propelled Wall Street to another record high yesterday. The ISM manufacturing index jumped to its highest level in almost two years, turbocharged by a surge in new orders, which spells good news for economic activity in the coming months. Something that flew under the market's radar yesterday was that the euro area officially fell into deflation in August. The yearly inflation rate fell below zero for the first time since 2016, and while the core rate remained positive, it still fell way short of forecasts. This has profound implications for markets. Under its worst-case scenario forecasts, the ECB still envisioned inflation remaining positive this year. The central bank will therefore be under immense pressure to act again soon, even if verbally, to calm investors' concerns about a prolonged deflationary episode. It's not only houses that have been in demand this year. Lego has reported that sales to consumers jumped 14% in the first half of 2020, as people looked for activities for their children (and maybe themselves?) to enjoy during the pandemic. With many toy shops closed during the lockdown, visits to the LEGO.com e-commerce platform doubled - helping to push operating profits up by 11%. LEGO Group CEO Niels B. Christiansen says the play sector, like many parts of the economy, has changed rapidly due to Covid-19. \"Many of the major trends shaping our industry, such as digitalisation and e-commerce, are accelerating as a result of the pandemic. We saw strong growth in digital and traditional play, a rapid shift to e-commerce and the importance of having a truly global operating model.\" Popular sets included LEGO Technic, and its Star Wars, Disney Princess and Harry Potter offerings, if you're looking for a new challenge. Here's our news story on the surprisingly sharp jump in UK house prices last month: UK house prices surged at the fastest pace in 16 years in August as strong demand pushed the cost of an average home to a record high, defying the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The average house price soared to \u00a3224,123 in August, the highest on record, according to data from Nationwide building society. Prices rose by 2% during the month, the fastest rate of increase since February 2004. Over the past 12 months prices have jumped by 3.7% despite the UK suffering the deepest recession since records began after unprecedented restrictions on movement. That same 12-month period also included prolonged uncertainty over when and how the UK would leave the EU, as well as a general election. However, a number of factors have come together to prevent major house price falls since the market was allowed to restart in May, including pent-up demand and the chancellor Rishi Sunak's stamp duty holiday, which means buyers in England and Northern Ireland do not pay the tax on purchases worth less than \u00a3500,000 until 1 April 2021. Different rates and thresholds apply in Scotland and Wales. Housing expert Henry Pryor points out that the average house price buyer has, on average, suffered less economic pain from Covid-19 than the rest of the population: Back in May, Resolution Foundation showed that you were much more likely to lose work or be furloughed if you worked in a low-paid job than a high-paid one. Overnight, Australia sank into its first recession in decades, due to the economic damage of Covid-19. My colleague Martin Farrer explains: Australia has slumped into recession for the first time in nearly 30 years as the coronavirus pandemic finally ended its record run of economic prosperity. Not since George Bush Sr was US president and Bryan Adams ruled the pop charts has the country's economy suffered two consecutive quarters of negative growth, the official definition of a recession that was widely forecast after the pandemic hit. But Wednesday's figures revealed that a cratering of household consumption forced GDP to shrink by 7% in the three months to the end of June. It was the biggest fall ever seen since records began in 1959 in Australia, which has ridden the decades-long boom in the Chinese economy and associated demand for its huge reserves of commodities such as iron ore and coal. In the City, shares in housebuilders have jumped - lifting the FTSE 100 index away from the three-month low we hit last night. Barratt are the top riser, up 6.5%, as investors welcomed news of strong demand since the lockdown lifted. Rivals Taylor Wimpey (+3.6%) and Persimmon (+3.5%) are also among the top risers. Overall, the FTSE 100 is up 92 points or 1.5% at 5953, recovering almost all Monday's slump. That's partly because the pound is dipping this morning, having hit its highest level in 2020 against the US dollar yesterday. European markets are also rallying, with gains in Germany (+1.2%) and France (+1.5%), as hopes of a Covid-19 vaccine rise. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx explains: There were a few different reports you could point to. In the UK, Matt Hancock has said that the law could be changed to fast track a vaccine before Christmas, while in the US Dr Anthony Fauci said a similar thing, stating that if the ongoing clinical trials were overwhelmingly positive, then a vaccine could arrive earlier than expected. To compliment these claims, human trials of the Oxford vaccine have now begun in the US. This was more than enough for investors - so much so, in fact, that it meant they could ignore the US saying it won't join in with the global, WHO-backed effort to develop and distribute a vaccine. Barratt Developments, one of the UK's biggest housebuilders, has told the City that demand has increased sharply since the lockdown eased. Barratt reported that reservations are running at 314 per week since the start of July, compared with 250 per week a year ago. Home completion are 62% higher than in 2019, as builders catch up with work delayed by the lockdown. Barratt says this increased activity is being stimulated by pent-up demand and the Stamp Duty holiday. However, it has still scrapped a 'special dividend' planned for 2021, after seeing profits nearly halve due to the pandemic. CEO David Thomas adds: \"While COVID-19 has had a significant impact on our results, our priority has been to keep our people safe, mitigate the effect of the pandemic on our business and be able to emerge from the crisis in a resilient position. Although uncertainties remain, all of our sites are operational, we are seeing very strong consumer demand and our robust financial position means we enter the new financial year with cautious optimism. Now this is interesting - and bad news for first-time buyers: HSBC is planning to cut back its 'low-deposit' mortgages, following a surge of interest. My colleagues Kalyeena Makortoff and Patrick Collinson explain: HSBC, one of the last banks to offer low-deposit \"90%\" mortgages, is expected to restrict sales within days, in a move likely to leave first-time buyers struggling to find a loan. The bank's 400 mortgage advisers are currently flooded with applications from buyers, with customers forced to wait as long as three to four weeks to be interviewed by the bank. Meanwhile, the bank is opening a daily window of as little as half an hour in the morning for brokers to apply for loans before the daily allocation of money runs out. The Guardian understands that HSBC - which accounts for around 6.8% of the UK's mortgage market - has been trying to find responsible ways to curb high demand for its low-deposit mortgages. here's a note of caution from Andrew Montlake, managing director at UK mortgage broker, Coreco: \"Two words: reality check. As strong as the property market is right now, it will not last. \"Demand is understandably strong after lockdown and the added bonus of the stamp duty holiday, but unemployment is rising by the day and the economic outlook is highly uncertain as the furlough scheme ends. \"In the final months of the year we will start to see a reversal in the current rate of house price growth, as the true impact of Covid-19 on the economy shows through Lucy Pendleton, property expert at independent estate agents James Pendleton, agrees that the stamp duty holiday is fuelling the housing market -- and pushing prices sharply higher: \"Buyers emboldened by the stamp duty holiday have been engaged in a pitch battle for property, delivering a barnstorming recovery for the market. A stunning proportion of properties are now going for asking price or more, and offers are flooding in. It's like lockdown was a bad dream. \"The number of buyer registrations is also holding up at a time of the year that would typically see a slowdown. \"The late summer surge is particularly apparent in London where the greatest proportion of buyers will benefit from the maximum discount of \u00a315,000. \"For many, this emerging boom will mean paying so much more for a home that the extra cash eclipses the saving dished out by the Chancellor. That's more likely to happen the further up the chain you go and that's the beauty of this policy. It's great for first-time buyers but everyone's invited, and once people get it into their heads that they're moving, it's like an unstoppable force. People double down on that momentum when they then find a property they love and, armed with some extra cash, they find a way to stretch the seams of their pockets just a little bit more. Jonathan Hopper, CEO of Garrington Property Finders, says rural estate agents and surveyors have seen a surge in demand this summer. That includes families looking to quit the daily commuting rat race and move to a greener lifestyle, following the move to home working this year [despite the government's efforts to get everyone back to their old desks]. \"In some areas the property industry is playing catch up. We're seeing good homes go under offer very quickly but transactions take longer - as demand for surveyors outstrips supply and conveyancing firms race to dial up their capacity to handle a fast-growing workload. \"Prices are rising fastest among coastal and country properties as buyers planning for a new work-life balance built around less commuting seek more green space, fresh air and better value. Tobi Mancuso, director of property investment company Track Capital, warns that the government's stamp duty holiday could drive a house price bubble. That temporary cut lets buyers in England and Northern Ireland save \u00a315,000 when buying a \u00a3500,000 house, so could drive demand for the next six months: \"The chancellor's stamp duty holiday has launched the sale of the century, and properties are flying off the shelves as fast as they are getting listed. \"Estate agents are rightly making hay while the sun shines, and house prices have accelerated to a new all-time high. Strap yourself in, because we're going to see a lot of records broken in the next few months. \"The March 2021 date for the end of the stamp duty holiday feels a long way away, and it looks like the market is going to enjoy a long uplift. \"The danger is that this frenzy could create a bubble in house prices that will be quickly deflated when stamp duty returns, so buyers should be wary of prices that feel over-inflated. Capital Economics' Hansen Lu points out that house prices inflation is back at pre-pandemic levels: This jump in UK house prices makes homes even less affordable. At 3.7% per year, prices are now rising much faster than incomes -- particularly as many people's earnings fell during the pandemic (because they were furloughed, lost their jobs, or saw work dry up). As this chart shows, we're heading back to price/earnings levels seen before the 2007 credit crunch: Here's the key points from Nationwide's house price report: Nationwide also predicts that house prices will keep rising this autumn, partly thanks to government's temporary stamp duty freeze [in England and Northern Ireland, anyway]. Chief economist Robert Gardner explains: \"These trends look set to continue in the near term, further boosted by the recently announced stamp duty holiday, which will serve to bring some activity forward. But, a surge in unemployment in the coming months would then hit demand, he adds: \"Most forecasters expect labour market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead as a result of the aftereffects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK house prices have accelerated to a fresh record high, as the property market rebounds after the Covid-19 lockdown. New figures just released by Nationwide show that the cost of the average house surged by 2% in August alone, up to \u00a3224,123 from \u00a3220,935 in July. That's the biggest monthly rise since 2004 - and the highest recorded by Nationwide. On an annual basis, prices were 3.7% higher than a year ago -- a much faster rise than expected (economists had forecast a 0.5% monthly rise - and 2% year-on-year). Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, says 'behavioural shifts' are helping to drive the housing market, as some people look to move to a house better suited to home working. \"UK house prices rose by 2.0% in August, after taking account of seasonal effects, following a 1.8% rise in July. This is the highest monthly rise since February 2004 (2.7%). As a result, annual house price growth accelerated to 3.7%, from 1.5% last month. \"House prices have now reversed the losses recorded in May and June and are at a new all-time high. \"The bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions. \"This rebound reflects a number of factors. Pent up demand is coming through, where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing. Behavioural shifts may also be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown. Our own research, conducted in May (link), indicated that around 15% of people surveyed were considering moving as a result of lockdown. \"Moreover, social distancing does not appear to be having as much of a chilling effect as we might have feared, at least at this point. This comes just a day after the number of new mortgage approvals jumped by 40% in a month, up 26,000 in July to 66,300. Net mortgage lending rose by \u00a32.7bn, the Bank of England reported on Tuesday. Details and reaction to follow... Also coming up today Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey will testify to parliament's Treasury Committee on the economic impact of Covid-19 this afternoon, alongside fellow policymakers Dame Colette Bowe, Alex Brazier, Dave Ramsden and Gertjan Vlieghe. It's quite a busy day for economic news, including new Spanish unemployment figures which will illustrate the impact of the pandemic on its tourism economy. The latest monthly US payroll changes from ADP will show how many jobs were created by American companies last month. Plus the latest oil inventory reports will show if energy demand rose or fell last week. After falling to a three-month low on Tuesday, the FTSE 100 is expected to recover somewhat today. The index is called up 50-ish points at 5903, having dropped by 101 yesterday. Last night, Wall Street closed at fresh record highs, with technology stocks continuing their remarkable ascent.

Thank you for joining us. I'm Jill Homenuk, Head of Investor Relations. We're happy to have you here with us for our 2018 All-Bank Investor Day. We have an action-packed agenda today with all of our businesses being covered and a number of our senior executives who are presenting today. In terms of the agenda, we're going to run until about 10 o'clock and then we're going to have about a 20-minute break and then we'll run until about noon after that. I also want to welcome our viewers on the webcast. Thank you also for joining us today.</p><p>On behalf of those speaking today, I'd like to note that forward-looking statements may be made during this presentation. Actual results could differ materially from forecast, projections or conclusions in these statements. I would also remind you that the bank uses non-GAAP financial measures to arrive at adjusted results. Management assesses its performance on both a reported and adjusted basis and considers both to be useful in assessing underlying business performance. Our presenters will generally be referring to adjusted results. Additional information on adjusting items, the bank's reported results and factors and assumptions related to forward-looking information can be found in our annual report and our third quarter report to shareholders. As a reminder, the Q&amp;A portion is at the end of the agenda. So we would ask you to hold your questions until then. At that point, we will also be taking questions from the webcast.</p><p>Let's get started. Before I pass it over to our Chief Executive Officer, Darryl White, I'd like to show a short video. So if you could just please turn your attention to the screen.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, BANK OF MONTREAL: Welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us today here in the room and for those of you on the webcast as well. That video, as I watched it, reminded me of what an action-packed year it's been as we've continued to invest in our foundation. And today we're going to talk about how we pivot from that foundation into our future agenda.</p><p>So I've got 2 main objectives for the day. The first is to make sure that we're all clear on what's at the center of our priority list at the Bank of Montreal, what's at center ice for our executive team. And secondly, that you have the opportunity to get to know in further detail, in a lot of detail, frankly, our senior management team, my team of partners who are executing those strategies and delivering the results that we've talked about. I have had a lot of opportunity to spend time with most of you, frankly, over the course of the last couple of years. And today, you'll have the opportunity to spend a lot of time with all the leaders of the bank who are executing on those strategies.</p><p>Speaking of the team, we have had some exciting announcements, haven't we, in the last couple of weeks? Each of Surjit Rajpal and Gilles Ouellette have announced their intentions to retire in 2019. And we have announced that Surjit will be succeeded by Pat, who's here today, and Pat, in turn, will be succeeded by Dan Barclay, who is also here today. And when Gilles retires, Joanna Rotenberg will expand her current responsibilities beyond the Wealth Management businesses to the Global Asset Management businesses. We're excited about these changes. We take transition pretty seriously around here, and we've got a plan that will be absolutely flawless as we go through it.</p><p>I'm going to hit some of the key points. These are the key themes for the day. I'm going to hit the high points of what we call our strong foundation. I'm going to talk to you about why we believe we have truly differentiated strengths at the Bank of Montreal. And we're going to talk about how we're using those strengths to accelerate into the financial performance that we've been talking to about through the course of the year.</p><p>And as each of the presentations come up one by one, you'll see that they all ladder up to these key themes and to what we talk about as our One Bank, One Team, One Strategy approach.</p><p>A reset on the strategic priorities. A reminder on the strategic priorities that these haven't changed. And when we think about how we execute against these strategic priorities, we are now leaning in with an execution focus around operational excellence. And whether it's the customer experience, whether it's the digital innovation which we're going to hear a lot about today, the efficiency agenda which we're going to hear a lot about today, the North American platform and, of course, are tried and true risk management platform, in every case the lens that we're taking against the strategic priorities is one of a competitive mindset where we drive superior financial performance over the long run.</p><p>We spend a fair bit of time talking about the foundation. And this is for good reason. These on this slide are the bricks on which this house is built. We continue to invest in these bricks and we continue to invest in the house. I'm not going to touch down on all of them, but I will hit a couple of them to get us started here today. I'm going to start in the middle and build out.</p><p>When we talk about our diversified and attractive earnings mix, those are deliberate words, diversified and attractive. Diversified by geography. Diversified by business segment. We skew commercial. We skew U.S. relative to some of our peers. As far as our business segments are concerned geographically, if you look at our business, these are round numbers. We'll get into some more detail as we go through it. But you can think roughly about 60% of our income coming from Canada, close to 30% coming from the U.S., and about 10% coming internationally. 60/30/10, we like that mix. We think it sets us up well for the future and the environment that we're in right now. So a diversified and attractive earnings mix.</p><p>Top left, 8th largest bank in North America. Why does this matter? There are over 5,000 banks in North America. Bank of Montrealis the 8th largest bank in North America. We have the scale and we have the size to ensure that we're making the right investments at the right time in our digital agenda, in our technology agenda overall, in our regulatory agenda, in our brand spend, in our marketing spend overall. And this matters relative to many, many of the competitors that we've got in many of the markets that we deal in.</p><p>Below that, respected brand. Again, intentional language. The brand is really important. It's consistent everywhere we go. We've got a brand that's recognized whether we're here coast to coast in Canada or in Toronto, or if you went with me to Chicago or Milwaukee or Indianapolis or St. Louis or Minneapolis or our outer markets in Atlanta or in Ohio, for example, you would see that the brand is recognized and we continue to invest in it.</p><p>But we choose the word respected quite intentionally. And you'll see that come to life through the course of the presentations today. But one example of that I would give you right here, right now is that in the most recent American Banker awards, when American Banker did a study along with the Reputation Institute to source consumer opinion on the most respected bank brands in America, BMO's brand ranked #2 of the 40 largest banks in the United States as far as being respected. And that matters. And we think that that will matter a lot more as we go forward. By the way, #1 was USAA, so the bank to the U.S. military. So we're in pretty good company there.</p><p>Last one I'll hit on before I move off of this slide is consistent and effective risk management. Again, deliberate language, consistent and effective. We have been very good risk managers at the Bank of Montrealfor a very long time. It's important to say it. Our risk posture has not changed. Our risk appetite has not changed. We are challenging ourselves every day to make sure that where appropriate we execute and we operate at the full extent of our risk appetite. We are good risk managers in large part because we are very good relationship managers. And we manage risk with our clients through the cycle and we're continuing to manage risk with our clients through the cycle. And when we look back in 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now, our objective is that we'll be able to do a look-back and say that all through the piece we will always have been considered world-class risk managers. It's a differentiated strength of the bank.</p><p>It's not the only differentiated strength of the bank; there are a number of others. When I go through these, I want you to know that we've been very thoughtful about thinking about and asking ourselves the question and asking some of you the question what makes BMO unique. What makes BMO unique? And I'll go through these in a little bit of detail, and I think you'll see them come to life through the various presentations that we've got going on through the morning today.</p><p>When we talk about a well-established U.S. presence, first transaction in the United States for the Bank of Montrealwas in 1818. We bought the Harris Bank in 1984. We've continually invested over time in our business in the United States. In 2010, 3% of the bank's earnings came from our U.S. operations. In 2011, 11% of the bank's earnings came from our U.S. operations. And year-to-date, as we told you, this year 28% of our earnings are coming from our U.S. operations. That's a mix we like. That's a mix that will continue to increase as we go forward.</p><p>Core strengths in commercial and wealth management. We're very proud of our core strengths in these businesses. You're going to hear from our leaders today. Joanna, Gilles will talk about wealth management. Our commercial bankers, you're going to hear from Dave. You're going to hear from a panel of commercial bankers who will talk to you about the work that we're doing on both sides of the border. We believe we're as good at the businesses as anybody that we compete with in any market, and we're proud of it and we're leaning in.</p><p>Unique approach to cross-border banking. Why do we talk about it as a unique approach? Because a lot of people do talk about cross-border banking, don't they? We are the only bank, best we can tell, that operates in every one of our lines of business, so whether it be personal banking, commercial banking, business banking, wholesale banking, capital markets, wealth management or asset management, on both sides of the border and do it in every case on an integrated basis.</p><p>Why does this matter? I'll give you a couple of examples. When we polled our wholesale customers and we asked them if they either currently are or intending to transact and do business on both sides of the U.S. border, 70% of them said that they were. We're set up to help them wherever they're doing business across that 70%, and the 30% who are operating independently on either side of the border.</p><p>Another example, in our capital markets business when we talk about an integrated cross-border strategy, the value to our Canadian clients of our U.S. franchise is increasingly important. When we talk to our U.S. clients, the value of our Canadian franchise is, in fact, increasingly important. If you look back at our sub-pack over the last number of quarters, you can go back 2 years, 3 years, what you'll see if you look at our underwriting and advisory revenues is more often than not we have more investment banking revenues in the United States than we do in Canada. It's a balance that we like and it's a balance that's reflective of the unique approach that I'm talking about. And I think you'll see that as you go through the day through various presentations that we've got. You'll see it from Pat and Dan in capital markets. You'll see it from the commercial bankers and the panel that I talked about.</p><p>Next, creating what we call sustainable efficiency. We've talked for a number of years with many of you about the efficiency agenda that we've got here at the bank. We're going to talk about it again today. The key message here is that we're accelerating into that agenda. We're accelerating into that agenda. We've created a new function at the center of the bank. Luke Seabrook is leading that function. He's going to take you through some of the initiatives that we've got going on in the work that we call EI3. It's really important work. We're just getting going. We've got a lot of great initiatives that I'm personally really excited about and I've asked Luke to share them with you today. It's not just about design. It's about design and execution. It's not just about cost. It's about revenue performance as well as cost efficiency. And we'll go through that today.</p><p>And on the digital investment and innovation, this is absolutely in the last but not least category. There will be some things today that I think will surprise you. We're not taking a backseat to anybody on the digital agenda. And we're going to reveal some of the work that we've been doing on the digital agenda here today.</p><p>So when I put this together as a platform and ask myself whether this is a collection of assets that makes BMO unique, we believe it is, and we hope that you'll agree with us when we go through the day.</p><p>One thing that's absolutely unique and measurable is what we call our cornerstone asset which is our differentiated culture. And at BMO, wherever we go, and I've spent a lot of time with all of my partners on this, wherever we go, we find that this is true, consistent among geographies, consistent among business lines.</p><p>And when I look at employee satisfaction, ethics, human values collaborations, the way this chart works, if you didn't squint at the legend, is that the dark blue bars are BMO. And this is comparing us not to just FIs, to financial institutions, but to leading companies in the world.</p><p>So this is based on 90% participation of the entire workforce of 45,000 people at BMO, against leading companies in the world. This matters. Why does it matter? Because this is the foundation on which the One Bank, One Strategy, One Team is built. This is it. And frankly, when we talk about accelerating our performance and growing off the foundation, I don't know how you do that if you don't have this bedrock of a foundation. And we're very proud of it and we talk about it all the time and we talk about it as something that around here can never change.</p><p>Accelerating the performance. Performance is what you came for. So to take you through the journey, this talks a little bit about where we've been and where we're going. So if I give you a bit of the from/to, it looks a little bit like this. Tom will unpack this a little bit more for you at the end of the day. But when we think about what we've delivered, we talked to you a couple of years ago about delivering 2% operating leverage. We did that in 2016. We did it in 2017. The forecast for you is that going forward, that target will remain 2% over time, and we'll continue to work hard at delivering that.</p><p>The efficiency ratio -- and by the way, on the operating leverage I should point out it's obvious everyone knows how to do the calculation. But we talk about this very actively at our management committee. We talk about making sure we're incenting all of our people to think deeply about how do we grow revenues at a faster rate than we grow our costs? Simply put, that's what our operating leverage agenda is. It's more complex than that, as you know. We're going to get into the details as we go through it today.</p><p>That drives out the efficiency ratio. We've taken 340 basis points off our efficiency ratio over the course of the last 2 1/2 years. We've had work to do on that and we continue to have work to do on that and we've got opportunities.</p><p>The consequence of driving 2% off operating leverage for the next 3 years is that we will deliver a 58% efficiency ratio or better by the end of 2021, that's from the 62% ratio that we're showing you today. So that's where we're traveling on that. And it's important to point out that the efficiency ratio is an outcome, it's not the driver. The driver is our focus on the operating leverage.</p><p>Important also to point out that we're not suggesting to you that we will do that in lieu of making smart investments. In particular, on the technology agenda, we're spending over $2 billion, well through $2 billion of technology spend at the Bank of Montreal. We've been increasing that over the last 2 years at a double-digit rate and we expect to see that increase at a double-digit rate for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The important point here is row 3 and row 1 on the chart are not in conflict. At this place, we operate and say that we have to deliver for you, our shareholders, both of these.</p><p>U.S. growth, I touched on it a moment ago. You'll hear others touch on it as we go through the day. 28% of our earnings. We could see that number traveling to 1/3 of our earnings over the course of the next 5 years organically through the initiatives that we've got in place. And it's not just because the environment is good. We do think the environment is good and constructive and we've got a backdrop that works well against our business, but it's also because we believe that we can compete with anybody in the market and we're taking share and we're beating the market in the businesses where we're choosing to compete in the United States.</p><p>And the output of all of that is our EPS growth. We've talked to you about 7% to 10% EPS growth over the medium term as a target. We've achieved 8% over the last couple of years. And as we look forward, that doesn't change either. As I think about the likelihood of being at the bottom end or the top end of that range, I would say to you, assuming continued constructive markets both personal and commercial and assuming the capital markets cooperate, we would be more comfortable at the top end of that range. But those are some assumptions that we'll have to see as time goes on.</p><p>One Team, One Bank, One Strategy. This is important for a lot of reasons. This is important because it's at the core of our agenda today. I don't want to take you through all the reasons that I think it's important. I'd like you to judge it by the end of the day so that you can spend a lot of time seeing our teams in action, seeing the growth plans that we have in place, seeing how we're executing against our agenda and seeing how we're sticking to ensuring that we do all of that within the risk appetite that we've said is very important to the Bank of Montreal. And I hope that you'll agree with me when we get through the end of today that this is differentiation in action.</p><p>I've spent the last 2 years examining, studying, spending time in every corner of the bank. And I can tell you that everywhere I go, this pops. Lots of times you'll hear that this is important. I'm telling you that this pops everywhere in the Bank of Montreal.</p><p>So before I turn it over, just a reminder, the key takeaways today. The foundation is really strong and getting stronger. We're using that foundation to really emphasize to our customers, to our communities, to our employees and to you our shareholders, that these are truly differentiated strengths at the Bank of Montreal. Those differentiated strengths, in turn, drive the performance agenda that we talk about and the outcomes that we talk about from a financial perspective, and we do it with the approach that I've talked about in terms of One Bank, One Team, One Strategy.</p><p>So when you listen to the others speak today, you can do it with the knowledge that I'm going to be sitting over there in the corner with complete confidence in the strategy, in the team, in the leaders, my partners who are up on the stage executing those strategies, and that we feel really good about the future.</p><p>The next segment's really important. We've got to executives who have each well over 20 years of experience in technology and in digital banking. Brett Pitts joined us earlier this year from Wells Fargo where he was the group head of digital at Wells. He came to us from Wells and is driving really aggressive change here at BMO. We're really excited about that. And Steve Tennyson, who is our Chief Technology and Operations Officer, are going to present to you together how the foundation of the technology stack meets the innovations that we're talking about on the technology side.</p><p>So guys, over to you.</p><p>BRETT PITTS, CHIEF DIGITAL OFFICER, BANK OF MONTREAL: Thank you, Darryl. Morning, everybody. So as Darryl mentioned, Steve and I are grizzled veterans in the digital banking space, some more grizzled than others.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: I didn't say grizzled.</p><p>BRETT PITTS: I can say it about ourselves. We've each been in the digital banking space for upwards of about 20 years each, and in the broader technology space for considerably longer than that. And as you know, over that period of time we have seen enormous amounts of change in terms of business models and ways of working; certainly the technologies that we have at our disposal to be able to provide best-in-class customer experiences and the velocity of change has done nothing but increase over that period of time. And that's caused banks across the world and certainly including BMO, to Darryl's points, to invest significant sums of money over the course of that time to make sure that we were meeting competitive changes. But I think, more importantly, again to make sure that we were providing the best experiences possible to our customers and to our teams.</p><p>So as we close out 2018 and we start thinking about 2019 with internal stakeholders and external stakeholder groups like you, there are certainly lots of understandable questions about how do we assess our current performance? Where do we think we are from a digital perspective now? What are we thinking about in 2019 in terms of features and roadmap? And then for the next 3 to 5 years, how are we confident that we're setting BMO up to be successful in the future? So those are some of the things that we're going to take you through.</p><p>Thematically, you'll see a lot of consistency with a lot of the points that Darryl just made, from a digital perspective. We're oriented entirely around creating customer and business value in demonstrable ways that we can prove on both dimensions. So we have lots of themes that our teams on a daily basis are running decisions through, including things like, does this demonstrably improve the customer experience? And increasingly, as we talk with our teams and think about digital tools, data that can make them more productive, ways that we can better support them in providing best-in-class service to our customers using digital, we're taking that feedback and making sure that we're applying many of the same techniques and principles to the tools that they have access to as the ones that we also deliver to our customers.</p><p>We're actively embracing the opportunities presented by open banking. It provides so many new chances for us to be with our customers in all of the places where they spend their digital time, when they're thinking about their important financial decisions and being able to bring aspects of the relationship to them.</p><p>Likewise, there are a whole host of very innovative partners across different spaces where we can incorporate new products and experiences and technologies to be able to augment the experiences that we have on BMO.com and all of its various forms.</p><p>As Darryl mentioned, we have many unique assets, nondigital and nontechnology-related. The strength of our brand, the affinity the customers have for us, the loyalty, the full complement of distribution touch points that our customers continue to value. Digital can make each one of those assets stronger and, likewise, those assets make digital more effective.</p><p>Steve will talk about the growing investment that we've been making in technology over the course of the past 5 years in particular, and what that looks like going forward. And again to Darryl's point, how we're also using that technology to generate and capture the value associated with efficiencies so that we can continue to invest in employee and customer-facing experiences at an inorganic rate and certainly far outpacing the overall expense growth of the company.</p><p>So from a digital perspective, what does that look like in terms of outputs? Three main dimensions: revenue and sales growth, adoption and engagement of the channels, and self-service and the efficiencies associated with that.</p><p>So today, BMO is already a leader in digital sales. We generate from a retail perspective 25% of the retail sales that BMO makes, it closes through digital, which is best-in-class not just from a Canadian perspective but given my U.S. experience where I operated in and among banks who had spent billions of dollars over the course of the past 2 decades, much of it oriented around generating sales and revenue through digital, most of those banks are still in the 15% to 20% range. So 25% would be aspirational for most in the U.S., 2 to 3 years from now. We're there today and we have an intention to double that again over the course of the next 3 years, and so I'll talk about what that looks like. That's in Canada. From a U.S. perspective, the intention is to more than triple the contribution of digital sales over the course of the next 5 years.</p><p>Over those same periods of time, we intend to drive best-in-class adoption and engagement from a digital perspective. And by doing so, generating even more substantial efficiencies as more of our customers shift their everyday transactions from higher cost assisted channels into self-service primarily digital. So we'll talk more about what that looks like.</p><p>To lay the foundation for this, we'll first start with technology. And for that, I'll turn it over to Steve.</p><p>STEVE TENNYSON, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, BANK OF MONTREAL: Thank you, Brett. I'm really, really happy to be here to talk about our technology architecture and where we've come over the last 5 years. I said to Brett when he joined the bank a year ago, I said, you're joining a 200-year-old bank which is fantastic. We're very proud of that. But I think we have a 20-year-old architecture. So it feels like a 20-year-old bank, but we have the wisdom and knowledge of a 200-year-old bank.</p><p>So what you'll find in what we built is a very modern platform. It is a world-class architecture. But I guess more than anything, it's an enterprise class architecture. So you'll see at other banks where they have this architecture in different areas. But here, it's across every business. So today you'll hear from all the business units. They're all riding the same architecture, which is exciting.</p><p>It's built for speed. So you'll hear about, as Darryl said, efficiencies in automation. We've done a lot of that from all the way from agile through dev ops through automating our IT ops group. So we're really into getting things to market faster.</p><p>We built a state-of-the-art data and analytics platform which provides all kinds of insights for our business units. And we're looking at automating and changing a lot of our channels. We talked earlier outside about how it's easy to do plug-and-play now with this architecture. We can do open banking. We can build new platforms and we can plug them in easily, which is exciting.</p><p>At the heart of this, though, is what we call the SmartCore. We've branded it. But it's really the concept of a 3-tier, service-oriented architecture for those of you that read a lot about technology. There's 3 components to it. There's the connector grid, which integrates our channel platforms with our product systems. And it is simply that. It's really the glue that keeps it all together. The data and analytics platform that we built, we call IDP, we're leveraging that across all of our business units, and Luke's going to talk about that a little later. But we're seeing roughly 3.5 million queries on that a day. So we have a data [leg] that we built, and it's not disparate anymore. We have one area where we have all the data. And then we have some enterprise platforms, which are single sign-on, identity and access management for our customers. And we also get into digitization. So we have a toolkit that allows you to do automation of business flow and workflow, which, again, is going to help us get at all those efficiencies.</p><p>So we're excited about what we've built. Brett mentioned we've been at this for 5 years. I would say we more or less finished about 2 years ago, and we've been starting to see the benefits across many areas. We see it in the speed, again 30% to 40% on our speed. The efficiency is coming through the services we built, back to being service-oriented. We've built 1,600 services. We feel like we need probably 2,000 for a bank our size. And the other banks I think would probably say the same thing. And with Brett, we're building those last 400 in the digital work that he's going to talk about. And on quality, 4 or 5 years ago, we were doing 35,000 changes a year. We're now up to 70,000. And I don't think we could have got here with this number of changes if we hadn't done the architecture the way we did it. So that works out to about 1,500 changes a weekend. So my teams are very busy over the weekend, but it's allowing us to do that with quality.</p><p>And then more exciting than for probably my business partners, is that we've changed the mix of spend and we've moved almost 8 percentage points from run the bank to transform the bank and protect the bank. Doesn't mean the number's not going up, as Darryl said. We are expanding the amount we're spending, but, as we do, we can move more to transform as opposed to running, which is proof that the architecture itself is working.</p><p>And with that, as I give that money to Brett to spend, he's going to talk about what we're working on.</p><p>BRETT PITTS: Lots of ways to spend it.</p><p>STEVE TENNYSON: Yes.</p><p>BRETT PITTS: So again to that point, in terms of how we're tasking this very modern architecture and all the efficiencies now that we're starting to garner, first starting with sales and revenue generation. So as I mentioned, BMO today is a leader in digital sales at 1 out of 4 retail products being sold and closed through digital. That represents a doubling of the rate when you look 3 years ago back to 2015. We have tremendous momentum for reasons that I'll talk about here in a moment and reasons why I think we are particularly good at this. And the plan and confidence that again we're going to be able to double that rate to 50% over the course of the next 3 years.</p><p>Of course, we're going to continue to focus on making sure that we're effective from a product sales journey perspective and that we're very effective in deepening relationships with existing customers through digital and a lot of the application of the techniques. We will also have a particular focus on new customer acquisition, and new primary customer acquisition in particular. You'll hear more about that from Cam a little bit later in the morning. But our intention is to also double the number of net new customers acquired through digital over that same period of time.</p><p>So in terms of what it is we do that makes us particularly good at this, there are a number of banks and financial institutions who I think are good at particular steps in the customer sales journey. They're good at the marketing upfront work. They're good from an application perspective. For years, BMO has been looking at the end-to-end. So we are particularly effective during the customer shopping journey when they're doing researching, identification of needs, comparison in making the decision to acquire a new financial product. We have very sophisticated tools and techniques, even according to our partners, that we apply to make sure that we're delivering the right information to the right prospect at the right time with the right offer.</p><p>And then as we feed customers into the application journey, we have a very high level of fidelity between the customers starting a product application through digital and customers completing that application. We're north of 50% in terms of pull-through rates which, again, is best-in-class from an industry perspective particularly when applied to prospects.</p><p>And then from a use perspective, we've been going much deeper into the architecture, the operations, the way that the overall enterprise works, to ensure that we have more real-time decisioning, more real-time product fulfillment and more real-time onboarding to get customers up and running with their relationship much more quickly than they would have been able to in the past.</p><p>Business Xpress, which, again, you're going to hear about a little bit later, I think is a terrific example from the small business front where we have improved the time to loan by 95%. So essentially, we have taken a process that used to take days and distilled it now literally to just a handful of minutes, which, of course, adds tremendous value to customers being able to get to yes faster, and certainly adds significant amounts of business value. So very excited about that as well.</p><p>We're going to be applying the same techniques, tried and true, across a broader set of product portfolios and a broader set of businesses to be able to achieve the kinds of outcomes that I talked about earlier.</p><p>Now, from an adoption and engagement perspective, I'd say today we are with the rest of the pack in terms of adoption and engagement of digital in the mid-50s, which is pretty typical from a Canadian perspective. We intend to grow that over the course of the next 3 years to best-in-class rates of 70%. We're going to have a particular focus on mobile, where we have identified that we have a really good opportunity there. I think we have made tremendous progress with our mobile offering over the course of the past 18 months. And I'll talk about what that looks like. But with that focus on mobile, we have confidence in being able to grow to that 70%. And why that's important in terms of both customer and business outcomes, digitally active and engaged customers on just about every possible dimension are happier with us, more loyal, less likely to attrit, are a disproportionate source of revenue and are more efficient for us to serve because they have moved more of their everyday transactions from high-touch channels into self-service, which is also good for assisted channels being able to free up more capacity for more sophisticated conversations with customers, which is what they continue to value in assisted channels.</p><p>Now in my experience, having driven engagement to 75%, 80% in the past, there are 2 important dimensions to being able to do that well. First and foremost, of course, you have to have a really competitive digital offering. And we do. That's what we've been focused on, again, over the past couple of years in particular. In the mobile space, we are at a high watermark in terms of customer satisfaction when we talk with them directly about our mobile offering. With publicly available sources of feedback like App Store ratings, we see tremendous progress over the course of the past year.</p><p>We're also in the process of introducing a whole host of innovative first-to-market features, some of which you'll see during the tech demos at lunchtime. BMO Quick Bill Pay is one of the features that we are most excited about. This gives customers the ability using their mobile device to be able to take a picture of a bill or forward an eBill to a BMO email box, have us, through a proprietary application of optical character recognition and AI, identify the different parts of the bill - the due date, the account number, the amount due - and automatically pay that on behalf of customers.</p><p>So as we put that in front of customers in prototype and pilot, they have absolutely rave reviews in terms of the utility and the ease of use of the feature. We've been issued patents associated with this. And, in fact, we're going to announce in the next 24 or 48 hours that we just won a Gartner Eye on Innovation Award for the Americas region for this feature. And this is just one of many features that you're going to be seeing from us over the next 6 to 12 months.</p><p>Now, the other important part of driving digital adoption and engagement is making sure that digital is part of every conversation that happens across the enterprise. So every product open, every onboarding conversation, every servicing interaction, every long-term loyalty conversation, ensuring that across the enterprise we have the right expertise and advocacy to make sure that we're talking about digital with all of our customers, to be able to drive the kind of engagement.</p><p>Couple of other really quick examples. And again, you'll see these in the tech demo for those of you who are here in the room. Over 2018, we have been completely redesigning and reengineering our entire digital offering within the U.S. So new digital sales platform, new digital servicing platform, very contemporary, responsive design, new look and feel across all of the different digital devices, new digital banking all built on a brand-new infrastructure that will become the go-forward digital infrastructure not just in the U.S., but we're also going to be using it in Canada to give ourselves true North American scale, efficiency and responsiveness.</p><p>And I've talked a lot about retail. But the progress that's being made is being made across the enterprise. So within wealth, within capital markets, within commercial, you'll see lots of good examples as the morning goes on. This is an example from our commercial business, where we have a new Online Banking for Business mobile application. So for our more sophisticated commercial and treasury management customers, when they're on the go, traveling, sitting with their customers, the full suite of features enabling them to be able to manage their company's finances. A particular feature of this being biometric authentication. So enabling our customers to be able to divorce themselves from the keychain full of physical fobs that they have been carrying around for years, continue to carry around for a lot of our competitors, they now have a whole host of options, including fingerprint, voiceprint, facial recognition and eye recognition in order to be able to authenticate and release high consequence transactions. So early days in terms of the rollout, performing very well and we're getting great feedback from customers.</p><p>Last topic that I'll touched on, partnerships. You hear a lot about partnerships within the financial services space right now. This is key to accelerating our digital strategy and progress as well. About 3 years ago, we started to establish a partnership ecosystem foundation on a number of different dimensions. So we're working with big technology firms like Amazon, Google, Apple, Samsung, to ensure that we're putting BMO products in all of the places where customers expect to be able to interact with them. We have a growing inventory of fintechs who we're working with so that we have access to new products, experiences and technologies that we can incorporate into BMO.com, without having to build everything ourselves.</p><p>We participate in a number of cross-industry consortia both in the U.S., and in Canada, around such consequential topics as blockchain, identity and payments. And we also participate and fund in a host of accelerators and incubators both in the U.S., and Canada, to give us early looks at new technologies and early-stage companies at a time when we can partner with them on their product development and influence that in ways that we know are going to be beneficial to our customers and our business.</p><p>So we'll continue to do all of those things, and I think that's pretty typical of what you hear from a number of competitors. But in 2019 and beyond, we're also starting to pivot into larger scale, more consequential types of partnerships. Today, you will see an announcement of a new partnership that we're forming with Intuit, which I think is a perfect example of this, an open banking partnership to better serve our mutual customers more easily and securely, enabling them to be able to take their banking data, put it into Intuit products like accounting software and, in the future, being able to take accounting information back into their banking relationship. I think this is a perfect example, because it is a truly customer-centric model, very transparent in terms of the interaction with customers, puts them firmly in control of their information, and, again, a very, very intuitive experience. So we're very excited about this going forward. And it, again, is one of many new partnerships that you're going to be hearing about in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>So with that, we'll wrap.</p><p>STEVE TENNYSON: I was going to say, so we hope you feel as we do, which is, we're really excited about the business and customer value we're generating. I'm excited about the business value for Brett, and Brett's very excited about the customer value. But we're doing some really great things.</p><p>And on the technology side, I think if you walk away feeling like it is a competitive advantage for us. I didn't say it earlier, but we have 4 patents outstanding on the SmartCore. So we do feel like how we built that is a competitive advantage for the bank, and it's for the entire bank not just a part of the bank.</p><p>BRETT PITTS: Great. You've seen certainly through our talk today lots of references to business strategies and you're going to hear about digital in just about every presentation for the rest of the morning. Digital is core and intrinsic to everybody's growth strategies over the course of the next 3 to 5 years. It's certainly a team sport from a BMO perspective. And again, from a strategic standpoint in addition to making sure that we're making the experiences the best they can be on BMO.com properties, we're also really embracing open banking and the power and leverage from a distribution and customer service perspective that that presents to us.</p><p>So the last thing that I'll do before we wrap up is, for those in the room, I'm going to run a quick add for the tech demo that we have during lunch and would certainly encourage all of you to go out and spend some time. We've got between 15 and 20 different prototypes, pilots, new features that we are in the process of launching as well as the business partners and technology partners out there who are very excited to be able to explain that to you, demo it for you, answer questions. For those of you on the webcast, I'm also going to run a short promo here to just show you 5 or 6 of the things that you'll see out there. So let's go ahead and run the video.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>BRETT PITTS: We'd like to now invite Luke up to talk about EI3. Luke?</p><p>LUKE SEABROOK, GLOBAL HEAD OF ENTERPRISE INITIATIVES, INFRASTRUCTURE &amp; INNOVATION, BANK OF MONTREAL: Thank you very much, gentlemen. Just quickly two seconds on where I've come from and why I'm standing in front of you today. I previously was President and COO of Capital Markets and prior to that was the Head of Global Trading products. And I say that only in so far as it to make an opening statement that when I moved into this new role, I was pleasantly surprised if not shocked at the extent to which the work had been going on in the areas that exactly we needed to be doing them. And I think you hear every organization say that efficiency is a focus, at least you should be, that's certainly the case here at BMO.</p><p>But I think what I've learned is that at BMO, we go about it quietly and we've accomplished a lot. And so what we intend to do here today is take you through some of the things that you may not really have been exposed to the full extent and the opportunity set associated with them.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>LUKE SEABROOK: So part of the catalyst for accelerating the efficiency at BMO is what we call EI3. The video gave you a brief overview. But EI3, what does it stand for? It's enterprise, initiatives, infrastructure and innovation. The key, though, is it's enterprise wide. And from our perspective, this is something that's relatively unique relative to our Canadian peers.</p><p>So we're here. We exist to leverage all of the good things that are going on across the entire organization, the different business units, the support areas, where we know that other parts of the organization could benefit by just even being made aware of what's going on and what they could benefit by implementing it. It provides resourcing. So where expertise or incremental help are needed in order to accelerate opportunities, we provide those.</p><p>Mandated in February of this year, we anticipate that with EI3, we will be able to deliver over $1 billion in savings and productivity improvement by 2021. This includes both permanent cost takeouts as well as revenue opportunities. And that $1 billion isn't aspirational. And as a matter of fact, as we're exiting 2018, we have locked in over 1/3 of that $1 billion already. And of that 1/3, none of it has related to revenue. It's all been structural cost removal. And of that removal, less than half of it actually is people-related reductions; the balance coming from procurement in a number of areas that we'll get into.</p><p>So with that as a backdrop, obviously, I'm highly confident that hitting the $ 1billion is something that we'll definitely achieve.</p><p>We're also about improving efficiency for today, tomorrow and beyond. We're looking to simplify the way we work across the enterprise, all the while keeping BMO's customers and, equally importantly, our employees in mind. We have the ability to unlock our employees' potential by eliminating unnecessary complexity, overhead and processes, again, across the entire enterprise.</p><p>As well as having the mandate, we have the budget, the people and, very importantly, the support of the organization broadly.</p><p>So how do we get at this? Well, by driving sustainable cost benefits, we have the ability to be reinvesting in strategic investments that can accelerate revenue opportunities. And this is across the organization. EI3 is agnostic. We don't have a P&amp;L. We're here to purely support and facilitate the entire organization.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, our productivity efforts are focused into 3 areas - first, optimizing enterprise infrastructure; secondly, delivering on targeted strategic initiatives; and finally, enabling simplification and automation.</p><p>So let me start with enterprise infrastructure. I'm going to call out procurement as an example because this is often an overlooked part of our industry, generally. So we've taken an outside lens as to how to approach it, and it started with specifically hiring from outside of the financial industry for our new global procurement head. This will allow us, with that expertise, to evaluate how are we using our technology? How are we leveraging our data and analytics? How do we move to a best-in-class procurement environment?</p><p>So with that, we're going to be transforming our supplier spend on everything that we use, including how we actually transact with the suppliers. We're launching our first eAuction in the next couple of weeks, which, to our knowledge, is the first of any Canadian bank. Studies will show you that on average 10% to 15% of incremental savings are realized in this approach versus the best bilaterally negotiated contract.</p><p>So to put this in the context of just our commoditized items, from pens to toilet paper, we see significant potential savings. There's only so much you can do with demand management. We needed to find another way to get at these costs. These commoditized items, for context, represent 25% of our annual spend. So when you apply the potential savings by moving to eAuction, you can see the size of the benefit there is significant.</p><p>We also have a supplier innovation program. This is becoming official next month. This is something that we've been working on for a number of months with select suppliers. It gives us early access to innovative products and services that they've been developing. But more importantly, an element of this is that we actually become part of their development process. So we're able to influence the end product, having it come out in the form that's much easier and much more effective for us to implement into our organization.</p><p>The opportunity to do all of this lends itself to our ability to reduce our real estate footprint. And with that, we have a target of 10% to 15% reduction in our real estate footprint over the next several years. With that comes the ability to accelerate agility, collaboration and engagement as we implement new ways of interacting between the employees across multiple disciplines in the organization. Again, achieving this allows us to actually free up 10% to 15% space.</p><p>You saw in the video 290 Yonge Street renderings. This is really part of our broader Toronto GTA strategy. It's one that we're going to be launching as the BMO campus. We're going to be borrowing from the employee best-in-class seen in the likes of Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft. Had we not had a standstill in negotiating that space, we would have been competing against 2 of those companies to secure.</p><p>We're looking to create a one-of-a-kind workplace. It'll be a point of connection across all parts of the business where innovation and the decisions made around them are accelerated and simplified. And more importantly, this will put BMO in a position to attract and retain the best talent.</p><p>Next, targeted strategic investments. This is where we're going to be putting our investments in data and technology to work in innovative ways. For example, using robotics. We've been able to cut the amount of time that it takes to onboard a commercial payments client by 99%, reducing it from 72 hours to an hour. This gives us a better customer experience, obviously, with a faster turnaround and an employee experience, because what we were able to reduce was mostly manual work. That frees these employees up to do higher value add.</p><p>Simplification and automation in EI3 is about automating, simplifying or outright eliminating. Unnecessary work and overhead, we have the ability to look across the organization and look for it. From our vantage point with our mandate, we then have the ability to look to either automate or optimize or ask whether or not we should be even continuing to do it. Example of that would be employee onboarding. There are hundreds of people in this organization involved with onboarding new employees; incredibly inefficient for us. EI3 will be providing an automated source to eliminate the need for a lot of the bodies that have been involved to date, that will route, fill and actually provide a cognitive interface at the desktop with the new employee, all the while reducing and freeing up the capacity for hundreds of employees.</p><p>This next one was one that we just decided to do and see how hard we had pushed the organization when we sized what our productivity opportunity set was. So in addition to everything that had been identified, we went to the top 60 leaders of the organization and challenged them to come up with eliminating one inefficiency within their organization which hadn't been previously identified, for which they had 3 months to do it. The result, I think surprised almost all of us in a sense that there was $20 million in ongoing structural cost takeout. More importantly, 45,000 hours of employee time was freed up as a result of that. And that's one ask with one small group.</p><p>Data and AI. This is the one when I mentioned we've been quiet about things, relatively quiet, is one that in my moving over, having come from an area where we were doing a lot of data and AI work on the trading business, really surprised me and thoroughly impressed me once we looked into it.</p><p>Steve talked earlier about the significant investments that we've made in SmartCore. Those are foundational investments. They were not only money, but they were also time. We set out years ago to develop and commit to doing so, the SmartCore. It was deliberately architected. It was developed, financially supported and committed to. The time and financial investment now provide us with a single view of the customer and the organization. But we needed to be able to bring that data to life. So we created an advanced analytics tool that sits on top of the SmartCore. This allows us to evaluate both the operating environment of the organization and the opportunity environment for the organization. And it needed to be more than just an analytical tool. So it was developed to be both a teaching tool but also a learning tool.</p><p>And this is where it gets really interesting. By teaching the users how to use the platform, the platform itself actually learns from the individual's interactions. And as it learns over time, watching how people are using it, where are they going, what are they accessing, what are they doing after they may be accessing a particular spreadsheet, where do they go, it's able to proactively deliver insights to individuals before they may have even considered looking for them. We think that will make an improved decision-making process. It will support the actions that are taken as a result of that. It will empower employee change by driving revenue growth so that we have a better understanding of where the opportunity set lies for our customers. All of this comes with an incremental cost savings through an improved understanding of our operating environment.</p><p>This was actually so well done - this is an absolutely factual statement - that we've been approached by one of the largest technology companies in the world to purchase it. It's not for sale but asked to purchase it.</p><p>So what do we need to do to bring all of this to life? Well, it's talent. And so as Darryl said, talent is the most, most valuable asset. We have a highly engaged workforce with an award-winning culture. It's a combination of these 2 things that make us truly differentiated from our competition. But we needed to find a way to fuse all of these elements together across the entire organization in a focused, coordinated way so that we could actually leverage it.</p><p>We mentioned the BMO Innovation Fund on the video. This is something we've deliberately, thoughtfully and thoroughly built out, have piloted and will now be expanding.</p><p>Other banks have chosen to go outside their organization to implement their innovation push. There was an article this morning on somebody who did that.</p><p>We wanted to respect and leverage our employees, not overlook them. To suggest that they don't have valuable insights and ideas, I think that would be inconsistent with our culture.</p><p>The BMO Innovation Fund is a funded vehicle with dedicated space where we will be going out to the entire workforce with focused questions and requests for ideas. The responses will be collected and presented in a transparent manner so that people can monitor where the ideas that are submitted are that have been selected to move forward in that process.</p><p>This is all being done through a world-class ideation program. We piloted it last month. Response rate exceeded all of the expectations. And I think the more important data point was that of the ideation provider who has done this for a number of Fortune 100 companies and has actual empirical data to see. So to me, that's another proof point of the kinetic energy we have built up in our employee base looking to engage.</p><p>We know that technology will eliminate some of today's jobs; it'll also create new ones. Knowing that, we're launching programs that will enable us to continually invest in our employees. As new jobs are eliminated through technology, new jobs will open up through emerging technologies. The results were BMO accelerated performance. It gives us the ability to retain and attract our existing employee base.</p><p>So we have a bolt-on talent program that we're launching. It gives us the opportunity for the employee to receive university credit for courses that they take onsite and online. They can ultimately earn advanced degrees, an example being a master's in data science from both a top Canadian University and a soon-to-be-announced Ivy League U.S. entity. It's imminent to be announced.</p><p>To us, EI3 is all about being the catalyst for accelerating organization and efficiency across the organization by working in partnership with all of the organization today, tomorrow and beyond, realizing productivity benefits in excess of $1 billion by 2021, creating capacity for the investment in strategic growth and practical innovation, all while making sure BMO is future proofed.</p><p>So thank you. I would now like to introduce Dave Casper and the team from BMOU.S. a strategic growth opportunity for us.</p><p>DAVID ROBERT CASPER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, BMO HARRIS BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION: Thanks, Luke. Thank</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>Joining me, and this</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>and Steve Taylor, our U.S. CFO. Steve's going to talk a few minutes about our overall U.S. business. From a financial perspective, he'll talk a little bit more on our P&amp;C business. Ernie will then talk about her strategies in the personal and business banking, and I'll close it out with some comments on our U.S. commercial.</p><p>With that, over to Steve.</p><p>STEPHEN R. TAYLOR, CFO, BMO FINANCIAL CORP.: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We believe the U.S. business continues to represent a strong growth opportunity for BMO. Our core footprint is Midwest-centric with our largest market shares in Wisconsin and the Chicagoland area. We have top-2 market shares in those regions, and we believe they continue to offer significant room for us to grow. We also have banking operations in several Midwest cities, including Indianapolis, Kansas City, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Arizona, and to a lesser extent, Florida. In addition, we have offices in several large U.S. cities that support our national commercial lending businesses as well as Capital Markets and Wealth. In -- from a relative growth perspective, we think this footprint also offers upside. In terms of size of GDP, the Midwest is bigger than all of Canada, and the U.S. has outperformed Canada in that regard, and that is expected to continue.</p><p>The U.S. business has grown in scale significantly over the past several years, and this has been through a combination of organic growth as well as strategic investments. As of Q3 '18, as Darryl mentioned, the overall contribution of the U.S. to BMO's adjusted net income was 28%. That's been increasing over time and is up from 20% in 2014 and 24% in 2017. Overall, U.S. segment growth has also been strong, with NIAD growing 9% in 2017 and 30% in 2018. While tax reform is certainly a big part of that, the pre-provision, pre-tax was also up 14%.</p><p>The M&amp;I transaction was a significant acquisition which has led to increased scale and efficiency in the U.S., but we've also executed other transactions, including Transportation Finance, Greene Holcomb Fisher and the recently closed KGS transaction. All of these represent strategic additions to our core U.S. businesses.</p><p>The strength and advantage of our U.S. segment strategy is our ability to market as one bank, leveraging the value that all three of the businesses bring. Our commercial business is a strong referral source for Capital Markets and is also a strong referral source for Wealth, particularly the private client business. Our Personal business provides a strong retail deposit gathering foundation for the U.S. overall, and in addition, there is strong synergy between the Personal business and the Wealth business in terms of partnering to grow the emerging wealth segment.</p><p>Across the U.S., we feel there is room to continue to grow in all core markets and use the complementary power of our businesses to do that. You'll hear more about the U.S. strategies for Capital Markets and Wealth in a bit.</p><p>In U.S. dollars, the overall U.S. business delivered about $1 billion in profit through the third quarter of 2018, with U.S. P&amp;C itself on track to deliver in excess of $1 billion for the year.</p><p>Before I turn it over to Ernie and Dave, I would like to share some U.S. P&amp;C financial metrics. The business has seen strong growth over the past year, with revenue up 10%, NIAD up 37%, or 8% and 31% when you exclude the loss on the sale of some indirect auto loans in 2017. Again, while some of that NIAD growth is tied to tax reform, pre-tax, pre-provision is up 15%, reflecting strong loan and deposit growth in the business as well as the benefit of higher rates.</p><p>On a go-forward basis, we are focused on growing deposits and loans at the same pace, and Ernie and Dave will talk a little bit more about our initiatives and strategies in that regard. The business' results have also tracked well against our regional peers, and we believe we can continue to perform well in that regard.</p><p>And finally, before I turn it over to Ernie and Dave, some key profitability metrics for the U.S. business: an efficiency ratio of 59.2% on a year-to-date basis and an ROE of 11%, with a return on tangible equity of just under 16%. Those all represent significant improvements over the past several years. It had been a medium-term goal of ours to drive the efficiency ratio into the 50s and get the ROE above 10, so it's been good to see that happen, and we think we can improve on those numbers with an outlook to drive the efficiency ratio into the mid-50s and the ROE in the 12% to 13% range over the next 3 years.</p><p>And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Ernie.</p><p>ERMINIA JOHANNSON, GROUP HEAD OF U.S. PERSONAL &amp; BUSINESS BANKING - BMO HARRIS BANK, BANK OF MONTREAL: Great. Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I want to start off by saying the U.S. Personal and Business Banking business is really poised for growth. There isn't a better time to be in this business than right now.</p><p>And that's really because of 3 factors: one, we have a strong U.S. economy. That's really fueling our business growth. Second of all, our consumer and our business banking segment is moving to a digitization space that we've already heard Brett speak to. That allows us to transform our business and take advantage of our North American scale. So we're going to be punching above our weight in the digital space because of our North American capabilities. And thirdly, we have a whole bunch of assets that are really built for more. Our people, our branch network, our products, our capabilities are going to allow us to do more with our current footprint and our current capabilities.</p><p>So let's talk a little bit about the assets we have, what we're planning to do with them, how we're focusing in on some opportunities and the strategies and their outcomes. So in particular, we right now have about 2.2 million customers and growing, a really important fact. Our business banking segment services clients that have businesses of revenue size of greater than $5 million and lending of under $1 million. That allows us to leverage the integration of retail and the commercial banking capabilities together.</p><p>Our retail franchise is composed of a very high skew of mass affluent customers who, as Darryl has already pointed out, really believe in our brand and trust in us as a strong reputable bank. That allows us to have strong conversations and holistic relationships with them. We also have the capability of driving through that mass affluent base significant referrals to our private client base and also to drive deposit capabilities. We represent 2/3 of the deposits that are taken within P&amp;C through this customer franchise.</p><p>As I look to what our opportunities are moving forward, we cannot not pause and talk about our deposit capabilities. We have the second leading market share in our home markets and an opportunity to leverage, as I speak further about the opportunity in our light-branch-footprint markets.</p><p>We have been leading in this space for many years. We have capabilities and talents that go deep in deposits. You can see us being able to compete with the nationals as well as the regionals, and we're doing that by leveraging a great customer relationship to drive those very valuable deposits into our business.</p><p>So as we think about where we're going forward and what we need to really maximize the opportunities against, it's really around these 3 areas. The first one is our footprint. 6 years ago I probably would have said I was disappointed in our branch footprint; I'm now saying it's a competitive advantage. We have 200 branches in markets that represent 2/3 of the deposit opportunity for our business, significant opportunity for us to leverage digital and our light branch footprint.</p><p>Second of all, as Brett mentioned, we are very light in digital. Right now, we're waiting for a launch that's coming in the next coming weeks that's going to transform our engagement with customers in a digital manner. That'll allow us to have more servicing -- more sales conversations because customers are self-serving, but we'll also be able to digitally acquire more customers in our lighter branch footprint. And you can see where we are now and where we target to be.</p><p>The third area of opportunity for us is in our lending business. To drive consumer profitability through our lending business is key. And we're looking at shifting the mix of our lending book; not changing our risk appetite, not moving from where we are, but cross-selling into our existing mass affluent base as we go forward. And you can see where we are on credit card penetrations and where we aspire to be in the very near future, really in line with where the industry is going. So that's also part of our focus as we go forward.</p><p>I'm going to share with you the strategy that we have developed, and it's a 4-pillar strategy that has a catalystic effect, if I can use that terminology, when each one of these components come together. And the first is about going on the offense in deposit taking. We are future-proofing our deposit capability for not only our home markets where we have high market share and -- but we're also doing it because we think there's an opportunity for us to acquire new customers in our lighter branch footprint.</p><p>We just recently launched a new app, Apply, an Apply section of our online platform in digital banking for deposit-taking, and we're already seeing a 60% lift in pull through on new customers coming through that app. We're going to streamline that process to make it all end-to-end for us to be able to acquire new customers in our light-branch-footprint market and then take the learning about price optimization, marketing, and bring it to defend our capabilities in Wisconsin and Illinois.</p><p>In business banking, we think we have a phenomenal opportunity to take that strong commercial brand that we have, combine it with the simplicity of retail-type operations, automation -- automated lending, and you're going to see Andrew Irvine speak a little bit about a capability that we have in Canada that we're going to bring to the U.S. to make sure we're doing an automated approach to lending in the smaller end of this business. For us, combining the business relationship and the personal relationship through that combination of sales teams and our branch force is going to be power for us -- powerful for us as we go forward to consolidate relationships.</p><p>Third, I've spoken a little bit about the consumer lending book. We've recently made a change in the mortgage business. We did that because the consumer in the U.S. is shifted. We've launched a new application, a digital application, for consumers to apply themselves or to use a self-service capability in our branch. We're seeing an improvement in the speed to deliver a mortgage to our customers by 60% as a result of that application. We see an opportunity for us, as I mentioned to you, to cross-sell our customers and drive more profitability through a holistic lending relationship with them as well.</p><p>And lastly, but certainly not least, is digitization and enhancing our guidance delivery. The more we're able to simplify our processes and digitize more in our branch network and in our back office, we're going to spend more time with our customers and have those great conversations, and our team is ready to engage in that as we speak, prepared and aligned to be able to have better conversations with our customers.</p><p>So as I think about, how does this all come together, and what are we looking to achieve over the next little while, it's really about achieving a revenue growth in the 6% to 8% range. We believe we will be top-tier in deposit growth, and 50% of that growth will come from our lighter-branch-footprint network. Our loan growth, because of that shift from mortgages into more unsecured and indirect auto lending, will now be growing at about 3% to 4%. And of course, last but not least, the catalyst for efficiency, for better conversation and revenue generation, is digital engagement, where we're moving from a -- from where we are to a 50% engagement score to a 70% engagement in the next 5 years.</p><p>So as I think about the strategy overall and its compounding effect, we really have something very special going on right now in the personal and business banking business in the U.S. We have confidence in the momentum that we have that you've seen already articulated and in the strategy that's already executing and starting to show performance. Our bankers are behind this and they're confident that we're going to get there as well. So we're looking forward to the next 3 years delivering against these objectives successfully.</p><p>So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Dave.</p><p>DAVID ROBERT CASPER: You can see why Ernie has just been named the #2 Woman to Watch in American Banker. I don't know who #1 is, but she better watch out.</p><p>So good morning. I'm here to talk about our largest business in the U.S., our commercial business. Our commercial business is one of our most successful businesses. It's one that we're most noted for. It's one of the -- it was the business we were founded upon. And it's the business that has a strategy that every day, a very steady, strong, long-term, focused management group, all sitting right over there in our North American commercial bank -- by the way, I've never seen them sit this long without calling a customer, so relax, it's coming. You're going to hear from them in a minute. I am, in essence, their warmup act. So let me talk a little bit about our U.S. commercial business.</p><p>If you can see on the slide, the blue states are where we have retail footprint. Everywhere we have retail footprint, we have commercial bankers on the ground. Looks like there's a lot of white space; there is. But it's important to note that over the last 8 years, we have filled out a lot of that white space with those blue dots. And those blue dots represent specialty groups that we have set up where we have both specialty groups as well as commercial offices.</p><p>An example of how we think about filling in this space would be Texas. For the longest time, our teams have wanted to be in Texas, for good reason. Texas has a GDP the size of all of Canada. Texas has been a migration magnet for companies all over the United States and Canada. So when we bought our Transportation Finance business, which is headquartered in Dallas, not only did we buy a very strong business, the leading financer of trucks and trailers in North America, we also acquired 400 employees in Texas. And that gave us the confidence to build a commercial banking team and a specialty business around that in Texas.</p><p>We've done that; that's up and running and it's going very well, but we're doing this over the long term. That's the important thing that we do, and as we talk about talent, and we've all talked about talent, the one thing I would say is, the most important part of our acquiring talent is getting teams that have cultures similar to what we do, have a long-term view and can express that to our clients, because they expect a long-term view from a 200-year-old bank.</p><p>A word on our specialties, on the right-hand side. 6 of those 13 specialties have significantly grown or have been -- actually been started over the last number of years. A couple of examples of those would be our dealer finance business, big business we had in Canada, auto dealer finance, floor planning. That was started from scratch in 2010 and is now a real national business for us. Another example would be our franchise finance business, a business that we did a lift-out and just headquartered in Irvine, California.</p><p>All of these businesses -- and it's important to note as you look on the right-hand side, it's a really diversified group. There is no business that has more than 10% of the overall personal and commercial loans, so it's very diversified. And lastly, I would say, these businesses together, these specialty businesses, have contributed significantly to the growth in the U.S., but it's also augmented and really accelerated a business that started out as a Midwest business but is much more of a national business as well today.</p><p>This page tells the story graphically and with numbers of our U.S. commercial business over the last 8 years. Now, we picked 8 years as a starting point because, some of you will remember, it was in 2010 that BMO signaled to the market that we thought the Great Recession was finally over. We also felt that it would be a commercially led recovery, and we thought that recovery would really start in the U.S.</p><p>So we were poised pretty well. We had a very strong balance sheet. We had a weaker competitive set, and we had the heritage of being a commercial bank from our beginning. So we bought both M&amp;I and we bought Transportation Finance in that period, and that explains the 27% growth. But underlying that is 10% growth annually, per annum, just from building the business. And that represents somewhere between 350 and 400 new commercial relationships each year, and those relationships beget more success, and that's really how we've grown over the period of time.</p><p>One of my favorite businesses within the commercial business, and it's a cornerstone of our commercial business, is our treasury and payment solutions business. If done right, this is both a sticky business and an annuity business, and it also is the business that, when we do it right, and we do, and we invest in it, it breeds some of our most loyal customers. This is a real strategy for us. You'll hear more about that later, and I'm quite sure Sharon will mention treasury and payment solutions a few times during her period.</p><p>So, the strategy in the U.S., if we get the -- okay, we've got that slide -- is really 3-pronged. And you'll hear more about -- let me just cover it quickly. Geographic expansion, Ray and Dan will probably mention that, but let me talk about 2 areas where we've had strong growth would be -- without the expansion: Wisconsin, which we acquired when we acquired our M&amp;I business. We were the #1 commercial bank at that time. We've extended that and we've grown it, and we've prospered off that. Chicago, where we have had no acquisitions. We started out as the fourth commercial bank there. We've gone to the third, we've gone to second, and there's really only one place to go from there, and I think we have a very, very good chance over the long-term of becoming the #1 bank in Chicago, which is 10 times the size of Wisconsin.</p><p>Second, our specialty businesses. You'll hear more about that in a minute, but let me cover two quick things. The asset-based lending business, a business which we have always been in, but in 2010 we were #20 in the United States in terms of ranking. We should have been substantially stronger in that, and today, we're #5. Another business that we've done quite well with is equipment finance. That was a business we acquired in 2012. At the time, it was about $400 million in assets; today, it's over $2 billion. And with the economy going as well as it is in the United States and the demand for equipment, that's a business that will continue to grow.</p><p>Third, and again, you'll hear more about this, but we continue to deepen the relationships. When you get 350 to 400 new relationships every year, you haven't totally sold them. We've done quite well, but there's huge opportunities to continue to sell our treasury businesses, continue to sell our Wealth and our Capital Markets and make for a more fulsome relationship with these companies.</p><p>So here are a couple things that you can expect over the next 3 years. Loan growth, which has been above industry over the last 3 or 4 -- over the last 5 years. We expect that to continue and to be above -- at the range of our top-tier competitors. Deposit growth will at least keep pace with our accelerated loan growth. And third, industry-leading scores in our customers. That's one of our strong points. I think that's our secret sauce. Both sides of the borders would have scores for NPS in the 70s. We know that's industry-leading, and I think that's the reason we get so many referrals from our existing customers.</p><p>So to pull it all together, Steve talked about our U.S. business and how important that is to the growth story for BMO. Ernie's very compelling story on our personal and business banking and what we've talked about in the commercial bank. Tie that into the interconnectivity with our Wealth and our Capital Markets business. I couldn't be more confident about the upside we have in the U.S. Not just because of the growth we've had today, but frankly, more because of the talent we've put together, the way that we go to the market and the long-term approach that we have in dealing with our customers.</p><p>And I think that is our success. That's how we've won, and now we'll talk about the real winners, the group that's really responsible for the North American commercial bank. As they come up, Sharon is going to lead the business. Sharon runs our -- is going to lead the discussion. Sharon runs our treasury and payment systems. Ray and Dan run our U.S. commercial business, and Christine and Nadim run our Canadian commercial business. So as they come up, thank you, and this is the team.</p><p>SHARON MARIE HAWARD-LAIRD, HEAD OF NORTH AMERICAN TREASURY AND PAYMENT SOLUTIONS, BANK OF MONTREAL: Great to see so many familiar faces from my time in IR. As Darryl said -- and it's nice not to have to organize the whole day, I must say. But in any event, we're very excited to talk. As Darryl said, our commercial banking business is a differentiating strength for BMO, and what we're going to try to do in the next 20 minutes is really just explain what we believe are the elements that differentiate that business and why we think that's not something that can be replicated by our competitors.</p><p>And because you can't do a presentation without a slide, we do have a slide, which really describes those competitive advantages. And as we have our conversation, we'll really bring out those points that have driven what we've seen above market growth, both in Canada and the U.S., over the last several years. And we'll start with that, with a discussion about where that growth has come from. And Ray, I thought maybe you could build on what Dave spoke about in terms of our geographic U.S. strategy.</p><p>RAY WHITACRE, HEAD OF DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIES, BMO HARRIS BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION: Yes, sure. So when we think about our geographic locations, we categorize them as flagship growth and high growth. And when you think about the flagship, and we've talked a bit about those, those businesses are ones where we have high market share and we have incredibly strong brand recognition. Illinois and Wisconsin are great examples of that. And in those businesses, they have grown historically faster than the local GDP, and we expect that to continue going forward.</p><p>When you think about our growth markets, those are ones that we are still building scale and where there's still lots of market potential. And there, we actually look at growing those businesses from a revenue standpoint year-over-year on a high-single-digit and low-double-digit basis. And then the high-growth markets are those where we've just started or just in the early stages of building a presence, and the growth there would be, obviously, exponential, but coming off of a smaller base.</p><p>And then when we think about starting a business in a new city, we look at making sure that it will be breakeven in the first 18 to 24 months relative to our direct expenses. We look for those businesses to be well balanced between loans and deposits, between fees and cross-selling of other non-lending product, and we look at those businesses to be a mix of sole and lead bank opportunities. Strategically, we're looking to start new offices in new cities between 1 and 2 per year through the medium-term.</p><p>DANIEL MARSZALEK, HEAD OF CORPORATE FINANCE, BMO HARRIS BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION: And then in addition to the geographies, and our go-to-market strategy is also with national specialties. As Dave Casper mentioned, a number of the specialties in the U.S. but collectively across North America commercial, we have 17 specialty businesses.</p><p>And by specialties, I mean in terms of product specialties and industry specialties. Products are asset-based lending, equipment finance, our exchange settlement business or mezzanine finance, as an example. And specialties in terms of engineering construction or food and consumer or transportation finance, dealer finance businesses.</p><p>And what we do in terms of from a growth perspective is when we take the geographies that Ray's laid out, and we're already national in terms of Canada, but as we expand in the U.S., we also layer on all the industry specialties and the product specialties. And so when we can combine all of those, what we do from a growth perspective is we have a higher win rate in terms of winning new customers. Customers really resonate when we can not only be near them and understand their needs, but when we can go really deep in an industry or really deep in a product and we know them, it resonates. And so as a result, we have higher -- a higher win rate.</p><p>An example -- Ray and I last month did a town hall for our U.S. teams, and we polled the geographic teams that Ray is responsible for. And in year-to-date, for fiscal '18, which is almost done now, 63% of the new transactions won in terms of new clients being added involved not only a geographic local presence but also one of the industry or product specialty teams. And it just shows that with the collaboration, we're able to get an exponential growth rate because we can do that in a manner that is better than our competitors.</p><p>NADIM HIRJI, MD, BMO CAPITAL PARTNERS: Actually just following up on that on the Canadian side, when we look at industry verticals for growth, we look at it in a very deliberate manner. So we need to understand the industry deeply. We need to understand, what's the market opportunity, what's the size of the pie, what are the risk return metrics that we can expect, and can we actually build scale and expertise to be meaningful and successful?</p><p>So just to give you -- give an example on the Canadian side, if you go back to 2005, we took a look at aging demographics, regulatory support, the combination of which we believed would create significant market opportunity in the future for seniors housing. We built strong relationships with centers of influence in the industry and really became a partner to the industry and an advocate within it. Today, we are now one of the largest financiers of seniors housing in Canada. And similarly, if you think about agriculture, scale, expertise and focus has led us to dominant market share in that industry segment across Canada. And today, we look at other verticals for growth, things like public sector, technology and specialized lending.</p><p>And if we look at our specialty businesses, like Dan talked about, real estate finance, auto finance are mature businesses that we're very good at and we will continue to grow. But where we really have opportunity to accelerate with velocity with new revenue streams is in businesses -- at probably 15% to 50% is in businesses like equipment finance, asset-based lending and media finance.</p><p>And just to go to what Dave was talking about earlier in his presentation, cross-border collaboration between us is critical. So asset-based lending is a very established product segment in the U.S. Still growing, but established, but much newer in Canada. And we've been able to use the expertise and the platform of our U.S. colleagues up in Canada, not just to build a platform but to actually win transactions and differentiate ourselves from the competitors. And if you think about equipment finance, it didn't even exist in Canada 2.5 years ago. As Dave mentioned, we bought that capability when we bought M&amp;I in 2012, and we've been leveraging that platform U.S. to Canada for 2.5 years. We now have about $1 billion in authorizations, and I fully expect we'll double that in the next 2.5 years.</p><p>And the collaboration goes both ways. Auto finance, we have significant scale, it's a mature business for us in Canada, and we dominate the market. And we've helped create the platform in the U.S. about 8 years ago, and we have about $3 billion now in the U.S. outstanding and growing fast.</p><p>CHRISTINE COOPER, SVP AND CO-HEAD OF CORPORATE FINANCE DIVISION, BANK OF MONTREAL: And we dominate in most of our core markets from a loan perspective, so we have a #1 or a #2 perspective market share. And in Canada, in the $25-million to $100-million space, we do have a #1 market share, but still opportunities to grow. Where we don't have a #1 market share is in deposits, so that's an opportunity for us, and we are focused on that. And we know we can grow in that and have introduced a number of things, including new deposit products and pricing strategies, adding deposit structuring capabilities, and really focusing on deposit-rich industries.</p><p>Earlier, Nadim mentioned public sector. As an example, we recognized that we did not have an appropriate share in this space, in public sector, which is hospitals, universities, municipalities. So we put a team earlier this year together, focused specifically on that space. And since we've put that team together, we have increased our deposits by 37%. And we're very confident based on this success that we can deliver over $1 billion in incremental deposits next year just from this team alone.</p><p>SHARON MARIE HAWARD-LAIRD: So thanks for raising the subject of deposits. I don't want to disappoint Dave by not putting in a plug for treasury and payment solutions. This is actually an area where we have drastically increased our investment. As Brett mentioned, we've just launched our new mobile app, which has bioauthentication capabilities. We're also rolling out some additional deposits -- BMO deposit products that really attract operational deposits, which are the highest-quality deposits you can get.</p><p>For example, we've had -- we've been kind of industry-leading in getting, in Canada, 50% of our all commercial checks are now deposited through remote deposit capture with a product we call DepositEdge. But we didn't have a strong solution for clients who had cash-rich industries and would have a lot of cash to deposit, so those clients would have to continue to go to the branch. And we're just piloting for a full rollout in January a -- what we call a Smart Safe or DepositEdge for cash, which will be on clients' premises. They get same-day credit for the cash that they deposit in there. It reduces traffic in the branch and also allows us to better service clients who are not close to a branch. So it's a win-win for the client, because they get same-day credit for their cash and don't have to send their employees to the branch, and for us because it's efficient and it does attract those deposits as well.</p><p>DANIEL MARSZALEK: But Sharon, if I could add just one more thing on deposits, too. In terms of -- Ray alluded to it, in terms of our new markets, that the goal of being the lead bank in a relationship is very important to us. Being the lead, with that, if we can capture the lead, we can capture more of the deposits. We can capture more of the treasury and payments services businesses because those are just usually correlated. And we progressively, each year, get more and more of our new customers as the lead bank. And one example for this year, in asset-based lending in the U.S., 14 of our last 17 deals, we've been the lead. And as a result, that team has seen a significant increase in terms of the treasury and payments service business, which drives a lot of revenue. So with that role, we do a much better job in terms of winning deposits.</p><p>SHARON MARIE HAWARD-LAIRD: Great. So I think we'll turn now -- Dave spoke about the strong client satisfaction and NPS scores that we've seen, and Nadim, maybe you can talk about how we're turning that client satisfaction into revenue.</p><p>NADIM HIRJI: Sure. So Net Promoter Score is how we test client loyalty, and the survey that goes out to clients asks a fair number of questions, but there's actually really one question that builds the score. And that question is how likely the customer is to recommend us to a friend or colleague. And in Canada, we've earned an industry-leading score of +77. And just to let you know, it goes from -100 to +100. And similarly high scores in the U.S. as well.</p><p>So our clients are telling us that they are loyal to us, and what they're telling us is they're loyal to us because we understand their business because we deliver on our commitments. But what's as important through these surveys is they're telling us how we can be better. And so they tell us things like, speed up on the onboarding process when we become a new customer. Increase your use of technology to simplify the customer experience.</p><p>So the loyalty is great to have. I think as we're going down the customer journey, I think Sharon, where you were going is, is how do we monetize this NPS? How do we monetize what the clients are telling us? And so what we're now focusing on is ensuring that our sales force are tooled and that they have the courage and confidence to go to these loyal customers and say, we want more share of wallet. We would like a referral to a new customer. So we're just starting to scratch the surface on this and going down this customer journey.</p><p>But the formula, if you think about it, is not that difficult. It's quite simple. We have a highly engaged workforce that delivers a great customer experience, and that great customer experience leads to the great client loyalty that we enjoy. And that client loyalty earns us the right because the customers are telling us, to get more share of wallet and ask for referrals. And if we do that, and if we do it well and tool our sales force, that will lead to improved financial performance, which makes all shareholders pretty happy.</p><p>So the formula, I think, is actually pretty simple. What's difficult is flawless execution of this. It is extremely difficult, but I think that's where we can shine.</p><p>RAY WHITACRE: Yes, 2 examples of that, Nadim, the first one in Canada, as it relates to our Transportation Finance business, they have an amazing Net Promoter Score and have traditionally been financing a company's transportation assets, especially when they were part of GE. What we've seen, and just really over the last 6 months, in this example, where we, from the commercial side, have actually won all of their -- these 2 companies, all of their operating business, as well as all of their operating lines. We actually won it from the incumbents that have been doing that business with these companies for over 20 years. And it's a great example of leveraging that great Net Promoter that we had in the transportation business to leverage the entire bank. From a numbers standpoint, it's over $100 million of new loan commitments just to those 2 companies here in Canada.</p><p>Another example in the United States as it relates to Net Promoter, we have a client of ours who has referred us into 4 new companies that were not clients of the bank, and -- just over the last 9 months. And now I'm happy to report that all 4 of those referrals are now clients of the bank, to the tune of an annualized revenue of over $2 million. To me, that's the power of a Net Promoter. That's the power of customer loyalty.</p><p>SHARON MARIE HAWARD-LAIRD: That's great. And so I think in -- Nadim, in his answer, talked about the talent playing an important role and our people playing an important role in customer loyalty. Christine, do you want to expand about talent?</p><p>CHRISTINE COOPER: Sure, absolutely. Really, to me, it comes down to our people, and we have this strong commercial presence because of the quality of the people that we have. And the reputation that we have in the market really allows us to attract top talent and high-performing individuals who want to work on a winning team.</p><p>But it's more than just attracting those individuals; we really need to retain them. And we look at lots of different ways that we'll retain them, including aligning our incentives and compensation, investing in training and development, and providing multiple career paths for people. And in many ways, our competition can do that as well, and I really think what it comes down to is what Darryl was talking about earlier, and it's our culture, and our unique culture that allows us to enjoy that really high employee engagement.</p><p>And it's not just our customers who tell us how happy they are to work here. I love when I hear it from our customers. I was having dinner a few weeks ago with one of our key customers in Vancouver who deals with all of the competition because of the size and the breadth of the operations that they have. And when I was asking him how we were doing in servicing his business and looking after him, he said, you know, BMO has the best bankers on the street. And I deal with many of the competition, but it's really not just the individuals that I have on my account, but they deal with multiple businesses, they deal with our diversified industries, our real estate finance, our auto finance. And he said it's consistently the best bankers on the street.</p><p>And while I know he can tell me that because I'm meeting with him, but it's -- the proof is in the results, because over the last 3 years, our business with this customer has grown over 50%, and that's taking share from the competition. And so, I think, in our business, customer retention is critical, but that talent retention really drives the customer retention and customer loyalty.</p><p>DANIEL MARSZALEK: But when we're in a high-growth mode, we have to keep fueling the pipeline. So our 2-pronged approach on talent is one, we want to acquire talent from the outside when we need to, such as going into new geographies when we want to get someone with a long-established local presence, so we'll go out and seek out that talent, or if we're going to go into a new industry like we did years ago in terms of franchise finance or healthcare in our specialty businesses of hospitality and healthcare, we'll go out and acquire that deep expertise.</p><p>But the other one is just, we like to promote from within. We have a phenomenal program in terms of recruiting young professional bankers and developing them, giving them challenging opportunities and growing them, because that's the full weight to take that talent and marry it with the outside to sustain the culture that we're looking to achieve.</p><p>SHARON MARIE HAWARD-LAIRD: So maybe just a couple words on efficiency, and on the lending side, we're incredibly efficient. I think we do have more opportunity on the treasury side. Luke spoke about some of the work that we're doing on robotics and onboarding, where we've really sped up the process of getting new clients onto our online banking platform. And to me, more than the reducing the time by 90%, it's that with robotics, it's actually completely scalable. So tying to what Ernie talked about, if we have good opportunity there, we could onboard an exponentially higher number of clients -- that's a throwdown to Ernie there -- exponentially higher number of clients we can onboard onto our system without adding people in that part of the process.</p><p>Another thing we're really focused on, especially after the M&amp;I acquisition, we have quite often had separate systems running in Canada and the U.S., and we've been steadily integrating those systems. We have a couple of big ones that will be fully integrated by the end of the year. And by rationalizing those platforms, you can invest more because you only have one platform and pick, really, the best of the 2 platforms that you have for moving forward. So we see lots of great opportunity there.</p><p>And so I think maybe another question we often get is what about risk management? And particularly in the U.S. with the strong growth that you've seen, how do you think about managing risk in that context of high growth?</p><p>DANIEL MARSZALEK: Yes, I mean, the first of everyone's question probably is with this kind of growth, what are we doing to get that growth and how are we going to -- what's it going to show up later on in terms of our portfolio stats? We've -- our -- first of all, in terms of the growth, our portfolio stats are relatively stable. We are not stretching on credits in terms of trying to win new clients. What we want to do is we want to compete on the basis that we've talked about already, which is our talent, our Net Promoter Scores, our industry expertise, our product expertise. So we don't like to do that in terms of competing on risk.</p><p>We avoid competing on risk. We've shown that we can win new clients by delivering a high value proposition. We show that we can retain clients by having that same value proposition. In our food and consumer business, in proteins, for example, it's a cyclical business. There's commodity inputs, commodity outputs. We understand that business through and through. And with that, clients who we talk to, they know that we know their business. They get a comfort that we know their business. And they know that we're going to stick with them through cycles.</p><p>We also, because of that deep industry expertise, we could figure out who we want to do business with in that industry as well. It's not only as much in terms of how we deal with our existing clients, but in terms of the portfolio selection, we try to overoriginate deals. We try to know everything about the industry, the suppliers, the customers and competitors, and pick the right deals, pick the right customers, such that we end up with a really high-quality portfolio. And as I said, our portfolio stats are proving that out. We do have a very strong risk culture. In fact, our best relationship managers are probably our best risk people too.</p><p>CHRISTINE COOPER: And I think it's that risk expertise, that deep risk expertise that allows us to grow without overall changing the material -- the risk profile that we have as an organization. And it's that -- it's really in our DNA over many, many years. It's built over time. You can't just come in and do this well. You have to understand that risk. You need to manage it, and then you need to mitigate it. And that allows us to grow in new areas in underpenetrated sectors without changing our risk profile.</p><p>And another important component is the foundational strength that we have in our portfolio diversification. We've talked about it this morning. We're geographically diversified across Canada and in our specialty businesses across the U.S. and regionally, and we're diversified by industry and by product. And it's that foundational strength that allows us to grow and continue to enjoy those loan -- low loan loss records.</p><p>SHARON MARIE HAWARD-LAIRD: Great. Well, the clock is not our friend, but maybe we'll just close on one last point, which is really on the point of collaboration, both cross-border and across business segments. Nadim, do you want to take that one?</p><p>NADIM HIRJI: Sure, yes. I already talked about leveraging platforms or expertise when you think about our auto finance business, equipment, leasing and other businesses.</p><p>So when you think about cross-border collaboration, an example -- without getting into client details, you look at real estate finance. A lot of Canadian large developers have gone into the U.S. and we've been able to use the U.S. real estate platform to seamlessly help them acquire assets in condo developments, hotel developments, regular commercial developments. We have auto finance dealers here in Canada, which is a significantly consolidating industry, who've built strong franchises, not looking down south to continue that strength and that build, and using a platform in the U.S., again, we're able to collaborate together and create seamless opportunities for debt financing for these clients.</p><p>And even more importantly, we each have dedicated cross-border teams. And these teams, their sole focus is to simply look at the subsidiary companies of parent companies that deal with us north and south, because we want to ensure that we have 100% of their share of wallet. And it's not one at a time. It's not different types of groups. We all act together as one bank, and it's one bank all the time. And the opportunity is significant. It's not tens of millions of dollars, it's hundreds of millions of dollars every year going back north and south every year.</p><p>So the bank that gets this right is going to have a significant advantage for the future, and we are passionate about it. And I think -- I want to be clear that although we have increased our focus on cross-border collaboration over the past few years, it's nothing new to us. We've been doing cross-border banking for 34 years and counting. So we're already a leader in it, and we intend to keep it that way.</p><p>RAY WHITACRE: Yes. We're also working closely with our Capital Markets colleagues and our Wealth partners to deliver perspective and advice, and unbiased solutions, to our clients. And if you think about a client, when they're looking at, or looking to make a strategic decision, they need an institution that's going to be able to provide market insight, be able to understand and provide insight into business valuation and to provide a comprehensive solution.</p><p>But taking all of that into consideration when thinking about the owners' personal wealth situation. And I think that unbiased comprehensive advice truly is what differentiates us and what we all provide every day to our clients. 2 quick statistics: closed referred revenue from commercial to our U.S. Wealth partners is up 53% year-over-year, and our closed referred revenue to our Capital Markets colleagues in the U.S. is up 23% year-over-year.</p><p>SHARON MARIE HAWARD-LAIRD: So that's great. So to sum up, I think when we put all of those things together, the capabilities, the risk management strength, the sector expertise, the client loyalty, the customer talent, we think putting all of those things together is actually very hard to replicate and really is what has driven this to become one of the most differentiating segments. And on that note, speaking of something that's hard to replicate, is our Capital Markets business, and I'm really excited to turn it over to my colleagues Pat and Dan.</p><p>PATRICK CRONIN, CEO, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS CORP.: Well, thank you very much, Sharon. Capital Markets has established a strong foundation that is built for growth. And what you see here on the screen today are the key attributes that are going to drive this business for years to come.</p><p>We have real franchise strength, and that strength is based on unique capabilities in all of the markets where we compete, and from that foundation, we are accelerating our growth in the United States. And all of that translates into the one key message that we'd like to leave you with today about Capital Markets. Our business delivers steady net income growth for the bank on a consistent and meaningful basis.</p><p>As you can see from this slide, Capital Markets has consistently generated a meaningful and steady contribution for the bank, at the same time with underlying net income growth and with low to moderate earnings volatility. Over the last 5-year period, net income has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 5.3%. And over that same period, the volatility of quarterly net income in BMO Capital Markets has been 17%, versus an average of 24% for our Canadian peer set. And over that same 5-year period, we have consistently generated a minimum of 20% of the bank's overall net income and a maximum of 26% over the past decade. And we expect to remain at or below 25% for the next 5 years as well.</p><p>Now, that attractive financial profile and strong foundation is, in large part, a function of the broad diversification that we have in this industry and in this business, and I'd say this business is extremely well diversified. When you look at it across every metric, look at it by industry sector, with no one industry segment in our business driving more than 25% of our revenue last year. It's diversified by client type, with strong contributions coming from both investors and issuer clients and even with strong diversification within those segments as well. It's highly diversified by product type, with deep capabilities in every single asset class. And lastly, it's diversified by geography. As you now know, a large percentage of our revenue now comes from outside of Canada. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that diversification is our greatest strength in the Capital Markets business, and it is the principal reason why we've generated a stable earnings stream across various market cycles.</p><p>Now I'd like to spend a minute talking specifically about the Canadian segment of our franchise because Dan and I believe it's extremely important for several reasons, which I'll get to in a second. BMO Capital Markets is widely recognized as a leader in Canada, and we certainly have strong market share positions in every single one of the key fee and profit pools. Now, a lot of firms say that, so we decided to put the facts on the screen to back that statement up.</p><p>But even amongst all of these proof points, I'd like to highlight a couple that Dan and I feel are really representative of that statement. We have a top-2 league table ranking in Canada in M&amp;A and equity capital markets versus our Canadian peers. And we believe that that is the most -- those are the most important indicators of depth of client relationship with our banking clients. Similarly, when you look at our investor businesses, we have strong market share across cash equities, fixed income and foreign exchange. Again, great proxies for depth of client relationship in our trading businesses as well. Our structured products business, which has long been a big growth driver for our business in Capital Markets, has won Best House in Canada according to Euromoney magazine for 6 of the past 7 years. And lastly, I think we'd all agree that high-quality content is the foundation for great client relationships, and here again, our equity research team this year ranks #1 according to Brendan Wood's.</p><p>Our Canadian business is based on deep client relationships developed over decades, and I assure you, we will fiercely protect that position with market-leading client service and capabilities.</p><p>And this, as I said at the outset, this strong Canadian franchise is so important for several reasons. Certainly it generates a meaningful financial contribution and an attractive return on equity, but equally important, it provides the foundation from which we can grow our business outside of Canada. It provides us with growth capital for expansion into new markets like the United States. Our expertise and our Canadian capabilities are readily extendible into adjacent markets like the United States. And when you combine our Canadian and our U.S. expertise, we think that makes us, in the capital markets space, one of the true -- only true cross-border banks in the entire market. And as Darryl and others have said from the outset, that is increasingly important to our clients both north and south of the border. In fact, I'd go as far as to say the success and stability of that Canadian franchise has been the enabler of the development of our U.S. business, which as I said is now not only a meaningful revenue contributor but also an engine of attractive growth for our business.</p><p>But to give you a bit more of a comprehensive view of that platform and a bit of a financial picture of our aspirations going forward, I'd like to introduce Dan. Dan is currently the co-head of our Global Investment and Corporate Banking business, but only for 1 more week, because next Wednesday he will assume the role of Group Head of BMO Capital Markets, and I couldn't be more pleased for Dan. I won't go through his bio; you can get it on the website. But suffice it to say that I've known Dan for a long time; he brings decades of client-focused experience to this role, and as one of the senior-most members of the Capital Markets executive team, and absolutely a co-architect of our strategy, he is perfectly positioned to be taking on this role. So with that, Dan, I'll turn it over to you.</p><p>DANIEL BARCLAY, CO-HEAD OF GLOBAL INVESTMENT &amp; CORPORATE BANKING, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS CORP.: Great. Well, as the new guy, I'm thrilled to be here today to talk to you. I think it's a great time for me to be taking over and guiding Capital Markets. I have the privilege of leading a dedicated and talented team with a unique, client-driven, partnership culture. Pat has left me an extraordinary legacy, Darryl before him, and I think I've got some big shoes to fill, and I'm looking forward to it.</p><p>As we think about the U.S. since 2009, we've been investing heavily in the business, and we've now established what we believe is a scalable U.S. Capital Markets platform. It contributes now materially to our net income. Over the last 5 years, U.S. revenues have grown to USD 1.3 billion, an increase of over 30%. Our U.S. employee base has grown modestly. As we've built the business, we now have over 1,000 employees in the U.S. When we think about the U.S. loan book, it has doubled over the last period without sacrificing any credit quality. Today, the U.S. franchise delivers over 38% of our total revenues. It has approximately 40% of our clients, 40% of our capital and 40% of our employees. With this investment, we believe we've now established the scalable U.S. platform. It will both deliver organic growth as well as strong operating leverage.</p><p>From a market share perspective, we continue to make progress. In investment banking, we've now broken into an overall top 15 in the U.S. league tables. In equities trading, we've taken market share every quarter over the last 3 years. Our revolving share is now up 30%. We now have a research platform in the U.S. where we cover over 200 U.S. stocks.</p><p>We're also making strides in fixed income. Our U.S. dollar SSA business is now a global top-10 business with market share tripling over the last 3 years. We've also tripled our market share in investment-grade underwriting business over the last 3 years. And in leveraged finance in the last year, we've increased our lead roles by 55%, doing over 80 transactions in fiscal '18 alone.</p><p>We believe we have reached a point of relevance to our clients and to the marketplace. We've achieved a scalable capital markets platform. And we see an opportunity to accelerate our U.S. growth.</p><p>What gives us the confidence that we can accelerate? Primarily how we see our competition position in the U.S. We believe we have an offer equivalent to all the bulge brackets in the U.S. and superior to the boutiques. We also have a series of U.S. or European competitors that have distracted, rebalancing their portfolio. There's significant opportunities for us to grab share.</p><p>We think the strength to drive this competitive advantage are 5-fold. First, strong financial capabilities. We have a strong capital position and we have a low cost of capital. Second, we have extensive product and service offerings. We have a full competitive suite in banking and in trading products. We have high-impact, insightful content in all of our research platforms. Third, we have a well-established brand and reputation both with our clients and with our regulators. Fourth, and you've heard from many today, a unique cross-border capability. That cross-border capability benefits both our Canadian clients as well as our U.S. clients as we build a business. And fifth, we have a unique high-performance partnership culture that is driven to succeed.</p><p>All of these capabilities are underpinned by a best-in-class control environment. Over the past several years we've made conscious investment decisions to invest heavily in our control environment -- AML, compliance, market risk, regulatory change, management. This leading control environment is actually a key enabler that allows us to grow our business in a scalable way. This overall suite that you see on the screen of capabilities is what gives us the confidence that we can accelerate our growth in the U.S. today.</p><p>How will we accelerate? It's very simple. We're going to deepen our relationships and do more business with more clients. We'll increase our client footprint by adding the new clients, but also increasing our product penetration with those clients. We have a focused strategy. We're not trying to be all things to all people in the U.S. When we think of that marketplace we're focused on 5 key industry sectors for the U.S. in partnership with a real strong sector we've already had for a long time in Canada, like mining.</p><p>We're focusing to achieve competitive scale in those sectors, as well as increasing client relevance. It's what we call our ecosystems. It's an alignment between our coverage teams, our product teams, our trading teams and our distribution teams. When they all have a common agenda you have higher impact and higher benefit your clients.</p><p>The U.S. sectors that we're focused on -- energy, healthcare, industrials, food consumer and real estate. We have a secondary focus on FIG, technology and business services, important verticals to us, but the high growth are in the first 5. And obviously we have a deep coverage model in financial sponsors.</p><p>We also need to expand the balance sheet, as it's critical to driving high quality relationships, both on the corporate side and on the institutional side. Lending is fundamental to allow us to achieve our objectives of increasing revenue growth, increasing market share and improving efficiency. We'll also be broadening our product capabilities. We know we can go deeper and gain market share. We'll continue to focus on equities and prime finance. Last year we successfully launched a U.S. ETF and index swap platform, as an example. In fixed income we've increased our high yield sales by 30%. And we've increased our commitment in investment grade trading substantially over the last 2 years.</p><p>There are also new product segments that we'll get into. A great example is the acquisition you heard earlier mentioned today, KGS-Alpha. It's an MBS/ABS underwriting platform, top 10 in the U.S. today. We're very excited about this acquisition. It was an area that we focused on that we see growth could come and we were underweight -- a perfect example of how we broaden and extend in the U.S. On board since September, KGS is already materially contributing to our platform in the U.S.</p><p>Over the last few years our platform has matured and our skills have deepened. We've transitioned to what we call our need-to-lead strategy. [Less] lead, more book run, up to your credit, a strategy of more of the fee wallet on every relationship and on every transaction accumulates to the lead.</p><p>We'll continue to hire strong talent. In a competitive marketplace we believe we have a very attractive value proposition. We have both a growing, competitive platform and a unique, attractive, team-oriented culture. We're seeing everywhere that we can attract talent from all the banks in the U.S.</p><p>You've heard today as we think about One Bank alignment that it's an opportunity for all of us to drive revenues. Partnership between banking and trading products. Partnership with commercial banking. Partnership with wealth. All of these are openings for us to develop new client relationships, deepen them and create opportunities for revenue for all of us. We think it's a differentiated strategy. Surprisingly, all of BMO actually likes to work together.</p><p>All of these strategies, as you can imagine, are designed around one thing, which is our client. We want to strengthen and deepen relationships, make them sticky, and they are the foundation for all success that we bring.</p><p>I take you to our takeaways. The one goal we want you to think for us today is we want to be a top 10 North American investment bank. We are on a clear path to accelerate growth in the U.S. while maintaining our strength in Canada. We'll leverage our competitive position to take share from mid- and small-size players, as well as the distracted Europeans. We're going to leverage our strong partnerships with wealth and with P&amp;C. We'll also capitalize on our position as one of the few truly North American competitive banks.</p><p>With this strong foundation we will generate and accelerate growth. We aspire over the next 5 years to double our U.S. market share; to have the U.S. business contribute between 45% and 50% of our overall revenues; to have the U.S. revenue CAGR increase to 10%; all the while targeting to have the overall capital markets efficiency stay below 60, a 500 basis point improvement from where we are today. Hopefully you see how BMO Capital Markets will capture opportunities set in front of us and why we are confident that we will deliver. Thank you.</p><p>I'll hand it over to Jill now for the break.</p><p>JILL HOMENUK: Thank you. So I think we're running in pretty good time. I'm going to ask everyone to come back at 10.20 and we'll get started again. The other thing to let everyone know is most of the team that you've seen this morning will be back up for the Q&amp;A at the end, and so we will obviously be taking questions on all of the presentations. So back at 10.20. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>JOANNA ROTENBERG, GROUP HEAD OF WEALTH MANAGEMENT, BANK OF MONTREAL: Okay, everybody, welcome back from break. I hope you got some great coffee as well as some great treats out there and good conversation as well.</p><p>And we are going to continue on here. And what we're going to be covering now is Wealth Management. And Gilles and I will both cover in turn. We're going to specifically be talking about how we are accelerating our growth trajectory in Wealth Management. What we'll do is I'll kick it off, talking about the overall total Wealth business and then I'll talk about our specific plans for Personal Wealth Management and then turn it over to Gilles who will talk about Global Asset Management in particular. So let's get started.</p><p>There are two key takeaways that I hope you take from today. One is that Wealth Management, both as an industry as well as our particular business, is an attractive business. It's got strong fundamentals. We've got momentum. And we're growing. And two is that we're taking action now to continue that momentum as well as to double our earnings in Wealth Management, much of that already within sight.</p><p>So before we go into the future too much, what I'd like to do is ground you in the present and tell you a little bit more about our starting points. And if you look at the past 5 years, we've already had a strong earnings growth trajectory, with double-digit earnings growth as well as improved efficiency, to the tune of over 500 basis points over the past 5 years.</p><p>We've also seen great fundamentals and strong CAGR, whether it's deposits, whether it's assets or whether it's loans, so strong trajectory and good momentum. I'm pleased to say that this momentum has also been backed by strong fundamentals. And if you look at the business in terms of its composition, we have over 60% of our business is fee-based. It's like an annuity to us. And we have strong stickiness as well, backed by our loyalty from our customers. So it's a strong business, strong momentum, and strong fundamentals.</p><p>Underpinning this momentum is our diversity of businesses and diversity of markets. We believe that this diversity, both in terms of the markets that we're leading in as well as the businesses that we're participating in really helps us in two ways. One is it obviously minimizes our correlation risk. But it also lets us keep our anchor businesses and access global growth markets. So we've got the anchors where we've already got momentum and we're reaching for areas where we can continue to grow in keeping with global industry trends.</p><p>Not only that, but we are leading in market positions where we're competing and we're very proud of where we stand today. Just a couple of examples. Today in our private bank in Canada we've got the leading AUM in the space. We're #2 in terms of our ETF share, which you recognize obviously is a very important part of our space in asset management. And we've also got strong full service brokerage revenues and asset participation.</p><p>The good news about all of that is we are also building this business and getting this momentum by doing what's right with our clients. And we're being recognized with that, both with our net promoter scores, which I'll talk about in a moment, but also externally recognized with a number of awards. And one in particular, I'd like to highlight that we're particularly proud of right now is we just received a few weeks ago recognition that InvestorLine, our self-directed business, was awarded with the #1 position by J. D. Power in terms of investor satisfaction. So we're #1 there and we're continuing with that momentum.</p><p>Some of my colleagues earlier also mentioned that we are nothing without our people, and in Wealth Management we fundamentally believe that. We are a people-driven engine. We've got strong talent and we've got high employee engagement. Our people feel engaged no matter whether they're in front of their clients or in more supportive functions. So we've got strong position, strong client relationships and loyalty, and strong people underpinning all of that growth.</p><p>The part of our culture that I want to touch on is also our client-focused innovation. And this is a key to our success and very much a part of our DNA. We've got a DNA that anticipates client needs and really sees around corners in terms of thinking about trends, thinking about how that will impact our clients, whether retail or institutional, and really being first to market with innovative solutions that will make a difference for our clients, their needs and where they're going.</p><p>A couple of examples here. One is in ETFs, which Gilles will touch on as well. We recognize the growth potential in the market and the client need and we took an early leadership position then, many years ago now. We now have the dominant share in the space in Canada and we have leading inflows 5 years straight. So a great example of seeing around corners, making sure we're first to market and continuing to participate in a growing trend.</p><p>And we're doing the same now with digital. We were early into the market there, recognizing the importance of the digital advice space. And we built adviceDirect, which is very much our hybrid advice product to the market. We followed that up with SmartFolio, which recognized the opportunity and the client need to access digital advice wherever and whenever they wanted it, but do it in a way that gives them the benefits of professional money management as well. So it really is the best of both worlds for our investing clients. We believe digital advice continues to be a growth space and we are well positioned in this growing space.</p><p>So that's a little bit about our starting point, which hopefully gives you a picture of our momentum. We've got strong foundation and strong momentum. But we're not stopping there. And what I'd like to talk about now is how we're going to be doubling our earnings over the next 5 years. If you look at our track record, we've doubled our earnings over the last 5 years as well, and our ambition now is to double it again over the next 5. And we'll be doing this as well with profitable growth, while continuing to manage down our efficiency ratio through a combination of initiatives that help us to drive revenue growth, make us effective capital allocators, as well as delivering on expense management platforms, many of which we've talked about before as well as other participation choices.</p><p>Now I'm going to shift gears and talk specifically about how we're going to be delivering this doubling of earnings, just for Personal Wealth Management. And then Gilles will talk about Global Asset Management.</p><p>I want to start off by talking very much about our value proposition, because everything we do, whether it's product development, whether it's how our teams interface with clients, or whether it's our risk management, is really rooted in our value proposition. And that is about making a meaningful difference in the lives of our clients by working together to help them grow, protect and transition their wealth and do that with confidence.</p><p>And that is where we start. There are 5 priorities in particular that underpin our growth strategy and I'll touch on each of them in turn through this presentation. And they are differentiating with top growth segments, building one team to bring the best of BMO to our clients, making it easy for our clients and or teams, accelerating the growth of our U.S. wealth business and growing responsibly by managing our efficiency and risk.</p><p>So our first priority is to differentiate by focusing on our top priority client growth segments. And then we'll focus specifically on client segments where we've got strong money in motion because we know money in motion really drives our business growth, but also in areas where we have a natural competitive advantage.</p><p>And I use 2 examples today. One example I believe you've heard throughout today's morning and presentation is on business owners. And hopefully you get the strength and underpinning of this growth segment. We have the leading North American commercial franchise, so we are well positioned. But I would also comment about the fact that over 5 million clients, business owner clients, are going to be transitioning out of their business, likely through an exit. And we're here to help there as well by using our leading commercial franchise and together with them building a world-class partnership. And I'll get on to more of this in a minute.</p><p>Ultra high net worth is another area where we're growing. This is a growth area. It already represents 1/3 of global assets in the marketplace. It's fast growing when you look at its asset growth relative to other segments. It's naturally got a high touch. And we do believe it's a more disruption-proof area, given the natural complexity of the client segment's needs. We've got a leading private bank and we've got strengths in brokerage as well as capital markets, as you heard before. And together we'll be building our platform, already a differentiated platform, to serve this important growth segment.</p><p>Our second priority and a thread you heard from today about One Team is building One Team to win with clients. And here we already have a strong track record working together both across businesses as well as across borders. A couple of examples there. Last year alone we already referred CAD 20 billion in referred and closed opportunities between our Wealth Management business and our Canadian personal and business banking business. And you'll hear from Cam in a moment. Almost 2/3 of our Nesbitt Burns branches already have dedicated bankers focused on those clients' needs. And we see significant growth in our cross-border platform. And as we look ahead, we're taking that collaboration strength that we already have and turning it into a deep competitive advantage.</p><p>We have a priority to build out collaboration as a real source of differentiation for our clients and in the industry. For example, commercial. You already heard again about a strength of our franchise; we have over 400,000 North American commercial clients. Yet only 10% of them or less today have a wealth relationship as well. So we see great opportunity here. We believe it's nearly CAD 100 million in earnings opportunity to be able to serve these clients together in a world-class partnership. So picture integrated teams, many collocated, building out deep specialization for segments that need it, as we do today already with our commercial segments, and working on relationship pricing as well to benefit the full client relationship. We also see a great opportunity to help our clients in many high net worth households that already have strong relationships in other parts of BMO.</p><p>Let me touch on our third priority, and Brett and others already referred to this, which is making it easy through continued technology investment to help both our clients as well as our professional teams win through digital. And this is already a critical part of our agenda. I'll give you a couple of examples of what's already underway and some more to come.</p><p>And let me start with onboarding, investment onboarding. It's our first impression. Many times you have a competitive situation and you've just won a client over. They've decided to come to BMO. A few years ago that first impression if they walked into one of our businesses was a stack of paper that they had to sign. We've invested to make sure that experience feels completely different and now today our onboarding experience is digital and it's modern and it's easy for our clients. Our forms are down by 90% or more. Our accounts are now funded 4 days faster, and over 50% of clients are signing up through e-signature. So it's what we call win/win. It's a win on the client experience. It's a win in terms of lowering our cost to serve. It's a win because our clients are spending more times with our teams. Our teams are spending more times with our clients, and less time on administration. And it's a win in terms of lowering our operating risk profile. So that gives you an example of what we already have today.</p><p>And now I'll talk about our next act, which we're very excited about. We're continuing to build out our differentiation using digital as a tool either directly to clients or helping our advisory teams to win with clients. One example of that is our launch of WealthPath. WealthPath is a digital goal-planning tool used on iPad, and we've built it in partnership with Voyant, which is just an exceptional client start-up, a technology start-up based in the U.S. This is a goal-based planning tool. It is collaborative. It's modern. It's dynamic. And it's going to make, most importantly, a meaningful difference in the lives of our clients as they make different decisions, and you can work in real time to help them shape those. So don't forget for those of you here, make sure you go see it demonstrated. You'll see it out in the tech showcase in an hour.</p><p>The fourth and final priority I'll talk about today is how we're going to be accelerating our growth and our momentum in our U.S. wealth franchise. And we already have a strong foundation in U.S. wealth today. We've built an exceptional leadership team and strong disciplines in each area that we participate in, strong talent backing that and a deep bench across our markets. We've also chosen to exit noncore businesses and noncore markets where we didn't believe we had a participation advantage. Through these choices and these changes we've seen strong growth in earnings as well as efficiency, as well as great gains in client loyalty, where we're up in the high 50s now on net promoter score, which we believe is close or industry leading.</p><p>Our intent now is to more than double our earnings growth in the next 5 years. But we're going to do this in many ways, including market expansion; deepening our relationships with partners already, and you heard Dave and others refer to that before; deepening our digital optionality and really building that optionality into our business model; as well as growing out our banking capability, which is already a source of growth for us.</p><p>I'm going to stop there and now turn it over to Gilles, who will talk specifically about our growth plans in Global Asset Management.</p><p>GILLES GERARD OUELLETTE, GROUP HEAD OF ASSET MANAGEMENT &amp; VICE-CHAIR OF INTERNATIONAL, BANK OF MONTREAL: Great. Thanks, Joanna.</p><p>Let me give you a little bit of background. We've had a great last 5 years in the Asset Management business. From 2012 through 2017 we tripled the size of this business to where we're currently running about CAD 325 billion. Now we had the benefits of some acquisitions, but if you strip out the acquisitions and the divestitures, because we did divest ourselves of some noncore businesses, our organic growth was 20% a year, or our organic net income growth was 20% a year. And during that period we merged what was a number of boutiques into one Global Asset Management business with one management team. So we've had great success in the past 5 years and I think that's what gives us confidence that we can reach our targets for this year -- for the next 5 years, which is growing our business to CAD 525 billion and double our net income.</p><p>So let me just explain how this business operates. BMO GAM operates as one global business, so we're structured globally across products, investments, distribution. And we're developing global operations and technology. So our manufacturing is concentrated in 4 hubs from which we distribute globally. So in London -- now London is a center of excellence for equities and fixed income. In Toronto, we focus on ETFs. In Chicago, it's our discipline equities, multi-asset, and alternatives, and in Hong Kong it's on Asian equities. Our distribution is through 20 offices around the world and we have clients in 30 countries. And we're continuing to grow this distribution, to get benefits of scale.</p><p>You can see in the pie charts here that we have a well-diversified mix of clients across Canada, the U.S. and various countries in EMEA, which includes the U.K., Germany, Netherlands and a few others. And then we have a meaningful presence in Asia through our investment in Fullgoal. Now you can see here that 19% of our assets are in the U.S., but the U.S. markets represents 50% of the global $100 trillion asset pool. And so clearly in the U.S., we're undersize. We've spent -- we've refocused our business there and we're now starting to see some strong results. So we expect this will be driving significant growth as we go forward.</p><p>In the middle, you can see that we have a healthy mix of assets across our bank-owned retail channels, intermediary advisors and institutionals.</p><p>And then on the right, if you look at the diversification of our asset base you can see that kind of reflects the depth and skill of our money management. We have 14% of our assets in passives, so we're able to serve all of our clients, from low-cost passive to high-return office strategies.</p><p>So when we meet clients we lead with an attractive global product offering. That just says we don't meet our clients, our Canadian clients, and talk about Canadian equities. We introduce global products. And so some of the examples of some of the award-winning products that we have is the liability-driven investments; ESG -- we've been in this space since the mid '80s, one of the first businesses -- significant businesses to start this; and now ETFs, as Joanna mentioned. But there are many more. So we're involved with -- we offer generating fundamental equities, quant-based capabilities. We've got emerging market equities, core and specialty fixed income, multi-asset, real estate, private debt and then just to name a few. So distributing our global products to clients worldwide is a differentiator. It's going to continue to enable us to go on this high-growth trajectory.</p><p>Another key differentiator is our investment excellence. So we bring global investment expertise to our clients through 11 consultant-credible specializations. And importantly, as you can see on the right, that our investment performance is consistently outstanding, with 80% of our funds meeting or beating the 5-year benchmark this year. So our global investment expertise, our consistently strong performance, is going to continue to be the cornerstone of our competitive position.</p><p>Just to summarize, our business is growing through a combination of distributing leading global products to our clients around the world and delivering investment excellence with consultant-credible capabilities. And this is all enabled on a global structure and platform. This has enabled us to double our business from fiscal '12 through '17. And we're continuing to grow. In this past year, in 2018, we grew our net new assets year over year by 100%. And it's the success of this strategy which gives us confidence that we can grow our assets to CAD 525 billion in 5 years and to double our net income.</p><p>So in closing, there's a couple of messages Joanna and I would like you to take away today, that at BMO wealth is a high-growth business. It has high ROE and it has great momentum. We have bold ambition to double our earnings over the next 5 years and we see this as being very achievable. And we have a strong track record, a clear strategy that gives us confidence that we can deliver.</p><p>So thank you. With that, I'll pass to Cam and Andrew.</p><p>CAMERON FOWLER, PRESIDENT OF NORTH AMERICAN PERSONAL &amp; BUSINESS BANKING, BANK OF MONTREAL: Thank you, Gilles and Joanna. A less confident leader might feel concerned about being the last group on the list. I made a gentle inquiry into our IR group and they said, \"Oh, no, no, no.\" Their job, by the way, is to work on messages, as you all know. The message back was, \"No, you're not last. You're the anchor.\" And I'm taking the best interpretation of that term \"anchor.\" I've been called worse and maybe you have as well. I'm here with my co-anchor, Andrew, who leads our Customer Solutions group.</p><p>I'm going to spend a minute on the business overall and I'll touch on the Commercial business and Andrew will talk about Commercial. Point of clarification. Earlier you heard from the Commercial panel up here, who did a terrific job. They're talking about the upper end of our Commercial business. Andrew and I will focus on small business and on the mid market.</p><p>So the anchor of the flagship business has a few things to deliver here, just a few points on this one. This is a large group and it is a profitable group and drives a significant component of our bank's performance, 43% of our net income. And it's a 30% ROE business. It's also a business that drives meaningful one-bank growth. 80% of our wealth customers were originated by a Personal and Commercial bank, a stat that we're very proud of. And it's also a business that's been delivering strong financial performance. We've had positive operating leverage in 10 of the last 11 quarters. So lots to be excited about here.</p><p>The focus for us now is acceleration. You've heard that theme throughout the day and we're no different. We are focused on acceleration. We've built a platform in this business that prepares us to win, and that is our intention. We've invested heavily in the business in the last little while. We've taken out CAD 150 million in structural cost over the last 3 years, which has enabled us to both invest in this new platform at the same time as we improve our efficiency ratio.</p><p>We have a few really specific ambitions for the business and they are as follows. #1, we do expect to deliver top-tier earnings growth; #2, market-leading efficiency gains; #3, the one that I'm perhaps most excited about, is 1 million new customers in our personal business; and #4, continued double-digit NIAC growth in the Commercial bank.</p><p>We have a clear path to deliver on the strategy I've just laid out. I'll cover the Personal ones, Andrew the Commercial ones. But they are consistent. There are 3 of them primarily. The first one starts with capacity growth. And this is 2 parts, aggressive hiring in key roles, #1; and #2, pretty significant improvements in productivity through our digital agenda.</p><p>The second is disciplined execution against our highest-value opportunities by product and by market and by segment. And then finally, you've heard throughout the day, and I do hope it sounds repetitive between Brett and myself and Ernie, we've made great gains on our digital and data agenda. And that is fuel for growth in the Personal and Commercial business.</p><p>A couple of thoughts on the Personal business off the top from me. We run our retail franchise on a North American basis. And you will have picked that up from themes from Ernie. We do this across brand and marketing. We do it in digital and technology. We do it in the way we think about our branches, our formats, our sales model, everything therein. When you put them together, we are a large retail franchise, 1,500 branches north and south, over 20,000 employees, and more than CAD 750 million in technology investment to work with for the combined entity, so powerful.</p><p>In Canada alone more than 7 million customers. We are the #1 issuer of Mastercard, the #1 issuer of AIR MILES. We are the bank of the defense community. We are the sponsor of TFC and the Montreal Impact. So fantastic, fantastic assets to work with and we're very really proud of them all.</p><p>I would just drill home the point around distinctive capabilities and specifically what it's going to take to win in the market right now. We see the customer-led shift to digital to be a positive one for customers and we see it to be a positive one for BMO. We know the digitally active customers are more valuable. They stay with us longer. They do more and they are generally happier. And so for these reasons we've been investing at the enterprise and at the group level on some key capabilities. I want to just emphasize a couple of them.</p><p>Digital and partnerships is core for the Canadian bank. It's core. We spent a great deal of time working on it in the last few years. The architecture that Steve laid out has helped us get to market-leading position in digital sales. It's helped us to get to #1 app in the App Store with a rating of 4.7 as of this morning, which we're really pleased with. And it's put us in a position to do meaningful, value-based partnerships with partners across big tech, thin tech, consortia, et cetera, which you've heard about earlier. And I think the fuel of the whole thing is the data and analytics engine that we have, which with the machine-learning capabilities built in is really fueling our growth.</p><p>So looking ahead, the personal ambition is clear. It's bold. We're confident. It is about getting 1 million new customers into the franchise. We're confident in the number for one reason primarily, and that is our primary customer growth over the last couple of years has been double digit. It's working. The formula we have we are pleased with. I would add just one point to that, which is when you have a customer focus, and in particular a primary customer focus as we do, you make participation choices at the margin. And we've done that. You've seen it in our decision around third party. You've seen it in broker. You've seen it in auto. There are times where we choose not to participate as deeply. You mustn't confuse those decisions with our commitment to grow the Personal franchise, both in terms of market share and customer base. We are here to grow this business.</p><p>Key to the growth for us is capacity gains. We think about it in 2 ways. The first is really bold hiring in 2 roles in particular, our financial planners, #1, and #2, our mortgage specialists. And we'd like to move these forces up significantly, 20% to 30% gains in both of those over the next period of time. So that's the hiring part.</p><p>We get a great deal of capacity from our digital work. And Steve and others have laid down what we've done over the last few years, putting in place architecture that supports workflow, imaging, e-signature, et cetera. This enables us to create a great deal of capacity. In the Canadian business we've removed more than 10 million pieces of paper, 3 million signatures and 500,000 hours of work capacity just in the last few years. That to us is the equivalent of 250 customer-facing roles. So we're starting to feel real gains from these capabilities.</p><p>Beyond the hiring and the creating space there is the digital capability that has been talked about that is customer facing that drives our results. We are a leader, as has been pointed out in the Canadian industry, and we will be very soon in the U.S. with our capability. Getting from 8, 9, 10, 11, 12% to 25% of our total sales in digital has been what we've achieved over the last 3 years. To double that number again, as we expect to do over 3, we'll shift our focus away from our strengths now, which are checking, savings, cards, into lending. And that will be the single biggest driver of the growth in the next period of time.</p><p>Two bits that are important here that we're really pleased about and you'll be able to see representations of them later today. #1 is the mortgage approval, preapproval capability. Using the architecture that the other groups talked about, we connect by API to external providers. That does 2 things. Immediate preapproval, because we're allowed to do credit, et cetera, and also a streamlining of the workflow. And our research says this preapproval is the single most important thing to accelerating buying decisions, #1. #2, unsecured lending. We're super excited about what we'll be rolling out in 2019. This will be minutes to approval, hours to funding for unsecured lending via the mobile app. We'll be first to market with it in Canada and we're very, very excited about it.</p><p>Moving on, just a couple of final points I'd like to make here. I do think that Brett raised the point about the Gartner recognition. That's really important to us because to me that is the living manifestation of the caliber of the teams we have and the way in which we've changed work practices. And there's plenty more fuel to gain from that.</p><p>Where we're pointing our energy from a customer perspective. We're positioned to serve all Canadian customers well. It's driving our customer growth now. But there's 2 that are newer for us that I'd just like to amplify today. We are the bank of the military, as I pointed out before. Our Canadian forces are 1 million strong, including their families. We have strong penetration of the base already. And you'll be hearing from us in 2019 for an acceleration of the agenda we have with the military. It is a wonderful, highly attractive captive group, and we have some terrific offers that will accelerate our customer growth through them.</p><p>The second opportunity we're very focused on is bank at work. This is where we focus on providing banking services to corporate customers. With such a powerful commercial franchise as we have, we're in a natural position here. We're starting with some of our largest customers. And we have great strength in serving this segment in the U.S. We have emerging strength serving it here. And we think this will be a big driver for us.</p><p>A final point on marketing. We've increased our marketing spend in the Canadian market significantly and we'll do so by doubling it over the next 5 years again. What I think is more interesting about the way we go about marketing is that we spend nearly 60% of our marketing dollars in digital. That's far higher than the industry average. And we're really very good at this. Our success in targeting our digital marketing has led to a decrease in CPA, cost per acquisition, of 35% in our core areas around checking and cards over the last 2 or 3 years. And that just gives us more fuel to reinvest in the overall marketing and in specifically the digital aspects of that.</p><p>Luke referenced the data. The data drives everything that we've talked about. This has been a long journey and it's one that we're really proud of. Just want to amplify a couple of things here. We have moved from partial view of customer to full view of customer, plus the ability to bring in third party. We have moved from branch-only ability to provide leads to leads across all channels that are real time in the minute. That is a big step forward to us. And we have moved from rather static offers 5 years ago to more dynamic real-time offers with the support of machine learning, which has been a real plus for us. Just these alone, just these evolutions alone in the past year has led to 750,000 leads being presented to our teams and to our customer and is a terrific driver of our revenue. And we expect that capability to double over the next 3 years.</p><p>I'll close, before I turn it to Andrew, with just a recap that says we're really very excited about the Personal business. The strategy is clear. The ambition, over 1 million customers, is one that we have a great deal of confidence in. The foundational assets are in place and they're terrific. What you should take from this more, though, is that we have momentum in the business and the capabilities that will drive us most around data and digital are mature and we're very, very proud of them.</p><p>With that, I'll pass it over to Andrew.</p><p>ANDREW IRVINE: Thank you, Cam. I must say, co-anchor is quite possibly the nicest thing you've said to me all year. I can't wait to share at the dinner table the conversation with my wife.</p><p>Look, I'm excited to talk to you today about the capabilities that we've built in our Commercial business, building on the strategically advantaged foundation that we have. We have the second largest market share in the 0 to CAD 25 million loan segment nationwide, with deep sector strength in areas like agriculture and indigenous banking. We have also been recognized as the best commercial bank in Canada for 4 years in a row by World Finance magazine, highlighting both our digital progress, as well as the quality of our bankers. And we have seen very strong growth in loans and deposits over time, with the best momentum of the Big 5 in the last 2 quarters. I would highlight our focus on deposits, where we have taken 68 basis points of share so far this year. And yet, despite our strengths, we continue to have clear areas of opportunity for future growth, which I will talk to momentarily.</p><p>As Cam said, our plan is to achieve double-digit growth in our Commercial business over the next 5 years. And our areas of focus to achieve that goal are crystal clear. First, we will create significant sales force capacity through both aggressive hiring and enabling greater individual productivity through process improvement, through data and analytics and through digital tools. Second, we will focus on opportunity areas in specific verticals, in geographic markets and in client segments where we can take share through disciplined execution. And both of these levers will be fueled by distinctive enablers we've built to drive our digital transformation.</p><p>Let me now dive deeper into our sales force expansion strategies. As is the case with our Personal business, we're now shifting to invest significantly to increase our sales force capacity by 50%. About half of this increase will come from hiring. Specifically, we will be adding 125 relationship managers throughout fiscal '19, and are focusing these RMs on our highest-opportunity areas right here in the greater Toronto area, in our verticals where we are hiring industry specialists, as well as in our small banking segment.</p><p>The other half of the increase will come from capacity creation through the transformation of our platform to allow our sales force to spend more time with our clients. Here we are modernizing our core systems to improve speed to market. We are automating routine work with robotics and AI. We're using data analytics to improve portfolio monitoring, allowing RMs to spend 50% less time on risk review and, importantly therefore, spend more time with our clients.</p><p>We plan on and are seeing disciplined execution against our focus areas on diversification into high-growth sectors such as healthcare, services and technology. We're doing that by having teams specifically focused on an individual sector where they can foster deep relationships and understand the complexity of the specific vertical. We're developing tailored products focused on these key sectors, and we're improving our capabilities in credit structuring and in pricing so that we can be highly market relevant.</p><p>And we're seeing results. In health care our share year to date is up 5 basis points. In services and technology our share is up 134 basis points. We are particularly excited by our Technology and Innovation group, where pipelines are the strongest we have ever seen.</p><p>And we're focused on geographic markets where we see growth potential and where our current share is below that that we see nationally, mainly Alberta and the Greater Toronto area. In Alberta, we see high potential given strong projected [D-to-P] growth and a reemergence of business confidence. We've remain committed to the market through the energy cycle and we're already seeing this pay off with loan share up 83 basis points year to date.</p><p>The GTD is also a major focus for us. Here in Toronto we're aggressively adding to our sales force and are adding 50 relationship managers over the course of 2018 and 2019. We're doing that to bridge the gap from #5 market share in this market to #2 that we have nationally. And we're making great progress. Year to date our deposit share in Toronto is up 87 basis points, and above our natural share growth rates.</p><p>And finally, we're excited about our prospects in small business, where I am very confident that the improvements we have made to our platform will allow us to lead in this segment. We have created dedicated leadership for the segment and are better aligning our RM portfolios to ensure we have more focused coverage on small business clients. We recently deployed a world-class digital lending platform called Business Express, where we can both write and approve a small-business loan in under 20 minutes. We'll be demoing this capability later this afternoon.</p><p>And as you heard from Brett this morning, we recently announced a partnership with Intuit Canada to allow BMO's Canadian small-business clients who use Inuit QuickBooks online to share their financial data between our 2 companies easily and securely.</p><p>Finally, we have completely refreshed our small business card suite, which has led to 40% year-over-year client growth, and we've seen good momentum in our e-business deposit plan, which we only launched in 2017 and now has over $500 million on deposit.</p><p>Our commercial business prospects are bright. We're confident in our plan to achieve double-digit growth in our commercial business. To recap, we have a leading franchise with clear opportunities to diversify our growth and great traction in the sectors, in the geographic markets and the client segments we're focused on. And we have strong momentum in F'18, with further potential to accelerate as we add 50% to our sales force capacity over the next 3 years.</p><p>In closing, Cam and I would like to leave you with the following. Across both of our P&amp;C businesses, we have a strong foundation that is built for purpose, we have a clear strategy, and we have great confidence that through disciplined execution, we will deliver on our bold goals. Top tier net income growth in P&amp;C, market-leading efficiency improvement, double-digit NIAT growth in commercial banking, and achieve 1 million net new customers in the personal bank.</p><p>Thank you for your time, and I'd now like to turn it over to Tom.</p><p>THOMAS E. FLYNN, CFO, BANK OF MONTREAL: All right. Thank you very much, Andrew. If Cam and Andrew were the anchor presentation, I'm not quite sure what that makes me, but I am happy to say that I will be the last presentation before we move to Q&amp;A, and my job really is to bring things together from a financial perspective and to reiterate some of the key themes that you've heard this morning.</p><p>On the key themes, we do think the foundation of the bank is strong. We think we've got real differentiating strengths that will drive our performance. We're looking to accelerate as a company, and our posture is one of leaning in. And we're united as a team under a consistent strategy.</p><p>I'd like to start with a few quick historical financials. Since 2010, our EPS CAGR has been 8%. More recently, from 2015 to 2017, the EPS CAGR is also 8%, and our revenue CAGR is 7%. For the year-to-date, EPS is up 7%, and excluding a gain we had in Q1 of last year, EPS would be up 11%. Operating leverage of 0.7, and also excluding the gain, it would be up 1.6%. And ROE is solid at 14.6%.</p><p>So when we look at that performance, we think it demonstrates good, consistent performance through time and nice growth. And we're happy to say that that performance has been recognized for our shareholders in the share price, which relative to our Canadian peers, is above average over the last 1, 3, 5 and 10 years.</p><p>I'd like to talk now about the diversification in our business. You've heard a bit about this through time, but we do think it's a real source of strength for the company, and there are some critical benefits to it that we'd like to spend a few minutes on. And it might be a somewhat underappreciated aspect of our story.</p><p>From a mix perspective, Canadian personal and commercial banking represents about 40% of the total, and then each of U.S. P&amp;C wealth and capital markets represent around 20%, with U.S. personal and commercial being the largest of the 3. Geographically, Canada represents about 65% of the total and the U.S. 28%. And as we've talked about, we expect that 28% to grow to a third organically over 5 years.</p><p>Within the U.S., U.S. personal and commercial banking is the biggest group, but we do expect strong growth from both wealth and capital markets, as you've heard about this morning.</p><p>There are 3 key benefits to the diversification that I want to spend a minute on. #1, our diversification provides us with a stable and resilient income stream over time. #2, we think we have more options for growth by virtue of the diversification. We're in more markets, we deal with more customers, and with that, we've got more opportunity to grow our business. And thirdly, we think we have a particularly attractive mix for the opportunities that exist in the world today.</p><p>We're overweight the U.S., and we expect better U.S. growth than Canadian growth. We're overweight commercial banking, and we think given consumer leverage in North America, commercial banking will have better growth. We have a strong and growing wealth business that we expect to do well, and the overall business is underpinned by our Canadian business, which has very strong core profitability.</p><p>This slide takes a look at the diversification 1 level deeper. It shows our line of business revenue within each of our groups. It's meant to just graphically illustrate that the diversification runs deep. It doesn't exist just geographically or at the group level. It goes much deeper. And the underlying drivers of our revenue within the businesses differ as well.</p><p>In our deposit revenue business, we have a sensitivity, as you know, to interest rates. Some of the sensitivity comes through shorter rates and some through longer rates. And we do see a real tailwind for our business from a revenue perspective with higher rates, which is what we expect going forward.</p><p>The graph on the right shows our revenue growth and income growth volatility through time, and it just illustrates the benefit related to stability that flows from diversification. You can see that the volatility of the growth rate for the total bank on both revenue and income is lower than each of the parts, and we would expect that to continue given the diversification. So, again, 3 key benefits -- more stability, more resilience, more opportunities for growth because we're in more markets, and a specifically attractive mix given our lineup of businesses.</p><p>Now, Darryl in his comments mentioned that we have a strength in risk management. We do view this as 1 of the defining characteristics of the bank. This slide shows our long-term credit track record compared to the Canadian peers, and over the roughly 30 years on the slide that we show, you see that our losses have a lower rate than the Canadian peers. We average a loss rate of about 40 basis points. The Canadian peers are at about 53. That is a meaningful difference over time, and we think it reflects the strength of our ability to manage risk.</p><p>This slide looks at how our business might play out under different scenarios. As you know, we're in a benign credit environment. Credit losses are running below the historical average. And so if credit losses were to roughly double from 20 basis points to 40 basis points, that would impact income by about 10%, so a significant increase in credit losses, a double gives rise to, I'll say, only a 10% change in income given the extent of the change.</p><p>Secondly, we have very strong pre-tax, pre-provision income. In 2017, this was $7.7 billion. Year-to-date, $6.1 billion. At that level of pre-tax, pre-provision income, we could absorb credit losses above 220 basis points. That's higher than at any point over the last 30 years, and it's more than 5 times the average of that period of time. There's an expression in risk management that the best defense against loss is strong profitability, and we do think this slide shows that we've got lots of that.</p><p>I'd like to spend a minute on efficiency. We've talked about this through time. You've heard about it through the day today. We have improved the efficiency ratio. It's down by 340 basis points since 2015. That improvement reflects a lot of good operating discipline across the company, it reflects executing on initiatives, and we do think it reflects also a stronger culture around efficiency that has resulted from a real focus on it over time.</p><p>And then lastly, we've taken steps to manage the portfolio, and over the last 3 years, we've sold or downsized 6 or 7 businesses because we didn't see a clear enough path to improved performance with the business being a part of our group. And we've improved efficiency, as we've talked about while investing meaningfully in technology.</p><p>The midterm target that we use to talk about efficiency is operating leverage. Our target is 2%, as you know. We've achieved that target over each of the last 2 years. We won't necessarily achieve it in every year. There are environmental factors that can impact that. But we are focused on achieving it looking forward, and with 2% operating leverage over the next 3 years, we would expect the efficiency ratio to be 58% or better in 3 years' time.</p><p>On the capital side, we're in a strong position. We have a CET1 ratio of 11.4%. With that, close to $2 billion of excess capital, which makes us well positioned to take advantage of strategic opportunities. Over the last 3 years, we've managed our capital carefully, we've grown the capital ratio, we've invested in the business, and we've returned over $8 billion to our shareholders, which is 56% of our earnings. That's come through dividends and through share buybacks.</p><p>Looking forward, we would expect the dividend to grow over time as earnings grow and consistent with our 40% to 50% payout ratio. And when the capital ratio is at the upper end of a band, you can expect us to be active with the share buyback, which we have been through time. And over the last year and a half, we've bought back about 2% of our outstanding stock.</p><p>Our balance sheet strength extends to liquidity and funding. We have a strong customer base that underpins our balance sheet on the deposit side. Our deposit growth has been good, averaging 6% per year over each of the last 3 years, and that provides funding for our loan portfolio and it reduces our wholesale funding.</p><p>Wholesale funding is well diversified across markets, structures, currencies and instruments, and we don't expect any significant change in our approach to wholesale funding with the introduction of bail-in funding -- or bail-in debt, and we expect to meet the 23% TLAC ratio that will come into effect in November of 2021.</p><p>This slide shows our midterm financial targets. We're not changing the targets for the next year. We're recommitting to working on achieving those targets going forward, and the fact that we're not changing them reflects the belief that the targets have served us well over the last couple of years and will do so looking forward as well.</p><p>And then just to conclude, I want to reiterate some of the key messages. We do think the foundation of the bank is very strong. It's strong in a number of ways. Some of them are shown on the slide. We believe we have real differentiating strengths that will drive our performance going forward.</p><p>As a company, we're looking to accelerate for growth and performance. There's a lot of energy in the company, and we hope that you've seen some of that today. And we're united as 1 bank and 1 team around a common, consistent strategy.</p><p>And with that, I would like to thank everyone for your engagement through the presentation part of the agenda so far. I'll invite Darryl and some of our colleagues up to the front for the Q&amp;A. And for those of you who are listening on the webcast, I would invite you to submit questions, if you'd like, through the portal that's available. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: We are ready to rock. We are on time almost to the second right now. We have about 40 minutes allocated for Q&amp;A. We do run a tight ship around here on the clock, so we will end at noon sharp if we are still going with questions, but that leaves us lots of time for a dialogue here. And if you don't need all of that time, that's fine too. So we're in your hands for the next 40 minutes or so in the room as well as on the webcast, so we have technology to take questions on the webcast. They'll pop up on the screen here, and Tom Flynn will triage there. And in the room, what we'll do is if you just put up your hand, we have people who have microphones around the corners of the room. They'll run a microphone to you. If you can contain yourself, try and wait for the microphone before you ask your question, because people on the webcast won't be able to hear your question if you don't have a microphone in your hand. So those are the rules. First hand is up in the back. I think it's Gabriel's. He's tall. His arm is long.</p><p>GABRIEL DECHAINE, ANALYST, NATIONAL BANK FINANCIAL, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Tom, you had an interesting slide there, a doubling of PCL would hit your net income by 10%. I think many of us on the sell side here have done analysis on sensitivities to higher loan losses. What about the capital impact? Do you have an outcome there from that scenario?</p><p>THOMAS E. FLYNN: I don't have a calculated number that I can give you off the top, but we were trying to illustrate 2 things with the double. #1, a doubling of credit losses is not inconsequential. That's a meaningful change. And #2, it only does drive -- and again, I'll say only a 10% change in income. On the capital side, a move from the current loss rate to 40 bps would bring us to the long-term average. That would have some impact on RWA from a migration perspective, but it wouldn't be that significant. So we would be going to a cycle of neutral level. There would be some movement, but I would say not significant.</p><p>GABRIEL DECHAINE: Then the trend in the ROE, which has been a pretty good 1 for the bank -- it should be in the slides there, but the -- along with EPS growth, the ROE has rebounded back up to close to the 15% target level. Does that embolden you, I guess, having achieved that in your future capital allocation decisions, specifically with regards to M&amp;A, where you'd be willing to take a step back on ROE with the confidence that you're going to rebuild that.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: Maybe I could take a first crack at that, Gabriel. By the way, did you just say we didn't have enough slides and we should have given you more? Because we didn't think so, but the -- I guess I would say that, in general, our improved ROE performance over the last year or so has emboldened us. I don't think it necessarily says that it emboldens you towards M&amp;A in particular. It's emboldened us because it's validated what we said we were going to do. If you remember, about a year ago, we started talking pretty actively about getting on our efficiency agenda in an accelerated way and building on the growth head of steam that we had in the United States, and I think you saw some of that come through today. And those 2 factors, among others -- those 2 factors, among others, have really driven the ROE growth that you saw and that you've seen us post in the last couple of quarters. As we think about the world going forward, we look at -- as I've said on many of the calls, we look at M&amp;A opportunities, but the priority is organic growth. We don't feel compulsion on M&amp;A. We feel like we're equipped, we're ready to go if the right thing comes along, but we don't feel a compulsion, and our priority is always on the organic growth and to continue to deliver that ROE that you saw from that perspective. We have 1 over here.</p><p>EVAN HUGHES: Evan Hughes with 1832 Asset Management. I have a question for Tom. Tom, we've seen the first bail-in debt issuance. Could you give us your updated thoughts with regards to timing and other considerations as BMO prepares to issue their first bail-in debt?</p><p>THOMAS E. FLYNN: Sure. So we've seen bail-in debt come to the Canadian market. The regulatory regime is in place. We've had 1 transaction. We would expect to be active with bail-in ourselves in the first quarter. And going forward, obviously, our senior debt will take the form of bail-in debt. I would say, from our perspective, the introduction of the new structure has gone very smoothly. There was a lot of consultation around the design of the debt. The market I think was ready for the product when it came in. We've had the 1 transaction. It went well. In the market now, bail-in debt is pricing 10 to maybe 15 basis points above where our senior debt would have traded before. Our hope is that will tighten in a little bit through time as the market gets fully comfortable with the structure. And so I think not a big change, all in all -- a slight uptick in price, but very slight, and the market receptivity has been good for the product.</p><p>EVAN HUGHES: So just to clarify, is that 1Q the calendar or bank fiscal year?</p><p>THOMAS E. FLYNN: Bank fiscal.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: And we'll take 1 more in the room, and then we'll jump to 1 or 2 on the webcast, and then we'll come back to the room. We've got 1 over here.</p><p>SUMIT MALHOTRA, MD OF CANADIAN FINANCIAL SERVICES, SCOTIABANK GLOBAL BANKING AND MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: My questions are going to be for Ernie, so I'll move over here so you can see me. Consumer -- or personal loan growth in the U.S., it's been a slow growth proposition for BMO basically since the M&amp;I deal, and you're certainly giving us a much more optimistic outlook for a couple of the components. So specifically, in your view, what has changed in terms of your consumer platform? And when you talk about nonresi real estate, what are the key drivers for that portfolio going forward? And the second part of it, I think your revenue growth target is double what you've expected -- or what you've forecast for loans, so it sounds like you think there's still more margin expansion to come. The market in the U.S. doesn't seem to be so sure of that for regional banks. Where is -- am I right on that, that it's basically margin that's going to make up that difference for you in terms of revenue?</p><p>ERMINIA JOHANNSON: Great question. And so it's a mix shift that is accountable for the shift in the growth and revenue. So as you think about the growth that we've had, it historically has been in the mortgage business, which has a lower spread overall for the business. So as we think about growing credit cards at the current spreads -- and we have a great opportunity in our franchise, because we're under-penetrated versus what our regional competitors do, and so we see that as an opportunity. As we think about getting back into the indirect auto business, as you recall, we made a sale a few years ago. We are now in the market in a way that's optimizing what I would say price and risk/reward optimization, and that's been fundamentally growing. We've been growing spreads in our indirect auto business over the past few quarters. So as you think about a mix between credit card, you think about cross-selling our home equity into our portfolio and our indirect auto business, as well as some unsecured. That's really going to accelerate our revenue trajectory going forward. So the shift in mortgages is a really important 1 for us. We're in the mortgage business, and we're doing it in a more centralized, optimized manner as well.</p><p>THOMAS E. FLYNN: Okay, I'll take a question from the webcast. It's a question related to our commercial business, and, Dave, maybe you want to lead on this and anyone else can join. The question is what's our outlook for commercial real estate lending from both a growth and a credit perspective in Canada and in the United States?</p><p>DAVID ROBERT CASPER: Okay, I'll start. I would say -- let's take Canada first. We're less than at the market vis-a-vis some of our other banks in commercial real estate. We think it's a great business for us, and we've done extremely well, and we've been pretty conservative. It's interesting. Nadim and I had dinner last night with 1 of our clients -- this will weigh in -- that is in the real estate side, and half of his business is in Canada and half of his business is in the U.S. We asked him where would he invest today if he had a dollar, and he was probably moving a little bit more to the U.S., maybe 60/40. Our business in the U.S. is -- as you saw that page with all the white space, we've had a lower than scale real estate business over time. We've drastically changed it to deal with much larger institutions where we would have lower loan to value. That's been very positive. We have a lot of room to grow. And I'd say on both sides of the border, we feel very confident in the sponsors we're working with, the locations they're going after. The only area that we have very, very little exposure, particularly in the U.S., is in retail, and that's been a decided position for a number of years. So I feel good about it. I think there's room to grow, and I do not see any near-term downturn that would impact how we would run our business. That's my view, with comments from the rest, Cam, anybody else in the room.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: Tom, do you want to take 1 more from the webcast, and then we'll come back to the room?</p><p>THOMAS E. FLYNN: Sure. We'll take 1 more. It's a multi-part question, and it's a little bit tricky, but the question relates to relationship pricing. And you've heard us talking about how we want to deliver a 1-bank impact to our customers, and if we're doing business with someone in banking, we'd like to get their wealth business, and so the question goes to what that means from a pricing perspective. And the question relates to how we look at relationship pricing when we're looking at the total client relationship, and if we have a strong relationship on 1 side of the house, does that mean we would price below the market in another piece of business that we would do with that client? So that question goes to wealth, goes to banking, and probably goes to capital markets as well, but go ahead, Joanna.</p><p>JOANNA ROTENBERG: I can kick it off, and others can augment. I'd start off by saying when we think about pricing, before we get into relationship pricing, hopefully one of the themes you've taken from the conversation today is we are disciplined when it comes to pricing. So whether it's a credit we're looking at or the investment management relationship or otherwise, we really take into account a number of factors to make a very disciplined decision in the risk-based return that we'll achieve. As it relates to our clients overall, as you can appreciate, some of the comments that we've heard from our clients over time, many of which may be franchise clients of the bank or standalone prospects that we would like to be franchise clients, they want us to think about the total relationship value that they bring to us, and in many cases, that can extend all the way from, let's say, a multinational capital markets relationship to the personal wealth of that client. And increasingly, when we come to market together, whether it's with an existing relationship where we don't have 1 part of the relationship or if we're going to market together, we try to think about the total picture of the client. And, again, reflecting on some of the other comments, we also try to use as much data as we can to back the decisions that we make. And so, increasingly, we do believe that relationship pricing is going to be a natural feature, something our clients naturally are expecting and something you would expect of an industry leader. Again, I would say this would be, obviously, taking into expectation the full return-based expectation we would normally have, but giving our clients a full and consolidated chance to have a relationship, and I do believe it would play it a little differently depending on the relationship and other factors, as well as within wealth management, we would be looking at the same.</p><p>THOMAS E. FLYNN: Anybody else want to comment on that?</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: The only thing I would say is we are almost -- we're always in a better position when the clients are asking for more opportunities, so giving the relationship pricing almost always makes sense because we're just getting more of their wallet, and we work pretty closely across the businesses to make sure that Joanna gives it up sometime or I give it up or somebody can. I mean, it works out in the wash, and because we're trying to grow the overall business, this is -- the best thing you can have is when a client says, \"Well, what if I bring some more business to you?\"</p><p>THOMAS E. FLYNN: Dan?</p><p>DANIEL BARCLAY: When I think about it from a banking point of view, we've always had a relationship focus, and 1 of the things when you've had the technology tools activated, we actually see a full client relationship now, and so when we look at that relationship, we look at it over time as opposed to transactional. It's actually over a year, over 3 years, over 5 years. And what you'll find is that by having a better relationship with a client, looking at our total cost of production, if you like, or cost of service, if we can add incremental revenue to it, ironically, we actually make more money. So in the relationship pricing, you can say, okay, you've offered a discount if you look at it in a little box, but if you look at it on a big relationship with lots of relationship horsepower, we actually turn out to be our best relationships with the highest return. And it's really a multi-product solution set that we offer on the long term, and it's turned out very well for us.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: Back to the room. Meny?</p><p>MENY GRAUMAN, MD &amp; HEAD OF INSTITUTIONAL EQUITY RESEARCH, CORMARK SECURITIES INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Meny from Cormark. When I was looking at the maps that you showed of the U.S., what struck me was, specifically in the commercial and on the wealth side, that you're really breaking out of the Midwest and moving to -- I think you called it the white spaces, the rest of the country, in a more significant way. But the question is when it comes to the branch network -- and that's very much still Midwest constrained -- what is your appetite for taking the branch network more across the U.S. and the retail business in general?</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: Maybe I'll start, Meny, on this, and Ernie might have something to say and Dave might have something to say, but I just want to make sure that we're level set. When we showed you the map on the U.S., we tried to animate it so that you could see how we think about the business. We talked first about what we call our core commercial markets, and those were the ones where I think you heard Dave say that the GDP of those markets where we're already well represented, flags flying, technology's in place, risk management's in place, sales force is in place -- those markets represent about 14% of U.S. GDP, so bigger -- way bigger than Canada right there. Then what you're referring to is we talk about our growth markets. We have got commercial operations, we've got capital markets operations, we've got wealth market -- wealth operations outside of those markets, maybe not completely full service, but we're there, and those operations are following each other, meaning you'll hear our wealth people -- Joanna and the folks who work for Joanna in the United States will say when our commercial bankers go to a market like Ohio or Georgia or Texas, our wealth people go with it. So that's the second ring, if you could think about it that way. Where you're going is what about the retail branch footprint? Ernie talked about 200 branches that are outside of that first circle, so we're in a lighter branch footprint there. And when we think about the deposit gathering capability as we go out -- let's talk about 3 years or 5 years here -- I think we would say outside of those branch footprints, we're more likely to see increased commercial deposit gathering and more likely to see wealth deposit gathering and more likely to see digital deposit gathering as we ramp up our digital than we are to see more branches in more places outside of that footprint. I say all that, and then I'll say never say never, because if we looked at something that was very attractive for a whole bunch of reasons and came with a really attractive branch footprint, then we might see ourselves target that as well, but we wouldn't do it for branch sake. Would you guys have anything to add to that, Dave or Ernie?</p><p>ERMINIA JOHANNSON: The only comment I would make is that even as we're growing our digital deposit strategy in those lighter branch footprints, we're going to be attracting new customers into our franchise that allow us then at some point to potentially launch a smart branch in a neighborhood because we've attracted so many customers in that space to be able to enhance the cross-sell capability. But our first and foremost strategy would be to leverage what we have today, use the digital capabilities and, if necessary, add as new customers come into the franchise in those places.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: Others in the room, we have a couple our left, to your right. There are 2 hands up over here, if we could run some mics over. Whoever gets the mic first gets to speak first.</p><p>NIGEL R. D'SOUZA, INVESTMENT ANALYST, VERITAS INVESTMENT RESEARCH CORPORATION: Nigel D'Souza, Veritas Investment Research. So the Bank of Canada just today announced that they will hike for the Bank of Canada rate and came out with a more hawkish tone than expected on monetary policy, stating that they expect to remove monetary stimulus from the economy. So, first, reactions, and does the tightening monetary policy -- how does that impact your outlook for growth or credit risk across BMO's business segments?</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: Tom might have a perspective on the rate increase itself. Cam might as far as the housing. Can I just ask you -- we've been pretty busy delivering these presentations, so the Bank of Canada, when you say more hawkish, did they delete the reference to gradual, or how did it come out more hawkish?</p><p>NIGEL R. D'SOUZA: So that's correct, there was a removal of the reference to gradual in the most recent commentary.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: So you've seen in the last bit the rising rate environment has been good for our bank. It's been good for most banks. So when we look at it, we consider the impact on our pricing, and you'll see that as the days roll forward, but I think fundamentally what's important to think about when you look at the Bank of Canada is the underlying economy, and if they've removed the reference to hawkish, that would likely come with some level of -- pardon me, the reference to gradual, because of the hawkishness, it's coming with some level of confidence in the underlying Canadian economy, and we're feeling that. We're feeling that in our small business banking, in our commercial banking, and in our capital markets banking. So, overall, the real economy, the underlying economy that's driving these rate decisions, is what's driving the profitability of the bank and our strategies. That's the most important factor. Do you want to talk about rates in particular?</p><p>THOMAS E. FLYNN: Yes, I'll add a little bit on rates. I would say we're happy with that increase. #1, we think it makes sense given what we see in the economy. The economy is doing well. Rates are relatively low. It's good to take away the stimulus and to have more powder for when that might be needed, and so the approach makes sense to us. Secondly, we do benefit from higher interest rates. We benefit on the short end, and we benefit from higher 5-year rates. And so I'd say we've been pleased with the moves that have occurred in the U.S., and we welcome the move today in Canada, and we're happy to see the market rates move up around the 5-year area over the last little while. And just to put a few numbers on that, people, kind of naturally because it gets the press, focus on the move and the administered rates from the fed and the Bank of Canada. The sensitivity there is real. You've seen it flowing through in the U.S. business. But the sensitivity that comes through time from higher 5-year rates is very significant, and what happens is we effectively have like a 5- or 6-year bond letter that rolls in and reprices, and as our assets in that bond letter mature, we reprice at higher rates, and over time, that can be very significant and it will provide we think a real tailwind to our revenue. And when you look at the deposits and the capital that we reprice in that kind of way, it's about $135 billion, and so that's a big number to put higher rates on and we think will benefit us. There's lots of natural debate about whether higher rates will cause pressure on credit. With a good underlying economic performance, as Darryl talked about, low unemployment, we don't think that's something that's of immediate concern. So the economy feels good, higher rates make sense, and we see it flow through in a positive way in the financials.</p><p>CAMERON FOWLER: I suppose I'd just add that given the overall health that Tom laid out, I don't think there's a near-term particular concern. You'd also know that from our book, probably least exposed to whatever that might be in the near and medium term, and the strategy that I laid out earlier is quite well aligned to some moderation in the performance of that business from a growth perspective. I think very limited risk in the near term and good opportunities for growth from the otherwise healthy bits of the economy.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: There were other hands up in this corner here.</p><p>STEPHEN GORDON THERIAULT, PRINCIPAL &amp; CO-HEAD OF RESEARCH, EIGHT CAPITAL, RESEARCH DIVISION: Steve Theriault from Eight Capital. Some pretty positive messages on the deposit franchise in the U.S., but there was lots of hand-wringing through the U.S. bank reporting season around a rotation of non-interest-bearing deposits, so maybe you can just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the context of your businesses, and is this clawing back some of your outlook or expectation for margin expansion?</p><p>ERMINIA JOHANNSON: I can take that 1. So a couple things. We think about our deposit capabilities as a portfolio. So there are a couple things that we are very focused on. Obviously, originating new customers to our franchise, and we're growing, is supporting our core checking account and savings. We've been seeing stability in our savings business, which is important, and in our checking business. And we are starting to see some movement from some of our products, from a money market into a CD right now is what we're seeing in terms of a migration within the portfolio. We're seeing more pricing competition, no question about that, and so we're looking at how do we diversify the play in the portfolio and take advantage of opportunities in certain markets where we think we can price differently and to different customer segments. So a generally macro statement would say that there is more of a shift in terms of getting back to the customer more of the increase, but it's managing that portfolio, and that's what our plans are and have been, and we've been doing that quite effectively.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: I'd just add on the commercial side, we're -- as you recall, we're underweight commercial deposits versus -- in the U.S. versus retail, and we're overweight the loans for commercial. But on the commercial deposits, we're up overall, but there absolutely has been a shift, and we would expect -- these commercial clients, they watch. They're sophisticated treasurers. They're going to expect from their bank, and we would do that, that we would pay up and there would be a change over time. What we've seen, though, and what we've been successful at is gathering -- we always have the deposits of our commercial clients where they are running all their cash through us. We're their cash management bank. That's good business for us. Also, we don't always have, but we have been more aggressive in getting the cash, the excess cash, from those clients and from prospects, so that would also help -- that'll build our deposits, but it would be a little bit more interest-bearing. It's what you would expect in a rising rate environment. It's not a big surprise for us, and we want to always stay competitive but have the full relationship of those clients as well. That help?</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: We had another hand up a moment ago over here. I don't see it currently. It's coming back around. Gabriel, then Ralph.</p><p>GABRIEL DECHAINE: A couple follow-ups here on the businesses. In the commercial bank, in the U.S., the loan growth we've seen has been really, really strong, and, thankfully, it doesn't look to be a 1-trick pony driven by commercial real estate. But to play devil's advocate, I see pretty much all the U.S. banks generating sub-5% commercial growth or talking about intensification of competition from non-banks and what have you. So why shouldn't I be worried about seeing growth like the kind you're delivering in the commercial loan book, and why should I be comfortable with it? Just to play devil's advocate.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: No, no, it's a great question and 1 that I think we address every day. We're not worried, but we're always watching to see that, so we've got a couple of things. Very diversified -- our real estate business is less than 10%, and a lot of the banks are a lot larger, so they're pulling back. What we've done, though, and what we've tried to show is in these specialty businesses -- and when we talk about them, asset-based lending is a good example. Our floor plan business is another good example. As we've grown, we've gotten to scale. We've kind of caught up with other banks. These are businesses too that have underlying assets behind them. So when there is a downturn, you still have the asset. You have a truck, you have receivables and inventory, so these are businesses that have very low losses given to fall. Where we haven't grown specifically in any major way is in the riskiest businesses we have. We have them, but they're a smaller part. So I feel real good about it. I feel that when I do see -- and I watch all the U.S. reporting, and I see lots of things that people talk about. We have paydowns every quarter. We compete with all of the non-banks. But I think we've found a way -- and I will point back to this group over here -- of not competing on risk, presenting a good long-term value, and growing over the long term, and that's the message we have. We started this in 2010 to say this is going to be a good business in the U.S. and we should double down to grow it, and so I feel really good about it. And we had low losses. They'll go up at some point, but I do not feel that we are creating a good problem.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: Gabriel, I would just add, before we go to Rob, unless -- do you have 2 parts of your question?</p><p>GABRIEL DECHAINE: I have a follow-up.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: I'm going to follow up on the follow-up, and you can follow up. I would just add, in a way that perhaps Dave won't, that we're really, really good at this business. When we look at our commercial franchise and the DNA that's been built up effectively over the course of 35 years, we're -- this business we think -- by the way, there's a little bit sketchy -- a little bit of sketchy data on this, but when we look at the commercial definition of the -- traditional definition of the commercial market, BMO is the seventh largest commercial lender in the United States. We think they're the second largest commercial lender in Canada. When you put it together, in North America, we're inside of 7. So we don't take a back seat to anybody in terms of our relationship capability, and yet the reason I think it's a sweet spot is that, while we're the seventh largest commercial lender in the United States, we still have low aggregate market share. We've got really leading capabilities and an ability to beat anybody in a street fight or in a boardroom to get the business, but we have a low market share. So we are taking share, and we're taking it from folks who are pretty good competitors, and Dave's team is doing a really good job of it. It's actually not a lot more complicated than that, but it's hard to get there.</p><p>GABRIEL DECHAINE: The next 1 is, I guess, for Dave on the capital market side, also U.S.-related. So the extension of the balance sheet has been a big part of that story, corporate lending. I'm just wondering -- that's the backdrop, I guess. How do you see -- or what are the main drivers to get you from your 70%-plus efficiency ratio you're at these days to 60% or below, your 5-year target? Are you happy with the ancillary revenue generation that you've achieved with that balance sheet that you put out there, or are you progressing ahead as normal, or are you reviewing the relationships? What's the progress like now?</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: Well, I think you've answered my question, which is nice. The driver for us is going to be scale in a bunch of this, and the lending book is a really interesting 1. If you remember -- sitting up here a few years ago, we would have told you we were a mid-market strategy. The mid-market, really, for us when we think about it, corporate versus commercial, was clients in the $100 million, $250 million, $500 million range. Then we stretched it to $2 billion, then to $5 billion, and now we'd tell you we're stretching it to $10 billion. And so what we're doing is we're increasing scale. One of the benefits of that is we're actually moving more into the investment grade than we were before. We had that cusp B, BBB, as kind of a core strength, and now we're really stretching that quite a bit broader, and so we're doing bigger loans, we're doing it with better clients, higher credit quality clients, and that's an underpinning. That business runs for us very similar to commercial, kind of in the mid-30s in terms of efficiency. Investment banking runs higher. Trading runs higher. And so we get to a blend of businesses is what's going to bring us down. The second is when you think about us moving forward in terms of revenue growth, I made lots of references to scale. We put a lot of investment into the business -- regulatory is a great example -- where you have to have a core capability on AML to survive, right? That's a basic service offering. As you think about doubling your revenues from where we are -- I don't need to double that regulatory scale anymore, right? I don't need to double the number of people we have in trading products. I don't need to double the number of people we have in banking to double our share. I'm going to add share in lots of places, which really flows down into net income. And so if you think about it in the classic operating leverage, we're going to increase revenues faster than expenses. That's what we're going to do. In all places, we're going to be increasing our expenses. It's just revenue will be faster.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: Rob, you were trying to get in.</p><p>ROBERT SEDRAN, MD &amp; HEAD OF RESEARCH, CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Rob Sedran from CIBC. Cam, for you on the mortgage business. And candidly, I'm not concerned about risk in the answer, so feel free to go there if you like, but it's more about growth. So we know that the market has clearly slowed, and I think I saw the word aggressive on your slide in terms of adding sales, sales staff, so a little bit more color on what you're hoping to achieve in what feels like a late cycle in the housing market, at least from a growth perspective. And then around the same issue, we've historically thought -- and maybe we've overused the word anchor, but we've historically thought of the anchor product as the mortgage product, and so if that's not the anchor product anymore, what's the anchor product of tomorrow that's going to get you the 1 million in net new customers you're looking for?</p><p>CAMERON FOWLER: So the first thing that I would say on the mortgage side, we made the participation choice 7, 8, 9 years ago to not be part of the broker market. So everything we do, we originate by ourselves, and we are very limited participants in the third-party part as well. So we start from that position that says we have a strong capability in this regard, we have a strong branch footprint, but in terms -- as you saw from the page, in terms of the number of mortgage specialists on the street we have right now, we've got a number that is in the 500 range. Obviously, we have FSMs and other folks in the branch who do this as well. That's a number that's meaningfully lower than our peer group. You put with that the fact that we have a wonderfully healthy book that we're super proud of and confident in, but it is smaller relative to the peers. So, to us, I think the fundamental point is that the opportunity is bigger. I would say that market down 15-ish and in the 20s in GTA and GVA, but settling the rest of the Canada market outside of those 2 things is relatively healthy and relatively well balanced, and so we see there to be opportunities outside of the 2 big markets where we're strong, but not performing as well as we could in this product. You're right to say that there can be other anchor products in terms of growth, and when we think about a net million, we're pretty focused on primary, and for us primary is checking, and specifically the checking where the relationship involves the deposit of the paycheck. And so a lot of our energy will go to ensuring that we can acquire checking accounts via digital in as high a quality way as we do via the branch channel, and that specifically means doing more than 1 product when you do so to secure the relationship. But if you were to say is there a co-anchor idea, like the ones you met earlier on stage today, mortgage and checking I think are reasonable ways to think about it.</p><p>ROBERT SEDRAN: It is fair to assume, though, that the mortgage product is still part of that million net new, is taking share in the mortgage product.</p><p>CAMERON FOWLER: Yes, I expect that we would take a little bit. It is not -- winning and that alone is not the ambition. We'll be out or ahead of market, and I think you'll see that in the next couple of quarters. We probably already are, but we're not looking to -- that's what we're looking to do.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: We probably have time for 1 more, maybe 2, depending on the complexity of Sumit's question.</p><p>SUMIT MALHOTRA: My question is actually for someone not onstage. That's Pat, if he's still around.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: Pat is over here.</p><p>SUMIT MALHOTRA: So Pat -- well, first off, Surjit is doing a really good job as Chief Risk Officer.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: Surjit is over here.</p><p>SUMIT MALHOTRA: He's leaving when things are perfect, so he's --</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: I couldn't agree more.</p><p>SUMIT MALHOTRA: -- handing the baton over to you. So as incoming Chief Risk Officer, you hear your commercial colleagues talking about double-digit growth. In U.S. personal, we're talking about increased growth in credit cards and auto, which historically have been higher loss rate products in the U.S. You're a markets guy. Equity market doesn't seem to be as sanguine about credit as most of the banks I talk to or hear from do. So when you put all these things together, what are some of the factors, as the Chief Risk Officer, that you would look at, either qualitatively or quantitatively, to make you go to your colleagues and say we've got to rethink some of these growth objectives that we've put out to the market today?</p><p>PATRICK CRONIN: Well, I'll say for starters, now you have me really worried about taking on this job. I would say, first of all, it's probably a little bit too early for me to answer the question. I can tell you a little bit of my philosophy going in, though. And I think even though I am a markets guy by background, probably 1 of the things I'm most proud of in my career is, amongst other people in the business, really building up a strong risk management capability in capital markets. We've spent the better part of 5 to 10 years investing heavily in the risk infrastructure and the risk culture, and so that's the philosophy that I'm bringing into the role, that that really is the foundation for all of the strategies that my colleagues are talking about. And so if we don't continue to invest heavily, continue to focus really deeply on the risk -- a lot of the same risk metrics you're talking about, we're going to undermine the strategies of all of my colleagues, so you can expect the same level of risk discipline. Secondly, I would simply point to my second strategy, which is a continuation really of what's been going on in the risk group so far. I think several of my colleagues have pointed to our track record over the past 5 years or so across all kinds of risk metrics, whether you look at PCLs, whether you look at our VAR or stress exposure in the risk groups, our operational risk track record, our track record in regulatory reviews and audits. And so my primary goal in the first 6 to 12 months is going to be to maintain the stability of that group and continue the great risk management tradition that we've got right now. So then over the course of time, I'll start to develop views along with the risk team about some of the key metrics that I want to look at to help underpin the strategies, but I think it's too early for me to say which ones are going to be the drivers of my thought process. We've got a lot of great risk professionals that I'll rely on that before that happens.</p><p>WILLIAM DARRYL WHITE: One thing I can tell you -- and it might be a good place to end it -- is that I've worked with Patrick for a very long time, and if there's anybody who has a great way of coming in either the front door or the back door and saying you probably shouldn't do that, it's Pat, and he will do an excellent job in this role, and he'll follow a superb job that Surjit has done in making sure with his team, with a great team, that we're all taking care of the risks at the same time as we take care of the customers. So we've got that at center ice as well. If I don't -- I don't see any other hands, so I'm going to do an attempt at wrapping up. We're going to get you out of this room before noon sharp, and I'd like to just leave you with a couple of thoughts. I was sitting listening to the presentations today, thinking to myself if I was in your shoes and you were to take away what's new -- you'll formulate your own point of view on this, but I was looking at the various commentary that we heard today. Some of the financial goals are new. We've been specific with respect to the achievement of the 58% in 3 years through the 2% of operating leverage. We've been specific with respect to the 1/3 from the U.S. We've been specific with respect to our spend on the technology agenda. On the technology agenda, the digital leadership that we talked to you about today I said at the beginning I thought might come as a bit of a surprise to some. You'll see a few more surprises if you've got some time to join us. When you leave the room, we're going to serve lunch, and then if you keep going to your left, we've got quite a display of technology innovations that we've got going on in the digital side, including some robots that are wandering around that you can talk to and do some fun things with. So I think there's a lot of exciting things from my perspective that are new on the digital agenda. When Luke was talking about the EI3 agenda, this is brand new. We got going on this only 8 months ago, so we're really only ramping up speed towards the efficiencies that Luke was talking about, and that'll be really productive for all of our employees, our customers and our shareholders. And the other thing that was particularly inspiring to me is as I watched the different groups perform what I like to think about as the 1 bank, 1 team, 1 strategy, it was remarkable for me to hear Ray, a U.S. commercial banker, talking about trucking clients in the United States and our businesses in commercial talking about 53% increase in referral rates to wealth and 23% referral increases to capital markets, and the list goes on and on as -- whether we're talking cross-border, cross-function or cross-business. This is for real, and this is what's happening here, and I wouldn't say to you that that's brand new. We've been at this for quite a while, but I can say to you that I think we're at an inflection point where everybody is in it together and everybody's got a hand on the oar, and I'm very proud of the work that we've done in that capacity. Before we wrap up, 1 shout out. This has been a great session today. Thank you for all of your attention. As we think about our relationships with the investment community, analysts, shareholders, rating agencies, there's 1 person in the room that I didn't give a shout out to earlier, and that's Frank Teacher. And Frank is sitting in the front row, and Frank probably, if there were an award for somebody who has spent more time being an ambassador for this bank -- probably went through 40 or 50 or 60 quarterly analyst calls where you heard his voice. You didn't have the pleasure always of seeing his smiling face through the whole way. I just want to give a shout out to Frank, because Frank will be moving on to his retirement in 2019, and he has been the best partner to all of us that are up here, and he's been a best partner to the investment community as well. So it just occurs to me that this may be the last time that he's here with all of you in person at the same time, so I'd like to give Frank some applause. And afterwards, Frank is going to be sure to take us aside and tell us everything that we should have done better, and that's good too. But now my responsibility is to get you out of the room. So for those of you who are here in the room, join us, as I said, for lunch in the tech showcase, so you just keep following around to your left. For those of you on the webcast, thank you for joining us today. We're out of time. We look forward to talk to you all again soon.

The moratorium on Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approvals would provide Congress time to close the ILC loophole and ensure ILCs and their parent companies don't pose unnecessary risks to consumers and taxpayers.</p><p>\"ILCs offer banking products and services that are functionally indistinguishable from those offered by banks, but the ILC loophole allows the parent companies of ILCs to avoid oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and to engage in commercial activities, thus introducing risk to the banking system and to taxpayers,\" the groups wrote. \"Legislative action to close this loophole is necessary to eliminate these risks.\"</p><p>ILCs are FDIC-insured, state-chartered institutions that can generally engage in the full range of banking activities, such as taking deposits and making loans. But unlike banks, their parent companies are not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act, which means those companies are not subject to any federal supervision, regulations or standards. For this reason, there has historically been considerable opposition to the charter, and both Congress and the FDIC have placed temporary moratoria on ILCs.</p><p>Big Tech company ownership of an ILC introduces a new concern: that consumer data, including sensitive personal financial information, will be inadequately safeguarded and used in inappropriate and unauthorized ways. With global e-commerce giant Rakuten recently joining tech firms such as Square and Nelnet in applying to form ILCs, the risk associated with this legal loophole is greater than ever.</p><p>\"In the era of dominant Big Tech, we should be cautious before giving technology companies even greater reach into the economic life of Americans by allowing them to own banks,\" the groups wrote. \"The integration of technology and banking firms would not only result in an enormous concentration of financial and technological assets but also would pose conflicts of interest and privacy concerns to our banking system.\"</p><p>The groups further noted, \"A growth in ILCs poses broader consumer protection risks as well, because non-bank lenders, including very high-cost lenders, view the ILC charter as a far easier way to obtain banking privileges than obtaining a traditional bank charter and, consequently, becoming subject to consolidated Federal Reserve supervision.\"</p><p>In March, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking related to parent companies of industrial banks and industrial loan companies. BPI, CRL, ICBA and a coalition of civil rights groups wrote to the FDIC requesting that the FDIC not approve ILC deposit insurance applications until its ILC rulemaking is final. However, in recent months, the FDIC has approved some ILC applications and is reviewing others, including some whose parent companies engage in commercial activities.</p><p>[Category: Financial Services]</p><p>Contact: Sean Oblack, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sean.oblack@bpi.com\">sean.oblack@bpi.com</email>;
