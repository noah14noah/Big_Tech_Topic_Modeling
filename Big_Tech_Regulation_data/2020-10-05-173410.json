So Silicon Valley big-tech companies made themselves the gatekeepers of 'goodthink,' de-platforming anyone who runs afoul of their arbitrary 'community standards.'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alex Jones, the host of InfoWars, has often been derided by establishment media as a conspiracy theorist. Yet on Monday, Apple, Spotify, YouTube and Facebook proved right the motto of his show \u2013\u00a0\"There's a war on for your mind!\"\u00a0\u2013 by\u00a0blocking or deleting\u00a0InfoWars accounts from their platforms, saying he allegedly engaged in\u00a0\"hate speech\"\u00a0and violated their\u00a0\"community standards.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Simply put, these corporations appointed themselves arbiters of acceptable political thought, and censored Jones for failing to comply with arbitrary political standards set in Silicon Valley boardrooms, not at the ballot box.</p><p>The First Amendment to the US Constitution says that Congress shall make no law\u00a0\"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\"\u00a0There is no\u00a0\"hate speech\"\u00a0exemption, either. In fact, hate speech is not even a legal category in the US. However, a chorus of voices all too glad Jones was purged immediately chimed up to argue that Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Spotify are private companies and this does not apply to them.</p><p>There is a wrinkle in that argument, though: civil rights outfits such as the ACLU have argued that social media amount to a\u00a0\"designated public forum\"\u00a0in cases where government officials tried to avail themselves of blocking, muting and other functions put forth by Big Tech as a way to police\u00a0\"toxicity\"\u00a0on their platforms.</p><p>\"When the government designates social media a public forum, the First Amendment prohibits it from limiting the discourse based on viewpoint,\"\u00a0the ACLU said in a brief\u00a0submitted last year\u00a0in a case before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia.\u00a0\"When a government actor bans critics from speaking in a forum, it silences and chills dissent, warps the public conversation, and skews public perception,\"\u00a0the ACLU brief went on.</p><p>In a separate but obviously related case,\u00a0a federal judge\u00a0used the\u00a0\"designated public forum\"\u00a0definition to demand that President Donald Trump allow critics access to his personal Twitter account \u2013 not the official @POTUS one \u2013 because he is a public official.</p><p>However, if social media platforms are a\u00a0\"designated public forum\"that government is not allowed to exclude people from on First Amendment grounds, how is it OK for corporations that operate these platforms to do so? Or is chilling dissent, warping conversation and skewing perception only bad when a government actor does it, thereby creating a legal system in which the\u00a0what\u00a0is irrelevant, and the only thing that matters is\u00a0who/whom?</p><p>There is something deeply cynical about people who until yesterday denounced discrimination and evil corporatism \u2013 and will do so again tomorrow \u2013 suddenly defending private property and freedom to discriminate against political viewpoints. That's because this isn't about principles, but about power.</p><p>Liberals were once all for free speech, starting a movement by that name at Berkeley in the 1960s. Now that the media and academia overwhelmingly march in lockstep with the Democratic Party, however, they're all about\u00a0\"no-platforming\"opposing views and calling them\u00a0\"hate speech,\"\u00a0all in an effort to limit the range of permissible thought and expression in America.</p><p>This has manifested in many forms, from\u00a0literal riots in Berkeley\u00a0to\u00a0\"shadowbanning\"\u00a0of several\u00a0Republican lawmakers on Twitter. That platform, which has so far refrained from banning InfoWars, didn't hesitate to block conservative African-American activist\u00a0Candace Owens\u00a0after she pointedly echoed the\u00a0hateful tweets of a liberal journalist\u00a0hired by the New York Times. Needless to say, the same people up in arms about Alex Jones argued that\u00a0Sarah Jeong's tweets were fine, because one\u00a0\"cannot be racist against white people.\"</p><p>This ideological conflict in American society actually goes back years, maybe even decades. However, the victory of Trump over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election, even though most of the media and all of the Silicon Valley were #WithHer, flushed it out in the open. Democrats quickly latched onto a claim of\u00a0\"Russian meddling,\"\u00a0intended to delegitimize Trump's presidency but also, as it turns out, create an excuse for corporate censorship.</p><p>Consider the\u00a0November 1, 2017 hearing\u00a0before the Senate Intelligence Committee, where lawyers for Google, Facebook and Twitter were subjected to a barrage of demands to regulate their platforms against\u00a0\"Russians\"\u00a0\u2013 or else.</p><p>\"You have to be the ones to do something about it, or we will,\"\u00a0said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California). She also pressed for the removal of RT from YouTube, only to have a Google representative say that despite looking very hard, the company hasn't found any policy violations that would justify such a move.</p><p>\"I'm not really satisfied with that,\"\u00a0said Feinstein.</p><p>Now, imagine how much more chilling this would be if Feinstein represented the ruling party, rather than the opposition. It isn't that far-fetched: during the 2016 election, Facebook COO\u00a0Sheryl Sandbergtold Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta that she\u00a0\"badly\"\u00a0wanted Clinton to win, while\u00a0Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet, actually spent election night at Clinton HQ with a\u00a0\"staff\"\u00a0badge. More recently,\u00a0this April actually, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey described as a\u00a0\"great read\"an article describing how Democrats should fight and win the\u00a0\"civil war\"\u00a0currently being waged in the US.</p><p>This isn't about how much one likes or dislikes Alex Jones or InfoWars. This is about corporations deciding for you what you should be allowed to hear, read, say or think\u00a0\u2013 and the people normally criticizing such behavior cheering it on, because it suits their political agenda.</p><p>As Jones's colleague Paul Joseph Watson put it,\u00a0\"The great censorship purge has truly begun.\"</p><p>Ask not for whom the censorship bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</p><p>Nebojsa Malic, RT</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-122885958</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T04-5BS1-F11P-X01S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1005\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Yerepouni Daily News.

This is FIRST MOVE. And here's your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fear mongering. China accuses the United States of overreacting to coronavirus; stocks there slump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Taking no chances. Hong Kong's Carrie Lam suspends ferries from Macau and restricts border crossings from the Mainland.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a raucous at the caucus. Who will come out on top? As Iowa voters officially kick off the 2020 election race. It's Monday. Let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE this Monday morning. Great to be back with you. Great to be back here at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>But I have to tell you, the action is not here. It's all about Asia and what we saw in the overnight in session today, take a look specifically at what we saw in China.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite plunging more than seven and a half percent. That was the worst daily drop in some four and a half years.</p><p>It was the first day of trade, of course, since before the Lunar New Year holiday. So much of that punch that we saw at the Chinese stocks is about playing catch up on the weakness that we saw in the region last week.</p><p>It's just one session, I have to say, but it was less than many have feared, perhaps due to the actions at the Chinese Central Bank. They cut rates and pumped and billions of dollars of cash into the system to calm investors' nerves.</p><p>Elsewhere though in Asia, and this is important, too, I think, things seem to stabilize. The Hong Kong markets actually ended the session in the green and that's how the U.S. session is shaping up right now. Futures are higher taking a cue from a stronger European session, too.</p><p>It does though follow the worst day for U.S. stocks since October. U.S. majors fell one and a half percent plus in Friday's session.</p><p>I'll tell you what. Now, the Dow and the S&amp;P negative on the year. The Dow has fallen three percent from record highs set just a week or so ago only - - three percent. I should perhaps add there.</p><p>What about the 10-year yield as well? A gauge of sentiment at this moment, a little bit firmer today after that felt October lows on Friday, too.</p><p>Wells Fargo warning that yields could fall a further 30 percent if the global health crisis intensifies.</p><p>The coronavirus outbreak is once again our top driver. Let me bring you up to speed with the latest at this moment.</p><p>The Philippines has confirmed the first death outside China this weekend. Right now, more than 17,000 cases and over 360 deaths have been reported worldwide.</p><p>Hong Kong closing all but three border crossings to the Mainland, as I mentioned and China is accusing the United States of overreacting to the outbreak.</p><p>David Culver joins us once again from Beijing. David, great to have you with us. I want to hone in on what the Chinese government have said today about the U.S. reaction, spreading a degree of panic by shipping their nationals out of China and restricting travel.</p><p>And then we've seen other countries follow suit, talk us through what they had to say today.</p><p>DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Oh, Julia, they were furious and the Foreign Ministry coming out through their spokesperson and they held this on an online chat with journalists because they're trying to avoid congregated masses together, and so they don't want to spread the virus even more.</p><p>So even on this online chat, you could feel their fury. I mean, they expressed this in several paragraphs, part of it essentially saying that they believe the U.S. has overreacted here, that they were the first to start this travel restriction against China.</p><p>They were the first to bring out there diplomatic personnel and that they were the first to essentially move forward with these growing concerns that this is larger than it's being portrayed.</p><p>And they say, you know, this is a concern. The coronavirus is an issue here, but they also point to the U.S. and they say, look at the flu and look how many people die and are infected with that each year and this year alone.</p><p>So that's where the Foreign Ministry is coming forward with this, but they also seem to be using this as an opportunity to question the U.S. bringing in their planes to evacuate American citizens. And here's why I say that.</p><p>There was a plane that was scheduled to take American citizens out of the City of Wuhan, and that they would bring them back to the United States. But that was delayed.</p><p>I was talking to some of those Americans who said we don't know what happened, we're just told it got pushed back.</p><p>That seemed to coincide with the Foreign Ministry issuing these very harsh remarks against the U.S., and one thing the Foreign Ministry pointed out when we asked them if this was punishment for the U.S.'s actions, they said no comment on that.</p><p>But they did point out that Wuhan's Airport only has a certain amount of capacity, and that they need to make capacity for aircraft that had medical supplies.</p><p>What are they implying there? Well Julia, if you look at other nations that have evacuated their citizens -- South Korea, Japan -- they have brought in planes of supplies, so as to help out with the dire need here.</p><p>It seems to suggest that the U.S. should be doing the same if they're going to be landing aircrafts in Wuhan, and the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that they would consider doing that -- Julia.</p><p>[09:05:21]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, that's a quite stark comparison, isn't it, between the two nations here. I just wonder, I mean, if we go back to last week, the World Health Organization deciding not to suggest/recommend restrictions to trade and travel here, it meant that countries like the United States and others had to act unilaterally.</p><p>You have to make a choice whether you do what your nationals are perhaps asking and that is, please get me out of here. It's a tough balancing act.</p><p>But to your point, premium medication and support is helpful.</p><p>CULVER: Yes, no question, Julia, and you're right. They feel the pressure from the U.S. side of things. It wasn't only the citizens who are raising pressure there, but you could look at certain unions.</p><p>I mean, you have the airline union there with flight attendants and pilots likewise saying, hey, we're concerned about going to and from Mainland China. So that's something they had to face.</p><p>And then other countries were also moving forward with certain restrictions that weren't as widespread, I would say, as the U.S.'s travel restriction, but still, they were suggesting that, for example, in Singapore, if you were a student or a staff member at a school, and this was early on, they said, if you had gone anywhere in Mainland China, you couldn't come into a school for 14 days.</p><p>So it just seemed that the U.S. came in with this oversleeping kind of travel restriction all together that really has angered the Chinese Foreign Ministry.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. And clearly a very delicate moment politically between the two nations already. David Culver there in Beijing for us. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. I want to move on and talk about the market reaction. $445 billion worth of market value wiped from Chinese markets in the session this Monday. The first trading day of course, since the Lunar New Year holiday.</p><p>John Defterios has been watching all the action for us, not to take any attention away, John, of course from the people that are infected ill here, but wow, what a reaction from the markets and currency weakness. It was cross asset reaction here in the Chinese markets.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Yes. In almost a whiff of desperation, I would say by the Central Bank of China, Julia, coming out with a very bold statement saying we're going to put liquidity of $173 billion, and then the other signal was, we're going to keep interest rates low.</p><p>And even the criticism of the United States here showing the fact that China is a little bit more vulnerable now than it was during the SARS crisis of 2002 and 2003. What a market route as you were suggesting here, a nearly half a trillion dollars if you take the combined indices of Shanghai and Shenzhen, a loss of an average of eight percent.</p><p>If you're looking for a silver lining, it was the fact that the Nikkei wasn't down sharply. Hong Kong actually went up after the route that we saw last week.</p><p>But I think -- and we had this conversation last Thursday in London -- we have to think in a larger context of the influence of China. Everybody is looking at the supply chains within the country and Hubei Province where Wuhan is based.</p><p>Right now, yes, it's clogging up the system, no doubt about it. But number two, this is an economy that ranked at $13 trillion at the end of 2018. We're looking for it in the final numbers, but the next seven economies in Asia add up to $12 trillion.</p><p>So I'm looking at a much bigger influence of what's going to happen in China going forward, overseeing the early expectations of a drop of two percentage points in terms of their growth, but coming from a very low level of six percent, which is the worst in nearly three decades for China.</p><p>So there's more trouble ahead, and it's going to filter out into other economies in that region.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and assuming you believe the numbers, I mean, when we're talking about, a full handle here for Chinese growth, it's in comparison to a country like the United States, perhaps zero to negative just on a relative basis.</p><p>But I do want to hone in on that and the reaction that we've seen in the oil markets because clearly, oil investors are suggesting that the economic fallout here perhaps could be really significant.</p><p>There's now rumors and you were talking about this when we were in Davos two weeks ago, the prospect perhaps of OPEC coming together here and OPEC Plus and deciding to do something to shore up support for these oil prices. What are your thoughts here, John?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Well, the narrative is changing rapidly because the sources I was speaking to just a week ago, Julia said they didn't want to show any signs of panic whatsoever.</p><p>But this is China, the vacuum cleaner if you will, of the world. It Hoover's up all kinds of commodities -- oil, iron ore, the grains -- but we're seeing the sharpest response when it comes to oil right now.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is the exporter to the world, two million of the seven million that it exports goes to China. So we're hearing reports that the new Minister of Energy, Abdulaziz Bin Salman wants to call an emergency meeting and be bold about it and say let's cut another million barrels a day.</p><p>But that would take the OPEC Plus agreement, Julia, listen to this to 2.7. The other option is to go to half a million barrels a day and send a signal to the market that we're ready to do more. I don't think that would move the needle on prices.</p><p>So they're almost backed into a corner here now to act and act swiftly. They have a technical committee meeting in Vienna, so we'll start getting some indications either tomorrow or the day after.</p><p>[09:10:21]</p><p>DEFTERIOS: But the Russians were not on board with us. They kind of reluctantly in December, when I saw the Minister in Vienna said, we'll go along with the deeper cuts, but they were hoping for some easing of this measure in the first half of 2020.</p><p>So I don't see them rushing to take a million barrels a day off the market. They don't know if this drop that we see which is three million barrels a day already in China is going to last into the second quarter or not.</p><p>So they don't want to be giving a knee jerk reaction and then having to respond right away and put oil back on the market.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, creating some of the volatility that they're trying to avoid here. So much uncertainty.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Indeed.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: John Defterios, thank you so much for that update there.</p><p>To Macau now, I mentioned that Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam suspending ferries to Macau. Ivan Watson has been looking at the fallout. Listen in.</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Julia, Macau is arguably the world's gambling capital, but the coronavirus crisis has really put the administrators of this city in a real dilemma, because their economy relies on millions of Mainland Chinese tourists coming across the internal boundary to this semi-autonomous corner of China to come and spend money in its casinos, and in its hotels.</p><p>But now the city's government, they're trying to find a way to stop the flow of those people without completely killing the economy because they don't want the deadly virus to take root in this former Portuguese colony.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WATSON (voice over): This is what the coronavirus crisis looks like. An ambulance delivers a patient to the emergency room in the tiny former Portuguese colony of Macau. Health workers fully protected against the new disease.</p><p>WATSON (on camera): The authorities in Macau aren't taking any chances. They are informing the public that if you suspect you have symptoms of coronavirus and that you've been in touch with somebody that you fear may also be sick somewhere in Mainland China, call for an ambulance, which will deliver you here to the emergency entrance of the city's main public hospital.</p><p>WATSON (voice over): Images from inside the isolation ward, at least seven patients are being treated here.</p><p>The health emergency has had a startling impact on this semi-autonomous corner of China. Macau with its small population of around 600,000 people is normally a major tourism hotspot, welcoming nearly 40 million visitors last year alone.</p><p>The main draw, Macau's towering casinos. This is the gambling capital of the world with the casino industry that dwarfs Las Vegas.</p><p>But since the coronavirus outbreak, tourism to Macau dropped 87 percent in January, compared to the previous year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATSON (on camera): You've never seen it this empty before?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I never.</p><p>ALBANO MARTINS, ECONOMIST: I never saw something like this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATSON (voice over): Albano Martins is a Portuguese economist long based in Macau.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARTINS: You go to the streets, I never saw streets empty. You go to the main square, totally empty. I never saw this in my life and I am here from 1981, so too long. Never.</p><p>I think people are scared, maybe scared because of the speed of these infections.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATSON (voice over): The Macau authorities say they have been rounding up every visitor from the Chinese province of Hubei, the origin of the coronavirus. Those people get a choice, either leave the territory or go into quarantine.</p><p>But they're drawing a line when it comes to the critical engine of the city's economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATSON (on camera): Could one of your health measures be to close the casinos?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATSON (voice over): We do not rule out this possibility, the city's Economy Secretary tells me, but at this point in time, the casinos in Macau are totally safe.</p><p>For now Macau's glittering gambling houses are still open. But like the rest of China, this city is struggling with a new virus, and everyone here agrees, this is just the beginning of the crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WATSON (on camera): So Julia, what a drastic measure the city's officials took sending the police around to dozens of hotels here and rounding up every person they could find from Mainland China's Hubei Province.</p><p>Now on top of that, the President of a casino workers union has argued publicly that all of the city's casinos and hotels should be close to protect the people who work there, but of course the city's administrators, they're not ready to take that dramatic step yet.</p><p>I walked through one of these huge casinos, the Galaxy Casino, which feels like it's longer than a football field in length, and that was a surreal sight because you couldn't see a single exposed face there.</p><p>All the workers, the waitresses, bartenders, card dealers, security officers all had masks on, and these relatively small number of customers there, were wearing them as well.</p><p>The only time anybody exposes their faces is when they're going through security to get into the casino. And that's when you have to show your face to a thermal camera to ensure that you don't have a fever -- Julia.</p><p>[09:15:52]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Ivan Watson there in Macau. All right, let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we are following around the world.</p><p>In Washington, the U.S. Senate will reconvene in the coming hours for closing arguments in the impeachment trial against President Donald Trump.</p><p>This comes after Senate Republicans blocked Democrats effort to call witnesses last week. The trial is expected to conclude on Wednesday with President Trump's acquittal.</p><p>And the stakes are high in the U.S. state of Iowa as the 2020 presidential nominating contest kicks off with the State's first in the nation caucuses.</p><p>Eleven Democratic candidates are currently running in the race for the White House and Jeff Zeleny is live in Des Moines for us. Jeff, great to have you with us.</p><p>If you're in the United States, you can't get away from this and you probably know what's going on, but for international viewers, why does Iowa matter so much and tell us what to expect?</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Julia, Iowa matters because it's the beginning of this long process to pick a Democratic presidential nominee to challenge President Trump.</p><p>Iowa has been one of the first stops for really several decades onto New Hampshire next week and then other states.</p><p>So it matters because it is first. It doesn't matter because it's more important than other states. But there's no question, all of the candidates have been spending most of the year here, investing millions and millions to get their message out.</p><p>It is the place that launched Barack Obama back in 2008. It is the place that launched George W. Bush back in 2000. President Trump -- Donald Trump narrowly lost Iowa, but it showed that he was a serious candidate.</p><p>So this is a place where voters have taken a strong measure of these candidates for the last year, asking them questions or seeing how it's going, so that's why this is important.</p><p>So this will not determine who the Democratic nominee is, but it will determine what voters are thinking as they move forward.</p><p>And Bernie Sanders is ending this in a strong position. So all eyes are on Bernie Sanders. If this is the moment for him, a lot of certainly high stakes for Joe Biden, the former Vice President here who has been campaigning aggressively.</p><p>This is the third time he is running for President. His hopes have always been dashed here in Iowa. We'll see if they are tonight. But of course, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and the other candidates as well, so this is the place that can make or break a candidacy before this show moves on to New Hampshire next week -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, what a show. Jeff Zeleny, great to have you with us. Thank you so much for explaining that there.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE.</p><p>But coming up, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd joins us. He gives his views on the coronavirus outbreak, the reaction from nations and of course, the bush fires in Australia. Stay with CNN.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE live and from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange where U.S. stocks look set to bounce back from Friday's losses. The big theme of course, too, what we saw -- losses in China overnight.</p><p>I want to talk this through, Solita Marcelli is Deputy Chief Investment Officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management and joins us now. Great to have you here.</p><p>SOLITA MARCELLI, DEPUTY CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER FOR THE AMERICAS, UBS GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Thank you. Great to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Happy Super Bowl Monday. One of your big themes for 2020 was the re-emergence or the emergence of emerging markets. Explain why and then we're going to talk about whether anything has changed in light of current events.</p><p>MARCELLI: Sure. So there are two main reasons why we believe emerging markets were going to be emerging. And by the way, putting aside, you know, barring aside the delay that might come from the spread of the coronavirus, we still feel confident that this might actually get realized this year.</p><p>So the first reason is around growth, right? We believe emerging markets provide better growth prospects competitive to developed markets, that the difference between growth differential will widen this year. And the second reason is valuations.</p><p>So on growth, two reasons for that. One is the benefits of the Phase 1 deal signing is going to accrue we think more to emerging markets. And the second is that accommodative Central Bank policy. The Fed's cut last year, started a chain reaction of global monetary easing.</p><p>And even though Central Banks are still -- developed markets Central Banks have paused for the time being, but emerging markets are still continuing.</p><p>And in terms of valuation, the second reason there is right now, emerging markets are trading at a historically cheaper levels than developed markets and we think there's going to be a catch up there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So growth outperformance in emerging markets versus developed markets and valuation just relatively cheaper. Okay.</p><p>And by emerging markets in particular, you were talking Asia, you were talking Japan or Asia not just Japan, let's be clear.</p><p>MARCELLI: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Okay, so now talk coronavirus and what you're thinking is here.</p><p>MARCELLI: Look, you know, the spread of the coronavirus at its core is a human tragedy with an unknown outcome, right?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Agree.</p><p>MARCELLI: It's impossible to predict that right now with hundred percent certainty how this is going to evolve, and markets hate uncertainty. We have that in spates right now resulting in this increased volatility and selloff in markets.</p><p>That said, we are encouraged by the extraordinary measures China has taken, coupled with unprecedented global mobilization to contain this virus, and we think eventually, it will prove to be effective.</p><p>So it will certainly have a negative impact on growth in the near term, but we think the impact on the long term economic growth should be limited.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, there were a couple of things that you mentioned that actually stood out for me, it's tough to gauge what the economic impact is going to be.</p><p>One, because of spread of misinformation, because of the prevalence of social media particularly compared to SARS.</p><p>But also if you look on a relative basis, the growth of e-commerce in China and Southeast Asia in particular actually provides a kicker to consumption there that perhaps wasn't there in, you know, decades past.</p><p>MARCELLI: Yes, exactly. I mean, the three structural changes, two of which you mentioned, the online spending is actually -- it could limit consumer damage there, but the spread of fear through social media is very important and fear really drives economic behavior as well.</p><p>And the third thing I would say is the rise of China's role in global manufacturers.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, far bigger.</p><p>MARCELLI: So that will actually be a reason for supply chain disruptions more than we expected.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But what you're ultimately saying is it's a delay not a derailment of your call.</p><p>[09:25:31]</p><p>MARCELLI: Exactly. It's a delay, not a derailment. We think with a successful containment, we think the growth is going to pick up in the latter quarters.</p><p>I think China is certainly going to be impacted this quarter, maybe into next quarter. But with a successful containment, we could see growth pick up in the latter quarters because there's pent up consumer demand, but also there's potential government stimulus.</p><p>I mean, China is doing all it can, going all in to make sure that they're most likely going to be stabilizing the economy and making sure the market is orderly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, we saw that already overnight and all Central Banks, I think around the world on the front foot here to react if necessary.</p><p>Great to have you with us. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>MARCELLI: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Solita Marcelli there, Deputy Chief Investment Officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.</p><p>We are counting down to the market open this morning. Let me give you a quick look at the futures. We're expected to see gains taking back some of the losses that we saw in Friday's session where we lost more than one and a half percent across these U.S. majors.</p><p>We've got the S&amp;P 500 what? Some three percent off recent record highs, too. So a bit of a pull back, but on a relative basis as the market is pretty resilient in the face of great global uncertainty.</p><p>Plenty more to come from FIRST MOVE. You're with CNN. Stay with us. The market open is next.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. That was the opening bell here at the New York Stock Exchange, and as we were discussing earlier, we do have a higher start to the trading week and the fresh new month, of course, too.</p><p>First trading day of February. Tech stocks, as you can see, are the best gainers in early trading after the one and a half percent drop that we saw on Friday. I showed you that in reverse order, so apologies, if I confuse you.</p><p>This follows though a weaker session in China. Overnight, the Shanghai Composite finishing the session as you can see down some 7.7 percent on the first day of trading since the Lunar New Year holiday, a bit of catch up there I think, pent up selling pressure. More than $400 billion in market value was lost in today's session alone in China.</p><p>We'll see what Tuesday's session brings, but beyond the persistent coronavirus fears, important U.S. factory data is out at the top of the hour here in the United States.</p><p>We've also got jobs numbers on Friday, too, and plenty more earnings. More than 70 percent of S&amp;P 500 firms have beaten profit estimates so far, just to give you a sense of what we've seen so far.</p><p>Let's take you through the Global Movers today, too. Investors are closely watching airline stocks like Delta and American today. Shares of both carriers are higher after falling some two percent plus on Friday. Delta, American and United have all announced that they are suspending flights to and from China.</p><p>Apple shares are also in focus today, down some two percent, shutting down all of their stores in Mainland China until February 9th due to the coronavirus outbreak. Shares fell more than four percent on Friday.</p><p>Shares of Exxon Mobil also lower today trading near nine-year lows in fact. Goldman Sachs downgrading the stock to a sell today, citing the weak outlook for oil prices. Exxon giant reported weaker than expected Q4 earnings on Friday.</p><p>All right, let's bring it back to the United States. The U.S. state of Iowa is holding the first in the nation caucuses in the coming hours.</p><p>According to recent polls, the top tier candidates are Senator Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg.</p><p>Senator Sanders and Warren have proposed big Federal spending plans with new taxes on wealthy Americans. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is skipping today's caucuses, but announced his own plans.</p><p>In fact over the weekend, investors are keeping a close eye on Iowa. In seven of the last nine Democratic primaries, the Iowa winner went on to become the party's presidential nominee.</p><p>Financial forecaster and futurist, Jason Schenker joins us now. He is President of Prestige Economics. Jason, great to have you on the show. Do you agree with that? How closely are investors watching the outcome here, particularly if we see strong gains or wins for the likes of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren?</p><p>JASON SCHENKER, PRESIDENT, PRESTIGE ECONOMICS: Well, I think that's what investors are looking for. There are a number of Democratic candidates out there, but there's a couple that investors are a bit worried about from a tax implication standpoint. It is Sanders and Warren.</p><p>If they do well here, then that could rile the markets a little bit, because there's never been a case where you've had a winner here or in the top three that didn't get the nomination.</p><p>So if they even place in the top three - that increases the odds that they would get that nomination, and as you've already noted, really, if we look at the last 10 times, the person who won the Iowa caucus eventually does get the nomination.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The Democrats handled this very differently from the Republicans here. If we're looking ahead to 2020, how much does incumbency matter here, when we look at President Trump? How important is that for who ultimately wins an election?</p><p>SCHENKER: Well, Julia, the thing is, this is the number one, statistically most significant factor that determines whether you become President, whether you get elected President, is if you already are President, and so that incumbency, it matters a whole lot because you can get eyes on screens, you're not competing against a lot of candidates. You're not spending a lot of money in the primaries.</p><p>And as the President, you have the ability to really direct the media to show up when you're making announcements. It's a little bit tougher as a candidate to get as much attention especially if there's still a wide field of folks competing and that's why most of the time, incumbents get reelected.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, because we'll talk endlessly about Iowa then move on to some of the other primaries, but you also talked about the shy votes, the shy vote for Donald Trump here that was so impactful in the 2016 elections. What's your gauge on what that shy Donald Trump vote is today? Is it higher or is it lower or about the same than it was in 2016, particularly in light of what we've just been through with the impeachment process, too?</p><p>[09:35:16]</p><p>SCHENKER: Well, I think there's a couple of really big takeaways and one is that donations, money fundraising, what always was the proxy for if you win, it doesn't really work anymore, because in 2016, Hillary Clinton spent almost 50 percent more money than Donald Trump and Donald Trump still won.</p><p>The polls really discounted what the shy Trumpers -- folks who would vote for Trump who didn't want to say they would -- and I would wager now the economy is quite good. Equity markets, despite recent pullbacks or high unemployment at the lowest level in 50 years.</p><p>There might be quite a few shy Trumpers out there and that might make polls a bit foggy in terms of what we might expect.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Money doesn't matter as much as it has in the past, even when you've got someone like a Mike Bloomberg here literally throwing as much money as he chooses at the campaign.</p><p>SCHENKER: Well, on the Democratic side, you've never had someone who didn't place in the first three named candidates who went on to get the nomination. The fact that Mike Bloomberg is skipping the Iowa caucus means you'd have to have a real first in order for that to happen.</p><p>But you might see a real protracted slug between the different Democratic candidates. You see the poll numbers, a lot of them are quite close here in terms of how you see Sanders performing or Biden performing or Warren performing, and I know we didn't get a recent Iowa poll.</p><p>But the Texas Lyceum did a poll in Texas, for example, and we saw Biden had the lead, but Sanders was pretty close behind. We see that in a lot of different polls and that means that you could see a pretty protracted slug to get to a Democratic nominee and that means Mike Bloomberg might have a shot to skip the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary and then come in and still get the nomination. It's still a possibility, but it would really be a first.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, I love your adherence to data points in it for all the books that you've written, and actually, I love the latest on \"The Dumpster Fire Election,\" talking about 2020. You point out the importance of the economy, and that the data point that connects the four Presidents in the last century that haven't won reelection is a higher unemployment rate between the midterms and then going for reelection in that two years later.</p><p>Jason, talk to me about coronavirus and the impact that that potentially might have on the economy, and then the impact perhaps, that that could have if we've got a GDP figure for the United States on a one handle in the first quarter. It's not the three percent that Trump promised.</p><p>SCHENKER: Well, you know, I think the U.S. economy is still doing pretty good if we look at the U.S. economy compared to other advanced economies, the U.S. is doing well.</p><p>The Q4 number came in at 2.1 percent, a little bit better than expected. The business investment recession is likely to end. There's been three consecutive quarters of contractions in U.S. business investment, likely to end, likely to see positive business investment in the year ahead. That's all good.</p><p>The coronavirus thus, at risk. I think that's more maybe on a global basis, but we do have things -- earlier, you had a guest talking about things like e-commerce and the like that could have a positive impact for what we've seen in consumers where there's sort of this assessed risk.</p><p>So I still think we're going to see a decent GDP number this year, between the one and a half and two and a half percent number, probably a little bit above two.</p><p>It's going to be a pretty good year. The unemployment rate still likely to remain low and if the unemployment rate is lower at the time of the October number, which gets released at the beginning of November, if that October unemployment number is lower than the 3.7 percent we saw in November of 2018 by the last century of data, we would expect that President Trump would be reelected, but if it's higher --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow.</p><p>SCHENKER: We would know.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All bets are off. Jason Schenker, President of Prestige Economics. Great to have you with us and we will get you back soon.</p><p>Up next, China lashes out at the U.S. over Washington's reaction to the coronavirus crisis. But what is the right response in this scenario? We'll discuss that with former Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd. He's up next.</p><p>[09:42:33]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show. China has accused the United States of creating fear and panic over the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>The U.S. has imposed strict travel restrictions beyond those advised by the World Health Organization. Washington has also evacuated much of its embassy staff from China.</p><p>Joining us, Kevin Rudd, the former Australian Prime Minister, and now the President of the Asia Society. Fantastic to have you on the show.</p><p>KEVIN RUDD, FORMER AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER: Good to be back.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What do you make of the Chinese accusations of an overreaction from the United States?</p><p>RUDD: I think the first thing we need to understand is the Chinese domestically are under huge political pressure.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>RUDD: I mean, if you're President Xi Jinping at the moment, and you've got this virus, which is being rampaging around Wuhan, then across the broader province of Hubei, and then into Hunan and then the now infections at every single province of the country, you've got a political problem domestically.</p><p>So therefore, what you're looking at domestically is maximizing international support, and the World Health Organization is the primary means for doing that.</p><p>But if in the midst of all of that, I think if you have statements like Secretary of State Pompeo's that the world's greatest threat in the 21st Century is the Chinese Communist Party, personally, I just think that's pretty tone deaf in the midst of a world public health crisis.</p><p>The Secretary of State could make those statements anytime he wants, not just now, I think that gets a big bucket of fuel, says there's a fire there and goes woof, and I'm not sure that's all that smart.</p><p>Let's deal with the health crisis first and that requires all hands to the pump.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, we had a conference call between the G-7 nations today, does a more coordinated response -- is a more coordinated response here needed? Because if the World Health Organization last week would have said, look, we do recommend travel restrictions. We do recommend trade restrictions, then countries wouldn't have had to act unilaterally and make decisions independently here.</p><p>RUDD: Well, institutionally, the World Health Organization is a relatively weak global body.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>RUDD: We know that not because of its leadership. Tedros from Ethiopia, I know very well. He's a strong individual. He understands public health intimately. So this is no criticism of him at all.</p><p>But he leads an institution which constitutionally is weak, given the structures and we saw that evidence through its handling of the Ebola crisis some time ago. So that's one point.</p><p>However, underneath that or surrounding that, we need to use other collaborative mechanisms. Though the G-7 Health Ministers are talking, but can I just suggest this?</p><p>[09:45:10]</p><p>RUDD: The G-20 exists for a purpose as well. It's 20 of the world's largest economies. It represents 90 percent of GDP. The G-7 does not include China, the G-20 does.</p><p>Now, I would have thought that's not a bad way to actually prosecute this at a political public policy and public health and security way while being mindful also where it's kind of bounced to, as far as economic consequences.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's fascinating to go back to your point about pouring lighter fuel on the fire here and the relationship between U.S. and China, an incredibly pivotal moment.</p><p>You've just put together a series of speeches that you gave in the past year, the title, \"The Avoidable War: Reflections on U.S.-China Relations, the End of Strategic Engagement.\"</p><p>One of the themes that comes off is the idea of a decoupling here and I pulled out one quote, \"Prepare for a decade of living dangerously.\"</p><p>Never mind the decade, what about the next year heading into the 2020 elections? How do you see this playing out? Even in light of the last couple of weeks of events, tensions are still fraught.</p><p>RUDD: You know, they are raw. There's two factors at work here, I think. One is structural. You have this massive country, the United States of America, we're in the New York Stock Exchange at the moment. It's the world's largest economy, it's going to remain that way for a while to come.</p><p>But now, we have structurally a huge challenger, which is the Chinese economy. If you do any analysis, so aggregate economic size, aggregate military size, these two countries are getting closer in terms of a comparison of their net power.</p><p>We haven't had that since the days of the Soviet Union, and even then, we didn't have it because the Soviets never had a global economy. That's a structural factor.</p><p>Underneath it however, you have also a new strong assertive leader in China, Xi Jinping who is pushing out in a way in which his predecessors never did. And now we have the Trump administration, which has drawn the lines on trade, open question mark about where we will now go on the rest of the U.S.-China relationship.</p><p>So when I say a year of living dangerously, I look at those structural factors. I look at the personalities of leadership. Then I look at incendiary things like we've just been discussing.</p><p>And goodness knows what happens as the decade progresses on the future of Taiwan. That to me is the continuing looming geopolitical problem.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: There's so much to discuss. We could continue that conversation, but I do want to get your views on the Australian bushfires because you have everybody -- it's something that you've been passionately talking about for a decade.</p><p>You've criticized the Australian government for their response. But it's far more broad than that. Again, it's a global issue where I think particularly in the last few weeks coming back from Davos myself, suddenly the whole world seems to be focused on climate change. What more from a national perspective, but also globally again do you want to see here?</p><p>RUDD: I think what the world saw and I think many Australians saw with the bush fires this Australian summer, northern window, was an unfolding apocalypse.</p><p>I call it the greatest trade inferno, because this is not just bushfires.</p><p>As a kid growing up, I grew up in a farm, I remember what fires were like. You have a big one every several years in one part of the country or another. This is across four states, simultaneously hundreds of fires. So what is it saying?</p><p>I think Australia is the first canary down the climate change mineshaft, and we need to understand that where we go as a country is a warning light, and if you like a beacon light to the rest of the world that climate change is not this esoteric, exotic thing to be discussed in political and scientific circles. It is a real unfolding economic and humanitarian and ecological disaster, which we can stop with effective political leadership.</p><p>It just takes us to bring down greenhouse gas emissions, and we keep temperature increases within 1.5 degrees centigrade.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Which we tried with the Paris Agreement.</p><p>RUDD: With Paris, which is the best one-third committed. We tried at Copenhagen, partly failed. National actions -- some of the actions we took in Australia in my government have continued, others have been repealed by the conservatives.</p><p>But leaving politics to one side, for God's sake, I think Greta is right, and she is just letting out this how to the world, and a part of my kid's generation is saying, for God's sake --</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Act.</p><p>RUDD: Get with the project and you know, something, it's doable. It's not beyond the realms of doability.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So much more to discuss, but no time. Sir, fantastic to have you on the show.</p><p>RUDD: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Kevin Rudd, former Australian Prime Minister and the President of the Asia Society Policy Institute. Thank you for that.</p><p>All right, rounding off big tech's strong earnings now. Big expectations ahead of Alphabet's numbers. We will discuss, next.</p><p>[09:52:02]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE with a look at today's Boardroom Brief. Shares of Ingenico soaring in France after payments giant, Worldline agreed to buy the company for $8.6 billion.</p><p>The deal will create the world's fourth largest payments provider. Worldline stock which also trades in Paris slightly lower in the session as you would anticipate for a buy here.</p><p>And shares of RyanAir are up in Ireland after the company reported a $98 million profits for its third quarter. That compares with a loss of $73 million a year earlier.</p><p>Europe's largest budget airlines said it raised average fares by nine percent from a year ago.</p><p>Bernie Ebbers, the former CEO of telecoms company, Worldcom has died. Ebbers was jailed in 2006 for his role in an accounting fraud worth $11 billion. He was released from prison last month due to poor health after serving 13 years. Ebbers was 78 years old.</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet to report its latest results after the closing bell. Clare Sebastian joins us now for a preview.</p><p>Of course, it's the first numbers that we've had since the Google CEO took over the full company here. Real expectations for more information, more clarity it seems. The question is, will we get it, Clare?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is a big question. A lot of analysts have been calling for more transparency really, from Google, when it comes to their earnings reports more information on how their YouTube segment is growing, how their Cloud segment is growing.</p><p>They don't really get much in the way of guidance, and perhaps they'll be looking for more in terms of that. But Cloud is really a big area for Google. They are fighting to take on the giants in this area, Amazon and Microsoft.</p><p>They're investing heavily to do that. They have been growing in terms of market share, so there will be a lot of scrutiny on how they're doing that.</p><p>And the other issue, Julia is regulatory issues. Facebook, the other competitor in terms of online advertising said that the headwinds from global privacy regulations will continue to impact their ability to make money through online advertising.</p><p>So it seems that Google will likely be hit by those headwinds, as well, and then, of course, the investigations into antitrust issues here in the U.S. There was a report about a week ago that state attorneys general had met with the Department of Justice signaling some potential coordination between the two when it comes to antitrust investigations into Google. So all of that is likely to come up on the call.</p><p>But meanwhile, Google had a couple of misses last year in terms of profit and revenue. So there will be a lot of scrutiny on those results. Can they continue to see revenue growth around the 20 percent mark? And will they see profits come back after a miss in the last quarter?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I remember interviewing Eric Schmidt a long time ago when he was still the Chairman. And he said, look, advertising revenues are always going to be the bulk of our revenues, of our profit generation for this company.</p><p>But the other interesting thing for me is what we get in terms of their other bets, the non-core items because I've seen a number of analysts looking at this and saying, actually, if they broke this down and told us what was going on that might help their overall valuation. What do we think of that?</p><p>[09:55:07]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Especially since the other bets are losing quite a lot of money, Julia. It's still a rather small part of the business, but in the last quarter, they lost six times more money than they actually made in the other bet segment.</p><p>These are things like self-driving cars, like drone deliveries, all of that. So I think there will be some scrutiny on that and not least, because if you look at this sort of one trillion club, as we call it, to the likes of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, we include because they tipped over that valuation mark a couple of weeks ago. They are all looking for the next product.</p><p>They're all still growing revenue. You know, just slowing down in a lot of cases, but they have to look for, in Google's case, the next billion user, and in all of their cases, the next big product to drive that next real sort of growth push.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, other bets, some I find exciting. Thanks, Clare. That's it for the show. I'm Julia Chatterley. You've been watching FIRST MOVE, time to go make yours. I'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020020301cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4H-6P81-JB20-G14F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7719\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

During the recent Tortoise Global AI Summit[1], panelists weighed the dynamics of an increasingly fraught relationship between two countries that are intent on wielding economic influence around the world. That competition had already shown signs of bitterness even before the trade war launched in recent years by President Trump[2]. While this competition extends across a wide range of technologies, the panelists agreed that AI is increasingly a focal[3] point thanks to the essential role many predict it will play in the coming decades. Not only is the race for AI supremacy pitting China against the U.S., but it is forcing every other region to reassess how they fit into this technological duel between superpowers. </p><p>'We're seeing a technology competition in the context of a worsening relationship between the world's two great powers,' said John Sawers, former head of the U.K.'s MI6 spy agency. 'These two countries have roughly equal-sized economies and they are using their economic platform as a vehicle for projecting power for their influence on controlling the world. AI is a central feature in that wider technology race.'VB Transform 2020 Online[4] - July 15-17. Join leading AI executives: Register for the free livestream[5]. Joining Sawers on a panel was Nigel Toon, CEO of Graphcore, and Sana Khareghani, head of U.K. government's Office for AI. 'I think when it comes to China and the US, they're putting AI in the center of a confrontation they've had for a very long time,' Khareghani said. 'It's an economic race to be the leader and technology had been kind of thrown in there.' While the panelists discussed the conventional wisdom that AI efforts in the U.S. are led by companies and China it is driven by government policy, Toon pushed back against that view. He acknowledged a greater government role in China, but he said much of the AI development is being pushed by tech giants such as Alibaba or Huawei who have the same motivations as Google or Facebook: maintaining their competitive edge. Such companies seem unbeatable today from the outside, he said. But inside they are driven by the same fear that someone outside will displace them by creating products driven by superior AI. 'If you look at this from the perspective of some of the big tech companies, AI is existential,' Toon said. 'If somebody else develops leading edge AI quicker than Googlethat's what Google is worried about. That's why they're investing fortunes into this. That's why Facebook is investing fortunes in this. That's why Google buys Deep Mind[6], because it's just existential to these massive companies. Same for Alibaba. Same for Tencent.' The main difference in China, Toon added, is that the government has a much closer and cooperative relationship with its tech companies. In addition, China has an advantage in terms of its policies and culture around privacy and data. 'There are no restraints on their collection and use of data,' Sawers said. 'In the West, we pride ourselves on individual privacy as being part of the free societyChina has set up a surveillance system inside their major cities which is so powerful, it's the sort of control mechanism Joseph Stalin would have died for because it is very, very extensive. That does give them an advantage in this area because AI and machine learning rely very heavily on the mass collection of data and being able to crunch that data and manipulate that data.' This picture of a two-way race inevitably led to the question of where and how Europe fits into the picture. The European Union has, in recent years, also made AI development a political and economic priority[7]. The region is investing large sums into research and startups, but also trying to carve out a distinct identity by taking a more ethical approach to AI than the U.S. or China. Khareghani said that numbers such as venture capital that show the U.S. and China with big leads tend to underestimate the strength of Europe. 'I think it's worth considering that the U.S. and China are leading in a specific way in terms of how much investment they're putting in to into AI,' she said. 'But in terms of focus, dedication, and thought leadership, the U.K. is up there along with the other countries like Canada, Germany, and France. So I do think that there is more than just funding criteria that should go into that.' Still, Europe does have some severe limitations. Toon noted, for instance, that while Europe has made impressive strides in many areas related to deep tech, it also remains heavily dependent on other regions for many of the basic computing components needed to develop advanced computing. 'There are very limited supplies for some of the core underlying technology,' Toon said. 'Take semiconductors. There are three companies on the planet that can build at the very leading edge of semiconductors. We work with TSMC[8], who is based in Taiwan. Then there is Samsung in Korea and Intel in the U.S. I think it's unbelievable, or impossible to think that we in Europe could develop these leading-edge semiconductor technologies.' So how should Europe respond? Toon worries that growing regulations around data and AI use, while intended to promote trust and confidence, could backfire by tying the hands of the region's companies. 'We need to be careful that we don't put in place some policy that actually causes Europe not to be able to compete because we can't get access to some of these leading-edge technologies,' Toon said. Until now, Europe has been trying to leverage its status by also working with both the U.S. and China. But recent events have made that increasingly difficult. And as the U.S. and China increasingly create trade barriers and try to assert their technology independence from each other, that is going to require Europe to rethink its relationship to both regions. 'I think Europe for a long time felt that somehow it could get the best of both worlds,' Sawers said. 'It could maintain political and defensive alliances with United States, but we could treat China as an equal economic partner. I think one thing that COVID has done is really taken the scales from the eyes of many Europeans about the nature of this Chinese regimeThe Chinese have become much more assertive. We're seeing what China is doing in Hong Kong in the South China Sea. And we see what it's doing in the cybersecurity domain. We're seeing how much more repressive China is.'

The country reached Google's maximum value of search interest at a query popularity rate of 100 for Libra[1] over the last month, according to Thursday data from Google Trends[2]. The cryptosystem, which is expected to launch by next year, will allow Facebook users to send money to their contacts \u2014 even those who live in different countries[3]\u2014 in just seconds through a regulated subsidiary called Calibra.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) The search results come one day after Libra chief David Marcus attended a four-hour congressional hearing in Washington, D.C., Wednesday to answer questions about the cryptocurrency system's risks. Marcus said[4] during the hearing that Facebook must attempt to lead the world in blockchain technology[5] because if it fails to do so, systems from foreign countries like China that are 'out of reach of our national security apparatus' will come first.Facebook's head of Calibra David Marcus uses the last resort of monopolist scoundrels, which is national security.

If we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different.' Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg echoed this stance in a 2018 interview with The Recode, saying, 'I think that the alternative [to U.S. tech giants], frankly, is going to be the Chinese companies. There are plenty of other companies out that are willing and able to take the place of the work that we're doing.' Libra[8]'s website defines its technology as 'a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people,' which, when it makes its debut on Facebook, will be backed by federal currencies so its value will not fluctuate any more than the money used today. Countries with the next four highest number of searches were St. Helena at No. 2, Singapore at No. 3, Hong Kong at No. 4 and Luxembourg at No. 5. The United States came in at No. 34 with a query popularity rate of 16. Russia came in last at No. 71.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Ant Financial and Ping An are considering applying for a virtual bank licence in Singapore, having both won a licence in Hong Kong.

Who knew?</emphasis></p><p>The Big Story</p><p>China stands on the brink of a breakthrough in its efforts to become self-sufficient in semiconductors. The country is on track to produce around 5 per cent of the world\u2019s memory chips by the end of 2020 having stood at virtually zero only a few years ago, according to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/China-memory-chip-output-zooms-from-zero-to-5-of-world-total\"> this scoop</url>\u00a0in the Nikkei Asian Review.\u00a0</p><p>Yangtze Memory Technologies Co, which makes NAND flash memory chips, expects to triple production to 60,000 wafers a month from next year at its new $24bn plant in Wuhan. ChangXin Memory Technologies, meanwhile, expects to quadruple production of DRAM chips to 40,000 wafers a month at its $8bn facility in Hefei. Global production of NAND and DRAM chips stands at around 1.3m wafers per month each.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key implications:</emphasis>\u00a0These two chip plants would not be expanding production plans so aggressively if they were not receiving orders from customers, suggesting that the chips they are making are of sufficient quality. Sources said that Yangtze Memory\u2019s NAND flash chips are already seeing orders from flagship companies, such as Lenovo.</p><p>Nevertheless, questions over intellectual property remain. One industry analyst said the next 12 months would be crucial in verifying whether intellectual property has been infringed.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upshot:</emphasis>\u00a0NAND flash chips, which constitute a $56bn-a-year market, and DRAM chips, which make up a $95bn market, are essential memory components used in a range of devices from smartphones and data centre servers to self-driving cars. The two plants mark China\u2019s entry into the manufacture of such chips, laying down a challenge to Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, Micron and Kioxia, formerly known as Toshiba Memory.</p><p>Mercedes\u2019 top 10</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A round-up of the week\u2019s best tech stories from Mercedes Ruehl, the FT\u2019s Asia tech reporter.</emphasis></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Is there a SoftBank-backed tech start-up out there not having problems?

(Pentagon officials were alarmed by the sudden shift in Syria policy, but top officials kept their views private.)</p><p>How we know: The Times obtained a copy of the unclassified memo from someone who said it was important to make Mr. Roebuck\u2019s assessment public.</p><p>Quotable: \u201cOne day when the diplomatic history is written,\u201d Mr. Roebuck wrote, \u201cpeople will wonder what happened here and why officials didn\u2019t do more to stop it.\u201d</p><p>On the ground: Our reporters <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/morning-briefing\">traveled along the only major road that runs the length of northeast Syria</url> to make sense of the new power dynamic taking shape there.

They reasoned that it would be worth the aid and support in peace talks to appear as though they were taking sides, something they would have preferred to avoid. </p><p>But once word of the aid freeze leaked, U.S. lawmakers were furious. Just two days before Mr. Zelensky\u2019s scheduled public statement on CNN, Mr. Trump released the aid, and the Ukrainians canceled Mr. Zelensky\u2019s appearance.</p><p>How we know: We went to Kiev and spoke to government officials, lawmakers and others close to the Zelensky government.

The case, a first in the U.S., underscores Saudi efforts to silence critics both inside the kingdom and abroad, and raises concerns about Big Tech\u2019s security. </p><p>Russia: A recent raid on an illustrious physics institute in Moscow stirred questions about the country\u2019s increasingly aggressive and erratic security apparatus \u2014 and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/morning-briefing\">why it is operating at odds with President Vladimir Putin</url>\u2019s stated policy goals. </p><p>Snapshot: Above, a student picking up her lunch on the U.C.

His success will be hard to repeat</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE most recognisable face of Chinese capitalism belongs to Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, an e-commerce juggernaut matched in size only by Amazon. Mr Ma, who launched Alibaba from a small apartment in Hangzhou in 1999, is an emblem of China's extraordinary economic transformation. This week's announcement that he will step down as the firm's chairman a year from now, to concentrate on philanthropy, was greeted with comparative calm by investors. He stopped being chief executive in 2013; Alibaba's share price has more than doubled since its initial public offering, the world's largest-ever, in 2014 (see \"Corporate leadership in China: Command and control\"). But one question presents itself: could China produce another story to match his? The answer is almost certainly not.</p><p>There are some very good reasons for that. China's own rise is an unrepeatable one. When Mr Ma, then an English-language teacher, launched Alibaba, the country was still gearing up to join the World Trade Organisation. Its GDP per head, in terms of purchasing-power parity, stood at under $3,000; it is now more than six times higher. The internet was still young, too. Less than 1% of Chinese had access to the web back then, compared with some 36% of Americans. As incomes grew and connections proliferated, Mr Ma took full advantage.</p><p>Thousands of small businesses have since flourished on Alibaba's platforms. About 1m merchants trade in its virtual emporiums. Its services have helped push China's economy towards consumption-led growth. Last year it boasted sales of $25bn on Singles' Day, China's equivalent of Black Friday (when Americans spent a measly $5bn). It has transformed logistics and finance, as well as retailing. Last year Alibaba delivered an average of 55m packages a day; its financial offshoot, Ant Financial, accounts for more than half of China's vast mobile-payments market. Its reach is so great that many startups decide to work with Alibaba rather than strike out alone.</p><p>But more has changed than the structure of China's economy and the clout of digital giants like Alibaba. Politics has changed, too. Alibaba thrived partly thanks to Mr Ma's skilful dealings with China's ruling Communist Party, with which he cultivated both closeness and stand-offishness (\"Love them, don't marry them,\" he once said of the government). Under the leadership of President Xi Jinping, however, China's political system has grown hostile to private businesses that become too big or too disruptive. Officials have constrained bosses' freedom to make splashy deals. Bytedance, a brash technology firm set up in 2012, has been reined in, and forced to withdraw one of its apps. Its founder issued a grovelling public apology after being chastised by the government. Ant, meanwhile, has seen its aspirations to compete with state-owned banks held back by regulators (see \"Ant and Tencent: And now for something completely different\").</p><p>China is putting its corporate champions at the service of its ambitions to compete globally in high-tech industries. Alibaba's task is to use artificial intelligence to improve cities. Through state-backed venture-capital funds, the government is pouring money into industries that were once the preserve of the private sector. Rumours occasionally surface that it plans to take stakes and board seats in big tech firms. All this has fed growing international suspicion of China, especially in America. Mr Ma was one of the first out of the blocks to congratulate President Donald Trump on his election victory; this year America prevented Ant's purchase of MoneyGram, a money-transfer firm, on national-security grounds. The reality was always more complicated, but Mr Ma embodies an idea of China as market-driven and open. That idea has faded.</p><h>Jack be nimble</h><p>None of this is to say that enterprise is fizzling in China. Indeed one of Mr Ma's legacies is a shift to a culture that values startups more than ever. His charisma and folksy advice have earned him cult-like status among the country's entrepreneurs. Venture capitalists are lavishing money on hundreds of newcomers, in industries from biotech to electric vehicles. Small private firms will continue to flourish.</p><p>But it is harder to be as disruptive today as Mr Ma was 20 years ago. That is partly because his own creation is so dominant. Increasingly, however, the greatest obstacle to disruption is China's rulers. The party is intent on having a say much earlier in the development of industries that it considers important. As a result, China is unlikely to see new business leaders with the boldness and brio to match Mr Ma.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20180915t1620000018xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T88-MMM1-JCDS-312S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2018 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

They don't want to risk being shut down.\"</p><p>The fines were handed out amid reports China's government is also moving to block the WhatsApp messaging service, which uses an encryption technology. While it is still possible to use the app, some people have had trouble sending video or voice messages. This was the last Facebook product available on mainland China with its main social media platform and image sharing app, Instagram, officially blocked. The New York Times reported that China's censors may have developed specialised software to interfere with WhatsApp text messages.</p><p>These are just the latest moves by Chinese authorities to tighten control over social media platforms.</p><p>Next month, new regulations will come into force which make creators of online groups responsible for the content published on their forums. For users of WeChat, this means people who set up a group chat with multiple users can be punished for what others write or post.</p><p>The National Party Congress, which starts on October 18, is a meeting held by the Communist Party twice a decade to reshuffle its main leadership organisations. Next month's meeting will mark the start of Mr Xi's second five-year term as General Secretary.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6wuopsd0uhy1db3xwjn5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJY-R0H1-JD34-V0V7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"460\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

At first sight, that looks unlikely. China is big, but world trade is conducted in dollars, and the US has economic, political and military influence across the globe. The usual result of a tally of US might is that its position as hegemon is unassailable. But that would overlook how measures of its strength depend upon the world staying in the form that US power has created since 1945. If it doesn't, then these will not count for as much. As one might expect, China has been responding to US attacks, and the outcome is likely to foment a split in the world economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Imagine you wanted to travel from one city to another, but the train company wouldn't sell you a ticket. Neither would the bus company. Then you were not allowed to buy or hire a car. And anyone who sold you or lent you a bicycle would be fined, or would face imprisonment. With due allowance for analogy, that is similar to what has happened to Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea and anyone else that the US does not like.</p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"304\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\" colwidth=\"40\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> Rank </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Port </entry><entry colname=\"col3\"> 2018 </entry><entry colname=\"col4\"> 2017 </entry><entry colname=\"col5\"> 2016 </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> 1 </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Shanghai, China </entry><entry colname=\"col3\"> 42.01 </entry><entry colname=\"col4\"> 40.23 </entry><entry colname=\"col5\"> 37.13 </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> 2 </entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Singapore</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"> 36.60 </entry><entry colname=\"col4\"> 33.67 </entry><entry colname=\"col5\"> 30.90 </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> 3 </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Shenzhen, China </entry><entry colname=\"col3\"> 27.74 </entry><entry colname=\"col4\"> 25.21 </entry><entry colname=\"col5\"> 23.97 </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> 4 </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Ningbo-Zhoushan, China </entry><entry colname=\"col3\"> 26.35 </entry><entry colname=\"col4\"> 24.61 </entry><entry colname=\"col5\"> 21.60 </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> 5 </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Guangzhou Harbor, China </entry><entry colname=\"col3\"> 21.87 </entry><entry colname=\"col4\"> 20.37 </entry><entry colname=\"col5\"> 18.85 </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> 6 </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Busan, South Korea</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"> 21.66 </entry><entry colname=\"col4\"> 20.49 </entry><entry colname=\"col5\"> 19.85 </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> 7 </entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Hong Kong, S.A.R, China </entry><entry colname=\"col3\"> 19.60 </entry><entry colname=\"col4\"> 20.76 </entry><entry colname=\"col5\"> 19.81 </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> 8 </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Qingdao, China </entry><entry colname=\"col3\"> 18.26 </entry><entry colname=\"col4\"> 18.30 </entry><entry colname=\"col5\"> 18.01 </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> 9 </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Tianjin, China </entry><entry colname=\"col3\"> 16.00 </entry><entry colname=\"col4\"> 15.07 </entry><entry colname=\"col5\"> 14.49 </entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"> 10 </entry><entry colname=\"col2\"> Jebel Ali, Dubai, United Arab Emirates</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"> 14.95 </entry><entry colname=\"col4\"> 15.37 </entry><entry colname=\"col5\"> 15.73 </entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>Woe betide you if you are on the wrong side of the US. Then you will find it very difficult to 'travel' in the world economy, that is to have any trade or financial dealings. It is not only the sanctions the US imposes; these are also followed to varying degrees by its allies in Europe, Japan and elsewhere. Could the same thing happen to China? It already has, but so far only to a limited extent.</p><p>I begin by discussing important dimensions of US power in the world, with a focus on the economic, commercial and financial aspects. I will not deal with the mountains of US weaponry and its means of intimidation with worldwide military bases, although these are significant. The remainder of the article deals with how the rise of China is reshaping the world economy and acting as an alternative focal point to the US.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[1]</url>\u00a0Many countries are paying attention to this, even if the 'western' powers do not like it.</p><p>In the past few years, the Trump-led US administration has stepped up anti-China moves. Even if Trump does not get re-elected in November, this direction of policy is not likely to be reversed by the Democrats. We have seen higher tariffs on China's exports, attempts to block its companies from receiving any US-made (or designed) products, particularly in the technology sphere, as well as pressure on US allies to exclude Huawei and other important Chinese companies from their domestic markets on supposed 'security' grounds.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[2]</url></p><p>China's importance in the world economy means that these exclusion tactics cannot easily be extended. Although the US administration has trumpeted, so to speak, a new objective to cut China out of the supply chains that its big corporations have profitably been using for decades, even the 'great again' America must know that this would take many years to achieve.</p><p>The US is the world's biggest economy. With a population of some 328 million people, its GDP in 2019 was $21,439 billion. China has a much bigger population of around 1.4 billion people, but a smaller GDP, estimated at $14,140 billion. China is nevertheless number two in the world, and would be a little bit closer to the US when Hong Kong's $373bn is added to the mainland China number. Both countries have huge domestic markets of interest to foreign companies, and each has a relatively small volume of international trade when compared to GDP, giving their domestic economies some insulation from the vagaries of the world market. China and the US are the biggest two global exporters and importers of goods, but China is far ahead on exports and the US leads in imports.</p><p>A Bank of England report included an interesting chart of the international trade in goods, showing how China was bigger than the US in trade with Asia and South America, and the US was bigger than China with the rest of North America and with Europe. Unfortunately, Africa was left out of account in this chart, but China's direct trade with Africa in 2019 was more than three times larger than that of the US.</p><p>The trade pattern shows there are already different relative strengths of the two countries in relation to the rest of the world. Geography goes some way to account for that difference, but one also has to take note of how US companies export from outside the US - including from China - and that many products from China will contain US components. China has a far smaller volume of foreign direct investment and ownership of foreign companies, so its role in world trade is overstated when compared to the US by this simple country-to-country trade picture.</p><p>US economic power in the world is shown most easily in the foreign exchange market. This comprises a multitude of transactions, usually across borders, for goods, services and flows of money to buy and sell equities, bonds, commodities, real estate and so forth. Most internationally traded commodities, like oil, copper, wheat and gold, are priced in terms of US dollars, as are many industrial goods like aircraft and chemicals, let alone weapons and illegal drugs. Many countries also have their own currencies directly tied or more loosely linked to the dollar, nearly all central banks hold reserves of US dollar-based securities, and all international companies have dollar bank accounts. As a result, the US dollar is involved in 88% of all exchanges between one currency and another on the international market.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[3]</url></p><p>This gives the US government more power than you might think. If a person or a company receives money from selling, or pays money to buy something, then that money has to shift between the bank accounts of the buyer and the seller. When that money happens to be US dollars, the transaction has to go through the US banking system, perhaps indirectly, even if both the buyer and the seller are not located in the US. So, if the US government does not like you, your company, or your country, it can block your ability to use the US banking system.</p><p>That would exclude you from the usual channels of world trade and international business transactions. There may be other ways to avoid the dollar entirely and get a transaction done, but these will likely be more costly. And they will also run the risk of the US government using other means of intimidation - for example, when it levies a fine on any bank that processed a deal with you and threatens to stop that bank from operating in the US. This is one way in which the political objectives of the US administration are advanced by its economic power and influence, with no guns needing to be fired.</p><p>Not only is the US dollar by far the most widely used global currency, the US also has the biggest markets for financial securities, ie for bonds, equities, futures and options contracts.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[4]</url>\u00a0US markets are the centre of gravity for world capitalism. Even though the bulk of transactions in such markets are done within the US itself, the linkages in the global system mean that they filter through quickly into other countries. That is why financial news reports focus most on policy decisions by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, and the ups and downs of the US stock markets usually have knock on effects elsewhere.</p><p>The New York Stock Exchange is the biggest equity market by far, with a capitalisation of nearly $23,000bn at the end of 2019. Nasdaq, also in New York, was the second largest, at nearly $11,000bn capitalisation. Next in line was Japan's Tokyo Stock Exchange, at a mere $5,700bn, with London at less than $5,000bn.</p><p>It is only when China's three stock exchanges, in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen, are taken together that they come anywhere near the US. At the end of 2019, their total market capitalisations amounted to around $10,500bn. However, the Chinese exchanges do have a slightly higher number of corporations listed, some 5,900 compared to a little over 5,300 in the two US markets.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[5]</url></p><p>The reason for considering these things is that they are not narrowly financial. For example, a company's market capitalisation - the total value of its shares - indicates the potential leverage the company has in the broader market. A higher capitalisation means that it can more easily borrow funds from banks, issue bonds itself to get funds, or use its own shares as a means of payment in its takeovers of other companies. Microsoft and Google stand out here, each having done more than 200 takeovers of actual or potential rivals, or of companies that will help them build up a monopolistic position in the market.</p><p>It is mostly US companies that figure at the top of the rankings for market capitalisation. In recent years, it has been the Big Tech corporations like Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, each having a number over $1,000bn. China's Alibaba and Tencent are the only two non-US companies in this top rank, but with valuations of half that of the largest US corporations.</p><p>Financial markets magnify US economic power. Not only does the US stock market present its corporations with many billions of market value, that value is also denominated in US dollars, a currency readily acceptable in most of the world. In global terms, it is 'real money'. Corporations wanting to takeover another will find it easier to do so with US dollars than euros, Japanese yen or sterling, let alone Australian dollars or Norwegian kroner. Apart from its size, liquidity and access to funds, that explains the attraction for companies of listing on the US equity market.</p><p>The US authorities run access to the dollar, especially the Treasury and the Federal Reserve central bank. So why is it that China, seen by the US as its most dangerous antagonist, has let its economy be dominated by dollars?</p><p>First, if China wanted to operate in the world economy, it had little choice 30-40 years ago but to accept the existing structure of world trade and finance. Asia's economies in particular were, and still are, bound up with the US dollar, through close ties of their currencies and through flows of trade, investment and loans. China has also for a long time followed a policy of keeping its domestic currency relatively stable versus the dollar, even in the wake of the severe crisis that hit emerging markets in the late 1990s. This, along with capital controls, helped keep its economy growing steadily by curbing one source of potential instability.</p><p>Second, one method of limiting the impact of possible capital flight is to build up foreign exchange reserves. If foreign investors have assets in China, whether through direct investment in factories, in buying equities or debt securities, then little could be done about the domestic effect on market prices if they sold those assets. But this would not lead to a serious shortage of funds or a collapse of the currency if China's central bank could sell dollars it already had to counter these flows.</p><p>This was an important rationale behind China boosting its official foreign exchange reserves from just $5bn in 1994 to a massive $3.84 trillion by 2014. Some reserves were shifted into state-sponsored purchases of foreign assets (often done using US dollars), some into covering the bad loans of domestic banks, some into offsetting downward pressure on the value of China's currency in the FX market.</p><p>That has still left what may look like an extravagant volume of reserves, totalling $3.1 trillion by end-June 2020. However, such funds have been required on a 'safety first' policy.</p><p>Consider that China has received a large volume of foreign investment inflow. By the end of 2018, the cumulative amount was $2.8 trillion of direct investment in China, $0.7 trillion in equities and $0.4 trillion in China's debt securities. Not all of this near-$4 trillion is at risk from capital flight - a chunk of it will also come from Hong Kong - but how much might be vulnerable is unknown. China also has foreign assets of its own that could be sold if necessary: $1.9 trillion in foreign direct investments, and roughly $0.5 trillion in foreign equity and debt securities. This reckoning puts in perspective what otherwise looks like absurdly big foreign exchange reserves.</p><p>If anyone thought that a country's FX reserves had much to do with its international trade in goods and services, the previous figures should put paid to that. Or contrast what happens when you are not as much at the mercy of a potentially destabilising flow of funds. The US has foreign exchange reserves of just $129bn, less than 10% of China's.</p><p>Close to half of China's foreign exchange reserves is held in terms of US dollars,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[6]</url>\u00a0from bank accounts to US Treasury bills and other interest-bearing securities, to gold.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[7]</url>\u00a0The rest is held in other currency denominations, especially the euro. Not just the central bank, but Chinese state agencies, as well as non-state companies and investors, also hold US securities and dollar bank accounts, as well as having dollar liabilities. Could the US government seize China's dollar assets, or limit China's access to them?</p><p>If seizure of China's assets looks implausible, consider what has happened to Venezuela's gold reserves held in the Bank of England's vaults, or to payments that have long been overdue to Iran! The US could, in principle, also say that the security certificates owned by China - often held in the big US-based custodian banks like Bank of New York Mellon, State Street, JPMorgan Chase, etc - are now invalid pieces of paper, or computer registered items, which belong to an enemy state and now will not be recognised. That would be an extreme measure, also undermining the US ability to attract further funds and investment, so it is unlikely. Such things are usually only done to 'little' countries to show them who is boss. But it remains a risk that China's policy has to manage.</p><p>Over recent years, there has been lots of speculation that China could reduce its dollar risk by selling the Treasuries and other US securities that its government and companies own. This would be a foolish thing to do quickly on a large scale, since the prices of the securities could fall in response.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[8]</url>\u00a0Much more importantly, it would also remove the easy access to US dollar funds that China has, and will continue to need, given the dollar-dominated global financial system. What China's authorities have done instead is to cut back new dollar exposure and quietly offload dollars in the market.</p><p>A more comprehensive way of reducing the risk that China faces from US sanctions would be to build another economic, commercial and financial network. Over the past decade, that is exactly what China has been doing.</p><p>Almost all of the measures used to highlight US economic power depend upon a link to the dollar-based system, for example, the dollar's domination of the global FX market, the huge capitalisation values of US corporations, and the scale and influence of US financial markets. But what if something shakes the foundations of this power and the global system begins to take on a different form?</p><p>Up to now, China's rise has been evident in production and trade figures. By comparison, its development in the more financial sphere has been limited, but let's take a look at some of these numbers and what they mean.</p><p>The US dollar rules the FX system, with 88% of the $6.6 trillion daily turnover involving the dollar on one side of the transaction. By comparison, even the euro is only at 32%, and China's currency, the renminbi, is at just 4%.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[9]</url>\u00a0Yet, 38% of the total volume of FX trading is between the dealing banks themselves, and 55% is between banks and other financial institutions, including 9% with hedge funds and other speculators. Only 7% of FX trading is with non-financial firms! What would happen if international financial dealing were less important, especially in US securities? This calls into question the solidity of the dollar's pre-eminent position in FX markets and in the world at large.</p><p>A similar thing applies to the financial power of big US corporations. For example, with a market capitalisation of around $1.6 trillion each in mid-July, it would seem that Amazon, Apple and Microsoft can do pretty much what they like: buy up any budding rival company, run a predatory pricing policy or extend their monopolistic positions further in other ways. But just as a company's share price can collapse when its prospects no longer look as rosy as before, so can its apparent financial power if it is not able to operate as it wants and finds its markets cut off.</p><p>So far these things have not affected the big US corporations very much, although they have faced more constraints than they would like in China's domestic market. They have not been able to compete well with the domestic champions Alibaba (e-commerce, payments systems, finance), Baidu (a search engine) and Tencent (various operations, from video games to e-commerce, to finance). The boot has instead been on the other foot, as China's big companies have been edged out of the US and face restrictions in the markets of US allies. Nevertheless, that could change if the US-dominated structure of world markets changes, a development that is well under way.</p><p>China has prepared itself against US hostility for years. That didn't take a lot of strategic insight, given the numerous reports to the US Congress complaining about the Chinese 'threat' - ie the threat to US hegemony in the world economy, not simply a military calculation. Three international projects have been key: the 'One Belt One Road' project launched in 2013, now called the 'Belt and Road Initiative' (BRI); the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), launched by China in 2013-14, and the BRICS Development Bank, now called the New Development Bank (NDB), proposed in 2013-14 and starting up in 2015.</p><p>The NDB is headquartered in Shanghai, and initially had enthusiastic support from all its founding members, Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (hence BRICS). They account for 20% of world GDP and 40% of the world's population, and the NDB looked like it was going to become a big player in development finance. But little activity seems to have taken place in the last couple of years, although there have been important, separate bilateral deals between China and Russia and between China and Iran.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[10]</url></p><p>At least partly, this has been due to renewed tensions between India and China, the latest being over their shared border in the north-west of India and India's ban on the use of 59 Chinese phone apps, including TikTok. The election of Bolsonaro in Brazil, who has criticised China's investments in the country, is another factor. More importantly, in recent years both India and Brazil have come more under the influence of the US and more anti-China in their policy stance. Bolsonaro has even tried to emulate Trump in this regard, as he has done in his disastrous handling of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has had a more active time, and it now has more than 100 member countries. Not surprisingly, the US did not join, but several of its close allies did, including the UK and Australia. It is a moot point whether the latter were defying the US, or whether they saw joining as a means of keeping an eye on what China was up to - apart from also not wanting to be on the outside to tender for any new contracts. China accounts for nearly 30% of the AIIB's capital of $100bn, and for 26% of the voting power. Since 2016, this bank has financed a number of power, energy and road projects in the Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Egypt, Turkey and elsewhere.</p><p>The Belt and Road Initiative is a much more serious plan from China. It has involved more than 130 countries in its projects, and some 30 international organisations. The basic idea is to develop ports, shipping lanes, roads and other infrastructure, including high voltage electricity grids, in a vast enterprise spanning the next 30 years.</p><p>The plan's scope can be seen in the following image, where its routes run all around Asia and Europe and extend into East Africa. It could be considered the beginning of a single market area, but it is nowhere near that yet. Although trade, investment and transit arrangements have been made with other countries along the routes, those countries may often have a cautious approach to dealing with China.</p><p>Europe, in particular, is wary. Not only because the relevant powers are not used to a 'developing country' having so much leverage, but also because they have been within the US sphere of influence. Yet they are growing worried about that, given Trump's unilateralist 'America First' approach that has also targeted their industries for extra import tariffs, and their fear of the role of US Big Tech corporations. While they have joined in some moves to curb Chinese companies, this has been only to a limited extent so far.</p><p>As the political leaders of the European Union, Germany and France will have to make up their minds which way to jump. Yet that process will take some time to play out. For the time being, they are working on trying to cohere the EU itself as the UK leaves, and they hope that the EU can play the role of being an independent actor in the world economy.</p><p>The UK, ex-EU and ex-much else, is far more tied to the US. It has legions of political figures and economic interests integrated with the Anglosphere global set up, from the UN Security Council, to military cooperation, to the 'Five Eyes' spy network, to the rules applied to finance and trade at the BIS, IMF and WTO, to deluded hopes for a special Brexity relationship with the US in the future. These things will weigh on British decision-making, and the resulting disarray in and confusion of an arrogant imperial power should be amusing to observe.</p><p>The Belt and Road project is very important for China, and opponents can easily cast it as simply a tool with which China secures safe routes for its exports and imports. It has also had negative media coverage because of signs of unequal deals, projects that have led to large indebtedness for the country concerned, or projects in which a commercial port is claimed to be a cover for a potential Chinese naval base (as in Sri Lanka), or potential Chinese takeover and ownership when the debt cannot be repaid or serviced.</p><p>Evidence I have seen points to a more positive assessment. At least some of the problems with projects have been due to local corruption as much as to any Chinese misdemeanour. It is also worth noting that China's infrastructure development plans often include building schools and hospitals as well as improving energy supply. The BRI should act to integrate more isolated areas into the world economy, greatly speed up logistics, travel and transport, and help these regions grow. It is not in China's long-term interests that cooperating regions and countries become mere servicing wastelands.</p><p>The BRI's routes traverse areas in which US imperialism has long sought to gain influence, many of which were formerly inside the USSR - including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Georgia - and also Iran and Russia itself. One area along the route that has been prominent in the news media recently is Xinjiang in north western China.</p><p>Xinjiang, or to give it the official title, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, is home to around 25 million people, of which 45% are of the Uyghur ethnic group, and many of these are Muslim. It is China's largest natural gas producing region, and has been the locus for many attacks by Islamic separatists, especially since the 1990s. Plausible reports claim that this was a 'blowback' from previous Chinese arming and training of Islamic guerrillas to fight Russia in Afghanistan in the 1980s. China, along with Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and others, cooperated with the US CIA in this period, and trouble brewed for China in this region when the guerrillas came home.</p><p>The US, UK and other western powers have a long history of using Islamic militants to do their dirty work of political disruption and destabilisation, even though it often comes back to bite them. Just think of Osama Bin Laden and the support the US also gave his organisation to attack the Russians in Afghanistan. Or the British support for Islamic militants in Egypt against Nasser and in Libya against Gaddafi.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[11]</url>\u00a0It is therefore no surprise that the US has been heavily involved in promoting Uyghur separatists, and that western news media have been full of stories about Chinese 'concentration camps' and brainwashing centres for Uyghurs.</p><p>It would take too long and be too off topic to cover this in more detail, but my basic view is this. China has not been kind to separatist forces in Xinjiang and may well have clamped down on them harshly. It has also encouraged Han Chinese to move into Xinjiang. But there is no evidence of actual or cultural 'genocide' of Uyghurs and the region has even had some autonomy from strict regulations imposed elsewhere in the country, for example, on population and family policy. The western media view of all this is readily available; for an informed alternative view, I give some sources in a footnote.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[12]</url>\u00a0Surely, anyone with any sense would see that there could not possibly be a 'Save the Muslims' motive behind the western propaganda about Xinjiang.</p><p>As the US anxiety and near-hysteria about China has grown, another opportunity has arisen for mischief - in Hong Kong, especially since early 2019. There have been widespread protests in this 'special administrative region' of China against the introduction of laws that would increase mainland China's authority and potentially suppress dissent and opposition to government policy. Although led principally by students, the protests clearly had support from a large section of the population of Hong Kong.</p><p>Beijing was obviously none too pleased with this, and its paranoia alarm bells rang loudly when some demonstrators carried US flags and called for the US to impose sanctions on Hong Kong to force China to drop its proposals. (The US has now done it.) With the CIA-backed National Endowment for Democracy supporting the protests and with Joshua Wong, one of the leading students, cosying up to arch reactionary and regime-change interventionist, US Senator Marco Rubio, the stage was set for a Chinese clampdown.</p><p>China's political system is authoritarian, but one should not fall for the hypocrisy of western powers lamenting the threat to a tradition of democracy in Hong Kong. Prior to UK talks with China in 1984 about the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, there was no sign of democracy, but instead an oligarchic Legislative Council, an advisory body to the British Governor. Full elections to this Council only began in 1995. So 'democracy' began to be introduced only just before Britain was going to lose its colony after 99 years.</p><p>What will be China's policy towards Hong Kong now? To answer this question, it is worth noting the role it has played in relation to China.</p><p>When it was a British colony, Hong Kong specialised as an entrepot centre in Asia, with a large port operation and a big financial sector. As China grew as a global production base, particularly from the 1980s, Hong Kong also thrived as the 'western' gateway into China, with booming cross-border deals. In turn, China used Hong Kong to gain experience of international markets, from how best to run a port to how to manage banking and finance.</p><p>Hong Kong is now less important for China than it might seem. Its GDP is less than 3% of mainland China's, and its 7.5 million people could be seen as barely a rounding error compared to China's total. It is nevertheless politically inconceivable that China would allow Hong Kong to become fully 'independent' or to secede. In the event of continued protests about rule by mainland China, a much more likely policy would be to slowly run down the remaining economic reliance China has on Hong Kong. This is no doubt on the minds of some Hong Kong residents, not all of whom are anti-Beijing.</p><p>Hong Kong's population has significantly higher living standards than the average in mainland China, and US dollar millionaires make up a surprising 7% of the population. Such factors will have influenced the protest movement in Hong Kong, and there have also been many signs of locals resenting mainlanders. Some of the latter have been attacked for supposedly being Beijing loyalists; others have faced opposition from locals who felt their presence was driving up prices and rents. I think that fear of an economic 'levelling down' is at least as significant a factor in the protests as any call for democratic rights.</p><p>One way of judging the ability of China to sideline Hong Kong, if it wants to, is by looking at its importance as a port. A list of the top world container ports - containers are critical in the trade of goods - has mainland China with six in the top 10. Hong Kong's port is large, but is ranked number seven and is only roughly half the size of Shanghai's at number one. Shenzhen, at number three and also bigger than Hong Kong, is only around 15 kilometres from Hong Kong (although a bit further to travel by sea!).</p><p>Rivalries in the world economy can bring unexpected results, especially when a former underdog can now pro-actively resist. The world order is no longer entirely one where, as Bob Dylan put it, 'You're dancing with whom they tell you to, or you don't dance at all'. How far China is able to build stable alliances for an economic area that limits US interference, and whether it too becomes oppressive, remain to be seen. But in the meantime it has offered many countries an alternative to the rich country model of development, one that has left poor countries poor.</p><p>Prospects for the Anglosphere powers are not good. Political idiocy born of generations of arrogance now adds to their difficulties in navigating a world that is changing increasingly outside their control. Examples of their recent responses to Chinese technology sum up their problem. China's Huawei produces very good, and cheaper, 4G and 5G products, including infrastructure and smartphones, and ByteDance also has a popular media app, TikTok. Instead of saying, 'we have something even better', the US and others respond by claiming, with no evidence, that they pose a security risk and that Chinese products should be rejected.</p><p>By contrast, Germany, the most productivist of the European powers, has shown more enthusiasm for China-led developments than others. The Belt and Road Initiative already has an important outlet in Duisburg, the world's largest inland port, where it is the first European stop for 80% of Chinese trains:</p><p>\"Every week, around 30 Chinese trains arrive at a vast terminal in Duisburg's inland port, their containers either stuffed with clothes, toys and hi-tech electronics from Chongqing, Wuhan or Yiwu, or carrying German cars, Scottish whisky, French wine and textiles from Milan heading the other way.\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[13]</url></p><p>Duisberg's main problem seems to be that 'for every two full containers arriving in Europe from China, only one heads back the other way, and the port only earns a fifth of the fee from empty containers that have to be sent back to China'.</p><p>At the other end of the line, another German company, BMW, has praised China's technical know how:</p><p>\"The auto industry is undergoing a major transformation driven by technological development. In the midst of industrial upgrading and transformation, we need to keep an open mind and to collaborate with outstanding Chinese innovation powerhouses.\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">[14]</url></p><p>To say the least, these things suggest that China's growing importance in the world economy will be difficult for the US to curb.</p><p>By Tony Norfield for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=3591186784456519139#_ftn1\">Public Reading Rooms (UK).</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://newsline.kz/upload/iblock/94f/94f5c1b97a8a7b9bc344c9117f1abba2.png\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SILKEN-925918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SILKEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MB-Y631-JDMW-J06K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463868</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5379\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Kazahkstan Newsline Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Silkroute.news (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"54\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 18, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>Stock Exchanges</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

A former Canadian diplomat has reportedly been detained in China. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, is this tit for tat?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HARLOW: Right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCIUTTO: This as Meng Wanzou, CEO of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei, hears her fate today in a bail hearing in Vancouver. She was arrested ten days ago in Canada and faces extradition now to the U.S., allegedly for helping her company circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining us now is CNN's Matt Rivers in Beijing with more. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Matt, this, as you know, was a concern because China has done this in the past. I mean, in effect, I don't know if you want to call it hostage taking, but retaliatory arrests when you have situations like this. Is that how it's being read in Beijing? </p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's certainly the speculation in the x-pac (ph) community here, those of us who are from, you know, other countries living here in China, that is the speculation that's rampant right now. </p><p>Now, to be clear, we don't know for a fact that China detained this former Canadian ambassador named Michael Kovrig as punishment in retaliation for what happened to the CFO of Huawei, Meng Wanzou. But it is certainly a possibility given the timing. So this diplomat, former diplomat, works for an NGO called the International Crisis Group. Here was traveling here in Beijing, usually based out of Hong Kong. Here in the mainland, though, and the NGO, ICG, actually put out a statement saying they believe he has been detained by Chinese authorities. </p><p>And like you said, Jim, this does happen every now and then. Not with regular occurrence, but it does happen where China takes into custody western NGO workers for a number of different reasons. But this jumps off the page because of the timing of all this. </p><p>You mentioned Meng is going to have a 1:00 p.m. bail hearing in Canada. But I can tell you that there has been incredible uproar here in China over what they -- the Chinese state media is calling Meng's unfair treatment, basically trampling on her human rights is what one state-run newspaper editorial wrote. So there has been the fear here that retaliation could be coming in some form. And what we could be seeing here with the detention of this former Canadian diplomat is a form of retaliation. </p><p>Jim. Poppy.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes. and that, of course, will spark talk of maybe a trade to diffuse it. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Matt Rivers in Beijing, thanks very much.</p><p>Right now, listen, the market has been watching these China trade talks with some fear, some trepidation. Right now they are surging. Of course the president tweeted earlier today that there is progress. Not clear what that progress is.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. We want the details. </p><p>Let's go to Alison Kosik at the New York Stock Exchange with more.</p><p>The markets like what they're seeing this morning, but, wow, what a whiplash we've seen over the past few weeks down there. </p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you said it. And you're talking trade. And trade, guys, has really been the driver to all this volatility we've been seeing in the markets, not just last week but yesterday. Yesterday was a real wild one where we saw the Dow drop more than 500 points and then make a total u-turn and end in the green yesterday. </p><p>This morning we are seeing a solidly higher open. The Dow up more than 350 points on positive news about trade. We learned that there was a phone call between secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Trade Adviser Robert Lighthizer, and the top trade negotiator for China. And on this phone call they apparently discussed a timeline for these trade negotiations and even possibly implementing some of the agreements that were made on the sidelines of the G-20 in Argentina a couple of weekends ago. </p><p>So this positive news is buoying the market forward. But the idea here is, don't get too complacent because if there's a negative headline that comes out about trade, you can see the markets make yet another u-turn. </p><p>There are also other concerns lingering in the background. I'm talking about the Brexit chaos, those geopolitical issues, about what's going to happen with Brexit now that Prime Minister Theresa May pulled that vote from parliament yesterday. And then the questions of, what is the Fed going to do when it comes to interest rates. Yes, it is expected interest rates will go up in December, but the question is, what will happen in 2019? That continues to weigh on the markets. We will be watching closely. </p><p>Poppy. Jim.</p><p>HARLOW: Alison, we will. You'll be there. Thank you so much.</p><p>So ahead for us, he has avoided the political spotlight pretty much completely until now. We're talking about Google's CEO. That changes in minutes. He will take the hot seat on Capitol Hill. He is testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. What is it about? It is largely about accusations that Google search results unfairly target conservatives. Google has said that is unfounded. But what will the CEO say when he takes questions?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:39:20] HARLOW: In minutes Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, testifies before Congress for the first time. The first time he'll ever publically testify on Capitol Hill. He's expected to respond to claims of political bias by the president and other top Republicans. In August, the president blasted Google, accusing it of, quote, rigging search results against him and, quote, suppressing the voice of conservatives. Google defended its search engine, insisting it is not used to set a political agenda. </p><p>But the tech giant reportedly not taking any chances when it comes to preparing its CEO. \"The Washington Post\" is reporting this morning Google spent $17 million this year lobbying regulators to gather intel on what the CEO could be asked today. That's according to top aides of members of the House Judiciary Committee. </p><p>[09:40:04] Earlier this morning I spoke with a Google executive who told me lawmakers will be, quote, pleasantly surprised at how thoughtful Pichai is and his willingness to roll up his sleeves and work with Washington on regulation. </p><p>Sean Captain joins me. He's a reporter for \"Fast Company.\" He's written extensively about this.</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>And I think we're all anticipating this. It is going to be really important on a number of levels.</p><p>We know a little bit about what Sundar is going to say, so let me read some of this prepared testimony for everyone. Quote, I lead this company without political bias. He goes on to say, to do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests. We are a company that provides platforms for diverse perspectives and opinions. </p><p>This is his first time in the spotlight. What are you expecting? </p><p>SEAN CAPTAIN, REPORTER, \"FAST COMPANY\": Well, having read that testimony and looked at all of it --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. CAPTAIN: He's definitely trying to portray Google as the all-American company. He made a lot of emphasis around that, that they're, you know, they're an American brand, that they're good for America, that they're -- you know, have the country's best interest at heart. And he's clearly trying to play to that notion that, you know, we're on your side, which is going to be tricky because there's a lot of reasons why people feel that he has not -- they've not served America well. </p><p>HARLOW: So, in terms of some of the political accusations against Google, the president made them, didn't back it up with evidence. But there is something from -- Breitbart surfaced this. OK, you'll remember Sergey Brin speaking after the election. I think we have a full screen we can pull up here, this video that we cans how you. </p><p>Or actually we can play it for you because listen to this. </p><p>CAPTAIN: OK.</p><p>HARLOW: This is where some of the Republican criticism comes from. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERGEY BRIN, GOOGLE CO-FOUNDER: As an immigrant and a refugee, I am -- I certainly find the selection deeply offensive. And I know many of you do, too. And I think it's a very stressful time, and it conflicts with many of our values. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Now, a Google executive responding to that said, look, there is nothing to suggest any political bias in that. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said to expect questions on this today. I mean, how will Google's CEO respond to that? Do you think he'll say, look, Sergey Brin, you know, the co-founder, shouldn't have said that? </p><p>CAPTAIN: Probably no. I think probably the way that you characterize that, saying that, you know, their -- the way that Google spokesperson had characterized it, saying that there's nothing inherently bias. He's just showing that there, you know, concern about what's happening in the country. I think Google's going to do a lot of what Google does, what tech companies do, is stand behind the technology, saying the algorithm is sound. You know, we're based on data science. We're, you know, bringing back the results that, you know, are most valuable without any bias in them. And it's very easy to out tech politicians. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes. </p><p>But you do write in your piece this morning, which is important to note, that it doesn't make any sense for Google to even try to alienate any one of any certain political strife. I mean they're not going to lay out all the secrets of their algorithm here, but that that wouldn't even be a smart business move by Google to do that one way or the other. </p><p>CAPTAIN: I mean Google's an advertising company ultimately. HARLOW: Right.</p><p>CAPTAIN: I mean the more eyeballs they get, the better. </p><p>HARLOW: China. You hope that China will come up today. I think it's a very important topic that lawmakers should ask about today. The code name for Google's exploration, shall I say, into China is Dragon Fly. And reports that it is exploring expanding into China with a censored search engine has even caused uproar within the company and it's caused some to protest, some employees of Goggle to protest. This is an area of common ground, of concern for Republican and Democratic lawmakers. What should we expect on that front today? </p><p>CAPTAIN: Well, yes, this is where, when I was looking at his comments about what a patriotic company Google is, this is what I think might have been in his mind because on the left, obviously -- well, on all sides, but especially on the left, there's a concern about the human rights abuses in China, especially the situation with the Weger (ph) concentration camps.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>CAPTAIN: On the right, there is that, plus the notion of saying, hey, Google, you -- kind of funny. Hey, Google, you dropped out of a Pentagon contract, Maven (ph), to provide AI to the Pentagon. So you're -- you know, you're abandoning the U.S., but now you're cozying up with China. So it took a double whammy and I think they're going to take a hard hit on both sides for that. </p><p>HARLOW: Before you go, I do want to read part of this testimony at the end here because he says we recognize the important role of government in setting rules for the development and use of technology. He has seemed, I would say, Sean, consistently open to the clearly coming regulation from Congress on big tech. What's your read? </p><p>CAPTAIN: Yes. I think -- I mean it's been pushed for so many reasons because of, getting back to that earlier concern about conservative bias or liberal bias, California's new regulation, European new regulation. I think -- I mean the handwriting is on every single wall at this point and they have to try to show that they're proactive and try to take -- sort of control the narrative to the extent that they can on that.</p><p>[09:45:20] HARLOW: OK. Well, we'll be watching. This testimony begins in about 15 minutes.</p><p>Sean, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>Sean Captain from \"Fast Company.\" Appreciate it.</p><p>CAPTAIN: Thanks.</p><p>HARLOW: Today, the Trump administration is expected to roll back environmental protection on waterways across the country. How this major overhaul could affect the drinking water used by millions of Americans. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:50:06] HARLOW: All right, this morning we've learned the EPA is preparing to roll back protections that shield streams and wetlands across the country from industrial waste and other pollutants. This proposal would change which bodies of water all over this nation are protected under the Clean Water Act. </p><p>SCIUTTO: It's a change President Trump has wanted since taking office, but environmentalists and others say the shift could endanger drinking water used by millions of Americans. </p><p>CNN's Rene Marsh joins us now.</p><p>Rene, it's a great point here to explore because often folks will think these regulations are something off in the distance, might make you feel good but doesn't really affect your life. This does, does it not? It affects the water coming out of the tap that you and your kids drink. </p><p>RENE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. I mean environmentalists are sounding the alarm extremely loudly today just for that reason, Jim, because they believe these small streams, these waterways, they all are sources, as you say, sources of tap water. They help filter larger bodies of water. </p><p>But here's the story. In about another two hours or so, the Trump administration is set to announce that they will weaken these federal clean water rules. This would impact, we're talking about millions of acres of wetlands, thousands of acres of streams that run through the United States. </p><p>The way this worked under the Obama administration was that the EPA regulated these smaller bodies of water, these streams and these wetlands. And they said essentially certain crops or pesticides could not be used near these streams and wetlands. This was a way to keep pesticides and other pollutants out of those waterways. </p><p>Well now, as I said, in just a couple hours from now, the Trump administration will loosen those regulations, and those rules will no longer be in place. And, of course, environmentalists are saying, look, this will impact things like drinking water. However, the argument on the other side, namely from the Trump administration, is that this was an example of federal government taking way too much control over land that belonged to farmers and farmers had to essentially run it by the EPA if they wanted to plant things or plant certain crops on their own land. </p><p>But, again, this is a controversial move, and we expect to hear lots of pushback, especially from environmentalists after this announcement is made in just a couple hours from now. </p><p>Jim.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes, fertilizers are a big pollutant. They end up in drinking water everywhere and it's a relevant issue. HARLOW: Yes. </p><p>SCIUTTO: Rene Marsh, thanks very much.</p><p>Newly released documents paint a disturbing picture of the Sandy Hook killer. Ahead, what those papers reveal about the years leading up to that just horrendous shooting.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:57:16] SCIUTTO: Nearly six years, if you can believe it, after the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, we are getting a new and disturbing look into the inner workings of the shooter' mind. And I have to say, whenever we talk about this story, my heart goes into my throat. </p><p>HARLOW: Oh, these kids. We will all remember that day, December 14, 2012, when Adam Lanza killed his mother before going into the Sandy Hook Elementary School, murdering 26 people, including 20 children. He then took his own life, and now state investigators in Connecticut have released more than 1,000 pages of his journals and documents showing that years before the shooting he displayed so many red flags. </p><p>Our Jean Casarez has the details. </p><p>Good morning. </p><p>JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know it's really stunning to read what \"The Current\" is reporting on. They got this exclusively. Such a negativity with all of his writings and the assessment by professionals. </p><p>These documents and writing of the Sandy Hook shooter, Adam Lanza, have never been made public before, until now. \"The Hartford Current\" was able to obtain over 1,000 documents from the Connecticut State Police after a five-year legal battle verve eventually decided by the state supreme court. </p><p>The documents included Lanza's own writing, as long with assessments from mental health professionals prior to December 2012 when Lanza shot and killed 20 first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School after shooting his own mother to death. </p><p>While we knew the 20-year-old had led a life of isolation, we now know that Lanza was evaluated in 2006, six years before the mass shooting, by Robert King, a professor of child psychiatry at the Yale Child Study Center. According to the newspaper's reporting, King asked him if there were kids that he enjoyed spending time with. A 14-year-old Lanza replied, why would that be significant? According to the doctor's notes, he appeared pale, gaunt, awkward, and standing rigidly with his eyes downcast, declining to shake hands, tremulous with discomfort and looking miserable. Dr. King's report stated in part, it was difficult to interpret what this increasing social withdrawal and reclusiveness represents, but stated that his homebound education was a mistake.  Many of Lanza's writings, according to \"The Current,\" were not dated. But at one point he wrote a list of his problems, including the lights were too bright, there were too many dirty dishes, and referring to his mother, you were in the room while I was in the kitchen. I am unable to distinguish between my problems, he wrote, because I have too many. </p><p>[09:59:55] At another point he writes in what appears to be an online communication with a fellow gamer, I incessantly have nothing other than scorn for humanity. I have been desperate to feel anything positive for someone </p><p>[Byline: Poppy Harlow, Jim Sciutto, Matt Rivers, Alison Kosik, Rene Marsh, Jean Casarez] [Guest: Sean Captain] [High: China has detained a former Canadian diplomat.

A former Canadian diplomat has reportedly been detained in China. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, is this tit for tat?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HARLOW: Right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCIUTTO: This as Meng Wanzou, CEO of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei, hears her fate today in a bail hearing in Vancouver. She was arrested ten days ago in Canada and faces extradition now to the U.S., allegedly for helping her company circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining us now is CNN's Matt Rivers in Beijing with more. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Matt, this, as you know, was a concern because China has done this in the past. I mean, in effect, I don't know if you want to call it hostage taking, but retaliatory arrests when you have situations like this. Is that how it's being read in Beijing? </p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's certainly the speculation in the x-pac (ph) community here, those of us who are from, you know, other countries living here in China, that is the speculation that's rampant right now. </p><p>Now, to be clear, we don't know for a fact that China detained this former Canadian ambassador named Michael Kovrig as punishment in retaliation for what happened to the CFO of Huawei, Meng Wanzou. But it is certainly a possibility given the timing. So this diplomat, former diplomat, works for an NGO called the International Crisis Group. Here was traveling here in Beijing, usually based out of Hong Kong. Here in the mainland, though, and the NGO, ICG, actually put out a statement saying they believe he has been detained by Chinese authorities. </p><p>And like you said, Jim, this does happen every now and then. Not with regular occurrence, but it does happen where China takes into custody western NGO workers for a number of different reasons. But this jumps off the page because of the timing of all this. </p><p>You mentioned Meng is going to have a 1:00 p.m. bail hearing in Canada. But I can tell you that there has been incredible uproar here in China over what they -- the Chinese state media is calling Meng's unfair treatment, basically trampling on her human rights is what one state-run newspaper editorial wrote. So there has been the fear here that retaliation could be coming in some form. And what we could be seeing here with the detention of this former Canadian diplomat is a form of retaliation. </p><p>Jim. Poppy.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes. and that, of course, will spark talk of maybe a trade to diffuse it. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Matt Rivers in Beijing, thanks very much.</p><p>Right now, listen, the market has been watching these China trade talks with some fear, some trepidation. Right now they are surging. Of course the president tweeted earlier today that there is progress. Not clear what that progress is.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. We want the details. </p><p>Let's go to Alison Kosik at the New York Stock Exchange with more.</p><p>The markets like what they're seeing this morning, but, wow, what a whiplash we've seen over the past few weeks down there. </p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you said it. And you're talking trade. And trade, guys, has really been the driver to all this volatility we've been seeing in the markets, not just last week but yesterday. Yesterday was a real wild one where we saw the Dow drop more than 500 points and then make a total u-turn and end in the green yesterday. </p><p>This morning we are seeing a solidly higher open. The Dow up more than 350 points on positive news about trade. We learned that there was a phone call between secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Trade Adviser Robert Lighthizer, and the top trade negotiator for China. And on this phone call they apparently discussed a timeline for these trade negotiations and even possibly implementing some of the agreements that were made on the sidelines of the G-20 in Argentina a couple of weekends ago. </p><p>So this positive news is buoying the market forward. But the idea here is, don't get too complacent because if there's a negative headline that comes out about trade, you can see the markets make yet another u-turn. </p><p>There are also other concerns lingering in the background. I'm talking about the Brexit chaos, those geopolitical issues, about what's going to happen with Brexit now that Prime Minister Theresa May pulled that vote from parliament yesterday. And then the questions of, what is the Fed going to do when it comes to interest rates. Yes, it is expected interest rates will go up in December, but the question is, what will happen in 2019? That continues to weigh on the markets. We will be watching closely. </p><p>Poppy. Jim.</p><p>HARLOW: Alison, we will. You'll be there. Thank you so much.</p><p>So ahead for us, he has avoided the political spotlight pretty much completely until now. We're talking about Google's CEO. That changes in minutes. He will take the hot seat on Capitol Hill. He is testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. What is it about? It is largely about accusations that Google search results unfairly target conservatives. Google has said that is unfounded. But what will the CEO say when he takes questions?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:39:20] HARLOW: In minutes Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, testifies before Congress for the first time. The first time he'll ever publically testify on Capitol Hill. He's expected to respond to claims of political bias by the president and other top Republicans. In August, the president blasted Google, accusing it of, quote, rigging search results against him and, quote, suppressing the voice of conservatives. Google defended its search engine, insisting it is not used to set a political agenda. </p><p>But the tech giant reportedly not taking any chances when it comes to preparing its CEO. \"The Washington Post\" is reporting this morning Google spent $17 million this year lobbying regulators to gather intel on what the CEO could be asked today. That's according to top aides of members of the House Judiciary Committee. </p><p>[09:40:04] Earlier this morning I spoke with a Google executive who told me lawmakers will be, quote, pleasantly surprised at how thoughtful Pichai is and his willingness to roll up his sleeves and work with Washington on regulation. </p><p>Sean Captain joins me. He's a reporter for \"Fast Company.\" He's written extensively about this.</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>And I think we're all anticipating this. It is going to be really important on a number of levels.</p><p>We know a little bit about what Sundar is going to say, so let me read some of this prepared testimony for everyone. Quote, I lead this company without political bias. He goes on to say, to do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests. We are a company that provides platforms for diverse perspectives and opinions. </p><p>This is his first time in the spotlight. What are you expecting? </p><p>SEAN CAPTAIN, REPORTER, \"FAST COMPANY\": Well, having read that testimony and looked at all of it --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. CAPTAIN: He's definitely trying to portray Google as the all-American company. He made a lot of emphasis around that, that they're, you know, they're an American brand, that they're good for America, that they're -- you know, have the country's best interest at heart. And he's clearly trying to play to that notion that, you know, we're on your side, which is going to be tricky because there's a lot of reasons why people feel that he has not -- they've not served America well. </p><p>HARLOW: So, in terms of some of the political accusations against Google, the president made them, didn't back it up with evidence. But there is something from -- Breitbart surfaced this. OK, you'll remember Sergey Brin speaking after the election. I think we have a full screen we can pull up here, this video that we cans how you. </p><p>Or actually we can play it for you because listen to this. </p><p>CAPTAIN: OK.</p><p>HARLOW: This is where some of the Republican criticism comes from. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERGEY BRIN, GOOGLE CO-FOUNDER: As an immigrant and a refugee, I am -- I certainly find the selection deeply offensive. And I know many of you do, too. And I think it's a very stressful time, and it conflicts with many of our values. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Now, a Google executive responding to that said, look, there is nothing to suggest any political bias in that. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said to expect questions on this today. I mean, how will Google's CEO respond to that? Do you think he'll say, look, Sergey Brin, you know, the co-founder, shouldn't have said that? </p><p>CAPTAIN: Probably no. I think probably the way that you characterize that, saying that, you know, their -- the way that Google spokesperson had characterized it, saying that there's nothing inherently bias. He's just showing that there, you know, concern about what's happening in the country. I think Google's going to do a lot of what Google does, what tech companies do, is stand behind the technology, saying the algorithm is sound. You know, we're based on data science. We're, you know, bringing back the results that, you know, are most valuable without any bias in them. And it's very easy to out tech politicians. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes. </p><p>But you do write in your piece this morning, which is important to note, that it doesn't make any sense for Google to even try to alienate any one of any certain political strife. I mean they're not going to lay out all the secrets of their algorithm here, but that that wouldn't even be a smart business move by Google to do that one way or the other. </p><p>CAPTAIN: I mean Google's an advertising company ultimately. HARLOW: Right.</p><p>CAPTAIN: I mean the more eyeballs they get, the better. </p><p>HARLOW: China. You hope that China will come up today. I think it's a very important topic that lawmakers should ask about today. The code name for Google's exploration, shall I say, into China is Dragon Fly. And reports that it is exploring expanding into China with a censored search engine has even caused uproar within the company and it's caused some to protest, some employees of Goggle to protest. This is an area of common ground, of concern for Republican and Democratic lawmakers. What should we expect on that front today? </p><p>CAPTAIN: Well, yes, this is where, when I was looking at his comments about what a patriotic company Google is, this is what I think might have been in his mind because on the left, obviously -- well, on all sides, but especially on the left, there's a concern about the human rights abuses in China, especially the situation with the Weger (ph) concentration camps.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>CAPTAIN: On the right, there is that, plus the notion of saying, hey, Google, you -- kind of funny. Hey, Google, you dropped out of a Pentagon contract, Maven (ph), to provide AI to the Pentagon. So you're -- you know, you're abandoning the U.S., but now you're cozying up with China. So it took a double whammy and I think they're going to take a hard hit on both sides for that. </p><p>HARLOW: Before you go, I do want to read part of this testimony at the end here because he says we recognize the important role of government in setting rules for the development and use of technology. He has seemed, I would say, Sean, consistently open to the clearly coming regulation from Congress on big tech. What's your read? </p><p>CAPTAIN: Yes. I think -- I mean it's been pushed for so many reasons because of, getting back to that earlier concern about conservative bias or liberal bias, California's new regulation, European new regulation. I think -- I mean the handwriting is on every single wall at this point and they have to try to show that they're proactive and try to take -- sort of control the narrative to the extent that they can on that.</p><p>[09:45:20] HARLOW: OK. Well, we'll be watching. This testimony begins in about 15 minutes.</p><p>Sean, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>Sean Captain from \"Fast Company.\" Appreciate it.</p><p>CAPTAIN: Thanks.</p><p>HARLOW: Today, the Trump administration is expected to roll back environmental protection on waterways across the country. How this major overhaul could affect the drinking water used by millions of Americans. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:50:06] HARLOW: All right, this morning we've learned the EPA is preparing to roll back protections that shield streams and wetlands across the country from industrial waste and other pollutants. This proposal would change which bodies of water all over this nation are protected under the Clean Water Act. </p><p>SCIUTTO: It's a change President Trump has wanted since taking office, but environmentalists and others say the shift could endanger drinking water used by millions of Americans. </p><p>CNN's Rene Marsh joins us now.</p><p>Rene, it's a great point here to explore because often folks will think these regulations are something off in the distance, might make you feel good but doesn't really affect your life. This does, does it not? It affects the water coming out of the tap that you and your kids drink. </p><p>RENE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. I mean environmentalists are sounding the alarm extremely loudly today just for that reason, Jim, because they believe these small streams, these waterways, they all are sources, as you say, sources of tap water. They help filter larger bodies of water. </p><p>But here's the story. In about another two hours or so, the Trump administration is set to announce that they will weaken these federal clean water rules. This would impact, we're talking about millions of acres of wetlands, thousands of acres of streams that run through the United States. </p><p>The way this worked under the Obama administration was that the EPA regulated these smaller bodies of water, these streams and these wetlands. And they said essentially certain crops or pesticides could not be used near these streams and wetlands. This was a way to keep pesticides and other pollutants out of those waterways. </p><p>Well now, as I said, in just a couple hours from now, the Trump administration will loosen those regulations, and those rules will no longer be in place. And, of course, environmentalists are saying, look, this will impact things like drinking water. However, the argument on the other side, namely from the Trump administration, is that this was an example of federal government taking way too much control over land that belonged to farmers and farmers had to essentially run it by the EPA if they wanted to plant things or plant certain crops on their own land. </p><p>But, again, this is a controversial move, and we expect to hear lots of pushback, especially from environmentalists after this announcement is made in just a couple hours from now. </p><p>Jim.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes, fertilizers are a big pollutant. They end up in drinking water everywhere and it's a relevant issue. HARLOW: Yes. </p><p>SCIUTTO: Rene Marsh, thanks very much.</p><p>Newly released documents paint a disturbing picture of the Sandy Hook killer. Ahead, what those papers reveal about the years leading up to that just horrendous shooting.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[09:57:16] SCIUTTO: Nearly six years, if you can believe it, after the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, we are getting a new and disturbing look into the inner workings of the shooter' mind. And I have to say, whenever we talk about this story, my heart goes into my throat. </p><p>HARLOW: Oh, these kids. We will all remember that day, December 14, 2012, when Adam Lanza killed his mother before going into the Sandy Hook Elementary School, murdering 26 people, including 20 children. He then took his own life, and now state investigators in Connecticut have released more than 1,000 pages of his journals and documents showing that years before the shooting he displayed so many red flags. </p><p>Our Jean Casarez has the details. </p><p>Good morning. </p><p>JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know it's really stunning to read what \"The Current\" is reporting on. They got this exclusively. Such a negativity with all of his writings and the assessment by professionals. </p><p>These documents and writing of the Sandy Hook shooter, Adam Lanza, have never been made public before, until now. \"The Hartford Current\" was able to obtain over 1,000 documents from the Connecticut State Police after a five-year legal battle verve eventually decided by the state supreme court. </p><p>The documents included Lanza's own writing, as long with assessments from mental health professionals prior to December 2012 when Lanza shot and killed 20 first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School after shooting his own mother to death. </p><p>While we knew the 20-year-old had led a life of isolation, we now know that Lanza was evaluated in 2006, six years before the mass shooting, by Robert King, a professor of child psychiatry at the Yale Child Study Center. According to the newspaper's reporting, King asked him if there were kids that he enjoyed spending time with. A 14-year-old Lanza replied, why would that be significant? According to the doctor's notes, he appeared pale, gaunt, awkward, and standing rigidly with his eyes downcast, declining to shake hands, tremulous with discomfort and looking miserable. Dr. King's report stated in part, it was difficult to interpret what this increasing social withdrawal and reclusiveness represents, but stated that his homebound education was a mistake.  Many of Lanza's writings, according to \"The Current,\" were not dated. But at one point he wrote a list of his problems, including the lights were too bright, there were too many dirty dishes, and referring to his mother, you were in the room while I was in the kitchen. I am unable to distinguish between my problems, he wrote, because I have too many. </p><p>[09:59:55] At another point he writes in what appears to be an online communication with a fellow gamer, I incessantly have nothing other than scorn for humanity. I have been desperate to feel anything positive for someone </p><p>[Byline: Poppy Harlow, Jim Sciutto, Matt Rivers, Alison Kosik, Rene Marsh, Jean Casarez] [Guest: Sean Captain] [High: China has detained a former Canadian diplomat.

A former Canadian diplomat has reportedly been detained in China. </p><p> JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, is this tit for tat?</p><p> HARLOW: Right.</p><p> SCIUTTO: This as Meng Wanzou, CEO of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei, hears her fate today in a bail hearing in Vancouver. She was arrested ten days ago in Canada and faces extradition now to the U.S., allegedly for helping her company circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. </p><p> Joining us now is CNN's Matt Rivers in Beijing with more. </p><p> Matt, this, as you know, was a concern because China has done this in the past. I mean, in effect, I don't know if you want to call it hostage taking, but retaliatory arrests when you have situations like this. Is that how it's being read in Beijing? </p><p> MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's certainly the speculation in the x-pac (ph) community here, those of us who are from, you know, other countries living here in China, that is the speculation that's rampant right now. </p><p> Now, to be clear, we don't know for a fact that China detained this former Canadian ambassador named Michael Kovrig as punishment in retaliation for what happened to the CFO of Huawei, Meng Wanzou. But it is certainly a possibility given the timing. So this diplomat, former diplomat, works for an NGO called the International Crisis Group. Here was traveling here in Beijing, usually based out of Hong Kong. Here in the mainland, though, and the NGO, ICG, actually put out a statement saying they believe he has been detained by Chinese authorities. </p><p> And like you said, Jim, this does happen every now and then. Not with regular occurrence, but it does happen where China takes into custody western NGO workers for a number of different reasons. But this jumps off the page because of the timing of all this. </p><p> You mentioned Meng is going to have a 1:00 p.m. bail hearing in Canada. But I can tell you that there has been incredible uproar here in China over what they -- the Chinese state media is calling Meng's unfair treatment, basically trampling on her human rights is what one state-run newspaper editorial wrote. So there has been the fear here that retaliation could be coming in some form. And what we could be seeing here with the detention of this former Canadian diplomat is a form of retaliation. </p><p> Jim. Poppy.</p><p> SCIUTTO: Yes. and that, of course, will spark talk of maybe a trade to diffuse it. </p><p> HARLOW: Yes.</p><p> SCIUTTO: Matt Rivers in Beijing, thanks very much.</p><p> Right now, listen, the market has been watching these China trade talks with some fear, some trepidation. Right now they are surging. Of course the president tweeted earlier today that there is progress. Not clear what that progress is.</p><p> HARLOW: Right. We want the details. </p><p> Let's go to Alison Kosik at the New York Stock Exchange with more.</p><p> The markets like what they're seeing this morning, but, wow, what a whiplash we've seen over the past few weeks down there. </p><p> ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you said it. And you're talking trade. And trade, guys, has really been the driver to all this volatility we've been seeing in the markets, not just last week but yesterday. Yesterday was a real wild one where we saw the Dow drop more than 500 points and then make a total u-turn and end in the green yesterday. </p><p> This morning we are seeing a solidly higher open. The Dow up more than 350 points on positive news about trade. We learned that there was a phone call between secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Trade Adviser Robert Lighthizer, and the top trade negotiator for China. And on this phone call they apparently discussed a timeline for these trade negotiations and even possibly implementing some of the agreements that were made on the sidelines of the G-20 in Argentina a couple of weekends ago. </p><p> So this positive news is buoying the market forward. But the idea here is, don't get too complacent because if there's a negative headline that comes out about trade, you can see the markets make yet another u-turn. </p><p> There are also other concerns lingering in the background. I'm talking about the Brexit chaos, those geopolitical issues, about what's going to happen with Brexit now that Prime Minister Theresa May pulled that vote from parliament yesterday. And then the questions of, what is the Fed going to do when it comes to interest rates. Yes, it is expected interest rates will go up in December, but the question is, what will happen in 2019? That continues to weigh on the markets. We will be watching closely. </p><p> Poppy. Jim.</p><p> HARLOW: Alison, we will. You'll be there. Thank you so much.</p><p> So ahead for us, he has avoided the political spotlight pretty much completely until now. We're talking about Google's CEO. That changes in minutes. He will take the hot seat on Capitol Hill. He is testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. What is it about? It is largely about accusations that Google search results unfairly target conservatives. Google has said that is unfounded. But what will the CEO say when he takes questions?</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [09:39:20] HARLOW: In minutes Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, testifies before Congress for the first time. The first time he'll ever publically testify on Capitol Hill. He's expected to respond to claims of political bias by the president and other top Republicans. In August, the president blasted Google, accusing it of, quote, rigging search results against him and, quote, suppressing the voice of conservatives. Google defended its search engine, insisting it is not used to set a political agenda. </p><p> But the tech giant reportedly not taking any chances when it comes to preparing its CEO. \"The Washington Post\" is reporting this morning Google spent $17 million this year lobbying regulators to gather intel on what the CEO could be asked today. That's according to top aides of members of the House Judiciary Committee. </p><p> [09:40:04] Earlier this morning I spoke with a Google executive who told me lawmakers will be, quote, pleasantly surprised at how thoughtful Pichai is and his willingness to roll up his sleeves and work with Washington on regulation. </p><p> Sean Captain joins me. He's a reporter for \"Fast Company.\" He's written extensively about this.</p><p> Good morning.</p><p> And I think we're all anticipating this. It is going to be really important on a number of levels.</p><p> We know a little bit about what Sundar is going to say, so let me read some of this prepared testimony for everyone. Quote, I lead this company without political bias. He goes on to say, to do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests. We are a company that provides platforms for diverse perspectives and opinions. </p><p> This is his first time in the spotlight. What are you expecting? </p><p> SEAN CAPTAIN, REPORTER, \"FAST COMPANY\": Well, having read that testimony and looked at all of it --</p><p> HARLOW: Yes. CAPTAIN: He's definitely trying to portray Google as the all-American company. He made a lot of emphasis around that, that they're, you know, they're an American brand, that they're good for America, that they're -- you know, have the country's best interest at heart. And he's clearly trying to play to that notion that, you know, we're on your side, which is going to be tricky because there's a lot of reasons why people feel that he has not -- they've not served America well. </p><p> HARLOW: So, in terms of some of the political accusations against Google, the president made them, didn't back it up with evidence. But there is something from -- Breitbart surfaced this. OK, you'll remember Sergey Brin speaking after the election. I think we have a full screen we can pull up here, this video that we cans how you. </p><p> Or actually we can play it for you because listen to this. </p><p> CAPTAIN: OK.</p><p> HARLOW: This is where some of the Republican criticism comes from. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SERGEY BRIN, GOOGLE CO-FOUNDER: As an immigrant and a refugee, I am -- I certainly find the selection deeply offensive. And I know many of you do, too. And I think it's a very stressful time, and it conflicts with many of our values. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HARLOW: Now, a Google executive responding to that said, look, there is nothing to suggest any political bias in that. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said to expect questions on this today. I mean, how will Google's CEO respond to that? Do you think he'll say, look, Sergey Brin, you know, the co-founder, shouldn't have said that? </p><p> CAPTAIN: Probably no. I think probably the way that you characterize that, saying that, you know, their -- the way that Google spokesperson had characterized it, saying that there's nothing inherently bias. He's just showing that there, you know, concern about what's happening in the country. I think Google's going to do a lot of what Google does, what tech companies do, is stand behind the technology, saying the algorithm is sound. You know, we're based on data science. We're, you know, bringing back the results that, you know, are most valuable without any bias in them. And it's very easy to out tech politicians. </p><p> HARLOW: Yes. </p><p> But you do write in your piece this morning, which is important to note, that it doesn't make any sense for Google to even try to alienate any one of any certain political strife. I mean they're not going to lay out all the secrets of their algorithm here, but that that wouldn't even be a smart business move by Google to do that one way or the other. </p><p> CAPTAIN: I mean Google's an advertising company ultimately. HARLOW: Right.</p><p> CAPTAIN: I mean the more eyeballs they get, the better. </p><p> HARLOW: China. You hope that China will come up today. I think it's a very important topic that lawmakers should ask about today. The code name for Google's exploration, shall I say, into China is Dragon Fly. And reports that it is exploring expanding into China with a censored search engine has even caused uproar within the company and it's caused some to protest, some employees of Goggle to protest. This is an area of common ground, of concern for Republican and Democratic lawmakers. What should we expect on that front today? </p><p> CAPTAIN: Well, yes, this is where, when I was looking at his comments about what a patriotic company Google is, this is what I think might have been in his mind because on the left, obviously -- well, on all sides, but especially on the left, there's a concern about the human rights abuses in China, especially the situation with the Weger (ph) concentration camps.</p><p> HARLOW: Yes.</p><p> CAPTAIN: On the right, there is that, plus the notion of saying, hey, Google, you -- kind of funny. Hey, Google, you dropped out of a Pentagon contract, Maven (ph), to provide AI to the Pentagon. So you're -- you know, you're abandoning the U.S., but now you're cozying up with China. So it took a double whammy and I think they're going to take a hard hit on both sides for that. </p><p> HARLOW: Before you go, I do want to read part of this testimony at the end here because he says we recognize the important role of government in setting rules for the development and use of technology. He has seemed, I would say, Sean, consistently open to the clearly coming regulation from Congress on big tech. What's your read? </p><p> CAPTAIN: Yes. I think -- I mean it's been pushed for so many reasons because of, getting back to that earlier concern about conservative bias or liberal bias, California's new regulation, European new regulation. I think -- I mean the handwriting is on every single wall at this point and they have to try to show that they're proactive and try to take -- sort of control the narrative to the extent that they can on that.</p><p> [09:45:20] HARLOW: OK. Well, we'll be watching. This testimony begins in about 15 minutes.</p><p> Sean, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p> Sean Captain from \"Fast Company.\" Appreciate it.</p><p> CAPTAIN: Thanks.</p><p> HARLOW: Today, the Trump administration is expected to roll back environmental protection on waterways across the country. How this major overhaul could affect the drinking water used by millions of Americans. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [09:50:06] HARLOW: All right, this morning we've learned the EPA is preparing to roll back protections that shield streams and wetlands across the country from industrial waste and other pollutants. This proposal would change which bodies of water all over this nation are protected under the Clean Water Act. </p><p> SCIUTTO: It's a change President Trump has wanted since taking office, but environmentalists and others say the shift could endanger drinking water used by millions of Americans. </p><p>CNN's Rene Marsh joins us now.</p><p> Rene, it's a great point here to explore because often folks will think these regulations are something off in the distance, might make you feel good but doesn't really affect your life. This does, does it not? It affects the water coming out of the tap that you and your kids drink. </p><p> RENE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. I mean environmentalists are sounding the alarm extremely loudly today just for that reason, Jim, because they believe these small streams, these waterways, they all are sources, as you say, sources of tap water. They help filter larger bodies of water. </p><p> But here's the story. In about another two hours or so, the Trump administration is set to announce that they will weaken these federal clean water rules. This would impact, we're talking about millions of acres of wetlands, thousands of acres of streams that run through the United States. </p><p> The way this worked under the Obama administration was that the EPA regulated these smaller bodies of water, these streams and these wetlands. And they said essentially certain crops or pesticides could not be used near these streams and wetlands. This was a way to keep pesticides and other pollutants out of those waterways. </p><p> Well now, as I said, in just a couple hours from now, the Trump administration will loosen those regulations, and those rules will no longer be in place. And, of course, environmentalists are saying, look, this will impact things like drinking water. However, the argument on the other side, namely from the Trump administration, is that this was an example of federal government taking way too much control over land that belonged to farmers and farmers had to essentially run it by the EPA if they wanted to plant things or plant certain crops on their own land. </p><p> But, again, this is a controversial move, and we expect to hear lots of pushback, especially from environmentalists after this announcement is made in just a couple hours from now. </p><p> Jim.</p><p> SCIUTTO: Yes, fertilizers are a big pollutant. They end up in drinking water everywhere and it's a relevant issue. HARLOW: Yes. </p><p> SCIUTTO: Rene Marsh, thanks very much.</p><p> Newly released documents paint a disturbing picture of the Sandy Hook killer. Ahead, what those papers reveal about the years leading up to that just horrendous shooting.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [09:57:16] SCIUTTO: Nearly six years, if you can believe it, after the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, we are getting a new and disturbing look into the inner workings of the shooter' mind. And I have to say, whenever we talk about this story, my heart goes into my throat. </p><p> HARLOW: Oh, these kids. We will all remember that day, December 14, 2012, when Adam Lanza killed his mother before going into the Sandy Hook Elementary School, murdering 26 people, including 20 children. He then took his own life, and now state investigators in Connecticut have released more than 1,000 pages of his journals and documents showing that years before the shooting he displayed so many red flags. </p><p> Our Jean Casarez has the details. </p><p> Good morning. </p><p> JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know it's really stunning to read what \"The Current\" is reporting on. They got this exclusively. Such a negativity with all of his writings and the assessment by professionals. </p><p> These documents and writing of the Sandy Hook shooter, Adam Lanza, have never been made public before, until now. \"The Hartford Current\" was able to obtain over 1,000 documents from the Connecticut State Police after a five-year legal battle verve eventually decided by the state supreme court. </p><p> The documents included Lanza's own writing, as long with assessments from mental health professionals prior to December 2012 when Lanza shot and killed 20 first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School after shooting his own mother to death. </p><p> While we knew the 20-year-old had led a life of isolation, we now know that Lanza was evaluated in 2006, six years before the mass shooting, by Robert King, a professor of child psychiatry at the Yale Child Study Center. According to the newspaper's reporting, King asked him if there were kids that he enjoyed spending time with. A 14-year-old Lanza replied, why would that be significant? According to the doctor's notes, he appeared pale, gaunt, awkward, and standing rigidly with his eyes downcast, declining to shake hands, tremulous with discomfort and looking miserable. Dr. King's report stated in part, it was difficult to interpret what this increasing social withdrawal and reclusiveness represents, but stated that his homebound education was a mistake.  Many of Lanza's writings, according to \"The Current,\" were not dated. But at one point he wrote a list of his problems, including the lights were too bright, there were too many dirty dishes, and referring to his mother, you were in the room while I was in the kitchen. I am unable to distinguish between my problems, he wrote, because I have too many. </p><p> [09:59:55] At another point he writes in what appears to be an online communication with a fellow gamer, I incessantly have nothing other than scorn for humanity. I have been desperate to feel anything positive for someone </p><p> [Byline: Poppy Harlow, Jim Sciutto, Matt Rivers, Alison Kosik, Rene Marsh, Jean Casarez] [Guest: Sean Captain] [High: China has detained a former Canadian diplomat.

A former Canadian diplomat has reportedly been detained in China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR: Yes, is this tit for tat?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HARLOW: Right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCIUTTO: This as Meng Wanzou, CEO of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei, hears her fate today in a bail hearing in Vancouver. She was arrested ten days ago in Canada and faces extradition now to the U.S., allegedly for helping her company circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Joining us now is CNN's Matt Rivers in Beijing with more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Matt, this, as you know, was a concern because China has done this in the past. I mean, in effect, I don't know if you want to call it hostage taking, but retaliatory arrests when you have situations like this. Is that how it's being read in Beijing?</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's certainly the speculation in the x-pac (ph) community here, those of us who are from, you know, other countries living here in China, that is the speculation that's rampant right now.</p><p>Now, to be clear, we don't know for a fact that China detained this former Canadian ambassador named Michael Kovrig as punishment in retaliation for what happened to the CFO of Huawei, Meng Wanzou. But it is certainly a possibility given the timing. So this diplomat, former diplomat, works for an NGO called the International Crisis Group. Here was traveling here in Beijing, usually based out of Hong Kong. Here in the mainland, though, and the NGO, ICG, actually put out a statement saying they believe he has been detained by Chinese authorities.</p><p>And like you said, Jim, this does happen every now and then. Not with regular occurrence, but it does happen where China takes into custody western NGO workers for a number of different reasons. But this jumps off the page because of the timing of all this.</p><p>You mentioned Meng is going to have a 1:00 p.m. bail hearing in Canada. But I can tell you that there has been incredible uproar here in China over what they -- the Chinese state media is calling Meng's unfair treatment, basically trampling on her human rights is what one state-run newspaper editorial wrote. So there has been the fear here that retaliation could be coming in some form. And what we could be seeing here with the detention of this former Canadian diplomat is a form of retaliation.</p><p>Jim. Poppy.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes. and that, of course, will spark talk of maybe a trade to diffuse it.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Matt Rivers in Beijing, thanks very much.</p><p>Right now, listen, the market has been watching these China trade talks with some fear, some trepidation. Right now they are surging. Of course the president tweeted earlier today that there is progress. Not clear what that progress is.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. We want the details.</p><p>Let's go to Alison Kosik at the New York Stock Exchange with more.</p><p>The markets like what they're seeing this morning, but, wow, what a whiplash we've seen over the past few weeks down there.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you said it. And you're talking trade. And trade, guys, has really been the driver to all this volatility we've been seeing in the markets, not just last week but yesterday. Yesterday was a real wild one where we saw the Dow drop more than 500 points and then make a total u-turn and end in the green yesterday.</p><p>This morning we are seeing a solidly higher open. The Dow up more than 350 points on positive news about trade. We learned that there was a phone call between secretary -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Trade Adviser Robert Lighthizer, and the top trade negotiator for China. And on this phone call they apparently discussed a timeline for these trade negotiations and even possibly implementing some of the agreements that were made on the sidelines of the G-20 in Argentina a couple of weekends ago.</p><p>So this positive news is buoying the market forward. But the idea here is, don't get too complacent because if there's a negative headline that comes out about trade, you can see the markets make yet another u-turn.</p><p>There are also other concerns lingering in the background. I'm talking about the Brexit chaos, those geopolitical issues, about what's going to happen with Brexit now that Prime Minister Theresa May pulled that vote from parliament yesterday. And then the questions of, what is the Fed going to do when it comes to interest rates. Yes, it is expected interest rates will go up in December, but the question is, what will happen in 2019? That continues to weigh on the markets. We will be watching closely.</p><p>Poppy. Jim.</p><p>HARLOW: Alison, we will. You'll be there. Thank you so much.</p><p>So ahead for us, he has avoided the political spotlight pretty much completely until now. We're talking about Google's CEO. That changes in minutes. He will take the hot seat on Capitol Hill. He is testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. What is it about? It is largely about accusations that Google search results unfairly target conservatives. Google has said that is unfounded. But what will the CEO say when he takes questions?</p><p>[09:39:20] HARLOW: In minutes Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, testifies before Congress for the first time. The first time he'll ever publically testify on Capitol Hill. He's expected to respond to claims of political bias by the president and other top Republicans. In August, the president blasted Google, accusing it of, quote, rigging search results against him and, quote, suppressing the voice of conservatives. Google defended its search engine, insisting it is not used to set a political agenda.</p><p>But the tech giant reportedly not taking any chances when it comes to preparing its CEO. \"The Washington Post\" is reporting this morning Google spent $17 million this year lobbying regulators to gather intel on what the CEO could be asked today. That's according to top aides of members of the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>[09:40:04] Earlier this morning I spoke with a Google executive who told me lawmakers will be, quote, pleasantly surprised at how thoughtful Pichai is and his willingness to roll up his sleeves and work with Washington on regulation.</p><p>Sean Captain joins me. He's a reporter for \"Fast Company.\" He's written extensively about this.</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>And I think we're all anticipating this. It is going to be really important on a number of levels.</p><p>We know a little bit about what Sundar is going to say, so let me read some of this prepared testimony for everyone. Quote, I lead this company without political bias. He goes on to say, to do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests. We are a company that provides platforms for diverse perspectives and opinions.</p><p>This is his first time in the spotlight. What are you expecting?</p><p>SEAN CAPTAIN, REPORTER, \"FAST COMPANY\": Well, having read that testimony and looked at all of it --</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. CAPTAIN: He's definitely trying to portray Google as the all-American company. He made a lot of emphasis around that, that they're, you know, they're an American brand, that they're good for America, that they're -- you know, have the country's best interest at heart. And he's clearly trying to play to that notion that, you know, we're on your side, which is going to be tricky because there's a lot of reasons why people feel that he has not -- they've not served America well.</p><p>HARLOW: So, in terms of some of the political accusations against Google, the president made them, didn't back it up with evidence. But there is something from -- Breitbart surfaced this. OK, you'll remember Sergey Brin speaking after the election. I think we have a full screen we can pull up here, this video that we cans how you.</p><p>Or actually we can play it for you because listen to this.</p><p>CAPTAIN: OK.</p><p>HARLOW: This is where some of the Republican criticism comes from.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERGEY BRIN, GOOGLE CO-FOUNDER: As an immigrant and a refugee, I am -- I certainly find the selection deeply offensive. And I know many of you do, too. And I think it's a very stressful time, and it conflicts with many of our values.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Now, a Google executive responding to that said, look, there is nothing to suggest any political bias in that. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said to expect questions on this today. I mean, how will Google's CEO respond to that? Do you think he'll say, look, Sergey Brin, you know, the co-founder, shouldn't have said that?</p><p>CAPTAIN: Probably no. I think probably the way that you characterize that, saying that, you know, their -- the way that Google spokesperson had characterized it, saying that there's nothing inherently bias. He's just showing that there, you know, concern about what's happening in the country. I think Google's going to do a lot of what Google does, what tech companies do, is stand behind the technology, saying the algorithm is sound. You know, we're based on data science. We're, you know, bringing back the results that, you know, are most valuable without any bias in them. And it's very easy to out tech politicians.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>But you do write in your piece this morning, which is important to note, that it doesn't make any sense for Google to even try to alienate any one of any certain political strife. I mean they're not going to lay out all the secrets of their algorithm here, but that that wouldn't even be a smart business move by Google to do that one way or the other.</p><p>CAPTAIN: I mean Google's an advertising company ultimately. HARLOW: Right.</p><p>CAPTAIN: I mean the more eyeballs they get, the better.</p><p>HARLOW: China. You hope that China will come up today. I think it's a very important topic that lawmakers should ask about today. The code name for Google's exploration, shall I say, into China is Dragon Fly. And reports that it is exploring expanding into China with a censored search engine has even caused uproar within the company and it's caused some to protest, some employees of Goggle to protest. This is an area of common ground, of concern for Republican and Democratic lawmakers. What should we expect on that front today?</p><p>CAPTAIN: Well, yes, this is where, when I was looking at his comments about what a patriotic company Google is, this is what I think might have been in his mind because on the left, obviously -- well, on all sides, but especially on the left, there's a concern about the human rights abuses in China, especially the situation with the Weger (ph) concentration camps.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>CAPTAIN: On the right, there is that, plus the notion of saying, hey, Google, you -- kind of funny. Hey, Google, you dropped out of a Pentagon contract, Maven (ph), to provide AI to the Pentagon. So you're -- you know, you're abandoning the U.S., but now you're cozying up with China. So it took a double whammy and I think they're going to take a hard hit on both sides for that.</p><p>HARLOW: Before you go, I do want to read part of this testimony at the end here because he says we recognize the important role of government in setting rules for the development and use of technology. He has seemed, I would say, Sean, consistently open to the clearly coming regulation from Congress on big tech. What's your read?</p><p>CAPTAIN: Yes. I think -- I mean it's been pushed for so many reasons because of, getting back to that earlier concern about conservative bias or liberal bias, California's new regulation, European new regulation. I think -- I mean the handwriting is on every single wall at this point and they have to try to show that they're proactive and try to take -- sort of control the narrative to the extent that they can on that.</p><p>[09:45:20] HARLOW: OK. Well, we'll be watching. This testimony begins in about 15 minutes.</p><p>Sean, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>Sean Captain from \"Fast Company.\" Appreciate it.</p><p>CAPTAIN: Thanks.</p><p>HARLOW: Today, the Trump administration is expected to roll back environmental protection on waterways across the country. How this major overhaul could affect the drinking water used by millions of Americans. That's next.</p><p>[09:50:06] HARLOW: All right, this morning we've learned the EPA is preparing to roll back protections that shield streams and wetlands across the country from industrial waste and other pollutants. This proposal would change which bodies of water all over this nation are protected under the Clean Water Act.</p><p>SCIUTTO: It's a change President Trump has wanted since taking office, but environmentalists and others say the shift could endanger drinking water used by millions of Americans.</p><p>CNN's Rene Marsh joins us now.</p><p>Rene, it's a great point here to explore because often folks will think these regulations are something off in the distance, might make you feel good but doesn't really affect your life. This does, does it not? It affects the water coming out of the tap that you and your kids drink.</p><p>RENE MARSH, CNN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. I mean environmentalists are sounding the alarm extremely loudly today just for that reason, Jim, because they believe these small streams, these waterways, they all are sources, as you say, sources of tap water. They help filter larger bodies of water.</p><p>But here's the story. In about another two hours or so, the Trump administration is set to announce that they will weaken these federal clean water rules. This would impact, we're talking about millions of acres of wetlands, thousands of acres of streams that run through the United States.</p><p>The way this worked under the Obama administration was that the EPA regulated these smaller bodies of water, these streams and these wetlands. And they said essentially certain crops or pesticides could not be used near these streams and wetlands. This was a way to keep pesticides and other pollutants out of those waterways.</p><p>Well now, as I said, in just a couple hours from now, the Trump administration will loosen those regulations, and those rules will no longer be in place. And, of course, environmentalists are saying, look, this will impact things like drinking water. However, the argument on the other side, namely from the Trump administration, is that this was an example of federal government taking way too much control over land that belonged to farmers and farmers had to essentially run it by the EPA if they wanted to plant things or plant certain crops on their own land.</p><p>But, again, this is a controversial move, and we expect to hear lots of pushback, especially from environmentalists after this announcement is made in just a couple hours from now.</p><p>Jim.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Yes, fertilizers are a big pollutant. They end up in drinking water everywhere and it's a relevant issue. HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>SCIUTTO: Rene Marsh, thanks very much.</p><p>Newly released documents paint a disturbing picture of the Sandy Hook killer. Ahead, what those papers reveal about the years leading up to that just horrendous shooting.</p><p>[09:57:16] SCIUTTO: Nearly six years, if you can believe it, after the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, we are getting a new and disturbing look into the inner workings of the shooter' mind. And I have to say, whenever we talk about this story, my heart goes into my throat.</p><p>HARLOW: Oh, these kids. We will all remember that day, December 14, 2012, when Adam Lanza killed his mother before going into the Sandy Hook Elementary School, murdering 26 people, including 20 children. He then took his own life, and now state investigators in Connecticut have released more than 1,000 pages of his journals and documents showing that years before the shooting he displayed so many red flags.</p><p>Our Jean Casarez has the details.</p><p>Good morning.</p><p>JEAN CASAREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: You know it's really stunning to read what \"The Current\" is reporting on. They got this exclusively. Such a negativity with all of his writings and the assessment by professionals.</p><p>These documents and writing of the Sandy Hook shooter, Adam Lanza, have never been made public before, until now. \"The Hartford Current\" was able to obtain over 1,000 documents from the Connecticut State Police after a five-year legal battle verve eventually decided by the state supreme court.</p><p>The documents included Lanza's own writing, as long with assessments from mental health professionals prior to December 2012 when Lanza shot and killed 20 first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School after shooting his own mother to death.</p><p>While we knew the 20-year-old had led a life of isolation, we now know that Lanza was evaluated in 2006, six years before the mass shooting, by Robert King, a professor of child psychiatry at the Yale Child Study Center. According to the newspaper's reporting, King asked him if there were kids that he enjoyed spending time with. A 14-year-old Lanza replied, why would that be significant? According to the doctor's notes, he appeared pale, gaunt, awkward, and standing rigidly with his eyes downcast, declining to shake hands, tremulous with discomfort and looking miserable. Dr. King's report stated in part, it was difficult to interpret what this increasing social withdrawal and reclusiveness represents, but stated that his homebound education was a mistake.

I am unable to distinguish between my problems, he wrote, because I have too many.</p><p>[09:59:55] At another point he writes in what appears to be an online communication with a fellow gamer, I incessantly have nothing other than scorn for humanity. I have been desperate to feel anything positive for someone</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2018121102CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY5-3K71-JB20-G35P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2937\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 11, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>INTERNATIONAL CRISIS GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Just six U.S.-dollar funds with exposure to China have sought to raise capital this year, down from 21 last year, according to researcher Preqin. Of those, only one has managed to complete a preliminary closing, compared with 10 last year.    It\u2019s a drastic reversal of the venture boom that fueled China\u2019s tech industry in the past decade. The U.S. State Department has asked colleges and universities to divest from Chinese holdings in their endowments, warning of potentially more onerous measures on holding the shares. That\u2019s on top of a wider campaign to curb Chinese tech champions and slow the money flowing into what are some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and TikTok owner Bytedance Ltd.    \u201cA total decoupling of U.S. funding and Chinese technology would also hurt American investors,\u201d said JP Gan, founding partner of Ince Capital, which last year raised $352 million for its first fund with the backing of University of Pittsburgh, Duke University and Carnegie Mellon University.    \u201cU.S. pension funds and endowments have been the biggest beneficiaries from investing in the China growth story,\u201d he said.    While some venture funds including DCM and Jeneration Capital were able to close financing rounds this year, those efforts started last year. Preqin tallies the initiation of a fund based on public filings such as with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.    The coronavirus has hit funds globally. In the U.S., while fund launches didn\u2019t see as drastic a fall in relative terms, new funds with U.S. exposure seeking money fell by 6% to 646. The number of funds that managed to complete an interim closing fell 76% to 14 compared with last year.    Investors raising U.S.-dollar funds to target China\u2019s fast-growing tech industry usually seek backing from American pensions or endowments. That backing has helped create some of the biggest private tech firms like artificial-intelligence giant SenseTime Group Ltd. \u2014 currently fundraising at an $8.5 billion valuation \u2014 and Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group, which could be worth $210 billion based on Bernstein estimates.    Some of the world\u2019s biggest private equity funds, including Silver Lake Management LLC, Carlyle Group Inc. and Warburg Pincus LLC, have pinned their growth on investing in Chinese companies. All three put at least $500 million in Ant and stand to generate up to 40% returns when the firm goes public.    Chinese companies can still look to listing in Hong Kong to allow investors to realize their gains. And in recent years, investors shaken by volatile markets have increasingly shifted to parking their money with the biggest funds with a proven track record.    The State Department\u2019s letter warned endowments it would be prudent to divest from Chinese stocks in the \u201clikely outcome\u201d of a wholesale de-listing of Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges by the end of next year.    The U.S. Senate in May passed a bill that threatens to remove all Chinese companies from U.S stock exchanges, unless a U.S. accounting regulator is allowed to inspect their auditors. The House of Representatives has also acted on its version of the bill, making it more likely that some form of legislation will be enacted.    Those bills were initiated in the fallout of scandals at Luckin Coffee Inc. and TAL Education Group.    The global market value of Chinese firms facing delisting from the U.S. totaled $1.9 trillion at the end of 2019, according to Will Cai, a partner and head of capital markets at law firm Cooley Asia.    These companies have generally outperformed their American peers. The BNY Mellon China ADR Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese firms, surged more than 389% in the past 16 years, versus 208% for the S&amp;P 500 Index.    \u201cAmerican investors could lose the opportunity to cash out their billions of dollars of investment before a company starts generating returns, and lose a channel to invest in growth,\u201d said Cai.

The number of funds that managed to complete an interim closing fell 76 per cent to 14 compared with last year.</p><p>Investors raising US-dollar funds to target China's fast-growing tech industry usually seek backing from American pensions or endowments. That backing has helped create some of the biggest private tech firms like artificial-intelligence giant SenseTime Group - currently fundraising at an US$8.5 billion (S$11.7 billion) valuation - and Jack Ma's Ant Group, which could be worth US$210 billion based on Bernstein estimates.</p><p>Some of the world's biggest private equity funds, including Silver Lake Management, Carlyle Group and Warburg Pincus have pinned their growth on investing in Chinese companies.

Just six U.S.-dollar funds with exposure to China have sought to raise capital this year, down from 21 last year, according to researcher Preqin. Of those, only one has managed to complete a preliminary closing, compared with 10 last year.   It\u2019s a drastic reversal of the venture boom that fueled China\u2019s tech industry in the past decade. The U.S. State Department has asked colleges and universities to divest from Chinese holdings in their endowments, warning of potentially more onerous measures on holding the shares. That\u2019s on top of a wider campaign to curb Chinese tech champions and slow the money flowing into what are some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and TikTok owner Bytedance Ltd.   \u201cA total decoupling of U.S. funding and Chinese technology would also hurt American investors,\u201d said JP Gan, founding partner of Ince Capital, which last year raised $352 million for its first fund with the backing of University of Pittsburgh, Duke University and Carnegie Mellon University.   \u201cU.S. pension funds and endowments have been the biggest beneficiaries from investing in the China growth story,\u201d he said.   While some venture funds including DCM and Jeneration Capital were able to close financing rounds this year, those efforts started last year. Preqin tallies the initiation of a fund based on public filings such as with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.   The coronavirus has hit funds globally. In the U.S., while fund launches didn\u2019t see as drastic a fall in relative terms, new funds with U.S. exposure seeking money fell by 6 percent to 646. The number of funds that managed to complete an interim closing fell 76 percent to 14 compared with last year.   Investors raising U.S.-dollar funds to target China\u2019s fast-growing tech industry usually seek backing from American pensions or endowments. That backing has helped create some of the biggest private tech firms like artificial-intelligence giant SenseTime Group Ltd. \u2014 currently fundraising at an $8.5 billion valuation \u2014 and Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Group, which could be worth $210 billion based on Bernstein estimates.   Some of the world\u2019s biggest private equity funds, including Silver Lake Management LLC, Carlyle Group Inc. and Warburg Pincus LLC, have pinned their growth on investing in Chinese companies. All three put at least $500 million in Ant and stand to generate up to 40 percent returns when the firm goes public.   Chinese companies can still look to listing in Hong Kong to allow investors to realize their gains. And in recent years, investors shaken by volatile markets have increasingly shifted to parking their money with the biggest funds with a proven track record.   The State Department\u2019s letter warned endowments it would be prudent to divest from Chinese stocks in the \u201clikely outcome\u201d of a wholesale de-listing of Chinese companies from U.S. exchanges by the end of next year.   The U.S. Senate in May passed a bill that threatens to remove all Chinese companies from U.S stock exchanges, unless a U.S. accounting regulator is allowed to inspect their auditors. The House of Representatives has also acted on its version of the bill, making it more likely that some form of legislation will be enacted.   Those bills were initiated in the fallout of scandals at Luckin Coffee Inc. and TAL Education Group.   The global market value of Chinese firms facing delisting from the U.S. totaled $1.9 trillion at the end of 2019, according to Will Cai, a partner and head of capital markets at law firm Cooley Asia.   These companies have generally outperformed their American peers. The BNY Mellon China ADR Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese firms, surged more than 389 percent in the past 16 years, versus 208 percent for the S&amp;P 500 Index.   \u201cAmerican investors could lose the opportunity to cash out their billions of dollars of investment before a company starts generating returns, and lose a channel to invest in growth,\u201d said Cai.

They aren't paying by credit card either. In fact, I can't\u00a0see a single customer\u00a0holding a wallet or a purse. Instead, they just hold\u00a0their mobile\u00a0phones over\u00a0a reader\u00a0and - beep! - the latte is theirs. </p><p>\"Almost no one uses cash here anymore,\" says cafe manager Lily Li, adding that more than\u00a080% of all payments in the coffee shop are made via mobile\u00a0phones. But it's not just global chains that offer \"m-payment\" in one of China's most technologically advanced cities.\u00a0Out on the street, two women are selling\u00a0noodles from a small stall during\u00a0the morning rush. Amid\u00a0the steam billowing\u00a0from\u00a0the big boiler and the smell of hot spices, I can hear the constant beeping of phones scanning the stall's QR code.

Photo: Johan Nylander While digital payments are\u00a0dominated by debit or credit cards in many Western countries, China's consumers have jumped directly from cash to mobile. Of\u00a0the country's 710 million internet users - more than the United States and Europe combined - the utilization ratio of mobile online payments stands at 57.7%. Put in plain English, the majority of people who go online are\u00a0using their smartphones to pay for goods and services, primarily through Alibaba's Alipay or WeChat's payment service, according to a November\u00a0report by consulting firm Ernst Young and Singaporean bank DBS. \"I can hardly remember the last time I used my wallet,\" said Mofei Chen, founder and\u00a0CEO of Money Bazaar, a peer-to-peer currency exchange platform. Mofei Chen, founder and CEO of fintech startup Money Bazaar, at a co-working space SimplyWork. Photo: Johan Nylander He is one of many new entrepreneurs in a Chinese digital financial services industry that is undergoing explosive development. The EY/DBS report says China has leapfrogged ahead to become the undisputed center of global fintech innovation and adoption, outpacing London, New York, Silicon Valley, Singapore, Hong Kong and other global fintech hubs by a significant margin. Read: Travel giant seeks Shenzhen fintech boost \"Few foreigners realize how fast and advanced the development actually is in new payment features and mobile financial services in China,\" Chen said. Indeed, the world's four most valuable\u00a0fintech unicorns - a startup company worth\u00a0more than US$1 billion - are Chinese. The largest is Ant Financial, an\u00a0arm of e-commerce giant Alibaba, and is valued at US$60 billion. Second is the peer-to-peer lender Lufax (US$18.5 billion), followed by JD Finance (US$7 billion), a joint venture between\u00a0e-commerce site JD and Tencent, and then\u00a0instalment payment firm Qufenqi (US$5.9 billion). China is also the world's largest market for Bitcoin,\u00a0accounting for 42% of all transactions using the digital currency during the\u00a0first six months of 2016, according to Chainalysis. The surge of fintech services is a growing headache for traditional banks which have been left painfully behind in the competition for e-commerce and new payment methods. These new services are dominated\u00a0by the internet giants - Alibaba's Alipay, which\u00a0has more than\u00a050% market share, Tencent's WeChat Wallet, based on its popular instant messaging service, and the Google-like Baidu. The big tech companies are also investing heavily in smaller startups to access the next generation of financial services, including blockchain technology, as used by Bitcoin, and\u00a0artificial intelligence. Foreign competitors are limited by government restrictions, while Chinese payment apps are being rolled out abroad, mainly in other Asian markets such as Hong Kong and Japan. Meanwhile, China's\u00a0banking system remains relatively undeveloped. One in five Chinese adults don't have accounts, while around\u00a080% of small and medium-sized enterprises are not adequately served by banks. The new alternative financial firms, on the other hand, offer significantly better services and customer experience, lower fees and less bureaucracy. \"I hardly use my regular bank account anymore. My salary comes in at Alipay and I make most payments with the app. They also offer better interest rates than the regular banks,' said Allen Yu, a PhD in mathematics who\u00a0runs MJL, a stock picking service based on quantitative analysis. \"If I borrow money, I'll go to a peer-to-peer platform, not a bank.\" MJL's HQ #8230; at SimplyWork co-shared office space. Photo: Johan Nylander The interview with Chen and Yu takes place at SimplyWork, a co-shared office in one of Shenzhen's buzzing high-tech parks. Here, fintech startups blend with e-commerce and venture capital firms. Young entrepreneurs can be seen lying\u00a0on\u00a0sofas with laptops on their bellies, while others are having animated\u00a0conversations in small groups; toys and skateboards are strewn\u00a0across the floor, and fluffy pet dogs and cats are playing under the tables. Enthusiasm and creativity abound. \"The tech scene is booming. Finance technology has become a part of all aspects of life,\" says Yu. SimplyWork co-shared startup space in Shenzhen. Photo: Johan Nylander Still, China's financial technology companies face many challenges, and so do their users. The government's tightening grip on the internet, with censorship and individual control increasing significantly in recent years, threatens innovation and the development of new ideas. Also, thanks to the\u00a0array of new digital financial services, it is easier for the ruling Communist Party to\u00a0conduct massive intrusive surveillance. Hong Kong-based news agency FactWire revealed in December that five Chinese mobile payment apps - WeChat, Taobao, Taobao World, Alipay and Tmall - already record sensitive information that people\u00a0store in their mobile devices, which can be used to track and monitor personal activities. Meanwhile, hustlers are flocking to the industry. Last year, about 900 peer-to-peer lenders went belly-up in China, with some owners taking the money and running. Authorities have conducted\u00a0many crackdowns and introduced tougher regulations, such as against Bitcoin platforms to stop the digital currency being used to smuggle money. Although venture capital has flowed into the sector, Chen says that investors have become more difficult to win over. \"They are more rational today. Much risk capital disappeared during last year's stock market crash,\" he says. On top of this, the technology is not always reliable. In demonstrating the efficiency of mobile payment apps, Chen\u00a0offered to buy\u00a0me a cup of coffee from a vending machine. After paying with his cell phone and pressing the button for espresso it was\u00a0not coffee that came out\u00a0- but milk. \"Oh, that was embarrassing,\" he said, but quickly finds an explanation. \"See, the machine is from Germany!\" China fintech facts \u2022 Country is home\u00a0to eight of the world's 27 current FinTech 'unicorns' - technology companies that investors value at more than US$1 billion. \u2022 There were 710 million internet users as of June (more than the US and Europe combined), bringing the\u00a0online penetration rate to 51.7%, from 1.8% in 2000 and 8.5% in 2005. At this pace, China will soon catch up with North America's 89% penetration and Europe's 73.9%. \u2022 China is already the world's largest and most developed retail e-commerce market, accounting for 47% of global digital retail sales - the result of a massive domestic retail market in a closed digital economy. \u2022 The smartphone is becoming the universal internet access device. As of\u00a030 June 2016, 656 million people, or 92.5% of users, were going online via connected devices, driven by the development of \"Smart City\" and \"Wireless City\" public access wireless networks in major cities. \u2022 Individuals making online payments with mobile devices hit 358 million at the end of 2015. The 64.5% increase\u00a0from a year earlier came despite rising concerns about the security of mobile finance activities. The utilization ratio of mobile online payments stood at 57.7%. \u2022 Mobile banking continued to expand\u00a0exponentially, with 6.3 billion transactions totalling 29.3 trillion yuan (US$4.4 trillion) in the second quarter of 2016.

China's growth slows: The world's second biggest economy grew 6.5% in the third quarter of this year. That's its worst performance since the depths of the global financial crisis in early 2009 and weaker than economists expected. Government efforts to rein in debt are putting the brakes on growth, and US tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese exports are set to make things worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chinese stock markets and the country's currency have been pummeled in recent months by fears about the economy and the trade war. Chinese officials made a rare, coordinated attempt on Friday to ease those concerns.</p><p>Central bank chief Yi Gang said that the market slump didn't reflect the state of the economy, which he described as \"moving forward\" in a stable manner. He added that the government would take more measures to support the economy. Similar comments were made by financial regulators and President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser.</p><p>Stocks in Shanghai closed up 2.6%, recovering most of Thursday's decline of almost 3%. The Shanghai Composite has lost 23% so far this year.</p><p>Some voices on Wall Street worry that a full-blown trade war with China, combined with Federal Reserve rate hikes, could lead to a recession in the United States by 2020.</p><p>\"A recession in the near-term is not inevitable, but the risk of one by 2020 has increased substantially in the past few months,\" Ronald Temple, head of US equity for Lazard Asset Management, told CNN Business. \"Take trade wars off the table and that significantly reduces the risk of recession.\"</p><p>2. Saudi Arabia and Silicon Valley: Saudi Arabia's global network of business ties and investments are coming under ever closer scrutiny as questions mount and the US government hardens its stance over the disappearance and apparent killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that he would not attend a major investment summit in Riyadh next week. Later that day, President Donald Trump said for the first time he believes Khashoggi is no longer alive. There would be \"severe\" consequences for Saudi Arabia if it is found to be involved in the killing, Trump added.</p><p>The crisis threatens big tech's budding relationship with the kingdom. Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL), among others, were hoping to develop new business as the oil-rich economy tries to diversify.</p><p>Japan's SoftBank (SFTBF), which has become a leading global tech investor with the help of Saudi cash, is at the center of attention. The SoftBank Vision Fund has pumped billions of dollars into startups around the world. Shares in SoftBank have slumped nearly 15% since October 2, when Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He hasn't been seen since.</p><p>3. Euro woes: The euro is under pressure, and Italian bond yields are rising after European officials fired off a stern warning to the government in Rome about its budget.</p><p>The European Commission wrote to Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria on Thursday, telling him that plans to boost the budget deficit may constitute a \"particularly serious non-compliance\" with EU rules designed to ensure the stability of the euro.</p><p>Italy's government debt stands at 130% of GDP. That's the second highest level in Europe after Greece. Inflating the budget deficit would further add to that huge mountain of debt.</p><p>Moody's is expected to publish its latest view of Italy's credit rating after European markets close.</p><p>4. Global market overview: Asian markets ended mostly higher, despite the disappointing China GDP data.</p><p>US stock futures were also moving higher, recovering from sharp falls on Thursday that accelerated after Mnuchin backed out of the Saudi conference.</p><p>European markets were weaker in early trading on Friday.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.3%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.4% and the Nasdaq sank 2.1%.</p><p>5. Stock market movers: Shares in PayPal (PYPL) were up about 6% in premarket trading, following a bumper earnings report on Thursday. AIG (AIG) fell about 4% premarket after it said it expected hefty pre-tax catastrophe losses in the third quarter related to a series of events including Hurricane Florence and typhoons in Japan.</p><p>6. Earnings and economics: Honeywell (HON), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), State Street (STT) and VF Corp (VFC) are set to release earnings before the open Friday.</p><p>7.

However, the technology could face a backlash once it touches a nerve with China's ruling authority.</p><p><br/> Last September, People.cn - the new media flagship of the party paper People's Daily - published a series of editorials lambasting the news app Jinri Toutiao, which prides itself on using AI to make user recommendations from a myriad of news sources.<br/> Jinri Toutiao, which means \"today's headline\" in Chinese, became a household name with its catchy tagline: \"The only headlines are the ones you care about.\" In its latest fundraising, Toutiao's parent company Bytedance had set its sights on surpassing US$30 billion in valuation, a source told The Information last December. That would make the five-year-old startup about 10 times as valuable as the 166-year-old New York Times. However, Toutiao's spokesperson told Tech in Asia that the company hasn't determined its valuation yet.<br/> The problem of Toutiao, the People.cn opinion piece says, is that it has allowed vulgar and clickbait content to flourish. \"Whether the content gets to be displayed and whom it goes to relies solely on one rule by the machine: Is this something eye-catching? This simplified standard not only overlooks quality and diversity too easily but also increases the difficulty and cost of content auditing,\" says one of the editorials.<br/> The AI factor<br/> In most cases, content in China falls under regulation for issues related to copyright and ethics - be it pornography, violence, or fake information. Media watchdogs also push for strict oversight during politically sensitive times to make sure that no one strays from core party values. Ahead of the Communist Party's twice-a-decade reshuffle that happened last October, Toutiao archrival Yidian Zixun, along with conventional news portals like Sohu, NetEase, and Tencent, was summoned to private chats with internet regulators to work on \"media cleansing.\"<br/> What's new about the critique of Toutiao is the AI factor, with the semi-official media calling attention to the app's \"social responsibility\" and the need for a human \"editor in chief.\"<br/> \"In any time, an 'editor in chief' cannot go missing in the process of content curation. A 'doorman' is required no matter how well the distribution channel works. Even in a time when technology is king, content cannot depend entirely on algorithms,\" says the People.cn opinion piece.<br/> \"The issue here is that AI is potentially a very powerful tool to shape news selection, and the Chinese leadership wants to make sure it has a hand in deciding how and what people read,\" suggests David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project and a fellow of the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin.<br/> \"It's not just about sensitive news coverage anymore. There is a tidal wave of choices out there now for information consumers, and the Party is as eager to ensure its message isn't drowned out in a flood of entertainment content as it is to ensure that a damaging story is kept under wraps,\" adds Bandurski.<br/> It's worth noting that while People.cn is a state-controlled media outlet, it's also listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. This means the site not only acts as a party mouthpiece but is also subject to market forces - just like Toutiao is. The accusation against Toutiao, for example, \"is one of those topics that could potentially go viral, given Toutiao's popularity,\" says a Beijing-based tech writer who prefers to be anonymous. 'Low taste'<br/> Following the denouncement, Toutiao responded with a letter vowing to improve its \"imperfect machine learning technology.\" The startup also stated that it had never actively sought to promote so-called \"low-taste\" content.<br/> \"We are always attacking [low-taste content] and clickbaits. In fact, the extremely vulgar content is all gone by now,\" said Toutiao founder and CEO Zhang Yiming during an interview in 2016. From the onset, the startup has positioned itself as an AI instead of a media company; its aim is to distribute content rather than produce it.<br/> \"An editor would inevitably make decisions based on his personal preferences, but Toutiao doesn't decide for users,\" Zhang noted. \"I think at the core of the debate is that Toutiao actually doesn't profit from vulgar content. In fact, it harms our business.\"<br/> But \"low taste\" hasn't prevented Toutiao from becoming an advertising darling. For 2017, the Beijing-based company is estimated to have pocketed US$2.5 billion in revenue. Most of it comes from advertisements that target its 200 million monthly users - that's about one in every six people in China. With these impressive figures, Toutiao is on its way to change China's online advertising arena, which for years has been dominated by the BAT tech trio - Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent. Censors: Human or AI?<br/> However hard Toutiao tries to position itself as an AI purist, it eventually kowtowed to the censors. At the beginning of 2018, the firm posted a notice to hire 2,000 content monitors with a preference for Communist Party members, The Paper reported.<br/> \"Some of the censoring is due to violent or bloody content, most is due to administration order from Office of the Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs,\" says a former Toutiao employee, who requested anonymity. Toutiao keeps an internal WeChat group that informs the auditors of what is permissible on a daily basis, the source adds.<br/> \"Most big tech companies use a combination of automatic and manual censoring,\" observes Ken Meng, who runs a Shenzhen-based social media marketing firm. \"The machine censor keeps a list of banned keywords, which can be instantly detected as soon as someone uses them.\"<br/>Smaller companies outsource the censoring job to larger tech firms like Shanghai-based Qiniu Cloud. The company, which uses image processing algorithms to spot illegal content, claims it can replace over 80% of human auditors.<br/> But combating other troublesome content such as fake news - which often makes headlines on Toutiao - isn't as straightforward. As such, the startup is developing a duo of fact-checking bots to crush rumors.<br/> \"One is good at writing fake news, and the other is good at detecting whether or not this news is fake. And they compete with each other,\" said Toutiao AI Lab head Ma Weiying at the company's AI conference last December. The writer bot, Ma says, draws from Toutiao's growing database of fake news stories, which are sourced from reports sent in by real people. It then goes on to train the detector by constantly feeding it with fake feeds.<br/> Toutiao's meteoric rise has encouraged traditional news outlets and startups to follow suit. China now sees more mobile content delivered by algorithms than by human editors, according to estimates by data firm Analysys. If the trend continues, machines will have a lot to learn as they operate in an increasingly strict media environment.<br/> \"It's a tough job being a news aggregator in China,\" says Charlie Smith, co-founder of GreatFire.org, a nonprofit organization that monitors which websites get censored in China. The AI-driven Yidian Zixun, for example, has hired Sohu's former editor in chief to be the app's gatekeeper. Regardless of how smart they are, future news apps - or any internet company that wants to thrive in China, for that matter - will need to constantly juggle between the country's picky consumer tastes, esoteric regulations, subtle social norms, and the government's unpredictable agenda.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INCIND-n10339706</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INCIND2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RDV-CRF1-DYDW-706F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410716</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1264\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inc.

That total was behind the US tally of 233 unicorns in the same period, according to this year\u2019s edition of the Hurun Global Unicorn Index released by Shanghai-based Hurun Research Institute on Tuesday. It said the US and China accounted for a combined 79% of the world\u2019s 586 known unicorns, based on valuations at the end of March.    \u201cThe US and China continue to dominate... despite representing only 40% of the world\u2019s GDP and a quarter of the world\u2019s population,\u201d said Rupert Hoogewerf, chairman and chief researcher of privately held Hurun Report, in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe rest of the world needs to wake up to providing an ecosystem that allows unicorns to flourish.\u201d    The total value of all known unicorns in the world is US$1.9tril (RM8.01tril), equivalent to the GDP of Italy, according to Hurun Research.    \u201cThese young companies, only nine years old on average, are the world\u2019s most exciting startups, leading a new generation of disruptive technology and attracting the world\u2019s top young talent,\u201d Hoogewerf said.    The findings bolster China\u2019s efforts to close the gap with the US on fostering many of the world\u2019s most innovative companies, while dealing with the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic as well as Beijing\u2019s complex tech and trade war with Washington.    The world\u2019s two largest economies are locked in fierce competition to drive major hi-tech sectors, including artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous driving, robotics and big data.    Alipay operator Ant Group, the digital financial services arm of Alibaba Group Holding , was the top-ranked unicorn in the Hurun list, with a valuation of US$150bil (RM633.07bil) on the back of its planned initial public offering in Shanghai and Hong Kong . Alibaba is the parent company of the South China Morning Post .    [embedded content]    The world\u2019s second-largest unicorn is TikTok owner ByteDance, with a valuation of US$80bil (RM337.64bil). The startup\u2019s flagship app, however, is caught in the crosshairs of Washington. US president Donald Trump has threatened to put the popular short video app \u201cout of business\u201d in the US if it is not sold by Sept 15 .    Third-ranked Didi Chuxing , China\u2019s biggest ride-hailing services provider, had a valuation of US$55bil (RM232.12bil). It was followed by Lufax Holding , which runs an online wealth management and peer-to-peer lending platform, with a US$38bil (RM160.37bil) valuation.    Billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp, better known as SpaceX , took the No 5 spot on the Hurun list with a valuation of US$36bil (RM151.93bil).    The US and China this year added 30 and 21 new unicorns, respectively, according to Hurun Research. It said the world\u2019s unicorns are based in only 29 countries around the world, spread across 145 cities.    Beijing, with 93 unicorns, led the world\u2019s top five cities in which billion-dollar startups have flourished. It was followed by San Francisco, with 68 unicorns; Shanghai, with 47; New York, with 33; and Shenzhen, with 20. As a region, Silicon Valley leads the world with 122 or 21% of the world\u2019s unicorns, according to Hurun Research.    The Trump administration, however, has ratcheted up its tech and trade dispute against China, and has tightened US export policy extensively. In recent years, the Commerce, Defence and State departments have instituted a slew of regulations to rein in technology transfers to China.    \u201cThis is a very difficult time for Chinese startups hoping to achieve the success enjoyed by some of their predecessors,\u201d said Paul Haswell, a partner who advises technology companies at international law firm Pinsent Masons. \u201cInvestment is likely to be limited within China, given the current global political situation. Therefore, it\u2019s more likely we\u2019ll see the acquisition of unicorns by big tech, rather than actual investments until things start to settle down.\u201d    The interest of China\u2019s major technology companies is likely to be determined by where the country\u2019s unicorns are active. There are 39 Chinese unicorns engaged in e-commerce, the top sector where these firms are involved, according to Hurun Research. There are 21 in AI, 18 in financial technology, 16 in logistics and 16 in health tech.    \u201cThere is always a market for innovation,\u201d Pinsent Masons\u2019 Haswell said. \u201cAn agile startup will be more adaptable than many existing entities.\u201d \u2013 South China Morning Post</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The moves come just ahead of a new round of trade talks.</p><p>What happened this week:</p><p> On Monday, the Trump administration blacklisted eight Chinese companies from buying American-made technology.</p><p> Yesterday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced visa restrictions on Chinese officials believed to be involved in the abuse of ethnically Muslim Uighurs.</p><p>The moves suggest that the White House is willing to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b16fd228-ea72-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55\">take aim at China\u2019s tech dreams</url>, particularly in artificial intelligence. Among the blacklisted businesses were iFlyTek, a specialist in voice recognition; Hikvision, a leading surveillance technology provider; and SenseTime and Megvii, both facial recognition companies.</p><p>They\u2019re also new uses of a U.S. tool usually deployed against terrorists. \u201cAs far as I know, it was the first time Commerce explicitly cited human rights as a foreign policy interest of the U.S. for purposes of export controls,\u201d Julian Ku, a law professor at Hofstra University, told the NYT.</p><p>A Beijing official accused the White House of using human rights as an excuse to punish Chinese companies. \u201cThis goes against the basic principles of international relations,\u201d Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said yesterday.</p><p>Expect the punishments to cast a chill over trade talks, and in the longer term hurt the Chinese companies\u2019 reputations, potentially limiting their sales in the U.S. and elsewhere.</p><p>More: The new head of the I.M.F. warned that the trade war could cost the global economy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b16fd228-ea72-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55\">around $700 billion</url> by next year.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s approach to political ads takes fire</p><p>The social network said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b16fd228-ea72-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55\">it would not take down an ad</url> from the Trump re-election effort that Joe Biden\u2019s campaign says makes false accusations. That shows how the tech giant is determined to avoid moderating political speech, even after its platform was used to sow disinformation in 2016, Cecilia Kang of the NYT writes.</p><p>The 30-second ad asserts that Mr. Biden offered Ukraine $1 billion if it fired the prosecutor investigating a company tied to his son. The Biden campaign requested that it be taken down, but the social network declined.</p><p>Facebook said the ad did not violate its policies. \u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,\u201d Katie Harbath, Facebook\u2019s head of global elections policy, wrote in a letter to Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign.</p><p>But CNN rejected the ad, saying that it made assertions \u201cthat have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets.\u201d</p><p>The social network has already faced accusations of censorship by conservatives, including President Trump. Abstaining from moderation of political content is leaving it open to criticism from liberals like Senator Elizabeth Warren, a rival of Mr. Biden\u2019s, who say it\u2019s widely spreading false information.</p><p>Silicon Valley\u2019s new obsession: profitability</p><p>Venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are now focusing on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b16fd228-ea72-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55\">getting start-ups on the path to profitability</url>, and not just as big as possible, Erin Griffith of the NYT writes.</p><p> The shift has come after the collapse of WeWork\u2019s I.P.O. plans and the frosty reception in the public stock markets to Peloton, SmileDirectClub, Uber and Lyft. All lose money, and some lose a lot.</p><p> \u201cNow some investors and start-ups are beginning to rethink that mantra and instead invoke turning a profit and generating \u2018positive unit economics\u2019 as their new priorities,\u201d Ms. Griffith writes.</p><p> \u201cAt Eniac Ventures, a venture firm in New York and San Francisco, the partners recently combed through their companies and identified the \u2018gross margins\u2019 \u2014 a measure of profitability \u2014 for each one, said Nihal Mehta, general partner of the firm.\u201d</p><p>Bird, a highly touted scooter start-up, recently raised $275 million, but only after taking steps this year to shore up its losses, according to its C.E.O., Travis VanderZanden.</p><p>Nissan\u2019s new chief has a big mess to clean up</p><p>The carmaker <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b16fd228-ea72-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55\">named Makoto Uchida</url>, the head of its China operations, as its new C.E.O. yesterday, sooner than expected, Ben Dooley and Liz Alderman of the NYT report.</p><p>Nissan\u2019s board chose him unanimously because of his experience abroad \u2014 China is a huge market for the carmaker \u2014 and his understanding of the company\u2019s alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi. (Renault is said to view him favorably.)</p><p>Mr. Uchida must steady the company after the ousting of Carlos Ghosn as chairman on charges of financial misconduct, dropping sales and the resignation of his predecessor over pay issues.</p><p>He must also deal with concerns about Hari Nada, the head of Nissan\u2019s legal department, who played a key role in ousting Mr. Ghosn but is seen by some at the company as an obstacle to overhauling corporate governance.</p><p>Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is headed to the highways</p><p>The electric carmaker is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b16fd228-ea72-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55\">staking its future</url> on its autonomous-driving technology, though it is pushing for widespread adoption of a system whose safety is still being proven, Bloomberg Businessweek\u2019s Zach Mider writes.</p><p> \u201cAutopilot is unlike almost any other consumer product in history, in ways that offer a preview of the uncomfortable questions we\u2019ll confront in the dawning robot age.\u201d</p><p> \u201cTesla\u2019s flamboyant chief executive officer, Elon Musk, says the technology saves lives, and legions of Tesla owners offer their own testimonies of hazards spotted and collisions avoided.

According to Marcus, stopping the launch of Libra will open the door for China to steal a key advantage in the world of digital currencies. </p><p>As reported[2] by Bloomberg, Marcus stated: 'The future in five years, if we don't have a good answer, is basically China re-wiring [much of the world] with a digital renminbi running on their controlled blockchain.' For those of you who don't know, American regulators have repeatedly called on Facebook to halt its proposed 2020 launch for the Libra cryptocurrency. They appear ready right now to impose new laws that would make a United States rollout impossible - including the so-called 'Keep Big Tech out of Finance' bill. David Marcus retorted that blocking Facebook and its Libra project could backfire[3] on American lawmakers. As China and other nations are known to be forging behind the scenes on digital fiat, there might be a bigger plot right now and something that could effectively end the dollar's control over the world economy. Marcus also warned the American regulators that they risked 'having a whole part of the world completely blocked from United States sanctions and protected from United States sanctions - and having a new digital reserve currency [with no alternative].' Bloomberg's report also quotes a 'former leader' and crypto pioneer from China and the central bank as stating that 'thegoal of the country's project was to keep China from having to adopt a standard, like Bitcoin, designed and controlled by others.' Meanwhile, the Libra coin news[4] show that the stablecoin appears to have finally found an ally in the American parliament. Rounds, who was a Republican senator for South Dakota Mike Rounds, wrote a letter[5] to Libra's partner Anchorage where he expressed his support for the companies that are continuing to stand behind Facebook's forthcoming cryptocurrency. 'It would be unfortunate to shun a new solution that could connect more of the most vulnerable Americans to our financial services system,' Rounds said.

Commercial and light-duty vehicles will see the restrictions removed in 2020, and finally, any remaining models will see caps removed in 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Before I analyze what todays news out of Beijing might mean its important to understand just how valuable the Chinese auto market is.</p><p>2016 saw the U.S. set an all-time record of over 17 million light-duty vehicles sold to consumers. In the same year, China sold 27.5 million light-duty cars and China is even forecasted to sell 30 million by 2020. China could be double the size of the U.S. domestic market in just a handful of years! Its easy to see why todays announcement might end up proving pivotal for global automakers futures.</p><p>China to end foreign automaker restriction after 25 years of pro-domestic policy</p><p>The year 1994 saw China impose strict limitations on carmakers ownership of any joint venture for selling vehicles in the worlds most populous nation. The way it was set up and operates to this day finds the top foreign auto brands (listed in descending order in terms of sales volume) such as VW (ETR:VOW3), Buick (NYSE:GM), Honda (NYSE:HMC), Hyundai (KRX:005380), and Toyota (NYSE:TM) forced to partner with a local entity in order to produce and sell cars in the Chinese domestic market. The current limit is a 50% ownership stake in the JV.</p><p>For example, the number 1 selling foreign brand in China is Volkswagen. In 1984 VW signed a 25-year agreement to partner with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (now SAIC Motor) resulting in the joint venture Shangai Volkswagen Automotive Co. Volkswagen owns the state maximum of 50%, SAIC owns the other 50%.</p><p>Volkswagen, in effect, had to sign over 50% of its profits in order to move into China while SAIC Motor just needed to build out the infrastructure for manufacturing which would be relatively risk-free when all of the R&amp;D has already been funded and vehicles models blueprinted in other facilities. SAIC received fully researched and developed modern car technology just for being a Chinese domestic company while VW gave all this up just for the ability to make and sell cars there.</p><p>And this is just about how all the major brands entered the Chinese car market; with 50% stakes in joint ventures.</p><p>Todays announcement from China means all that may change in the coming years. Electric and hybrid carmakers will see an immediate opportunity to wholly own their Chinese operations while commercial (2020), and everyone else (2022) will have to wait.</p><p>Despite the possibility to massively increase stakes in their Chinese subsidiaries, most manufacturers are downplaying todays announcement and are stating their intention to continue to work with their Chinese partners.</p><p>We believe a more free and flexible business environment will benefit both Chinese and foreign companies in China and the Chinese economy. BMW will continue pursuing mutual benefit and win-win solutions with the local partners.</p><p>Honda:</p><p>At the moment we have no plans to change our capital relationship..</p><p>GM is also partnered with SAIC Motors and said its grown in China is a result of working with our trusted joint venture partners.</p><p>After so many years of working together and relying on the Chinese, automakers may find that their structure is now too deeply ingrained to revert back to full ownership. Facilities, supply chains, and operations would have to be purchased back retroactively and there might be regulatory nightmares in doing so. China may make this so difficult that the change is only lip-service and in reality, nothing will change.</p><p>Its possible the automakers are just playing coy and dont want to upset their business partners before they are ready to strike out on their own. Given the huge (both present and future) volume of the Chinese market, and the newfound ability to raise their stake from 50% to 100%, it speaks to reason that there is a massive incentive for automakers to actually take advantage of the change and retake ownership of their Chinese divisions.</p><p>The automaker that may be the most excited for todays news might be Elon Musks Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). The electric automaker has never been shy about its ambition to build a production facility in Shangai to reach the massive Chinese consumer base. Tesla doesnt have a deeply ingrained Chinese partnership and perhaps most important  since it produces exclusively electric vehicles it is immediately allowed to enter the market and own a 100% stake in its Chinese division.</p><p>Automaker ownership getting relaxed could be a diversion from the real campaign: Made in China 2025</p><p>Made in China 2025 is a state-sponsored initiative to boost homegrown tech and manufacturing.</p><p>I will go out on a limb and say that it seems China may be deflecting attention away from its true intentions  to become the undisputed leader in global high-technology. As we reported a few weeks ago, China is giving its domestic tech industry massive tax cuts.</p><p>The automobile is old-world technology. Cars are getting smart features and assembly is utilizing more and more advanced robotics but the product itself isnt some paradigm shift. Both the United States and China understand this.</p><p>Tomorrows world (and economic leverage) will rest in rapidly advancing information technology. Big data, machine-learning, advanced artificial intelligence, autonomous algorithms and robots all promise to shift how we do business and even go about our lives as humans. Advertising, production, content creation, entertainment, research and development  the list goes on.</p><p>Several industrial sectors are highlighted in Chinas official plan. However, most acknowledge that semiconductors and other related high tech systems that will drive tomorrows information technologies are one of the primary, if not THE primary focus of the plan.</p><p>To wrap up, U.S. President Trump has already discussed this in the media on several occasions and indeed, there is general bi-partisan agreement that China becoming a leader in advanced technology poses a risk the business interests of the Western world. China appears to be adopting a true change in how it allows foreign companies to sell cars within its borders, but this might be a smokescreen that will allow the Xi administration to proclaim they engage in free and open trade while remaining a protectionist when it comes to its more important sectors like big tech. 2018 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUTOMO-114587719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUTOMO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S4F-CDP1-F11P-X3K4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">427901</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1087\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Global Data Point.

Even though the country's growth has been rather slow during <br/>the last few years and despite having to absorb the impact of an <br/>increasing trade war with the US, the technological, military, <br/>intelligence, diplomatic and financial components of Beijing's national <br/>power are being continuously strengthened as part of a long-range <br/>multidimensional grand strategy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the field of finance, China has invested considerable resources in<br/>the international projection of its influence. For instance, the Asian <br/>Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) can be seen an ambitious <br/>institutional financial vector that ultimately responds to China's <br/>geopolitical agenda. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that almost <br/>three years ago the Chinese yuan was included in the Special Drawing <br/>Rights, the official basket of hard currencies used by the International<br/>Monetary Fund. In fact, the IMF specifies that the renminbi is the <br/>world's fifth most used currency when it comes to the denomination of <br/>worldwide foreign exchange reserves.</p><p>Moreover, according to the Society for World Interbank Financial <br/>Telecommunication (SWIFT), the renminbi is the world's fifth most <br/>actively used currency for international payments by value, with a share<br/>of 1.99%. Even if its proportional importance is still relatively <br/>modest compared to the US dollar, the euro, the pound sterling and the <br/>Japanese yen, the renminbi is already ahead of traditionally strong <br/>currencies like the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, and the <br/>Swiss franc.</p><p>That means China's financial Lebensraum has been growing, <br/>even though it is still no match for the US dollar. However, Beijing has<br/>been seeking alternatives to enhance its global financial position. <br/>That is hardly surprising, considering that throughout history, China <br/>has been at the forefront of financial innovation. For recent proof, <br/>look no further than the Central Bank's Digital Currency Institute plan <br/>to launch a state-backed cryptocurrency. According to open sources, the <br/>design of the prototype started back in 2014.</p><p>This is a natural move which responds to the increasing importance of<br/>digital transactions in countless economic sectors. According to <br/>statements made by senior officials from the People's Bank of China in <br/>August 2019, their creation is almost ready to be released, even though <br/>there were no comments about a specific timeframe. Although the <br/>technical aspects are mostly covered, allegedly some regulatory <br/>standards still need to be adjusted.</p><p>Nevertheless, the eventual materialization of such project would <br/>represent an unprecedented development in the field of digital <br/>currencies. Most existing cryptocurrencies \u2013 like Bitcoin, Litecoin or <br/>Ethereum \u2013 are decentralized stateless currencies whose value fluctuates<br/>so wildly that they can be regarded as speculative assets. In contrast,<br/>Libra \u2013 the result of an initiative masterminded by social media <br/>company Facebook \u2013 would operate as some sort of multilateral <br/>derivative, since its value would be calibrated based on a basket of <br/>several Western hard currencies.</p><p>Another peculiar fact about this is that until recently, Beijing's <br/>actions usually reflected a deep distrust about the world of existing <br/>cryptocurrencies. Accordingly, Chinese regulatory agencies have <br/>essentially banned financial operations with private cryptocurrencies. <br/>Hence, it is logical to assume that China is preparing to enter such an <br/>esoteric realm, but only under its own conditions. Actually, the idea of<br/>harnessing impersonal forces in order to advance one's own interests is<br/>highly consistent with classical Chinese strategic thinking.</p><p>So far, the Chinese project is referred to as the Central Bank <br/>Digital Currency (CBDC) and it seems that, instead of competing with the<br/>Chinese yuan, it would be organically linked to it in a symbiotic way. <br/>In fact, it looks like it is being conceived as a digital parallel <br/>counterpart whose circulation would rely on corporate conduits and apps <br/>like WeChat \u2013which has more than one billion users \u2013 and/or Alipay. In <br/>other words, the CBDC will likely operate as a state-supported <br/>cryptocurrency rather than as a decentralized currency fully dependent <br/>on market forces. Accordingly, there would be no loss of monetary <br/>sovereignty (perhaps a similar concern motivates the recent US Federal <br/>Reserve attempts to align Libra with the dollar's might).</p><p>Therefore, it is expected that both the paper yuan and its digital <br/>twin will strengthen each other, especially now that China needs to <br/>cultivate its domestic market as much as possible, due to the <br/>establishment of barriers that limit the access of Chinese exports \u2013one <br/>of the cornerstones of China's economic dynamism \u2013 to some consumer <br/>markets. A wider availability of financial services, offered through <br/>digital platforms, could help counter the exclusion of mostly rural <br/>Chinese citizens that have been marginalized from the untold levels of <br/>prosperity achieved by the country's leading economic engines, located <br/>mainly in coastal areas.</p><p>Nevertheless, this monetary platform could also be instrumental in <br/>expanding \u2013 through cyberspace \u2013 the global reach of international <br/>Chinese financial circuits through trade partnerships with countries <br/>willing to do business with Chinese firms in a way that manages to <br/>bypass American dominance in the realm of global finance, a consequence <br/>of the US dollar's hegemonic position. For instance, the CBDC could even<br/>play a role in the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative, a <br/>huge project that intends to revive the legendary Silk Road, according to 21st century parameters of international trade and interconnectedness.</p><p>Furthermore, the introduction of this digital yuan would facilitate <br/>the formulation of monetary policy. The inflow of big data that such <br/>systems enable improves decision-making and strategic management <br/>capabilities, along with a high degree of situational awareness when it <br/>comes to tracking the behavioral patterns and volume of transactions.</p><p>It would be mistaken to interpret the CBDC project as a response to <br/>Libra. However, Facebook's vocal campaign to promote its initiative \u2013 <br/>and the discussion it has sparked in several strategic circles \u2013 might <br/>have motivated the Chinese to accelerate the execution of their plan, in<br/>order to achieve a meaningful competitive edge. In other words, even <br/>though Facebook is officially banned in China, Beijing does not want <br/>Libra \u2013 a currency that, after all, belongs to an American big tech firm<br/>\u2013 to undermine the geopolitical significance of its own ambitious <br/>international financial plans.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are still important challenges that will have to <br/>be addressed. For instance, the tense political situation that is <br/>currently unfolding in Hong Kong is critical, considering that <br/>geographical, economic, historical, legal, social and cultural factors <br/>have made it a natural world-class financial hub that operates as a <br/>gateway between mainland China and global financial circuits. The <br/>outcome of said crisis is still unclear but its short-term potential <br/>impact on the financial components of Chinese grand strategy should not <br/>be underestimated, especially in a context in which geopolitical and <br/>military tensions are rising in East Asia.</p><p>Lessons Learned</p><p>The presence of geopolitics  is felt, in one way or another, in all walks of life. Therefore, its  arrival to the realm of cryptocurrencies \u2013 a complex field that combines  economic, monetary and technological factors \u2013 is not surprising. The  prospective participation of China in such realm means it is rapidly  becoming an increasingly fierce competitive arena. It is thus  foreseeable that other countries \u2013 especially great powers \u2013 will  develop their own digital currencies in the near future, considering the  attractive potential they offer for their national interests in terms  of grand strategy.</p><p>This article was published by Geopolitical Monitor.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-153673100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1C-4P41-JDJN-60CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1326\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 11, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0009S94</classCode><className>PEOPLE'S BANK OF CHINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Boeing helped develop the country's aviation industry and infrastructure. </p><p><br/>Xi visited Boeing's factory in Everett, Washington, where it produces the 747-8, 767, 777 and 787 Dreamliners. <br/>Together, Boeing and Xi announced that Chinese companies have inked a deal to buy 300 more Boeing planes this year. According to the company, China will need an estimated 6,330 new airplanes over the next 20 years, a haul worth $950 billion. <br/>Boeing also announced that it's teaming with the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China to build a facility in China to paint and finish the interiors of 737s. <br/>Xi said that he wants to continue to grow China's relationship with Boeing, which dates back to 1972. <br/>Boeing workers, however, are concerned that will mean fewer jobs in the United States. The Machinists Union in Seattle, which represents Boeing's Washington employees, organized demonstrations outside the facility on Wednesday. They say Boeing is outsourcing jobs. <br/>But a company spokesperson said the plan will not result in job losses, and Boeing anticipates it may add workers at the U.S.-based plant as the Chinese plant ups its capacity to build more 737s. <br/>Xi also crossed paths with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on Wednesday. <br/>Earlier in the day, Xi attended a forum hosted by the Paulson Foundation, an economic think tank founded by former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. Xi met with 30 American and Chinese CEOs, including Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook and Microsoft's Satya Nadella. <br/>Also scheduled to be there were executives from Chinese tech giants Baidu, Tencent, Lenovo and Alibaba. <br/>They discussed a range of issues, including trade relations. Xi told attendees he wants to make China more accessible to American investors, according to the Paulson Institute. <br/>U.S. CEOs spoke of their concerns about intellectual property protection and regulation transparency. They also touched on clean energy and how the countries can work together to develop new technologies. <br/>Xi also attended the U.S.-China Internet Industry Forum, where he met Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. <br/>Zuckerberg, who speaks some Mandarin, wrote in a Facebook post that \"this was the first time I've ever spoken with a world leader entirely in a foreign language. I consider that a meaningful personal milestone.\"  It's been a busy visit for Xi. On Tuesday, he signed a pact with some U.S. governors committing to work with the U.S. on clean energy development. The Chinese government also recently announced it plans to import such technology from America. <br/>Xi also said Tuesday that he's ready to talk about Internet security with the U.S. It's a hot topic after a series of hacking incidents have strained relations between the countries, although Xi insists Beijing is not involved. <br/>On Friday, Xi is scheduled for a visit to the White House and meet with President Obama. <br/>- Samuel Burke and Kevin Wang contributed to this story. 2015 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICTMOW-58749803</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICTMOW2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H0N-BYJ1-F11P-X1F2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">Syndigate.info</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ICT Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35460\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>September 24, 2015 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001NW4</classCode><className>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BOE (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BA (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>BRK.B (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>BRK.A (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X7D</classCode><className>MANUFACTURING FACILITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

The Machinists Union in Seattle, which represents Boeing's Washington employees, organized demonstrations outside the facility on Wednesday.

On Tuesday, he signed a pact with some U.S. governors committing to work with the U.S. on clean energy development. The Chinese government also recently announced it plans to import such technology from America.</p><p>Xi also said Tuesday that he's ready to talk about Internet security with the U.S. It's a hot topic after a series of hacking incidents have strained relations between the countries, although Xi insists Beijing is not involved.</p><p>On Friday, Xi is scheduled for a visit to the White House and meet with President Obama.</p><p>-- Samuel Burke and Kevin Wang contributed to this story.</p><p>Correction: A headline on an earlier version of this article misspelled <person><nameText>President Xi Jinping's </nameText></person>name due to an editor's error.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20150923xi-jinping-tech-leaders1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H0K-6501-JBPX-W1V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"547\"/><timeReceived>4:32 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>September 23, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001NW4</classCode><className>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

the technical term for a network of accounts taking part in a campaign to artificially amplify an agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They say the accounts were linked to the Chinese government in an attempt to discredit Hong Kong protesters.</p><p>In response, state media has decried the actions as an attack on free speech, a narrative taken up by Chinese social media users.</p><p>What happened</p><p>On 19 August, both Twitter and Facebook published blog posts announcing their findings on investigations into alleged Chinese CIB.</p><p>Twitter said it had identified and closed 936 accounts based in the People's Republic, which \"were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground\".</p><p>It specifically noted that although Twitter is blocked in China, the accounts were operated from \"specific unblocked IP addresses\" in the country.</p><p>Twitter has also announced that it will no longer accept advertisements from state-run media organisations, a move that has caused dismay in both Russia and China, who claim it is a move to stifle their own media organisations.</p><p>In a similar announcement to Twitter's, Facebook said it had removed removed seven pages, three groups and five Facebook accounts \"as part of a small network that originated in China and focused on Hong Kong\".</p><p>Facebook also said that their investigation came as a result of a tip-off from Twitter and noted \"Although the people behind this activity attempted to conceal their identities, our investigation found links to individuals associated with the Chinese government\".</p><p>Speaking in a press briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined direct comment on the issue, but defended the right of Chinese people and media to make their voices heard over Hong Kong.</p><p>People will naturally have their own judgement over Hong Kong, he said, \"Why is it that China's official media's presentation is surely negative or wrong?\"</p><p>State media</p><p>The official China Daily didn't hold back in an editorial about the issue. \"US puppets, that's what's happening\", its headline read.</p><p>\"Although they claim to have difficulty shutting down illegal, violence-inciting race-hate posts, Twitter and Facebook have had no difficulty shutting down some accounts they claim are spreading disinformation about the 'protests' in Hong Kong, claiming these accounts are tied to the Chinese government,\" it says, claiming there is no tangible evidence.</p><p>Pushing the government line that the Hong Kong protests are being spurred on by Western agitators, China Daily implied that US-based social media companies were part of this plot.</p><p>\"It is suggested the two companies reflect on their inglorious record of being accomplices of the US government in inciting 'revolutions' around the world to instal puppet regimes in the name of the people,\" China Daily concludes.</p><p>State-run Global Times was angered by the \"very rude\" claims that Beijing was behind the alleged fake accounts.</p><p>Twitter and Facebook are only loyal to the US and the West, and the bans show \"a naked ideological action\", Global Times said.</p><p>Shanghai-based Observer Net said that the deleted accounts were not spam, rather performing a public service as the \"mainland accounts that exposed the mobs\".</p><p>Twitter's action is \"ridiculous\", it says, explaining that the removed accounts were spreading \"legitimate content\".</p><p>External broadcaster CGTN used foreign experts to support China's argument. American political analyst Andrew Korybko wrote on the official CGTN website that \"Big Tech has taken a side in Hong Kong and is once again embracing the double standard that it's recently become known for.</p><p>\"Moreover, Twitter is actively preventing Chinese international media outlets from doing their job by promoting their content across the world,\" he concluded.</p><p>Social media</p><p>The irony that Twitter and Facebook are banned from China was lost on many people posting on Chinese social media about the closure of the alleged CIB accounts.</p><p>There's a certain irony in China getting very animated about the deleting of Chinese accounts by Facebook and Twitter - platforms which it bans users in mainland China from seeing.</p><p>On Weibo, China's most popular social media platform, the Chinese hashtags #ThisIsSoCalledFreedomOfSpeech and #TwitterAndFacebookDeleteAccounts were used to vent anger at the two American web services.</p><p>Many social media users mocked \"so-called western freedom of speech\", but some made quips about what they perceived to be Chinese media's \"double standards\".</p><p>\"The demonstrations are legal but our content is illegal\" one user said sarcastically. Others brought another angle to the debate, noting that the management team of overseas platforms are often based in Taiwan. Some users consequently asked whether Taiwanese \"separatists\" were behind the move.</p><p>Chinese social media is heavily censored, so it's likely anybody brave enough to post contrary opinions would see their post - or account - deleted.</p><p>But the major theme is Western hypocrisy, asking how western media supposedly support freedom of speech for Hong Kong protesters, while denying the same for Chinese commentators, rather ignoring the fact that the banned accounts are not actually genuine users.</p><p>\"It is outside the firewall where freedom of speech is suppressed,\" Hong Kong's South China Morning Post  quoted one mainland social media commenter as saying, referring to the Great Firewall which regulates and censors the Chinese internet.</p><p>Source: BBC Monitoring 21 Aug 19</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCMIR-AUG2119FST6705</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCMIR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVY-62D1-JC8S-C0MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10962</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"980\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 British Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific - Political <br/>Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30259\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 21, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

EDT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. And today I'm signing an executive order to ensure that the federal government lives by a very simple rule: Hire American. We've been doing it at a level that hasn't been done maybe ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'll also be taking firm, disciplinary action against the leadership of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has sadly and cruelly betrayed American workers. And we have some of those great American workers with us at the table. This is the Cabinet Room, and it's an honor to have you in the Cabinet Room and at the Oval Office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're joined by the Vice President; Congressman Tim Burchett, who's doing a fantastic job in the state of Tennessee; Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia; Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Secretary, Ken Cuccinelli. Where's Ken? Hi, Ken. I didn't see you down there. That's great. Doing a great job.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Quiet, as usual.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Keep you busy, right? (Laughter.) We're keeping you busy, Ken.</p><p>Recently, the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Jeffrey Lyash, made a disastrous and heartless decision. The TVA announced that it would lay off over 200 American workers and replace them with cheaper foreign workers brought in from overseas.</p><p>The Tennessee Valley Authority leadership then ordered the American workers to train their foreign replacements, rubbing salt in their very open wound.</p><p>So we're going to bring in workers. They're going to foreign workers. And people from Tennessee, and some others states right around it, are going to train them - what to do and how to do it. It doesn't work that way.</p><p>As we speak, we're finalizing H1-B regulations so that no American worker is replaced ever again. H1-Bs should be used for top, highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labor program to destroy American jobs.</p><p>Sitting at the table are six of the TVA workers who were ordered to train the foreign labor flown in to replace them. I want you and your colleagues to know that my administration will not be putting up with - I happen to know a young woman who's been very active over the last couple of years because we were together on Disney and a couple of other things.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And it all seems to be working out pretty well.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing a great job.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And thank you for it.</p><p>But that's why I'm formally removing the chairman of the board, James Thompson, and board member Richard Howorth. If the TVA does not move swiftly to reverse their decision to rehire their workers, then more board members will be removed. We have the absolute right to remove board members. And the board makes the decision; I don't make the decision. I saw there was an ad on television talking about the amount of money that the chairman makes, and it's a ridiculous amount of money. But we have the right to replace the board, and the board is the one - the only ones that get the right to then hire a new person.</p><p>Furthermore, the board must immediately hire that new CEO who puts the interest of American workers first. The current CEO, Jeff Lyash, is ridiculously overpaid. He earns $8 million a year. Did you know that? Eight million. He's the highest-paid government official of any country anywhere in the world.</p><p>Now, I don't know that you call him officially a government. It might be a public-private. It may be something - a lot time ago, it was established, Tennessee Valley Authority. But he gets $8 million a year. So that was just a succession of deep-swamp things happening, and it's a disgrace. But he gets $8 million a year, and I can think of about almost 100 percent of the people I know would take that job. (Laughter.) It's not a very hard job. I mean, you have not a lot of debt, not a lot of anything, right?</p><p>Public service is just that: Those who takes these jobs must be focused on the public good, not on personal profit. He would have taken the job for millions and millions of dollars less, but nobody asked him to do that. Okay? He would have gone for less. You could have had him for $4 million, $6 million, $7 million, $2 million, $1 million, probably $500,000 a year.</p><p>But the new CEO must be paid no more than $500,000 a year, which is still a significant amount more than the President of the United States makes. And I donate my salary. I've donated it. From what I hear, I'm the only President to do that. You'll have to check on that, but that's what I've heard. I'm very surprised to hear that. But I donate my full salary; I don't take it.</p><p>The board must work to ensure the CEO does not receive a lavish compensation package upon his departure, too. We don't want him leaving and then he gets a big check for millions and millions of dollars.</p><p>We want the TVA to take action on this immediately: Lower energy prices in the states of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. I love all those states. Any additional states you can think of there? I don't know. Let's see. So we're talking about of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Great states, there - every one of them.</p><p>So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words: You're fired. You're fired. It's ridiculous. The man is getting $8 million. It'd be interesting to see how much money he made before this. And I have no idea. Maybe he made more. I don't know. But I doubt it. But it'd be interesting to see. He got this position - must have been politically inspired because I can think of probably, almost, everybody in the nation would have liked this position, including every one of the media folks across the table from me. I would say that everybody would have liked this position.</p><p>So, with that, we're getting rid of him in one form or another. Either the board is going to do it, we're going to do it. But he's gone. And he's done not a great job. He's done not even a good job, in certain ways. Plants in Kentucky - he could've kept the plant open in Kentucky, if he wanted to, even if they retrofitted the plant. And he didn't do that, did he, Congressman?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He wouldn't do that.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: We asked him to do it. He didn't want to do it. We said, That's okay. And here we are doing what we're doing today.</p><p>So we will get somebody for a much lower price. I want the saving - much lower salary - I want the saving to go to the people of these great states in the form of energy savings. And that's a pretty substantial number.</p><p>So, Kevin, could I ask you to start off and say a few words, please?</p><p>MR. LYNN: I certainly appreciate that, Mr. President. My name is Kevin Lynn. I'm the executive director of Progressives for Immigration Reform and the founder of U.S. Tech Workers. And thank you for paying attention to our ad, Mr. President.</p><p>We were founded - we founded U.S. Tech Workers three years ago to look at the - and inform the public on the great harm that's being caused by the outsourcing and offshoring of our skilled labor jobs. And, Mr. President, I want to thank you for inviting us here. On behalf of U.S. Tech Workers and the Tennessee Valley Authority, we appreciate your willingness to look at the endangered jobs of the Tennessee Valley Authority workers, especially in a time of pandemic and an election year, when you've been so busy signing documents that affect the welfare of millions of Americans.</p><p>Taking time to ensure that these hundreds of workers, under your administration, can continue to provide great services to the American people, as they have since 1933, shows the people of Tennessee and beyond that you stand by your promise to keep American jobs with Americans.</p><p>This is a historic moment that I'm hopeful will reverse the harm outsourcing and offshoring have done to our nation's productive classes. And it is my hope that Congress will join you, Mr. President, in making sure our workers are more secure in their jobs.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>MR. LYNN: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you're the one that took the ad about me that - I didn't know that. (Laughter.) I was just saying, you know, I think he's the one that took this, really, vicious ad. Like, I hired this guy for $8 million, that I had nothing to do with it. I said, What's that? But, actually, you brought something very important up, because when I looked into it, I said, This guy is actually making $8 million a year. And you did the ad. So you really made me aware of what was going on with the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has been a - a feeding pot for a long time. And a lot of deep state, a lot of swamp creatures, okay?</p><p>So, that's it. So we're going to make that - I see. So I think now you realize that it wasn't about me. I hope you now realize that.</p><p>MR. LYNN: I do realize that, Mr. President. (Laughter.) But if I could -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I accept - I accept your apology. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LYNN: In full disclosure, Mr. President, when we sat down with the Davis Agency constructing the ad, they said, Who's your audience? And I said, Just one person. He's the only one that... -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's smart. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LYNN: - ...would do this, and he's the only one that can come to the aid of these workers in the Tennessee Valley.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He's the only one with any guts to do it - who has guts to do it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'll tell you, though - I have to say, Kevin, the end was very appropriate. And while it has nothing to do with me, I can do things with respect to the board, and ultimately, the board controls that decision. This is a very, very old authority done in the -</p><p>MR. LYNN: 1933, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So it was done during the FDR days. And it's been - you know, it's been getting crazier and crazier just over the years. And they have, basically, nobody watching over them. And the board isn't watching. You see this happening in public companies also. You see it happening a lot.</p><p>But for a essentially - I would say, for a federal employee to be paid $8 million - now what we're doing is we're looking at the board members, how much are they paid. Because usually what happens is they pay, and then he says, You know, I think you ought to get more money. And everybody is making a lot of money, and your pricing for electric and utilities starts going up, and people say, I wonder why.</p><p>I also see that they're doing a lot of things in terms of electric, which is very expensive electric. They're building facilities that are very, very expensive to build and don't work well. But we'll discuss that separately.</p><p>But I appreciate it because you did make me aware of what's going on, and it's a terrific thing we're doing today. Thank you very much, Kevin.</p><p>Please, Stacy. How are you?</p><p>MR. WHETZELL: I'm doing fine. Mr. President, my name is Stacy Whetzell. I'm the son of a sharecropper.</p><p>First, I want to thank you for being the great American President you are and for caring about and looking out for the great American citizens and workers. We thank you for that.</p><p>I picked cotton from the time I was big enough to carry my own pick sack until I married. My wife and I have been married 47 years and have 7 children and 14 grandchildren. I began working for TVA in 1975 as a carpenter's apprentice. Currently, I'm the system administrator on TVA's core team that's responsible for installing a $20 million computer system. Our team and the entire IT department have been praised and thanked multiple times this summer for the outstanding performance we've done.</p><p>So it was shocking and devastating to be notified on July the 23rd that IT leadership had decided our team and a total of 40 workers would be terminated and our work done to others. This brings the total planned outsourced jobs to over 200 in TVA information technology alone. We believe there are more planned to come.</p><p>The three companies chosen to do the IT work are all three foreign companies that depend heavily on H1-B workers. We're required to train these - our replacements, as President Trump said. Apparently, we're good enough to train but not retain.</p><p>Using H1-B workers to replace capable and willing American citizens is turning entire American communities upside down. Left unchecked, it will turn our nation upside down and negatively impact our national security as certainly as our 50-year build-up of dependence on China for manufacturing has. Thank you, President Trump, for beginning to reverse that hive-centric mistake.</p><p>American patriots will forever be grateful that you're also acting and fought the misguided and out-of-control H1-B worker program. I thank you for Americans first and acting to stop this travesty.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you're a very powerful speaker. And so powerful that we just got a call - Mark just brought this in from - the TVA CEO, and he's indicated a very strong willingness to reverse course. (Laughter and applause.)</p><p>So it must have been Stacy. I think Stacy did a much better job than me. I mean, you're talking and all of the sudden, I get the note.</p><p>So he's looking to change course and reverse it, and that's good. Now, maybe he'll take a major cut in salary, too. That'll be phase two, right? So we'll take a look at that. And maybe you'll start looking at that on behalf of everybody, gratis. Right?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Your group. That's great, isn't it.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yeah, I mean, TVA told me while we were in this process of working on behalf of the workers - I'm the union president, IFPTE-Engineering Association. They told me it's going to take a message - a stop order from the President in order to keep us from moving forward. And I said, I'm working on that. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you did a good job.</p><p>MS. HENSON: So I appreciate you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Everybody in this room did a good job.</p><p>MS. HENSON: I appreciate you, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And, Congressman, you have my endorsement.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay? You had it anyway, but you have it now. It's a great job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Well, I appreciate you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: The only congressman in the room. I tell you, Tim, great job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Thank you, brother.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's only phase one. Phase two is - imagine being paid the $8 million a year to run a thing that's pretty easy to run, in all fairness. It's not like he built it; he didn't build it. He went there and he's been there, and he gets a lot of money, and it shouldn't be. Five hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money, right?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir. In Tennessee, it is.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And I'm willing to say he gets paid more money than I do. I don't care.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But, you know, it shouldn't happen.</p><p>So that's a start. That's a start. And I think we should find out what board members make, okay? Because -</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: I'll look into that.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: - I can almost guarantee you they're paid heavily.</p><p>Congratulations, Stacy. Really good.</p><p>Please, go ahead.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir. Mr. President, thank you. My name is David Littlejohn. I am a soon-to-be father. This November, my wife will be giving birth to my first child. I am a long line - I'm the son in a long line of military men and women, so I was born with a heart of service. And with that, I love to serve the people of the Valley.</p><p>I was told July 23rd that I would be sent home and to be trained - training a contractor from a H1-B-dependent contract company. Now, I'm shaking right now because -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing great.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You had a big victory already. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir.</p><p>I'm shaking right now because this really impacts me and my wife and my unborn child, and I greatly appreciate everyone here to support us.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate it, and thank you very much.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you'll see what happens. It's going to be very quick, too. Thank you.</p><p>Wendy, please.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah. I'm Wendy Turner, and thank you for having us here. I've been a software engineer at TVA for 19 years. I'm going to change my comments a little. I was (inaudible) saying, you know, for the first time in 19 years, I didn't know what was going to happen to me and my kids, and I also take care of my mom. But what we're going to do going forward - so, thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And this was - everybody felt this way in Tennessee Valley Authority then, I guess- right? - if you do. You've been there for 19 years. So everyone had to feel this way, like there's been a big feeling of doubt, right?</p><p>MS. TURNER: Right. Yeah.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's a terrible thing.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They're waiting for it to happen to them.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah, and I've been training since June. I've been training our replacements from a company that relied on -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You've been training people?</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yes. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And so, did they let you off yet? Or are you not sure?</p><p>MS. TURNER: I got my notice in June that we would be laid off September 1st.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you're training people to take your job at a - whatever. Right?</p><p>MS. TURNER: They told us it would be -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And where are the people from that you're training?</p><p>MS. TURNER: All over the place. We - everything is done remotely or -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are they from other countries?</p><p>MS. TURNER: They're here on soil now. I don't know their status as far as -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Because with Disney, they were from other countries, right?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah, so I don't know. I know the com- - Accenture is replacing our group, and I know they rely heavily on H1-B workers, but I don't know for sure where everyone is.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, we'll make sure that things work out for the three of them because they're brave to be here, actually, Sara. So you'll check that out, right?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Let's see that they get their jobs back -</p><p>MS. TURNER: Thank you very much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: - because I hear you're great workers. I mean, I said I want people, but I also people that are really good workers - that did a great job. Because, you know, people can be let go; should be able to - if they're not doing a good job. I'm all for that. I think - I'll bet you are.</p><p>But I said, I want people that really do a great job and were unfairly let go. Right, Tim?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Absolutely.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's, to me, very important.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Wendy. We'll see what happens. Okay? We're going to push it hard.</p><p>Chuck, please.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I recognize how busy your schedule is, and I sincerely appreciate your time today. Okay?</p><p>I'm Chuck Charnawskas. Basically, I've had the opportunity to work with the really technically competent people of the Tennessee Valley for seven years, okay? It's been a great experience. I have a degree in electrical engineering, 45 years of valuable industrial experience, and I'm a certified security professional here, okay?</p><p>Working with the people in Tennessee Valley was how I learned just how important the Tennessee Valley is to 11 million people in seven different states, okay, and how it basically impacts their lives. It's absolutely significant. And that is the reason that I'm really here today.</p><p>The TVA basically has the capability to produce 35 billion watts of powers, okay? They have 17,000 lines of high-voltage transmission.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: How does that compare to other big utilities, would you say?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: It definitely ranks right in the top of them. There's no question about it. And very significant: Tennessee Valley is part of the Southeastern Reliability Corporation, and it's obviously one of the biggest players in that area.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yea, it's very big. That's a lot.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Very significant in that respect, okay? And in essence here, as a consequence of that, they also basically support 35 dams - that produce power from 29 - to do flood control.</p><p>Just a couple years ago, they were able to reduce billions of dollars of potential damage by managing the rivers correctly, in that case.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: They have three major power plants - nuclear power plants.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What's your biggest dam? What's the big dam?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Probably it would be Chickamauga or -</p><p>MR. HICKS: Wilson. Wilson Dam, in Alabama.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Wilson in Alabama.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: There's the expert, right down there. (Laughter.) So I defer to the expert about that.</p><p>But the bottom line of it: As a consequence of this, it's a very - a very important player not only in the Southeast region, but for (inaudible) internationally, okay? And today, the TVA receives hundreds if not thousands of potential attacks - cyberattacks - testing its network here, right?</p><p>It's imperative to have experienced, knowledgeable employees to handle that situation, yeah. Okay?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: And a fine example of this - and I just kind of - you know, it's a little bit humorous, but the great power outage in 2003 was affected by a software glitch - okay? - that impacted and it shut down Manhattan for 24 hours.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I remember that very well. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: I thought you might be related - or familiar with that. So, as a - it just really points to the significance of having qualified, vetted people with proper clearances.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I agree.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: - dedicated to that job.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I agree. That wouldn't happen with you, would it? Huh? It wouldn't happen.</p><p>MS. TURNER: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I appreciate it, Chuck.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: And then just a - quickly, two other quick points. Basically, this outsourcing agreement could impact - the Tennessee Valley has always - our goals are to provide energy, economic development, and protect the environment. This particular outsourcing agreement could impact the Valley by $88 million to these local economies here. And for the individuals that are in there, not only may they lose their primary income, but they may consequently have insurance costs that basically reflect a 3- to 400 percent increase for these families on how they manage it.</p><p>And I'd like -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. And you're going to lose - you're going to lose people when you're firing people that are - they live in Tennessee and they live in Georgia and they live in the other states that I mentioned, and it's not a fair situation.</p><p>Go ahead. Let's - let's go, Chuck.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Final point: The effort here to make America great again - okay - reflects the fact that we need to take into repatriate manufacturing companies and companies to take and spend our money domestically and support the domestic product. How can we justify spending these millions of dollars - for one particular consulting firm, $15 million to -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Who is the consulting firm?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Well, that would be Capgemini (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You spent $15 million a year on a consulting firm?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Well, this was a -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: We just found another nugget of gold. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Sara doesn't care about that one, but that's a - (laughter) - I care about. You spent $15 million to one consulting firm.</p><p>MS. HENSON: It's not - it's not a consulting - that's one of the companies that are picking up. And it's Capgemini, and that's $15 million that - just for that one company.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: How many are there - how many are there like that?</p><p>MS. HENSON: There's Capgemini, CGI, Accenture, and Tech Systems at TVA -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And they're paying tremendous amount of money?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir. And our workers are more than capable.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very - they're very political people. You know this is a very political group of people you just named?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Really? I just know that -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Not to me. Not to me, I don't care. (Laughter.) I don't care who they are, but they - they are very political.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, I mean, and these people are more than capable of doing the job and have done it with excellence. And TVA says your matrix for your performance is above; it doesn't make sense. And what you're doing - I cannot tell you how much it means to me. And for these workers it - and I'm very emotional because TVA is a large racket. They do their thing, and nobody can touch them. And I believe today they've been touched.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's a racket.</p><p>MS. HENSON: They've been touched. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, it's a racket. Well, we just found that out. (Laughter.) No, it's a racket.</p><p>I mean - I mean, I understand it. The four firms that you just mentioned that are paid tens of millions of dollars, they're very political firms. You know, they may be good, but they're very political firms. And they do it for much less much - much, much, much less. You could give them half. You could give them 10 percent, they'd probably do it for. Those are big numbers for a consulting firm.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, they're - they're not the consulting firm; they're the ones actually going to take these people's jobs. That -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's worse.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, it is worse. So I mean -</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tim, go ahead, please.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Mr. President, thank you -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Congratulations.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: - and Vice President so much for this. My mama worked at TVA after the Second - during the - at the end of the Second World War, when dad came home from the Pacific and married her, and then she went into education. But, you know, working people are the backbone of this country. That's not clich\u00e9 and you've -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: - you've highlighted that so much with the trades and other things, and I'm very appreciative of the fact.</p><p>But I'll you what: Dadgummit, if TVA wants be Duke Electric, let them because Duke Electric, but they're not. And they - they hide behind the government's skirt and they - they use eminent domain, and their arrogance is beyond belief. You know, when they had the ash spill, people died, and then - you know, and then they are just these poor country folks that are just pushing them off until they all die off, until those lawsuits go away. It's ridiculous.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, that's right. And, by the way, in Kentucky, when we wanted to have a plant open with a lot of jobs, they didn't even want to consider it.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No. No, they didn't. It's their arrogance. You're questioning them, and finally we have a President with the guts that understands business and government. And if TVA wants to be a government entity, they need to - they need to declare it, and quit using - they hide behind - you know, they have their - their -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Do you think Joe Biden would do this?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Heck no.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He wouldn't know you're alive.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He'd be - no, he'd -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He doesn't know he's alive either. (Laughter.)</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He needs to get out of the bunker.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, can you imagine him sitting at this table right now? Wouldn't have a clue.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. So go ahead, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, I think you pretty much covered it, Mr. President. I'm just honored to be here. And I -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm honored that you're here. And you've done a fantastic job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: And I thank you for standing up for working Americans.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, well we're going to - and we're going to get this finished too. So we'll get it finished, Sara.</p><p>Thank you very much, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Gene, please.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: Mr. President, thank you for bringing this group together. And this this meeting has, I think, shown a very human impact on individual working -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Incredible.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: - men and women of a practice that's actually pretty widespread.</p><p>And the way it's worked under our immigration laws for a while now is that a company that wants to bring in workers from overseas - wants to use the H1-B program for high-skilled workers - has to file an attestation with us at the Labor Department, saying American workers aren't going to lose their jobs when I bring in these H1-B workers. And they have to say it's not going to hurt their wages.</p><p>But what companies do is they bring workers in, and then they lease them out to another company. And so you've got one company bringing them in and then leasing them to TVA. And it's true, the company bringing them in - their workers aren't being affected, but the TVA workers are.</p><p>And so I took a look at this, as your Labor Secretary, recently, and I said to my staff - I said, Well, if the workers are going to the other company, why doesn't the other company, where they're actually going to be working and supervised, also file an application?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. Right.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: And say, 'We're not going to affect U.S. workers either.' And I said to staff, Why can't we do that? They looked into it. And, Mr. President, today, you're going be signing an order -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, good.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: - that requires that change.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: So, going forward, when those workers are going to another company, both companies are going to (inaudible) - (applause) - and that's a change we'll make. We'll do it together with the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>I just want to mention one other thing we're doing together. For more than 15 years, the Secretary of Labor has had the authority to initiate an investigation of abuse of H1-B program when he or she finds reasonable cause. That has never been done. That authority has never been used.</p><p>But again, we saw - signed a memo of understanding on Friday with the Department of Homeland Security that'll change that too. They're going to now share information they have, which I can then use to bring cases when we're finding the program (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. You're going to find a lot. And thank you very much, Gene.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: Thank you. And thank you for this order today.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Good work, Stacy. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right, Stacy? Right? I like that. You like that?</p><p>MR. WHETZELL: We'll take it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Linda, please.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being with us today. The concern you show for American workers is greatly appreciated. And my mother made me promise to tell you that Alabama loves and appreciates your leadership. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I love Alabama.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: So, a promise that my mother made.</p><p>My name is Linda McDonald. I've lived in northeast Alabama my entire life. My goal was to work at TVA; that was my American Dream. After years of sacrifice and hard work, I achieved that goal. I've been working for TVA for seven years now. But - so, and in that role, I got to see every day -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So that was like an ambition of yours to work someday for TVA?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Correct.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you finally got there?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I did.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So, what's happening?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Well, June 30th, we were told that we would be outsourced to another company with -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: All right. Yeah.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Yeah, so, here I am, faced with -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you had to have these consulting firms making 10, 15 million dollars a year?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Yeah, I feel like my -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And the man that heads it making $8 million a year, right? (Laughter.)</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I feel like my American Dream was being stolen from me -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: - and given to someone else. So I just think -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Is that the way you view it: given to somebody else?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: It is. It was taken from me, and -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's a very interesting way -</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: - it was then given to someone else.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: - of viewing it, right?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: So, I thank you for listening to us, because it felt, for so long, like no one was even listening to us. So thank you very much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I've been hearing about it for a long time. When I was running, I met Sara, and we worked on the Disney situation -</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes, sir. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: - but that was a long time ago. But - and, you know, this has been happening for a while. So we're taking care of it.</p><p>Thank you very much. Thank you, Linda. We'll see what happens. You may be very pleasantly surprised. Okay?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I hope so.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>Jonathan, please.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, thank you for your time.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>MR. HICKS: My name is Jonathan Hicks. I'm a - I'm from a large family, and we've had three - three members of our family who have served in the U.S. military. I grew up in Tennessee, around the Knoxville area, and started my career with TVA in 2001 as an IT intern. During - as soon as I graduated, I got a fulltime job there, and I've been there for - for 19 years. I've been -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And that was a big deal, right?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Working - because there's a great prestige to that.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's true.</p><p>MR. HICKS: I've spent my time there working for river operations for the - for their group, and helping them, you know, have programs - mostly in-house solutions to be able to manage the river and the river systems.</p><p>I was told in June - early June - that I would be training replacements, that I would be receiving my work notice in September, and that the workers that I'd be training, there's been five or plus that I've been training for my one position, and at least four of those seem to be H1-B type workers.</p><p>I guess there's a concern with the kind of stuff that we do, at least for the river operations, and that they're generating a significant amount of power out of all the - out of all the - all of these dams. And, you know, is this something that - that we want to turn over this knowledge, this ability to control these dams and - you know, whether it be generation, whether it be floodgates - and hand it over to corporations that aren't in the U.S., to workers that aren't necessarily in the U.S. doing this work?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are you there now? Are you -</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I - I've been put on non-work status. I'm still employed and still getting a paycheck until September 1st, but I've been -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What happens on September 1st?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I've been relieved of my job duties, but September 1st is when I would lose -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you train people to take your job?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you've worked with people to take your job.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You've taught them, like, almost everything you know, but plenty, right?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I - I think there's a big -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Maybe not. Maybe you held back a couple of secrets. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I think there's a - I think there's a big learning curve and there's - for the knowledge that they do there for river operations, I think it takes several years of understanding the job in order to be able to do this.</p><p>The people that are taking over the job have never dealt with utilities, they've never dealt with power generation, they've never dealt with any kind of water management or hydrogenation. And so the - to say that they're ready to go is a misstatement. So -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, let's see how out it works out, Jonathan. I think you're going to be in very good shape. Okay? I have a prediction.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, Jonathan.</p><p>Please.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: It's - I'm so honored to be here.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Honored to have you.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: My name is Renae McKenzie, and I actually work for the Engineering Association as an advocate for these IT employees and for other white-collar workers. But I've worked really closely with the IT professionals at TVA, with all of this that has been going on.</p><p>I've had to witness the anguish of the different employees that are performing these knowledge transfers on the software and the applications that they actually custom built themselves.</p><p>But so many TVA employees have been there from the beginning of their careers. So to actually witness what's happening to them, being replaced by these non-Americans, is very difficult.</p><p>But I think one of the hardest things to witness is what TVA is actually doing to themselves. I mean, their mission is about bringing economic development to the Tennessee Valley. And to be taking that - taking our economy and just giving it outside of the United States is just almost - it's unbelievable because of what they stand for and what they were built for. To come out of economic -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you see them going outside of the United States, not just here. You see them go -</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Right. Well, if you look at these companies, these companies are based outside of the United States. So - so when they're getting their millions of dollars, I mean, it's going to France, it's really going to - I think one of them is -</p><p>MS. HENSON: India.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: India, Canada.</p><p>PARTICIPANT: Ireland</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: And Ireland. So, yes, our dollars are going to them.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Unbelievable. And they get us in many other ways too, but we're stopping it, as you noticed. That's very interesting.</p><p>So you would say France, India, Ireland, Canada. Who else?</p><p>MS. HENSON: That's the main groups right there. Those (inaudible) countries.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Right. Those are the main ones.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: A lot of them - are a lot of the workers being outsourced -</p><p>MR. LYNN: All these firms: H1-B visa dependent. And 70 percent of H1-B visa workers in the United States come from one country: mainly, India.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: You know, Mr. President, I worry too about the national security. You know, we're during a pandemic, people are out of work, and our electric grid could be put in the hands of folks that, maybe, their loyalty isn't to this great country, and that bothers me.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You know, with TVA, more so than most companies. You're right - you're talking about controlling all of that energy and power. It's - you're right. You're right about that, Tim. That's a very good statement. Anything else?</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Just, it - again, it's such an honor to be in your presence. (Laughs.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's my honor. It's my great honor. Do you know the man next to you is Ken Cuccinelli, a legend? (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Look, and I tend to be very quiet like him. Just saying.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He's a legend in his own mind. (Laughter.)</p><p>Ken - Ken has done a fantastic job on the border. Unbelievable job on the border. And you might just tell us for a couple of seconds while we have the - the media here - I'm sure they'll report it very accurately - how well we're doing on the border and then maybe get on to make a statement, because I know you've been working with Gene and everybody very hard.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Yes. And Secretary Scalia really covered the partnership with - between DHS and Department of Labor to solve this problem. You're solving it forcefully today for these folks. You're certainly putting the ball in motion to do that. And what we're - our two agencies, at your direction from June, are going to do is solve this permanently so that we never have to see this happen again.</p><p>But, on the border, we're seeing success with your leadership with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries. The relationships you helped us forge last year, in 2019, are bearing fruit at the border during a very difficult time with the coronavirus and that taskforce, of course, led by the Vice President. And the ability since March to enforce the public health order there has changed the nature of our ability to protect the border.</p><p>There are still people getting away, more than we would like. But last year, they were running to us; this year, they're running from us, at the border.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's right.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: It's a bit different. And over 80 percent of the folks that we're apprehending are being returned to Mexico in under two hours, which is astonishing. It's just an astonishing turn.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It used to take, in some cases, years. Years.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Right. Absolutely.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's been incredible what's happened at the border. And I think the wall is helping you quite a bit, right? We have now about almost 271 miles of wall.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Everywhere that that new system is put in place, the Border Patrol agents are just universal in their praise for both their safety and the way it impedes illegal traffic - not just people, but drugs, as well, and so forth. So it's extremely effective, and it's going up faster and faster and faster.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They had a human trafficker the other day saying that they used to go out and they're trafficking - human traffic - mostly women and children, but mostly women, and they'd bring them across the border, taped up and - horrible.</p><p>And this guy was saying how they used to go up and they'd make a left turn. They'd make a right and then a left into the United States. He says, and now we just keep driving into this massive wall that nobody gets through. Nobody is getting through that wall. That wall is the real deal. And it's steel, concrete, and everything else. And lots of cameras all over it.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And drones on top of it. And people aren't getting through. But it's been an incredible, incredible success.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: It's a real force multiplier for the Border Patrol and OFO.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. And Mexico is helping us a lot. They have -</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: A lot better partnership.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: - 27,000 soldiers.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: I remember how people complained about how you were pushing them so hard last year. But the partnership that's grown up with Mexico has been the best. We have really had, in decades, if not forever -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's what they say.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: - in cooperating and securing the border.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They have a very good President who was just here two weeks ago.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: He was. Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He's really doing a good job. And we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding the border. And they don't play games. They don't play games. It's been pretty amazing. The numbers are way, way down. And we want people to come in, but they have to come in legally, and that's -</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: You got to come in legally. That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it.</p><p>Okay, please. Go ahead. You can finish up.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yeah, I appreciate you so much. I really do. As I said earlier, I'm the union president for the workers that are represented by this move that TVA has taken. I met earlier with Tim Burchett and he told me how disgusted he was with it. But that was earlier.</p><p>We've really tried to get our voice heard. We've been screaming, Hey! Hey! Help us out.</p><p>Finally, U.S. Tech Workers came out, kind of put a commercial together, and we're - you know, that got your attention, and we appreciate it so much.</p><p>I've lived my whole life in the Tennessee Valley region, and my uncle was a - worked at TVA during World War Two. He laid his job aside, and went and served and perished in that war. My mother told me TVA was a great place to work, and I - I've worked there now 35 years.</p><p>This means a lot to the people of the Tennessee Valley region, more than you will ever know. I know that consulting companies looked at what to do with this IT work. They're now looking at what to do - the same consulting companies are looking at what do with the transmission work. That transmission - that grid has got to be protected at all cost. And we've got to. We cannot afford to let someone else, who may not have the loyalty to our nation, have the grid.</p><p>And I think that some of these workers here at this table, IT workers, that's one of the biggest they've said to me: There's a large chance that we would be breached. And we can't do that. And we tried to say all those things -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, with our people running it, a very small chance, from what I understand.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes. With the right people running it. right. But you can't give it to just anybody. And that's why these workers at TVA are so important. And I appreciate you and all that you are doing for us.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are the people that you're representing, are they - because you represent a big group of people - are they all nervous, like the folks at the table?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Like Wendy?</p><p>MS. HENSON: They're going, Are we next, Gay? Is this what's coming next? And my answer is, Not on my watch, if we can help it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tell them no. Tell them no, they're not next.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay? You can tell them. I think we can say that. So thank you very much.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Thank you. I just think you bringing TVA back to their mission of service to the people of the Valley, service to people of the Valley and to this nation is - is a pivotal moment for the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So, right now, their mission is taking care of a lot of consultants and a lot of people and paying - paying heads of this whole thing $8 million a year. And you'll find a lot of other things in there that are crazy.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, people over profit. And that's what you're doing here.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What do the people of Tennessee think when they hear that the head of TVA - which has been running for a long time - and, in all fairness, not a very difficult thing; there are many people who can do it. What do they hear when they hear - and they think of government, you know? It's sort of semi- - I guess, you call it - public-private. But there's not private, really, when you think of it. So, it's a board member.</p><p>What do they think when they hear that the head person is making $8 million a year? Which is, by the way, I said it before, the most highly paid person anywhere in any country if you call this government, which it sort of is. What do they think when they hear? Do they know he makes $8 million a year?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, they do now after Kevin's commercial. (Laughter.) But they're pretty shocked. I mean - in fact, they - I think the workers even - I think some of the workers at TVA have been shocked about that. It is a lot of money.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But people have known. I've known, actually, before the commercial because we were looking at it. We sent them notices a year ago and two years ago saying, We want some information. And, you know, people have known this. I just can't even imagine that somebody gets paid $8 million a year.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, the difference -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's the most sought-after job. It has to be the most sought-after job in any country in any government. Right, Tim? You'd take the job. Would you resign from Congress immediately?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Take it for one year. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You only need it for one year. You -</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: I don't know. You don't know my wife and daughter, Mr. President. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tim would take it. That's - he'll take it only -</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, they're actually pretty thrifty.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Only for a year. You just need it for one year. That's right. Anyway.</p><p>MS. HENSON: So the workers - they are surprised at that. But, you know, back to the days of Kilgore and having worked there so long - I tell people I started when I was eight, because I can't believe how long I've worked there now -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p><p>MS. HENSON: But the truth is, there are very capable people at TVA that love -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'll bet.</p><p>MS. HENSON: - the TVA and the mission that they're really - were put together for and would love to take that job.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I even think they like your President - your current President, anyway. I'm not sure about the past President.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Tennessee Valley is - that's right. The boats on the lake all say, you know -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Trump. Yeah. No, they're great people. Say hello to them. Just say hello. They're great people.</p><p>Sara, why don't you just discuss it real quick, and you can maybe work with us in getting it all done very quickly. Okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Of course, President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you for having us and having everyone here and for all you're doing with regard to immigration. Immigration should be about America, Americans, and the immigrants. Right now - the way it was, before you started working on it, it's always been the big business, big tech, and universities. And with you, we are working to make immigration in America for the right reasons.</p><p>And Protect U.S. Workers - I endorsed you in 2016, we endorse you in 2020, and we know for a fact that Slow Biden and the Democrats will never push towards immigration that benefits Americans, America, and the immigrants. And I think they hide behind: Nationalists are bad, immigrants are kind and good. And if we are against the immigration the way it is now, then we are racists.</p><p>But the reality is, if you can keep immigration the way it's going now, the way Joe Biden will push it, the problem is you're actually benefiting the big tech billionaires and universities, and that is not what immigration is about in this country.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Where you come up with the name Slow Biden? You know, so many people want me to use that term, and I say, It's too mean; it's too nasty. (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Oh, no! That means I'm mean.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you just come up with that term. And where did that come from? Is that the -</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: My son, actually, who's 11.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Your son? He's 11?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: If he's 11, and he said he's slow and that he shouldn't be President -</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: They need to pay your son $15 million in consulting. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great job.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Actually, during the rallies in 2016, you met my son. He had a Thor, and he dressed him up like President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, that's great.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's very nice. Thank you, Sara. Very - great job you're doing.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELLL: Thank you so much. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good. Thank you.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you for all you do.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay, Mike. Go ahead. We'll knock it out, Sara.</p><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Mr. President. I'll be - I'll just be very brief.</p><p>Four years ago, when you ran for this office, you said the forgotten men and women in America would be forgotten no more. You said that we'd put America first and American workers first, you said that American workers would have a seat at the table in this administration, and we'd deliver real results.</p><p>And today, we see all that happen right in front of us. Because of your leadership indicated during this meeting, that the TVA is going to reverse course on their plan to use H1-B visa workers to replace hardworking Americans. And I can see the gratitude and the emotion on faces around the room, Mr. President, and the gratitude that these people feel and all those that will be reading about this and hearing about this in the days ahead.</p><p>But I also just want to say, finally, to all the - all the great Americans who gathered here, who have been willing to speak up: Know that with the executive order the President is signing today, we're not just solving your problem. What the President is committing to today is to end the abuse of our worker visa program once and for all, and pulling together multiple agencies to do that. And I want to promise you that you've not only gone out and been a champion for fellow workers at TVA, but you've been champions for American workers all across this country.</p><p>And I know I speak on behalf of the President and our whole administration when I thank you. Thank you for stepping up for American workers and making it possible for this President to keep one more promise to working Americans. God bless you. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. So we're going to sign a little document now. Is that okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: I would love that. Thank you, President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And it's very important one, aligning federal contractors and contracting and hiring practices with the interests of the American workers, which is very simple - which actually just boils down to pretty much what we're talking about today. Okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much, President Trump.</p><p>(The executive order is signed.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Here, give that to Sara because she was there very early. (Distributes signing pen.)</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I have to give - I have to give one to you. You got us moving here. That's good. Will you pass these around the table, Mike? We'll just pass them on that side. You'll pass them on this side. Everybody that doesn't get it - (distributes signing pens.)</p><p>So here we are.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I'll get you one, Tim. Don't worry.</p><p>So, thank you very much everybody. (Applause.)</p><p>We're going to be - we're going to be discussing, very shortly, a immigration bill, which covers this and many other things. It'll be a very, very comprehensive bill. That's a word that some people love and some people hate, but it'll be very comprehensive only in the sense that it'll cover just about everything.</p><p>It'll be based on merit. It will be - it'll cover territory that nobody would have thought could have ever been agreed to. And I think it'll be bipartisan, in the sense that people are going to like a lot of the things that are in there. And probably some people won't; we're going to have that. And we'll probably do it maybe a little bit after our convention. We'll sign it after the convention.</p><p>Likewise, we're going to be doing a healthcare bill - act - and it'll be extremely comprehensive. It will cover a lot of things that nobody thought you would be able to get, and - I mean, in a positive way. And I think it'll be very popular. And it will be a great thing for our country.</p><p>In addition, we have many other things. But immigration and healthcare - it doesn't get much bigger than that. Immigration will be very merit-based, but it'll be - it'll be great for the worker, and it'll be great for people coming into our country - but coming into our country legally and loving our country and wanting to help our country, as opposed to people coming in and they don't like our country.</p><p>You see that, and you see that with certain of our politicians that ran for office. I say, I don't think they like our country too much. All they do is complain. And you would never tell them to go back to their own country because that would be inappropriate, wouldn't it? But all they do is complain about our country, and their country is going to hell. So, you know, it's sort of an interesting phenomenon.</p><p>So the - the merit-based immigration is going to be incredible, and the healthcare bill or act is going to be something that I don't think anybody in this country thought they'd ever see. And we've done much of that. If look at some of the legislation that we passed, Ken, I think you can say very strongly we've - we've gotten things passed that nobody would be possible.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Whether it's Right to Try - that's where you're terminally ill and you don't have a right to use our great medicines because they haven't been approved - they're in a line of approval and it takes some time. We've cut the time in half, by the way, for approval by the FDA. But people are sick.</p><p>We have very promising drugs and they're not allowed to use them because - I mean, they're terminally ill and they wouldn't let them use them because of liability and other things, but I got that taken care of. So, Right to Try was a very important one.</p><p>Getting Veterans Choice was so important - having Veterans Choice. Nobody thought we could get that. Hasn't been done in 50 years. They haven't been able to get it. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Accountability. Because we have so many other things. So many things.</p><p>And on the border, Ken, we've done things that nobody thought would have been possible. Right? Do you want to name a couple of them?</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: We're making enormous progress in the - especially in the regulatory arena: reestablishing the 140-year-old American tradition of inviting immigrants here who can stand on their own two feet, as - much like Sara had said. And to add to this country and not - while not becoming a burden on the country.</p><p>We've also - the security that you've advocated for and pushed us to achieve has been unprecedented on a border that we still have more work to do. But we -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great progress.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: - the amount of improvement in three years is just extraordinary.</p><p>And one more piece of legislation you know is near and dear to my heart that you led is criminal justice reform, which was - you know, lots of people before you talked about it, and this is the first administration to do it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Nobody else could've gotten that done. Nobody. And we really thank Ken, but we thank a lot of people that came through.</p><p>By the way, some conservative - very conservative really wanted it and some liberal wanted it. But we got criminal justice reform done. Nobody thought that was possible. The biggest beneficiary is African Americans and Hispanic Americans, I would say - and Asian Americans - the three, the groups.</p><p>But tremendous benefits and - you know, it's really amazing. When we got that done, we had people supporting that that I would've never thought would've supported it. Not for bad reasons, but they would've never supported it, and they actually led the way. It's pretty incredible. Criminal justice reform was a big deal. You know that, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So - and you were helpful actually, and I appreciate it. And thank you very much. Anybody have a question?</p><p>Q Yes, Mr. President -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p><p>Q Mr. President, on TikTok: You said over the weekend -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>Q - that you're planning to ban it. I know that you spoke with the CEO of Microsoft after that.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I did.</p><p>Q So can you give us an update on -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>Q - where you're at?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We had a great conversation. He called me to see whether or not - how I felt about it. And I said, Look, it can't be controlled, for security reasons, by China. Too big, too invasive, and it can't be. And here is the deal: I don't mind if - whether it's Microsoft or somebody else - a big company, a secure company, very - a very American company buy it. It's probably easier to buy the whole thing than to buy 30 percent of it. Because they say, How do you do 30 percent? Who's going to get the name? The name is hot; the brand is hot. And who's going to get the name? How do you do that if it's owned by two different companies?</p><p>So my personal opinion was: You're probably better off buying the whole thing rather than buying 30 percent of it. I think buying 30 percent is complicated. And I suggested that he can go ahead. He can try. We set a date - I set a date at around September 15th, at which point it's going to be out of business in the United States. But if somebody - and whether it's Microsoft or somebody else - buys it, that'll be interesting.</p><p>I did say that if you buy it, whatever the price is, that goes to whoever owns it. Because I guess it's China, essentially, but more than anything else. I said a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States because we're making it possible for this deal to happen. Right now, they don't have any rights, unless we give it to them. So if we're going to give them the rights, then it has to come into - it has to come into this country.</p><p>It's a little bit like the landlord/tenant: Without a lease, the tenant has nothing. So they pay what's called key money, or they pay something. But the United States should be reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money, because without the United States, they don't have anything - at least having to do with the 30 percent.</p><p>So I told him that. I think we're going to have - maybe a deal is going to be made. It's a great asset. It's a great asset. But it's not a great asset in the United States unless they have the approval of the United States. So it'll close down on September 15th, unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal - an appropriate deal. So the Treasury of the - really, the Treasury, I guess you would say, of the United States gets a lot of money. A lot of money. Okay?</p><p>Q Mr. President, can you explain why so many of the public health experts on the coronavirus task force are contradicting you on things like why the virus is so widespread in this country, on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine? Why are so many of these people on your task force contradicting you?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think we're doing a great job. I think we're doing great on vaccines. We're doing great on therapeutics. You'll be seeing that very soon. I think we're - when you look at a map, this is a map of the - I've got - I sort of shown that around a little bit, but that's - the red is the area of most concern. (Displays a U.S. map.) Pretty recent map of the - of the country. And there's a lot of - a lot of people that - in a lot of areas that have gotten very - you know, better very fast.</p><p>Hydroxy has tremendous support, but politically, it's toxic because I supported it. If they would have said, Do not use hydroxychloroquine under any circumstances, they would have come out and they would've said, It's a great - it's a great thing. Many doctors have come out strongly in favor of it. They want it very badly. It's a great malaria drug.</p><p>So, for many years -</p><p>Q But Admiral Giroir says it's not effective.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me finish my - let me finish my answer.</p><p>So for many years - it's, I guess, 60 years it's been a malaria drug; very successful, as you know. And it's been also a drug for lupus. And it caused no trouble - virtually nothing, in terms of causing people to get sick or having problems with anything. You add the zinc and you add the azithromycin - the Z-Pak, as they call it - and it's been very - I happened to take it myself, the threesome.</p><p>I took it myself for a period of two weeks. I mean, I - I had no problem. I had no problem whatsoever. And, importantly, I, you know, didn't test positive. That's very nice. Okay? I'm very happy about that negative.</p><p>And so - so that's the story. It's - it's very highly thought of. Interestingly, a great doctor, from what I understand - a great doctor from Yale feels very strongly about hydroxychloroquine. The Ford Clinic in Michigan came out with a very, very powerful paper saying it's very good. Many other - in France, as you know, they came out with a very positive statement. Many individual doctors have come out with very positive statements.</p><p>I will tell you that if I was surrounded by people, as I was at the time - the reason I took it: You know, we had some people that were relatively near me that tested positive. And I took it for that reason, just because I've heard good things.</p><p>Q But Fauci says it doesn't work. Admiral Giroir says it doesn't work.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I don't agree with Fauci on everything.</p><p>Q They're on your task force.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I don't agree with Fauci. Look, Fauci didn't want - and I - I like him. I get along with him actually great. But he didn't want to ban people from China from coming into the country, and I overrode him and I did the right thing. He was saying face masks are no good a short while ago. So it doesn't mean he's a bad person, because he's not. He's a good person; I like him. But we - we disagree on things. We disagree on things.</p><p>Now, I will say this: We've done an amazing job with ventilators. We're supplying the world with ventilators. Ventilators are very hard, very expensive, very hard to make, very complex. Very complicated machines. Very - very expensive.</p><p>Q But why does the -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it. Hold it.</p><p>Q But why does the U.S. have so many deaths?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it.</p><p>Q The U.S. has so many deaths compared to -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it.</p><p>Q - so many countries around the world. I -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Fake news CNN, hold it. We have done a great job in this country. We haven't been given - and not me. I'm not talking about me. The Vice President, the task force have not been given the kind of credit.</p><p>If you look, countries all over the world are exploding right now - people that you said were doing a wonderful job, so wonderful. But right now, take a look at the countries that are exploding: You have Italy back. You have Spain back. You have France back. You have Germany back. You have a lot of countries, and that's not to knock them.</p><p>It is a very delicate, very contagious disease. It was released by China. It should never have been allowed to release. There was the source where you could have stopped it. And they did stop it from going into China, although now they say that China is having a lot of problems. Moscow, in Russia, is having tremendous problems.</p><p>What China unleashed was a very, very sad situation. With all of that being understood, the United States has done an amazing job, a great job, and you're going to see that because we have vaccines and we have therapeutics coming very soon.</p><p>Yeah, go ahead.</p><p>Q Mr. President, why are you not involved directly in negotiations with Capitol Hill?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I am. Oh, why? The fact that I'm not over there with Crazy Nancy? No, I'm totally involved.</p><p>Q Have you spoken with her?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'm totally involved. And we're going to be doing some things that are very good, because we don't think that she - look, what Chuck Schumer wants more than anybody - and I would say Nancy Pelosi would be second - they want to bail out cities and states that have done a bad job over a long period of time. Nothing to do with coronavirus or China virus, or whatever you want to call it.</p><p>They want to bail out cities and states. They want bailout money. They want to trillion dollars in bailout money, and a lot of people don't want to do that because we don't think it's right. The Democrats have run some very bad states and some very, very bad cities, and a lot of people don't want to give them a trillion dollars to reward them for doing a bad job.</p><p>If you look at some of the states - I won't insult anybody by naming those states, but you know what they are. They want bailout money. They're not interested in the people. They're not interested in unemployment. They're not interested in evictions, which is a big deal - the evictions. They want to evict. A lot of people are going to be evicted, but I'm going to stop it because I'll do it myself if I have to. I have a lot of powers with respect to executive orders, and we're looking at that very seriously right now.</p><p>But what the Democrats want, they want - they're slow-rolling it, and all they're really interested in is bailout money to bail out radical-left governors and radical-left mayors, like in Portland and places that are so badly run. Chicago, New York City - you see what's going on over there. Bailout cities and states who have been poorly run and spent a fortune doing it, they want a trillion dollars, and we're really not interested in that.</p><p>Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>Q What about the Postal Service, Mr. President? What about the Postal Service? Any message to your postmaster general?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Jim, very much. Thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>1:10 P.M.

EDT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. And today I'm signing an executive order to ensure that the federal government lives by a very simple rule: Hire American. We've been doing it at a level that hasn't been done maybe ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'll also be taking firm, disciplinary action against the leadership of the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has sadly and cruelly betrayed American workers. And we have some of those great American workers with us at the table. This is the Cabinet Room, and it's an honor to have you in the Cabinet Room and at the Oval Office.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're joined by the Vice President; Congressman Tim Burchett, who's doing a fantastic job in the state of Tennessee; Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia; Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Secretary, Ken Cuccinelli. Where's Ken? Hi, Ken. I didn't see you down there. That's great. Doing a great job.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Quiet, as usual.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Keep you busy, right? (Laughter.) We're keeping you busy, Ken.</p><p>Recently, the CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Jeffrey Lyash, made a disastrous and heartless decision. The TVA announced that it would lay off over 200 American workers and replace them with cheaper foreign workers brought in from overseas.</p><p>The Tennessee Valley Authority leadership then ordered the American workers to train their foreign replacements, rubbing salt in their very open wound.</p><p>So we're going to bring in workers. They're going to foreign workers. And people from Tennessee, and some others states right around it, are going to train them - what to do and how to do it. It doesn't work that way.</p><p>As we speak, we're finalizing H1-B regulations so that no American worker is replaced ever again. H1-Bs should be used for top, highly paid talent to create American jobs, not as inexpensive labor program to destroy American jobs.</p><p>Sitting at the table are six of the TVA workers who were ordered to train the foreign labor flown in to replace them. I want you and your colleagues to know that my administration will not be putting up with - I happen to know a young woman who's been very active over the last couple of years because we were together on Disney and a couple of other things.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And it all seems to be working out pretty well.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing a great job.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And thank you for it.</p><p>But that's why I'm formally removing the chairman of the board, James Thompson, and board member Richard Howorth. If the TVA does not move swiftly to reverse their decision to rehire their workers, then more board members will be removed. We have the absolute right to remove board members. And the board makes the decision; I don't make the decision. I saw there was an ad on television talking about the amount of money that the chairman makes, and it's a ridiculous amount of money. But we have the right to replace the board, and the board is the one - the only ones that get the right to then hire a new person.</p><p>Furthermore, the board must immediately hire that new CEO who puts the interest of American workers first. The current CEO, Jeff Lyash, is ridiculously overpaid. He earns $8 million a year. Did you know that? Eight million. He's the highest-paid government official of any country anywhere in the world.</p><p>Now, I don't know that you call him officially a government. It might be a public-private. It may be something - a lot time ago, it was established, Tennessee Valley Authority. But he gets $8 million a year. So that was just a succession of deep-swamp things happening, and it's a disgrace. But he gets $8 million a year, and I can think of about almost 100 percent of the people I know would take that job. (Laughter.) It's not a very hard job. I mean, you have not a lot of debt, not a lot of anything, right?</p><p>Public service is just that: Those who takes these jobs must be focused on the public good, not on personal profit. He would have taken the job for millions and millions of dollars less, but nobody asked him to do that. Okay? He would have gone for less. You could have had him for $4 million, $6 million, $7 million, $2 million, $1 million, probably $500,000 a year.</p><p>But the new CEO must be paid no more than $500,000 a year, which is still a significant amount more than the President of the United States makes. And I donate my salary. I've donated it. From what I hear, I'm the only President to do that. You'll have to check on that, but that's what I've heard. I'm very surprised to hear that. But I donate my full salary; I don't take it.</p><p>The board must work to ensure the CEO does not receive a lavish compensation package upon his departure, too. We don't want him leaving and then he gets a big check for millions and millions of dollars.</p><p>We want the TVA to take action on this immediately: Lower energy prices in the states of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. I love all those states. Any additional states you can think of there? I don't know. Let's see. So we're talking about of Georgia, Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. Great states, there - every one of them.</p><p>So let this serve as a warning to any federally appointed board. If you betray American workers, then you will hear two simple words: You're fired. You're fired. It's ridiculous. The man is getting $8 million. It'd be interesting to see how much money he made before this. And I have no idea. Maybe he made more. I don't know. But I doubt it. But it'd be interesting to see. He got this position - must have been politically inspired because I can think of probably, almost, everybody in the nation would have liked this position, including every one of the media folks across the table from me. I would say that everybody would have liked this position.</p><p>So, with that, we're getting rid of him in one form or another. Either the board is going to do it, we're going to do it. But he's gone. And he's done not a great job. He's done not even a good job, in certain ways. Plants in Kentucky - he could've kept the plant open in Kentucky, if he wanted to, even if they retrofitted the plant. And he didn't do that, did he, Congressman?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He wouldn't do that.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: We asked him to do it. He didn't want to do it. We said, That's okay. And here we are doing what we're doing today.</p><p>So we will get somebody for a much lower price. I want the saving - much lower salary - I want the saving to go to the people of these great states in the form of energy savings. And that's a pretty substantial number.</p><p>So, Kevin, could I ask you to start off and say a few words, please?</p><p>MR. LYNN: I certainly appreciate that, Mr. President. My name is Kevin Lynn. I'm the executive director of Progressives for Immigration Reform and the founder of U.S. Tech Workers. And thank you for paying attention to our ad, Mr. President.</p><p>We were founded - we founded U.S. Tech Workers three years ago to look at the - and inform the public on the great harm that's being caused by the outsourcing and offshoring of our skilled labor jobs. And, Mr. President, I want to thank you for inviting us here. On behalf of U.S. Tech Workers and the Tennessee Valley Authority, we appreciate your willingness to look at the endangered jobs of the Tennessee Valley Authority workers, especially in a time of pandemic and an election year, when you've been so busy signing documents that affect the welfare of millions of Americans.</p><p>Taking time to ensure that these hundreds of workers, under your administration, can continue to provide great services to the American people, as they have since 1933, shows the people of Tennessee and beyond that you stand by your promise to keep American jobs with Americans.</p><p>This is a historic moment that I'm hopeful will reverse the harm outsourcing and offshoring have done to our nation's productive classes. And it is my hope that Congress will join you, Mr. President, in making sure our workers are more secure in their jobs.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>MR. LYNN: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you're the one that took the ad about me that - I didn't know that. (Laughter.) I was just saying, you know, I think he's the one that took this, really, vicious ad. Like, I hired this guy for $8 million, that I had nothing to do with it. I said, What's that? But, actually, you brought something very important up, because when I looked into it, I said, This guy is actually making $8 million a year. And you did the ad. So you really made me aware of what was going on with the Tennessee Valley Authority, which has been a - a feeding pot for a long time. And a lot of deep state, a lot of swamp creatures, okay?</p><p>So, that's it. So we're going to make that - I see. So I think now you realize that it wasn't about me. I hope you now realize that.</p><p>MR. LYNN: I do realize that, Mr. President. (Laughter.) But if I could -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I accept - I accept your apology. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LYNN: In full disclosure, Mr. President, when we sat down with the Davis Agency constructing the ad, they said, Who's your audience? And I said, Just one person. He's the only one that... -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's smart. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LYNN: - ...would do this, and he's the only one that can come to the aid of these workers in the Tennessee Valley.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He's the only one with any guts to do it - who has guts to do it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'll tell you, though - I have to say, Kevin, the end was very appropriate. And while it has nothing to do with me, I can do things with respect to the board, and ultimately, the board controls that decision. This is a very, very old authority done in the -</p><p>MR. LYNN: 1933, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So it was done during the FDR days. And it's been - you know, it's been getting crazier and crazier just over the years. And they have, basically, nobody watching over them. And the board isn't watching. You see this happening in public companies also. You see it happening a lot.</p><p>But for a essentially - I would say, for a federal employee to be paid $8 million - now what we're doing is we're looking at the board members, how much are they paid. Because usually what happens is they pay, and then he says, You know, I think you ought to get more money. And everybody is making a lot of money, and your pricing for electric and utilities starts going up, and people say, I wonder why.</p><p>I also see that they're doing a lot of things in terms of electric, which is very expensive electric. They're building facilities that are very, very expensive to build and don't work well. But we'll discuss that separately.</p><p>But I appreciate it because you did make me aware of what's going on, and it's a terrific thing we're doing today. Thank you very much, Kevin.</p><p>Please, Stacy. How are you?</p><p>MR. WHETZELL: I'm doing fine. Mr. President, my name is Stacy Whetzell. I'm the son of a sharecropper.</p><p>First, I want to thank you for being the great American President you are and for caring about and looking out for the great American citizens and workers. We thank you for that.</p><p>I picked cotton from the time I was big enough to carry my own pick sack until I married. My wife and I have been married 47 years and have 7 children and 14 grandchildren. I began working for TVA in 1975 as a carpenter's apprentice. Currently, I'm the system administrator on TVA's core team that's responsible for installing a $20 million computer system. Our team and the entire IT department have been praised and thanked multiple times this summer for the outstanding performance we've done.</p><p>So it was shocking and devastating to be notified on July the 23rd that IT leadership had decided our team and a total of 40 workers would be terminated and our work done to others. This brings the total planned outsourced jobs to over 200 in TVA information technology alone. We believe there are more planned to come.</p><p>The three companies chosen to do the IT work are all three foreign companies that depend heavily on H1-B workers. We're required to train these - our replacements, as President Trump said. Apparently, we're good enough to train but not retain.</p><p>Using H1-B workers to replace capable and willing American citizens is turning entire American communities upside down. Left unchecked, it will turn our nation upside down and negatively impact our national security as certainly as our 50-year build-up of dependence on China for manufacturing has. Thank you, President Trump, for beginning to reverse that hive-centric mistake.</p><p>American patriots will forever be grateful that you're also acting and fought the misguided and out-of-control H1-B worker program. I thank you for Americans first and acting to stop this travesty.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you're a very powerful speaker. And so powerful that we just got a call - Mark just brought this in from - the TVA CEO, and he's indicated a very strong willingness to reverse course. (Laughter and applause.)</p><p>So it must have been Stacy. I think Stacy did a much better job than me. I mean, you're talking and all of the sudden, I get the note.</p><p>So he's looking to change course and reverse it, and that's good. Now, maybe he'll take a major cut in salary, too. That'll be phase two, right? So we'll take a look at that. And maybe you'll start looking at that on behalf of everybody, gratis. Right?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Your group. That's great, isn't it.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yeah, I mean, TVA told me while we were in this process of working on behalf of the workers - I'm the union president, IFPTE-Engineering Association. They told me it's going to take a message - a stop order from the President in order to keep us from moving forward. And I said, I'm working on that. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you did a good job.</p><p>MS. HENSON: So I appreciate you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Everybody in this room did a good job.</p><p>MS. HENSON: I appreciate you, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And, Congressman, you have my endorsement.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay? You had it anyway, but you have it now. It's a great job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Well, I appreciate you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: The only congressman in the room. I tell you, Tim, great job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Thank you, brother.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's only phase one. Phase two is - imagine being paid the $8 million a year to run a thing that's pretty easy to run, in all fairness. It's not like he built it; he didn't build it. He went there and he's been there, and he gets a lot of money, and it shouldn't be. Five hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money, right?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir. In Tennessee, it is.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And I'm willing to say he gets paid more money than I do. I don't care.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But, you know, it shouldn't happen.</p><p>So that's a start. That's a start. And I think we should find out what board members make, okay? Because -</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: I'll look into that.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: - I can almost guarantee you they're paid heavily.</p><p>Congratulations, Stacy. Really good.</p><p>Please, go ahead.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir. Mr. President, thank you. My name is David Littlejohn. I am a soon-to-be father. This November, my wife will be giving birth to my first child. I am a long line - I'm the son in a long line of military men and women, so I was born with a heart of service. And with that, I love to serve the people of the Valley.</p><p>I was told July 23rd that I would be sent home and to be trained - training a contractor from a H1-B-dependent contract company. Now, I'm shaking right now because -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing great.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You had a big victory already. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir.</p><p>I'm shaking right now because this really impacts me and my wife and my unborn child, and I greatly appreciate everyone here to support us.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate it, and thank you very much.</p><p>MR. LITTLEJOHN: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you'll see what happens. It's going to be very quick, too. Thank you.</p><p>Wendy, please.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah. I'm Wendy Turner, and thank you for having us here. I've been a software engineer at TVA for 19 years. I'm going to change my comments a little. I was (inaudible) saying, you know, for the first time in 19 years, I didn't know what was going to happen to me and my kids, and I also take care of my mom. But what we're going to do going forward - so, thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And this was - everybody felt this way in Tennessee Valley Authority then, I guess- right? - if you do. You've been there for 19 years. So everyone had to feel this way, like there's been a big feeling of doubt, right?</p><p>MS. TURNER: Right. Yeah.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's a terrible thing.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They're waiting for it to happen to them.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah, and I've been training since June. I've been training our replacements from a company that relied on -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You've been training people?</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yes. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And so, did they let you off yet? Or are you not sure?</p><p>MS. TURNER: I got my notice in June that we would be laid off September 1st.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you're training people to take your job at a - whatever. Right?</p><p>MS. TURNER: They told us it would be -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And where are the people from that you're training?</p><p>MS. TURNER: All over the place. We - everything is done remotely or -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are they from other countries?</p><p>MS. TURNER: They're here on soil now. I don't know their status as far as -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Because with Disney, they were from other countries, right?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p><p>MS. TURNER: Yeah, so I don't know. I know the com- - Accenture is replacing our group, and I know they rely heavily on H1-B workers, but I don't know for sure where everyone is.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, we'll make sure that things work out for the three of them because they're brave to be here, actually, Sara. So you'll check that out, right?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Let's see that they get their jobs back -</p><p>MS. TURNER: Thank you very much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: - because I hear you're great workers. I mean, I said I want people, but I also people that are really good workers - that did a great job. Because, you know, people can be let go; should be able to - if they're not doing a good job. I'm all for that. I think - I'll bet you are.</p><p>But I said, I want people that really do a great job and were unfairly let go. Right, Tim?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Absolutely.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's, to me, very important.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Wendy. We'll see what happens. Okay? We're going to push it hard.</p><p>Chuck, please.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I recognize how busy your schedule is, and I sincerely appreciate your time today. Okay?</p><p>I'm Chuck Charnawskas. Basically, I've had the opportunity to work with the really technically competent people of the Tennessee Valley for seven years, okay? It's been a great experience. I have a degree in electrical engineering, 45 years of valuable industrial experience, and I'm a certified security professional here, okay?</p><p>Working with the people in Tennessee Valley was how I learned just how important the Tennessee Valley is to 11 million people in seven different states, okay, and how it basically impacts their lives. It's absolutely significant. And that is the reason that I'm really here today.</p><p>The TVA basically has the capability to produce 35 billion watts of powers, okay? They have 17,000 lines of high-voltage transmission.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: How does that compare to other big utilities, would you say?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: It definitely ranks right in the top of them. There's no question about it. And very significant: Tennessee Valley is part of the Southeastern Reliability Corporation, and it's obviously one of the biggest players in that area.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yea, it's very big. That's a lot.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Very significant in that respect, okay? And in essence here, as a consequence of that, they also basically support 35 dams - that produce power from 29 - to do flood control.</p><p>Just a couple years ago, they were able to reduce billions of dollars of potential damage by managing the rivers correctly, in that case.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: They have three major power plants - nuclear power plants.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What's your biggest dam? What's the big dam?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Probably it would be Chickamauga or -</p><p>MR. HICKS: Wilson. Wilson Dam, in Alabama.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Wilson in Alabama.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: There's the expert, right down there. (Laughter.) So I defer to the expert about that.</p><p>But the bottom line of it: As a consequence of this, it's a very - a very important player not only in the Southeast region, but for (inaudible) internationally, okay? And today, the TVA receives hundreds if not thousands of potential attacks - cyberattacks - testing its network here, right?</p><p>It's imperative to have experienced, knowledgeable employees to handle that situation, yeah. Okay?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: And a fine example of this - and I just kind of - you know, it's a little bit humorous, but the great power outage in 2003 was affected by a software glitch - okay? - that impacted and it shut down Manhattan for 24 hours.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I remember that very well. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: I thought you might be related - or familiar with that. So, as a - it just really points to the significance of having qualified, vetted people with proper clearances.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I agree.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: - dedicated to that job.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I agree. That wouldn't happen with you, would it? Huh? It wouldn't happen.</p><p>MS. TURNER: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I appreciate it, Chuck.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: And then just a - quickly, two other quick points. Basically, this outsourcing agreement could impact - the Tennessee Valley has always - our goals are to provide energy, economic development, and protect the environment. This particular outsourcing agreement could impact the Valley by $88 million to these local economies here. And for the individuals that are in there, not only may they lose their primary income, but they may consequently have insurance costs that basically reflect a 3- to 400 percent increase for these families on how they manage it.</p><p>And I'd like -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. And you're going to lose - you're going to lose people when you're firing people that are - they live in Tennessee and they live in Georgia and they live in the other states that I mentioned, and it's not a fair situation.</p><p>Go ahead. Let's - let's go, Chuck.</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Final point: The effort here to make America great again - okay - reflects the fact that we need to take into repatriate manufacturing companies and companies to take and spend our money domestically and support the domestic product. How can we justify spending these millions of dollars - for one particular consulting firm, $15 million to -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Who is the consulting firm?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Well, that would be Capgemini (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You spent $15 million a year on a consulting firm?</p><p>MR. CHARNAWSKAS: Well, this was a -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: We just found another nugget of gold. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Sara doesn't care about that one, but that's a - (laughter) - I care about. You spent $15 million to one consulting firm.</p><p>MS. HENSON: It's not - it's not a consulting - that's one of the companies that are picking up. And it's Capgemini, and that's $15 million that - just for that one company.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: How many are there - how many are there like that?</p><p>MS. HENSON: There's Capgemini, CGI, Accenture, and Tech Systems at TVA -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And they're paying tremendous amount of money?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, sir. And our workers are more than capable.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very - they're very political people. You know this is a very political group of people you just named?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Really? I just know that -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Not to me. Not to me, I don't care. (Laughter.) I don't care who they are, but they - they are very political.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, I mean, and these people are more than capable of doing the job and have done it with excellence. And TVA says your matrix for your performance is above; it doesn't make sense. And what you're doing - I cannot tell you how much it means to me. And for these workers it - and I'm very emotional because TVA is a large racket. They do their thing, and nobody can touch them. And I believe today they've been touched.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's a racket.</p><p>MS. HENSON: They've been touched. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, it's a racket. Well, we just found that out. (Laughter.) No, it's a racket.</p><p>I mean - I mean, I understand it. The four firms that you just mentioned that are paid tens of millions of dollars, they're very political firms. You know, they may be good, but they're very political firms. And they do it for much less much - much, much, much less. You could give them half. You could give them 10 percent, they'd probably do it for. Those are big numbers for a consulting firm.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, they're - they're not the consulting firm; they're the ones actually going to take these people's jobs. That -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's worse.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes, it is worse. So I mean -</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tim, go ahead, please.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Mr. President, thank you -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Congratulations.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: - and Vice President so much for this. My mama worked at TVA after the Second - during the - at the end of the Second World War, when dad came home from the Pacific and married her, and then she went into education. But, you know, working people are the backbone of this country. That's not clich\\xE9 and you've -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: - you've highlighted that so much with the trades and other things, and I'm very appreciative of the fact.</p><p>But I'll you what: Dadgummit, if TVA wants be Duke Electric, let them because Duke Electric, but they're not. And they - they hide behind the government's skirt and they - they use eminent domain, and their arrogance is beyond belief. You know, when they had the ash spill, people died, and then - you know, and then they are just these poor country folks that are just pushing them off until they all die off, until those lawsuits go away. It's ridiculous.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, that's right. And, by the way, in Kentucky, when we wanted to have a plant open with a lot of jobs, they didn't even want to consider it.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No. No, they didn't. It's their arrogance. You're questioning them, and finally we have a President with the guts that understands business and government. And if TVA wants to be a government entity, they need to - they need to declare it, and quit using - they hide behind - you know, they have their - their -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Do you think Joe Biden would do this?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Heck no.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He wouldn't know you're alive.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He'd be - no, he'd -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He doesn't know he's alive either. (Laughter.)</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: He needs to get out of the bunker.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: No, can you imagine him sitting at this table right now? Wouldn't have a clue.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay. So go ahead, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, I think you pretty much covered it, Mr. President. I'm just honored to be here. And I -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I'm honored that you're here. And you've done a fantastic job.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: And I thank you for standing up for working Americans.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, well we're going to - and we're going to get this finished too. So we'll get it finished, Sara.</p><p>Thank you very much, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Gene, please.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: Mr. President, thank you for bringing this group together. And this this meeting has, I think, shown a very human impact on individual working -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Incredible.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: - men and women of a practice that's actually pretty widespread.</p><p>And the way it's worked under our immigration laws for a while now is that a company that wants to bring in workers from overseas - wants to use the H1-B program for high-skilled workers - has to file an attestation with us at the Labor Department, saying American workers aren't going to lose their jobs when I bring in these H1-B workers. And they have to say it's not going to hurt their wages.</p><p>But what companies do is they bring workers in, and then they lease them out to another company. And so you've got one company bringing them in and then leasing them to TVA. And it's true, the company bringing them in - their workers aren't being affected, but the TVA workers are.</p><p>And so I took a look at this, as your Labor Secretary, recently, and I said to my staff - I said, Well, if the workers are going to the other company, why doesn't the other company, where they're actually going to be working and supervised, also file an application?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. Right.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: And say, 'We're not going to affect U.S. workers either.' And I said to staff, Why can't we do that? They looked into it. And, Mr. President, today, you're going be signing an order -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, good.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: - that requires that change.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: So, going forward, when those workers are going to another company, both companies are going to (inaudible) - (applause) - and that's a change we'll make. We'll do it together with the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>I just want to mention one other thing we're doing together. For more than 15 years, the Secretary of Labor has had the authority to initiate an investigation of abuse of H1-B program when he or she finds reasonable cause. That has never been done. That authority has never been used.</p><p>But again, we saw - signed a memo of understanding on Friday with the Department of Homeland Security that'll change that too. They're going to now share information they have, which I can then use to bring cases when we're finding the program (inaudible).</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Very good. You're going to find a lot. And thank you very much, Gene.</p><p>SECRETARY SCALIA: Thank you. And thank you for this order today.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Good work, Stacy. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right, Stacy? Right? I like that. You like that?</p><p>MR. WHETZELL: We'll take it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Linda, please.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being with us today. The concern you show for American workers is greatly appreciated. And my mother made me promise to tell you that Alabama loves and appreciates your leadership. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I love Alabama.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: So, a promise that my mother made.</p><p>My name is Linda McDonald. I've lived in northeast Alabama my entire life. My goal was to work at TVA; that was my American Dream. After years of sacrifice and hard work, I achieved that goal. I've been working for TVA for seven years now. But - so, and in that role, I got to see every day -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So that was like an ambition of yours to work someday for TVA?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Correct.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you finally got there?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I did.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So, what's happening?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Well, June 30th, we were told that we would be outsourced to another company with -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: All right. Yeah.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Yeah, so, here I am, faced with -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you had to have these consulting firms making 10, 15 million dollars a year?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: Yeah, I feel like my -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And the man that heads it making $8 million a year, right? (Laughter.)</p><p>Go ahead.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I feel like my American Dream was being stolen from me -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: - and given to someone else. So I just think -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Is that the way you view it: given to somebody else?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: It is. It was taken from me, and -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's a very interesting way -</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: - it was then given to someone else.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: - of viewing it, right?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: So, I thank you for listening to us, because it felt, for so long, like no one was even listening to us. So thank you very much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I've been hearing about it for a long time. When I was running, I met Sara, and we worked on the Disney situation -</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes, sir. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: - but that was a long time ago. But - and, you know, this has been happening for a while. So we're taking care of it.</p><p>Thank you very much. Thank you, Linda. We'll see what happens. You may be very pleasantly surprised. Okay?</p><p>MS. MCDONALD: I hope so.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>Jonathan, please.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, thank you for your time.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>MR. HICKS: My name is Jonathan Hicks. I'm a - I'm from a large family, and we've had three - three members of our family who have served in the U.S. military. I grew up in Tennessee, around the Knoxville area, and started my career with TVA in 2001 as an IT intern. During - as soon as I graduated, I got a fulltime job there, and I've been there for - for 19 years. I've been -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And that was a big deal, right?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Working - because there's a great prestige to that.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's true.</p><p>MR. HICKS: I've spent my time there working for river operations for the - for their group, and helping them, you know, have programs - mostly in-house solutions to be able to manage the river and the river systems.</p><p>I was told in June - early June - that I would be training replacements, that I would be receiving my work notice in September, and that the workers that I'd be training, there's been five or plus that I've been training for my one position, and at least four of those seem to be H1-B type workers.</p><p>I guess there's a concern with the kind of stuff that we do, at least for the river operations, and that they're generating a significant amount of power out of all the - out of all the - all of these dams. And, you know, is this something that - that we want to turn over this knowledge, this ability to control these dams and - you know, whether it be generation, whether it be floodgates - and hand it over to corporations that aren't in the U.S., to workers that aren't necessarily in the U.S. doing this work?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are you there now? Are you -</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I - I've been put on non-work status. I'm still employed and still getting a paycheck until September 1st, but I've been -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What happens on September 1st?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I've been relieved of my job duties, but September 1st is when I would lose -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you train people to take your job?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So you've worked with people to take your job.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You've taught them, like, almost everything you know, but plenty, right?</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I - I think there's a big -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Maybe not. Maybe you held back a couple of secrets. (Laughter.)</p><p>MR. HICKS: Well, I think there's a - I think there's a big learning curve and there's - for the knowledge that they do there for river operations, I think it takes several years of understanding the job in order to be able to do this.</p><p>The people that are taking over the job have never dealt with utilities, they've never dealt with power generation, they've never dealt with any kind of water management or hydrogenation. And so the - to say that they're ready to go is a misstatement. So -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, let's see how out it works out, Jonathan. I think you're going to be in very good shape. Okay? I have a prediction.</p><p>MR. HICKS: Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, Jonathan.</p><p>Please.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: It's - I'm so honored to be here.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Honored to have you.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: My name is Renae McKenzie, and I actually work for the Engineering Association as an advocate for these IT employees and for other white-collar workers. But I've worked really closely with the IT professionals at TVA, with all of this that has been going on.</p><p>I've had to witness the anguish of the different employees that are performing these knowledge transfers on the software and the applications that they actually custom built themselves.</p><p>But so many TVA employees have been there from the beginning of their careers. So to actually witness what's happening to them, being replaced by these non-Americans, is very difficult.</p><p>But I think one of the hardest things to witness is what TVA is actually doing to themselves. I mean, their mission is about bringing economic development to the Tennessee Valley. And to be taking that - taking our economy and just giving it outside of the United States is just almost - it's unbelievable because of what they stand for and what they were built for. To come out of economic -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you see them going outside of the United States, not just here. You see them go -</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Right. Well, if you look at these companies, these companies are based outside of the United States. So - so when they're getting their millions of dollars, I mean, it's going to France, it's really going to - I think one of them is -</p><p>MS. HENSON: India.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: India, Canada.</p><p>PARTICIPANT: Ireland</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: And Ireland. So, yes, our dollars are going to them.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Unbelievable. And they get us in many other ways too, but we're stopping it, as you noticed. That's very interesting.</p><p>So you would say France, India, Ireland, Canada. Who else?</p><p>MS. HENSON: That's the main groups right there. Those (inaudible) countries.</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Right. Those are the main ones.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: A lot of them - are a lot of the workers being outsourced -</p><p>MR. LYNN: All these firms: H1-B visa dependent. And 70 percent of H1-B visa workers in the United States come from one country: mainly, India.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: You know, Mr. President, I worry too about the national security. You know, we're during a pandemic, people are out of work, and our electric grid could be put in the hands of folks that, maybe, their loyalty isn't to this great country, and that bothers me.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You know, with TVA, more so than most companies. You're right - you're talking about controlling all of that energy and power. It's - you're right. You're right about that, Tim. That's a very good statement. Anything else?</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Just, it - again, it's such an honor to be in your presence. (Laughs.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's my honor. It's my great honor. Do you know the man next to you is Ken Cuccinelli, a legend? (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. MCKENZIE: Look, and I tend to be very quiet like him. Just saying.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He's a legend in his own mind. (Laughter.)</p><p>Ken - Ken has done a fantastic job on the border. Unbelievable job on the border. And you might just tell us for a couple of seconds while we have the - the media here - I'm sure they'll report it very accurately - how well we're doing on the border and then maybe get on to make a statement, because I know you've been working with Gene and everybody very hard.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Yes. And Secretary Scalia really covered the partnership with - between DHS and Department of Labor to solve this problem. You're solving it forcefully today for these folks. You're certainly putting the ball in motion to do that. And what we're - our two agencies, at your direction from June, are going to do is solve this permanently so that we never have to see this happen again.</p><p>But, on the border, we're seeing success with your leadership with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries. The relationships you helped us forge last year, in 2019, are bearing fruit at the border during a very difficult time with the coronavirus and that taskforce, of course, led by the Vice President. And the ability since March to enforce the public health order there has changed the nature of our ability to protect the border.</p><p>There are still people getting away, more than we would like. But last year, they were running to us; this year, they're running from us, at the border.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's right.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: It's a bit different. And over 80 percent of the folks that we're apprehending are being returned to Mexico in under two hours, which is astonishing. It's just an astonishing turn.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It used to take, in some cases, years. Years.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Right. Absolutely.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's been incredible what's happened at the border. And I think the wall is helping you quite a bit, right? We have now about almost 271 miles of wall.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Everywhere that that new system is put in place, the Border Patrol agents are just universal in their praise for both their safety and the way it impedes illegal traffic - not just people, but drugs, as well, and so forth. So it's extremely effective, and it's going up faster and faster and faster.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They had a human trafficker the other day saying that they used to go out and they're trafficking - human traffic - mostly women and children, but mostly women, and they'd bring them across the border, taped up and - horrible.</p><p>And this guy was saying how they used to go up and they'd make a left turn. They'd make a right and then a left into the United States. He says, and now we just keep driving into this massive wall that nobody gets through. Nobody is getting through that wall. That wall is the real deal. And it's steel, concrete, and everything else. And lots of cameras all over it.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And drones on top of it. And people aren't getting through. But it's been an incredible, incredible success.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: It's a real force multiplier for the Border Patrol and OFO.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. And Mexico is helping us a lot. They have -</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: A lot better partnership.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: - 27,000 soldiers.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: I remember how people complained about how you were pushing them so hard last year. But the partnership that's grown up with Mexico has been the best. We have really had, in decades, if not forever -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's what they say.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: - in cooperating and securing the border.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: They have a very good President who was just here two weeks ago.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: He was. Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: He's really doing a good job. And we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding the border. And they don't play games. They don't play games. It's been pretty amazing. The numbers are way, way down. And we want people to come in, but they have to come in legally, and that's -</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: You got to come in legally. That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You're doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it.</p><p>Okay, please. Go ahead. You can finish up.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yeah, I appreciate you so much. I really do. As I said earlier, I'm the union president for the workers that are represented by this move that TVA has taken. I met earlier with Tim Burchett and he told me how disgusted he was with it. But that was earlier.</p><p>We've really tried to get our voice heard. We've been screaming, Hey! Hey! Help us out.</p><p>Finally, U.S. Tech Workers came out, kind of put a commercial together, and we're - you know, that got your attention, and we appreciate it so much.</p><p>I've lived my whole life in the Tennessee Valley region, and my uncle was a - worked at TVA during World War Two. He laid his job aside, and went and served and perished in that war. My mother told me TVA was a great place to work, and I - I've worked there now 35 years.</p><p>This means a lot to the people of the Tennessee Valley region, more than you will ever know. I know that consulting companies looked at what to do with this IT work. They're now looking at what to do - the same consulting companies are looking at what do with the transmission work. That transmission - that grid has got to be protected at all cost. And we've got to. We cannot afford to let someone else, who may not have the loyalty to our nation, have the grid.</p><p>And I think that some of these workers here at this table, IT workers, that's one of the biggest they've said to me: There's a large chance that we would be breached. And we can't do that. And we tried to say all those things -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, with our people running it, a very small chance, from what I understand.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes. With the right people running it. right. But you can't give it to just anybody. And that's why these workers at TVA are so important. And I appreciate you and all that you are doing for us.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Are the people that you're representing, are they - because you represent a big group of people - are they all nervous, like the folks at the table?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Like Wendy?</p><p>MS. HENSON: They're going, Are we next, Gay? Is this what's coming next? And my answer is, Not on my watch, if we can help it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tell them no. Tell them no, they're not next.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Okay. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay? You can tell them. I think we can say that. So thank you very much.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Thank you. I just think you bringing TVA back to their mission of service to the people of the Valley, service to people of the Valley and to this nation is - is a pivotal moment for the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So, right now, their mission is taking care of a lot of consultants and a lot of people and paying - paying heads of this whole thing $8 million a year. And you'll find a lot of other things in there that are crazy.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, people over profit. And that's what you're doing here.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: What do the people of Tennessee think when they hear that the head of TVA - which has been running for a long time - and, in all fairness, not a very difficult thing; there are many people who can do it. What do they hear when they hear - and they think of government, you know? It's sort of semi- - I guess, you call it - public-private. But there's not private, really, when you think of it. So, it's a board member.</p><p>What do they think when they hear that the head person is making $8 million a year? Which is, by the way, I said it before, the most highly paid person anywhere in any country if you call this government, which it sort of is. What do they think when they hear? Do they know he makes $8 million a year?</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, they do now after Kevin's commercial. (Laughter.) But they're pretty shocked. I mean - in fact, they - I think the workers even - I think some of the workers at TVA have been shocked about that. It is a lot of money.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: But people have known. I've known, actually, before the commercial because we were looking at it. We sent them notices a year ago and two years ago saying, We want some information. And, you know, people have known this. I just can't even imagine that somebody gets paid $8 million a year.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Well, the difference -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: It's the most sought-after job. It has to be the most sought-after job in any country in any government. Right, Tim? You'd take the job. Would you resign from Congress immediately?</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Take it for one year. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: You only need it for one year. You -</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: I don't know. You don't know my wife and daughter, Mr. President. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Tim would take it. That's - he'll take it only -</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: No, they're actually pretty thrifty.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Only for a year. You just need it for one year. That's right. Anyway.</p><p>MS. HENSON: So the workers - they are surprised at that. But, you know, back to the days of Kilgore and having worked there so long - I tell people I started when I was eight, because I can't believe how long I've worked there now -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p><p>MS. HENSON: But the truth is, there are very capable people at TVA that love -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'll bet.</p><p>MS. HENSON: - the TVA and the mission that they're really - were put together for and would love to take that job.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I even think they like your President - your current President, anyway. I'm not sure about the past President.</p><p>MS. HENSON: Tennessee Valley is - that's right. The boats on the lake all say, you know -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Trump. Yeah. No, they're great people. Say hello to them. Just say hello. They're great people.</p><p>Sara, why don't you just discuss it real quick, and you can maybe work with us in getting it all done very quickly. Okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Of course, President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you for having us and having everyone here and for all you're doing with regard to immigration. Immigration should be about America, Americans, and the immigrants. Right now - the way it was, before you started working on it, it's always been the big business, big tech, and universities. And with you, we are working to make immigration in America for the right reasons.</p><p>And Protect U.S. Workers - I endorsed you in 2016, we endorse you in 2020, and we know for a fact that Slow Biden and the Democrats will never push towards immigration that benefits Americans, America, and the immigrants. And I think they hide behind: Nationalists are bad, immigrants are kind and good. And if we are against the immigration the way it is now, then we are racists.</p><p>But the reality is, if you can keep immigration the way it's going now, the way Joe Biden will push it, the problem is you're actually benefiting the big tech billionaires and universities, and that is not what immigration is about in this country.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Where you come up with the name Slow Biden? You know, so many people want me to use that term, and I say, It's too mean; it's too nasty. (Laughter.)</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Oh, no! That means I'm mean.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And you just come up with that term. And where did that come from? Is that the -</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: My son, actually, who's 11.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Your son? He's 11?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: If he's 11, and he said he's slow and that he shouldn't be President -</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: They need to pay your son $15 million in consulting. (Laughter.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great job.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Actually, during the rallies in 2016, you met my son. He had a Thor, and he dressed him up like President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, that's great.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Yes. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: That's very nice. Thank you, Sara. Very - great job you're doing.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELLL: Thank you so much. Thank you.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Good. Thank you.</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you for all you do.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Okay, Mike. Go ahead. We'll knock it out, Sara.</p><p>THE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Mr. President. I'll be - I'll just be very brief.</p><p>Four years ago, when you ran for this office, you said the forgotten men and women in America would be forgotten no more. You said that we'd put America first and American workers first, you said that American workers would have a seat at the table in this administration, and we'd deliver real results.</p><p>And today, we see all that happen right in front of us. Because of your leadership indicated during this meeting, that the TVA is going to reverse course on their plan to use H1-B visa workers to replace hardworking Americans. And I can see the gratitude and the emotion on faces around the room, Mr. President, and the gratitude that these people feel and all those that will be reading about this and hearing about this in the days ahead.</p><p>But I also just want to say, finally, to all the - all the great Americans who gathered here, who have been willing to speak up: Know that with the executive order the President is signing today, we're not just solving your problem. What the President is committing to today is to end the abuse of our worker visa program once and for all, and pulling together multiple agencies to do that. And I want to promise you that you've not only gone out and been a champion for fellow workers at TVA, but you've been champions for American workers all across this country.</p><p>And I know I speak on behalf of the President and our whole administration when I thank you. Thank you for stepping up for American workers and making it possible for this President to keep one more promise to working Americans. God bless you. (Applause.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. So we're going to sign a little document now. Is that okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: I would love that. Thank you, President Trump.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: And it's very important one, aligning federal contractors and contracting and hiring practices with the interests of the American workers, which is very simple - which actually just boils down to pretty much what we're talking about today. Okay?</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much, President Trump.</p><p>(The executive order is signed.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Here, give that to Sara because she was there very early. (Distributes signing pen.)</p><p>MS. BLACKWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I have to give - I have to give one to you. You got us moving here. That's good. Will you pass these around the table, Mike? We'll just pass them on that side. You'll pass them on this side. Everybody that doesn't get it - (distributes signing pens.)</p><p>So here we are.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: (Inaudible.)</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I'll get you one, Tim. Don't worry.</p><p>So, thank you very much everybody. (Applause.)</p><p>We're going to be - we're going to be discussing, very shortly, a immigration bill, which covers this and many other things. It'll be a very, very comprehensive bill. That's a word that some people love and some people hate, but it'll be very comprehensive only in the sense that it'll cover just about everything.</p><p>It'll be based on merit. It will be - it'll cover territory that nobody would have thought could have ever been agreed to. And I think it'll be bipartisan, in the sense that people are going to like a lot of the things that are in there. And probably some people won't; we're going to have that. And we'll probably do it maybe a little bit after our convention. We'll sign it after the convention.</p><p>Likewise, we're going to be doing a healthcare bill - act - and it'll be extremely comprehensive. It will cover a lot of things that nobody thought you would be able to get, and - I mean, in a positive way. And I think it'll be very popular. And it will be a great thing for our country.</p><p>In addition, we have many other things. But immigration and healthcare - it doesn't get much bigger than that. Immigration will be very merit-based, but it'll be - it'll be great for the worker, and it'll be great for people coming into our country - but coming into our country legally and loving our country and wanting to help our country, as opposed to people coming in and they don't like our country.</p><p>You see that, and you see that with certain of our politicians that ran for office. I say, I don't think they like our country too much. All they do is complain. And you would never tell them to go back to their own country because that would be inappropriate, wouldn't it? But all they do is complain about our country, and their country is going to hell. So, you know, it's sort of an interesting phenomenon.</p><p>So the - the merit-based immigration is going to be incredible, and the healthcare bill or act is going to be something that I don't think anybody in this country thought they'd ever see. And we've done much of that. If look at some of the legislation that we passed, Ken, I think you can say very strongly we've - we've gotten things passed that nobody would be possible.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: That's right.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Whether it's Right to Try - that's where you're terminally ill and you don't have a right to use our great medicines because they haven't been approved - they're in a line of approval and it takes some time. We've cut the time in half, by the way, for approval by the FDA. But people are sick.</p><p>We have very promising drugs and they're not allowed to use them because - I mean, they're terminally ill and they wouldn't let them use them because of liability and other things, but I got that taken care of. So, Right to Try was a very important one.</p><p>Getting Veterans Choice was so important - having Veterans Choice. Nobody thought we could get that. Hasn't been done in 50 years. They haven't been able to get it. We got Veterans Choice. We got Veterans Accountability. Because we have so many other things. So many things.</p><p>And on the border, Ken, we've done things that nobody thought would have been possible. Right? Do you want to name a couple of them?</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: We're making enormous progress in the - especially in the regulatory arena: reestablishing the 140-year-old American tradition of inviting immigrants here who can stand on their own two feet, as - much like Sara had said. And to add to this country and not - while not becoming a burden on the country.</p><p>We've also - the security that you've advocated for and pushed us to achieve has been unprecedented on a border that we still have more work to do. But we -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Great progress.</p><p>ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY CUCCINELLI: - the amount of improvement in three years is just extraordinary.</p><p>And one more piece of legislation you know is near and dear to my heart that you led is criminal justice reform, which was - you know, lots of people before you talked about it, and this is the first administration to do it.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Nobody else could've gotten that done. Nobody. And we really thank Ken, but we thank a lot of people that came through.</p><p>By the way, some conservative - very conservative really wanted it and some liberal wanted it. But we got criminal justice reform done. Nobody thought that was possible. The biggest beneficiary is African Americans and Hispanic Americans, I would say - and Asian Americans - the three, the groups.</p><p>But tremendous benefits and - you know, it's really amazing. When we got that done, we had people supporting that that I would've never thought would've supported it. Not for bad reasons, but they would've never supported it, and they actually led the way. It's pretty incredible. Criminal justice reform was a big deal. You know that, Tim.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE BURCHETT: Yes, sir.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: So - and you were helpful actually, and I appreciate it. And thank you very much. Anybody have a question?</p><p>Q Yes, Mr. President -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.</p><p>Q Mr. President, on TikTok: You said over the weekend -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>Q - that you're planning to ban it. I know that you spoke with the CEO of Microsoft after that.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I did.</p><p>Q So can you give us an update on -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.</p><p>Q - where you're at?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. We had a great conversation. He called me to see whether or not - how I felt about it. And I said, Look, it can't be controlled, for security reasons, by China. Too big, too invasive, and it can't be. And here is the deal: I don't mind if - whether it's Microsoft or somebody else - a big company, a secure company, very - a very American company buy it. It's probably easier to buy the whole thing than to buy 30 percent of it. Because they say, How do you do 30 percent? Who's going to get the name? The name is hot; the brand is hot. And who's going to get the name? How do you do that if it's owned by two different companies?</p><p>So my personal opinion was: You're probably better off buying the whole thing rather than buying 30 percent of it. I think buying 30 percent is complicated. And I suggested that he can go ahead. He can try. We set a date - I set a date at around September 15th, at which point it's going to be out of business in the United States. But if somebody - and whether it's Microsoft or somebody else - buys it, that'll be interesting.</p><p>I did say that if you buy it, whatever the price is, that goes to whoever owns it. Because I guess it's China, essentially, but more than anything else. I said a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States because we're making it possible for this deal to happen. Right now, they don't have any rights, unless we give it to them. So if we're going to give them the rights, then it has to come into - it has to come into this country.</p><p>It's a little bit like the landlord/tenant: Without a lease, the tenant has nothing. So they pay what's called key money, or they pay something. But the United States should be reimbursed or should be paid a substantial amount of money, because without the United States, they don't have anything - at least having to do with the 30 percent.</p><p>So I told him that. I think we're going to have - maybe a deal is going to be made. It's a great asset. It's a great asset. But it's not a great asset in the United States unless they have the approval of the United States. So it'll close down on September 15th, unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal - an appropriate deal. So the Treasury of the - really, the Treasury, I guess you would say, of the United States gets a lot of money. A lot of money. Okay?</p><p>Q Mr. President, can you explain why so many of the public health experts on the coronavirus task force are contradicting you on things like why the virus is so widespread in this country, on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine? Why are so many of these people on your task force contradicting you?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think we're doing a great job. I think we're doing great on vaccines. We're doing great on therapeutics. You'll be seeing that very soon. I think we're - when you look at a map, this is a map of the - I've got - I sort of shown that around a little bit, but that's - the red is the area of most concern. (Displays a U.S. map.) Pretty recent map of the - of the country. And there's a lot of - a lot of people that - in a lot of areas that have gotten very - you know, better very fast.</p><p>Hydroxy has tremendous support, but politically, it's toxic because I supported it. If they would have said, Do not use hydroxychloroquine under any circumstances, they would have come out and they would've said, It's a great - it's a great thing. Many doctors have come out strongly in favor of it. They want it very badly. It's a great malaria drug.</p><p>So, for many years -</p><p>Q But Admiral Giroir says it's not effective.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Let me finish my - let me finish my answer.</p><p>So for many years - it's, I guess, 60 years it's been a malaria drug; very successful, as you know. And it's been also a drug for lupus. And it caused no trouble - virtually nothing, in terms of causing people to get sick or having problems with anything. You add the zinc and you add the azithromycin - the Z-Pak, as they call it - and it's been very - I happened to take it myself, the threesome.</p><p>I took it myself for a period of two weeks. I mean, I - I had no problem. I had no problem whatsoever. And, importantly, I, you know, didn't test positive. That's very nice. Okay? I'm very happy about that negative.</p><p>And so - so that's the story. It's - it's very highly thought of. Interestingly, a great doctor, from what I understand - a great doctor from Yale feels very strongly about hydroxychloroquine. The Ford Clinic in Michigan came out with a very, very powerful paper saying it's very good. Many other - in France, as you know, they came out with a very positive statement. Many individual doctors have come out with very positive statements.</p><p>I will tell you that if I was surrounded by people, as I was at the time - the reason I took it: You know, we had some people that were relatively near me that tested positive. And I took it for that reason, just because I've heard good things.</p><p>Q But Fauci says it doesn't work. Admiral Giroir says it doesn't work.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I don't agree with Fauci on everything.</p><p>Q They're on your task force.</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I don't agree with Fauci. Look, Fauci didn't want - and I - I like him. I get along with him actually great. But he didn't want to ban people from China from coming into the country, and I overrode him and I did the right thing. He was saying face masks are no good a short while ago. So it doesn't mean he's a bad person, because he's not. He's a good person; I like him. But we - we disagree on things. We disagree on things.</p><p>Now, I will say this: We've done an amazing job with ventilators. We're supplying the world with ventilators. Ventilators are very hard, very expensive, very hard to make, very complex. Very complicated machines. Very - very expensive.</p><p>Q But why does the -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it. Hold it.</p><p>Q But why does the U.S. have so many deaths?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it.</p><p>Q The U.S. has so many deaths compared to -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Hold it.</p><p>Q - so many countries around the world. I -</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Fake news CNN, hold it. We have done a great job in this country. We haven't been given - and not me. I'm not talking about me. The Vice President, the task force have not been given the kind of credit.</p><p>If you look, countries all over the world are exploding right now - people that you said were doing a wonderful job, so wonderful. But right now, take a look at the countries that are exploding: You have Italy back. You have Spain back. You have France back. You have Germany back. You have a lot of countries, and that's not to knock them.</p><p>It is a very delicate, very contagious disease. It was released by China. It should never have been allowed to release. There was the source where you could have stopped it. And they did stop it from going into China, although now they say that China is having a lot of problems. Moscow, in Russia, is having tremendous problems.</p><p>What China unleashed was a very, very sad situation. With all of that being understood, the United States has done an amazing job, a great job, and you're going to see that because we have vaccines and we have therapeutics coming very soon.</p><p>Yeah, go ahead.</p><p>Q Mr. President, why are you not involved directly in negotiations with Capitol Hill?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I am. Oh, why? The fact that I'm not over there with Crazy Nancy? No, I'm totally involved.</p><p>Q Have you spoken with her?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: I'm totally involved. And we're going to be doing some things that are very good, because we don't think that she - look, what Chuck Schumer wants more than anybody - and I would say Nancy Pelosi would be second - they want to bail out cities and states that have done a bad job over a long period of time. Nothing to do with coronavirus or China virus, or whatever you want to call it.</p><p>They want to bail out cities and states. They want bailout money. They want to trillion dollars in bailout money, and a lot of people don't want to do that because we don't think it's right. The Democrats have run some very bad states and some very, very bad cities, and a lot of people don't want to give them a trillion dollars to reward them for doing a bad job.</p><p>If you look at some of the states - I won't insult anybody by naming those states, but you know what they are. They want bailout money. They're not interested in the people. They're not interested in unemployment. They're not interested in evictions, which is a big deal - the evictions. They want to evict. A lot of people are going to be evicted, but I'm going to stop it because I'll do it myself if I have to. I have a lot of powers with respect to executive orders, and we're looking at that very seriously right now.</p><p>But what the Democrats want, they want - they're slow-rolling it, and all they're really interested in is bailout money to bail out radical-left governors and radical-left mayors, like in Portland and places that are so badly run. Chicago, New York City - you see what's going on over there. Bailout cities and states who have been poorly run and spent a fortune doing it, they want a trillion dollars, and we're really not interested in that.</p><p>Okay, thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>Q What about the Postal Service, Mr. President? What about the Postal Service? Any message to your postmaster general?</p><p>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Jim, very much. Thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>1:10 P.M.

China reporting its weakest growth in decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And climate pledge. Microsoft promising to become carbon negative.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And new ammunition. Democrats getting a series of revelations in the impeachment trial.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is Friday, my friends, and this is FIRST MOVE.</p><p>Welcome to FIRST MOVE. So good to have you with us, almost looking like to be another record breaking day here on Wall Street. All the major indices are look set to hit fresh all-time highs at the open.</p><p>Tech stocks are on track for their strongest gains. The Dow rose almost one percent on Thursday. It begins today's session less than two and a half percent away from hitting the milestone 30,000 so far this year, which is only 15 days.</p><p>The Dow and S&amp;P 500 have risen more than two and a half percent. Tech has actually been the strongest gainer with the NASDAQ rallying over four and a quarter percent.</p><p>The major markets in Europe are solidly higher as well this Friday. French and U.K. stocks are leading the pack of about one percent. Stocks rose in Asia, too, but the gains were muted in China.</p><p>New numbers show the Chinese economy growing at 6.1 percent in 2019 -- that is its weakest performance in nearly three decades. The big question is will the just completed Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal help boost future growth.</p><p>We begin our driver with looking closer at the Chinese data that's just coming in. David Culver joins us live now from Beijing. So David, of course, for any other country, these numbers, 6.1 percent would be stellar. But this isn't any country we're talking about. This is China. The numbers came in at the lower end of its target range. Is the worst over?</p><p>DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And you're right, Zain. In the past, we've seen double digit growth here, percentage wise here. They say they're within their target. Of course, there's even been questions as to the reliability of these numbers and the data that they've put out.</p><p>To your question as to if the worst is over yet? Well, if you listen to officials here, they're certainly putting out a narrative that would suggest that there is going to be some stability going forward.</p><p>In fact, Liu He, the Vice Premier who is representing the Chinese delegation this week in Washington for the deal signing of Phase 1 suggested that 2020 would be positive and that things were looking upwards and he pointed mostly towards a lessening of the reliance on debt, as well as a drive towards innovation.</p><p>The reality is, economic woes have been felt here. It's been felt in consumer confidence, even car sales have seen 18 straight months of decline in China. It's been felt as well with unemployment. There's real concern over unemployment, particularly in some of the rural provinces.</p><p>And that's been something that the State Council even put out last month here in China, telling those local provincial leaders essentially to go at all lengths to make sure that there are not massive layoffs.</p><p>So there is urgency to this, but at the same time, state media is also coming across to try to point out some of the positives as they see it. They point out some of the numbers that came out today, towards retail for example, towards the back end of 2019, look to be trending upwards.</p><p>They say that is a big plus perhaps countering the negative consumer confidence that we've seen here thus far.</p><p>So going forward, the economic stability question from Phase 1 remains the mystery. Will it, in fact, stabilize things here and allow for China to see a rebound? That's to be determined, really -- Zain.</p><p>ASHER: So, obviously, with the Phase 1 trade deal between the U.S. and China, that's a positive development for the Chinese economy. But the fact is that there are many, many tariffs still in place. How badly does China need to progress to a Phase 2 trade deal between both countries?</p><p>CULVER: It is interesting to point that out. The fact that really the only rollback was on 7.5 percent on $120 billion worth of tariffs, but that 25 percent remains on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods.</p><p>So they seem to be wanting to see how this implementation process will go. It is also interesting to note the messaging here. They don't want to come across too desperate towards the U.S. Of course, they want to move towards a Phase 2, but they're also mindful in how they come across publicly in displaying that.</p><p>[09:05:00]</p><p>CULVER: In the U.S. side of things, President Trump has said that that could wait until after the 2020 election. But can the Chinese economy hold on through that?</p><p>Leading up to Phase 1, they were releasing little details. In fact, all the details out of Phase 1 were coming from the Trump administration officials. China was keeping tight lipped about it.</p><p>And it seemed that they wanted the ink to dry first before moving forward with any of the details, but even before they signed it, Zain, there were publications coming out through op-eds and other editorials that were trying to portray that China had this strength underneath it, that it could withstand even going without a Phase 1 deal if it had to, going forward.</p><p>So the messaging, the narrative versus reality, that seems to be to separate things.</p><p>ASHER: David Culver, live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>So our next drive, the T in Alphabet now stands for trillion. Google's parent company joined the exclusive Trillion Dollar Club after the share price surged on Thursday. It is only the fourth -- the fourth -- American company that has ever hit that milestone.</p><p>Paul La Monica joins us live now. So Paul, this has really been a stellar sort of 15 years for Alphabet or back when it had its IPO, obviously, it was Google.</p><p>The company launched its IPO with about -- worth about $23 billion, and now, it's a $1 trillion company. Part of this is to do with, really the whole that it's had on the search market and also advertising revenue from the likes of YouTube.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Exactly. You know, Zain, Google- owner Alphabet has really dominated online search advertising along with Facebook for the past couple of years, and you've mentioned YouTube that is another huge driver of revenue for the company.</p><p>They've obviously diversified into many other businesses like Life Sciences, which is a reason why they have the Alphabet umbrella for everything, but Google now, at this trillion dollar market cap, there are only two other American companies currently worth more. That is Apple and Microsoft.</p><p>And then you have Saudi Aramco, which, you know, went public late last year at almost about a $2 trillion market valuation. It's come back a little bit since then, but those are the four companies right now.</p><p>And then lurking in the wings, Amazon, which had actually hit a trillion dollar market valuation in 2018, it has pulled back. It's crept a little higher again. It's around $930 billion.</p><p>So we might be at a point not too long from now, where there are four American companies worth more than a trillion dollars.</p><p>ASHER: And just in terms of Alphabet moving higher, what's going to be the key for it, just in terms of its core advertising business, online advertising, just in terms of innovating when it comes to advertising and also Cloud computing, which is hugely important as well.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think that Google Cloud is going to be an increasingly important part of the Alphabet growth story in addition to all the ads that they run on the core search platform, as well as YouTube because we know, Zain that the Cloud is a big area of growth for Amazon.</p><p>Amazon Web Services generates gigantic profits from it. Microsoft and Azure, they've been doing really well. Those are the two big leaders in Cloud right now, and I think Google is hoping to become as formidable a Cloud player as Amazon and Microsoft right now.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Paul La Monica, live for us there. Thank you so much.</p><p>Microsoft has pledged to go carbon negative by the end of this decade, by 2030. The tech giant wants to remove more carbon that it actually emits by that year.</p><p>Anna Stewart joins us live now. So Anna, the timing of this announcement is quite interesting, because obviously we've got Davos next week and climate change is going to be a big topic on the agenda. Just walk us through why Microsoft is making this change now, to go carbon negative, not just carbon neutral, but actually carbon negative, and how do they actually plan to sustain this?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: It's hugely ambitious, isn't it? Carbon negative by 2030, so take out more carbon than it produces, and by 2050, Zain, it plans to remove all the carbon that is ever admitted directly, since it was founded in 1975.</p><p>So this is the most ambitious thought I think we've really seen from a big company here. Microsoft's President, Brad Smith said, \"While the world would need to reach net zero, those of us who can afford to move faster and go further, should do so.\"</p><p>Now, how do they plan to do this? First of all, by just reducing carbon emissions generally. By 2025, they plan to only use renewable energy, 100 percent. They're also planning to target sort of not having any vehicles that aren't electrical on their campuses and so on.</p><p>Then there's the removing the carbon from the atmosphere. They are planning to seed new forests. They are planning to work on technologies that put carbon back into the ground, also carbon capture technology and to do all of that, they are also investing $1 billion. The new investment fund that will accelerate all those technologies -- Zain.</p><p>ASHER: It's interesting because earlier this week, BlackRock actually announced that they are going to revolve some of their investment strategy around climate change and sustainability, so overall, Anna, just in terms of the big picture, what is corporate America's role in helping and sustaining the environment?</p><p>[09:10:15]</p><p>STEWART: We're certainly seeing a lot of corporations under pressure and I'd say from the tech sector particularly, a report from the AI Now Institute estimates that tech companies, the tech sector will contribute three to 3.6 percent of all global greenhouse emissions this year. So that is why they are particularly under pressure.</p><p>If we examine how they're all planning to do this, though, In2IT, a software maker also plans to be carbon negative by 2030, matching this new pledge from Microsoft. But the other big tech giants kind of lag behind. We have Amazon, they're planning to be carbon neutral, not negative, and that's by 2040, so 10 years later on.</p><p>Apple says it is reducing its carbon footprint. It has by some 35 percent since 2015, but there are no -- there are no dates, no deadlines to be either carbon neutral or certainly carbon negative.</p><p>I think these companies will be under pressure. As you say, Davos kicks off next week, and this is one of the big themes of the World Economic Forum this year. Satya Nadella, the Microsoft boss will surely have a spring in his step when he walks down the corridors now. He has really set the pace of this brand new, very ambitious target.</p><p>And we could see a new sort of battle underway between these tech giants trying to match it, maybe the new goal will now not be carbon neutral, but carbon negative -- Zain.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Anna Stewart live for us. Thank you so much. Okay, so these are the stories making headlines around the world.</p><p>The Senate stage is set. The jury is sworn in and now they must wait out a long holiday weekend before the impeachment trial of President Trump kicks into high gear. You could call it a calm before the storm, but nothing is ever really calm in Washington.</p><p>Athena Jones joins us live now on Capitol Hill. So Athena, let's just talk about this Lev Parnas interview, this Rudy Giuliani associate for our audience who might not be familiar with his name. This is the man who allegedly -- allegedly -- helped President Trump find dirt the Biden's in Ukraine. How are Senate Republicans specifically reacting to the interviews that he's given?</p><p>ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Zain, many of the Senate Republicans you talk to are being dismissive of what he has to say. They're saying, look, he's under indictment. He is facing prison time, and he is trying to say anything that he can to anyone who will listen to maybe reduce his prison time. That's also what we heard echoed from Vice President Pence's -- top aide to Vice President Pence, Mark Short.</p><p>And so there's not a lot of appetite, at least so far among several of the Republican -- members of the Republican Caucus to having new evidence allowed.</p><p>People like Lindsey Graham, who questioned the legitimacy of the integrity of Lev Parnas as a witness, and also Tennessee Senator, Marsha Blackburn, who said, look, it is -- it was the House's job to put together this case. It's not the Senate's job to help the House complete its work. They should have done a more comprehensive job. They should have called these witnesses.</p><p>So you are going to see kind of the battle lines that are being drawn, but you do have other members of the Republican Party, a handful of moderates and folks who are facing tough races that we're going to be keeping our eye on.</p><p>Several of those members -- moderate members of Republican Party -- have said that they are open to witnesses. So that's a question that's going to be answered in the coming weeks. We know that on Tuesday when the Senate convenes to begin this trial in earnest. That is, when we will see them vote on rules -- resolution setting up the rules of the trial. What will be the parameters that this trial is carried out under?</p><p>And we know that even folks who are open to witnesses, people like Susan Collins of Maine, even she says she doesn't want to discuss that at the beginning, at the outset. She wants to wait until both sides, the House Impeachment Managers and the Trump defense team have been able to make their arguments, make their cases and have the Senate -- senators ask questions, then, she wants to get to the point of discussing witnesses and new evidence -- Zain.</p><p>ASHER: And Athena, given that the Senate is of course controlled by Republicans, and there's very little chance that Trump after all of this is going to be removed from office. What are the political consequences, though, for the President going into 2020?</p><p>JONES: Well, certainly this could damage the President and so this is this is a high stakes moment and all of the eyes of the nation are going to be focused on this and of course, even members of his own party, people who have been dodging the questions about whether it was appropriate for him to have pressured Ukraine to announce these investigations into the Biden's et cetera.</p><p>They're now going to be forced to pay close attention, no distractions, no electronics, no smartphones, no reading material that is not relevant to the case at hand.</p><p>They're going to be watching closely and so even though you may not get you 67 senators, at least the hope on the part of Democrats is that the case against President Trump, the case against his wrongdoing will be spelled out for the American public and that a lot of the public will go along with their argument that Republicans are trying to cover up the President's wrong doing even if they do as expected vote to acquit him -- Zain.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Athena Jones, live for us. Thank you.</p><p>[09:15:06]</p><p>ASHER: In Iran, a defiant Ayatollah Khamenei led Friday prayers for the first time in eight years. In a combative sermon, the Supreme Leader blasted America welcoming last week's attack on the U.S. face and calling it \"a slap in the face' for the country. The crowd responded with chants of \"Death to America.\"</p><p>In the meantime, a U.S. military official has told CNN that 11 service members -- 11 service members -- were injured in last Wednesday's strike on the U.S. military base. The Pentagon had initially said there were no casualties at all.</p><p>Severe thunderstorms and heavy rain are bringing some relief to Australia's fire-ravaged East Coast. Authorities say the rain will not put out all the fires, but will help contain the blazes.</p><p>After three years of drought, the wet weather brings with it new risks including flash flooding and falling trees as well.</p><p>All right, after the break here on FIRST MOVE, as the US celebrates low jobless numbers, a shrinking talent pool is causing concern for business leaders as well and we'll also give you a check on the markets, too. See you soon.</p><p>ASHER: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE, coming to you live from the New York Stock Exchange. We are gearing up for another day of records here on Wall Street. All the major averages are set to hit fresh all-time highs in just a few minutes from now.</p><p>U.S. stocks, take a look here at Dow futures, they are up about almost a hundred points in terms of futures. U.S. stocks are rallying amid optimism over the just completed Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal and solid earnings from major U.S. banks as well.</p><p>Talk of new U.S. tax cuts are helping, too. The true test of this earnings season begins next week when a flood of results begins pouring in including Netflix, IBM, Intel and many other major companies and big names set to report as well.</p><p>As the jobless number falls here in the U.S., a shrinking talent pool is a top concern for small and midsized business leaders and according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase, businesses are responding to the lack of competition in the employment market. The bank's chief commercial analyst told Julia Chatterley why it's such a big problem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM GLASSMAN, HEAD ECONOMIST, JPMORGAN CHASE COMMERCIAL BANKING: I think the problem is when you look at where all of these jobs, we can't find it. It's all over the place. Every industry across the country, and I think that's confirming that really, what's going on here is the demographics is really driving it.</p><p>So you have all -- you have a boatload of people who are moving towards retirement, the baby boomer generation. The same thing going on in Europe, same thing going on in Japan, and 65 year olds are leaving, and there aren't as many people coming in to take those jobs.</p><p>So to me, this is a huge demographic story. Not a surprise because we've known about this since 1945, but we always thought -- in the developed economies, we always thought, well, if we don't have the people, we'll get the immigration, and that's not been happening.</p><p>JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: Well, that's something perhaps that's masked what we're seeing today, because this is heightened sensitivity, not just in the United States, but around the world --</p><p>GLASSMAN: Everywhere.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But far more here, I think that then perhaps anywhere else.</p><p>GLASSMAN: Japan knows this story really well, because their population isn't growing. But you know, the Europeans have seen this for a long time, too. And now, America is sort of feeling it. And I think it's sad to me because it tells me that if we could find ways of getting people into those jobs, we could produce so much more. The economy would grow faster. It's part of the fiscal challenge for the U.S.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The challenge for companies is that they're going to have to pay more and what? Seven tenths of them in your survey said they are simply going to have to pay more, give people better benefits in order to get the workers that they need.</p><p>GLASSMAN: Yes, and I don't fear that. I think we're in a good spot.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, good for consumers, too.</p><p>GLASSMAN: Anything that makes companies work hard to retain people, it's not just the pay. They're working harder to help -- once people get into a job, they find out there may be more things available to them, and if you can get the training, companies are finding out that if you can train people for those jobs, you might retain them, and that's the big challenge.</p><p>You can't grow people, but you can improve their skills and move them into the company and hold onto them longer. So it's good news, really.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: Oh, all right, just a few minutes to go before the opening bell. Tony Crescenzi joins us live now. He is the Market Strategist and Portfolio Manager at PIMCO.</p><p>Tony, thank you so much for being with us. Hi. So when you look at the market, we've gone from record highs to record high and then generally when you see the stock market behaving like this, you anticipate that people are going to leave bonds and go straight to stocks. What is happening here when you look at the yield on the 10-year being at 1.8 percent. What is that telling us?</p><p>TONY CRESCENZI, MARKET STRATEGIST AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, PIMCO: Well, there's it tells you something about growth potential. The growth potential United States, Japan, Europe is still seen as low. Most people still think the United States growth might be around two percent and growth such as that is not likely to prompt the Central Bank, the Federal Reserve to raise its policy rate. In fact, is more likely to keep it low because it's been under shooting on its inflation target.</p><p>And it's made it very clear, it won't raise interest rates until the inflation number starts to move up, and that's what the bond investor cares about when he thinks about investing. He looks at yields versus inflation. But it also thinks about the safety element.</p><p>It's very important to an investor to try to avoid market timing, the diversification benefits of bonds and so they're not likely to leave bonds for equities simply because bonds are not yielding much and equities are faring well.</p><p>It's like giving up on car insurance for a day or two because you think things will be fine. It's too risky to do that because you never know when there could be an accident.</p><p>ASHER: Okay, so there's still some concern there. When you think about the Treasury, the Treasury just announced that they're going to be issuing a brand new 20-year bond. Part of the reason for that is that the deficit is a major issue.</p><p>So just walk us through your thoughts on that. I think, they're going to be issuing it in the first half of 2020.</p><p>CRESCENZI: Well, the U.S. Treasury Department has had a practice since the 1970s called regular and predictable issuance. It likes to keep the calendar the types of bonds that it issues monthly, fairly regular and predictable so that it doesn't -- it has no impact on interest rates because if there was an irregular pattern, the bond investor might say, well, how much supply of bonds will there be next month for us to deal with? So perhaps we should ask for more yield from the Treasury Department today.</p><p>But the large deficit, as you mentioned, Zain, about a trillion dollars per year requires and as far as the eye can see, at least in the next five years requires that the Treasury get a little innovative with respect to issuance.</p><p>Now, the amount of 20-year bonds that will be issued next year, which by the way, is a very popular category for investors, probably about 150 billion, 140 billion or so.</p><p>To put it in perspective, that's about one percent of all treasuries outstanding, about 16 trillion outstanding. It is very small. So it's not likely to have a meaningful impact on overall interest rate levels because global investors have a strong demand for high quality bonds and the fact is, there is a shortage in the amount of high quality bonds with nations.</p><p>[09:25:09]</p><p>CRESCENZI: The final point is, nations as Italy and Spain, no longer considered highly rated as they used to be before the financial crisis. So there isn't -- there isn't a large amount of high quality issuance out there.</p><p>ASHER: And then just in terms of this week, obviously, we had a slew of bank earnings. A lot of them coming in good, especially JPMorgan Chase. Others, like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have other issues that they're dealing with that caused problems for those banks.</p><p>But when you look at this low rate environment that we're in, obviously with banks, they have to diversify and perhaps charge higher fees in their advisory and their investment banking divisions to make up for it. What is the strategy for banks in this kind of environment?</p><p>CRESCENZI: Well, what's clear is banks have gone back to what I've often called 3-6-3 model of banking. It is the more traditional model of banking. 3-6-3 old number, but it's this way that bankers would pay three percent on deposits, say zero -- charge six percent on loans and be at the golf course by 3:00 p.m.</p><p>So they've gone back to sort of 3-6-3 model, as you could call it, or something else with different numbers. More traditional banking, earning money on fees, earning the difference between the amount they charge on loans, and they pay on deposits, which we all know as depositors is very low.</p><p>ASHER: Right.</p><p>CRESCENZI: So they're making money there. So PIMCO favors banking institutions, particularly in Europe and different parts of this so-called capital structure, because of this soundness of banks, and one could simply go to the Federal Reserve website, or the European Central Bank website and look at stress tests they've done and conducted on these banks to see that even under very severe conditions where the stock market declines almost 50 percent.</p><p>Home and commercial real estate prices fall 30 to 40 percent. Banks still have so-called capital levels that are above what regulators want them to have, which is another way -- a long way of saying you're probably going to be a lot better shape than they were even during a financial crisis if something severe were to happen.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Tony Crescenzi, live for us. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. You have a great weekend, by the way.</p><p>CRESCENZI: Thank you.</p><p>ASHER: All right that's it for the show. Thank you so much for watching FIRST MOVE. I'm Zain Asher.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020011701cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0W-CCF1-DXH2-60SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4298\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 17, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Economy, Stock Market, China, Environment, Technology, Government, Politics, Impeachment, Donald Trump</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>New York Stock Exchange</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTA5NzZFOEE4NUFGNDk0NjgzQzhEMEExMjU2RUNDMjc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA4MDk2MDE2NTVGNDFCRDgxODBDMzc5NDgwOTczRTU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Rules &amp;

It was China\u2019s highest number of new infections in two months.</p><p>This briefing has ended. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">Check here for the latest updates.</url></p><p>China reports its highest number of new infections in two months.</p><p>China on Sunday reported 57 new confirmed infections, its highest single-day tally in two months, renewing fears that the country\u2019s grip on the pandemic is not yet secure.</p><p>Of the 38 locally transmitted cases, 36 were in the capital, Beijing, where the authorities are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">conducting mass testing at a major seafood and produce market</url> that appears to be the source of a new outbreak. It is the most cases the city has reported in one day since the coronavirus first emerged. Beijing had gone eight weeks without a single locally transmitted case until a total of seven were detected on Thursday and Friday.</p><p>The other 19 cases China reported on Sunday involved travelers arriving from overseas, mostly in the southern province of Guangdong.</p><p>Nearly all of the dozens of people who tested positive in Beijing in recent days had worked or shopped at the Xinfadi market, a wholesale market on the city\u2019s south side that sells seafood, fruit and vegetables, according to the Beijing health commission. The market has been shut down and several nearby residential complexes are on lockdown.</p><p>More than 10,000 people work at the market, which supplies 90 percent of Beijing\u2019s fruits and vegetables, according to the state news media. The virus was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">reportedly detected</url> on cutting boards for imported salmon there.</p><p>The developments also prompted the authorities to partly or completely close five other Beijing markets and to tighten controls on movement in and out of the city. State media outlets described the effort as a \u201cwartime mechanism.\u201d</p><p>China was the site of the first major coronavirus outbreak \u2014 with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">many of the first reported cases</url> tied to a seafood market in the central city of Wuhan. But as the pandemic has ravaged the rest of the world, China\u2019s government has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">loudly promoted</url> its apparent success in controlling the virus\u2019s spread. According to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">New York Times data</url>, China has had 89,720 cases and 4,634 deaths.</p><p>In Chile, criticism over erratic measures and confusion over its records of deaths.</p><p>Chile\u2019s health minister resigned Saturday amid criticism of his handling of the pandemic and controversy over the number of related deaths.</p><p>Dr. Jaime Ma\u00f1alich faced growing calls for his resignation because of what many considered an erratic strategy to address the rising rate of contagion per capita, one of the highest in the world. The government reported 167,355 cases and 3,101 deaths as of Friday night, mostly concentrated in the capital, Santiago. Chile\u2019s population is about 19 million.</p><p>The resignation coincided with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">news reports</url> that the government was reporting a much higher number of deaths \u2014 over 5,000 \u2014 to the World Health Organization, by including unconfirmed cases of deaths suspected to be caused by the virus.</p><p>Dr. Ma\u00f1alich came under fire for his ministry\u2019s ever-changing methodology of reporting Covid-related deaths, which did not always coincide with morgue records. Poor traceability and weak enforcement of a lockdown and other sanitary restrictions, despite mobilizing the military and the police, are contributing to the spread of the virus.</p><p>The government began ordering partial lockdowns in certain neighborhoods and cities as of mid-March, and as the virus continued to spread, lifted restrictions in some areas and imposed them in others. For months, mayors in several municipalities and cities with high contagion rates pleaded with the government to impose lockdowns in their areas to no avail.</p><p>Some members of the health and scientific community said the minister had not considered their professional opinions, not even of those participating in the government\u2019s Covid-19 advisory panel.</p><p>In mid-April, before the country reached a peak in cases, Dr. Ma\u00f1alich promoted a return to a \u201cnew normal,\u201d prompting people to go out with friends, children to go back to school and for malls to reopen with the necessary precautions. A month later, on May 22, the government ordered a total lockdown for the Santiago Metropolitan Region, which is still in effect.</p><p>President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era replaced Dr. Ma\u00f1alich with Dr. Enrique Paris, a former president of the Medical Association and member of the advisory panel. In a public statement shortly after, Dr. Paris called for \u201cdialogue and cooperation\u201d and for the scientific community, health professionals and research centers to work together.</p><p>\u201cA new stage begins in which we should be receptive of divergent opinions and those that support current policies,\u201d he said.</p><p>As cases grow in Florida, a fired virus data manager publishes her own statistics.</p><p>Florida reported 2,581 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, a record-high number for the third consecutive day, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">a Health Department dashboard</url>.</p><p>The dashboard has been the source of most of the virus data available in the state since the crisis began. The geographic information systems manager who built it, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">Rebekah D. Jones, was fired</url> for insubordination last month after she said she questioned orders she had received from supervisors to suppress some of the information.</p><p>Now Ms. Jones has unveiled a new, independent dashboard that highlights more statistics than those chosen by the Health Department. For example, her online tool, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">floridacovidaction.com</url>, includes information on hospital capacity that is maintained by the Agency for Health Care Administration.</p><p>\u201cI thought, well, I\u2019m pretty good at this, so I think I will stop hiding and do something for the people who now don\u2019t trust this other dashboard,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think it\u2019s a political tool, which it partly is.\u201d</p><p>To support its economic reopening, the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has selectively picked data to show a lower percentage of people testing positive for the virus, Ms. Jones said. Her dashboard uses a more straightforward calculation and clearly shows that the rate is increasing.</p><p>Unlike the official site, the totals for cases and deaths in Ms. Jones\u2019s dashboard include non-Florida residents who were in Florida when they became sick. She also lists the number of positive antibody tests statewide.</p><p>Ms. Jones\u2019s site uses publicly available data that in some cases is buried deep in PDF spreadsheets and not easy for residents to peruse at a glance. \u201cI don\u2019t have access to the data I did before, but there\u2019s other information out there that can provide context, can provide resources, and can enable people to take control during this crisis,\u201d she said.</p><p>Outbreaks in Brazil and India hit landmark new levels.</p><p>Brazil\u2019s coronavirus outbreak passed a grim landmark on Saturday,  recording the second-highest death toll in the world after the United States\u2019, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">according to a New York Times tally</url>.</p><p>As of Saturday morning, Brazil had acknowledged 41,828 virus deaths, 166 more than Britain\u2019s total. The figure for the United States was 115,136. Brazil\u2019s daily death toll is now the highest in the world, bucking the downward trend that is allowing many other major economies to reopen.</p><p>Meanwhile, India has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">overtaken Britain</url> as the nation with the fourth-highest number of cases worldwide after it experienced the most new cases in a single day on Friday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">according to the Times tally</url>.</p><p>There have been at least 308,900 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in India, according to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">Ministry of Health and Welfare</url>. As of Saturday morning, 8,884 people had died.</p><p>The country had instituted one of the world\u2019s most stringent lockdowns in late March, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">recently lifted most of its lockdown measures</url> in an effort to ease pressure on the economy.</p><p>In Brazil, experts point to President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s rejection of the emerging scientific consensus on how to fight the pandemic \u2014 including his promotion of unproven remedies such as the drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine \u2014 as one of the factors that helped tilt the country into its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">current health crisis</url>.</p><p>Mr. Bolsonaro has sabotaged quarantine measures adopted by governors, encouraged mass rallies and repeatedly dismissed the danger of the virus. He has asserted that the virus was a \u201cmeasly cold\u201d and that people with \u201cathletic backgrounds,\u201d like himself, were impervious to serious complications.</p><p>This week, his administration <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">stopped disclosing comprehensive coronavirus statistics,</url> though the data was restored after a Supreme Court order.</p><p>Here are some other developments around the world:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said on Saturday that he was prepared to reinstate a strict coronavirus lockdown if looser measures were not observed.

They sat in white folding chairs spaced six feet apart, at which point they were allowed to take their masks off. The West Point band played with plexiglass shields to protect against the virus.</p><p>Cannons fired a 21-gun salute and, from the bandstand, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">President Trump delivered a commencement address</url> in which he stressed staunch support of the armed forces and honored the class\u2019s unity.</p><p>\u201cYou have come from the farms and the cities, from states big and small and from every race, religion, color and creed,\u201d he told the graduating class, \u201cbut when you enter these grounds you became part of one team, one family, proudly serving one great American nation.\u201d</p><p>Later, with diplomas in hand, the cadets saluted the commander in chief two by two as their names were called. Hundreds of times, Mr. Trump saluted back. No family or friends were allowed to attend, but they commented on the live-stream of the event <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">on West Point\u2019s YouTube channel</url>. And at the end, the cadets were permitted the traditional touch of throwing their caps into the air.</p><p>Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to deliver the address in person was contentious. Cadets had been sent home in March because of the coronavirus, but after Mr. Trump said he would go through with plans for the speech, they were ordered back to campus in time to be tested and undergo a 14-day quarantine.</p><p>The address also came at a fraught moment in the history of civilian-military relations in the United States. Mr. Trump has clashed sharply with military leaders in the days since <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">the killing of George Floyd</url> over his desire to send troops into American cities. Tensions worsened after military leaders expressed openness to renaming Army installations named after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">Confederate generals</url>, including Fort Bragg, Fort Hood and Fort Benning, only to be firmly slapped down.</p><p>New York\u2019s deaths hit a record low, as other states see record-high new cases.</p><p>The number of deaths tied to the coronavirus has continued to decline in New York, even as much of the state marches toward fully reopening the economy, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced Saturday.</p><p>\u201cAll the news is very, very good news,\u201d he said during his daily news briefing. \u201cWe are now 180 degrees on the other side.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Cuomo reported that the state\u2019s death toll, numbering 32 on Friday, was the lowest figure recorded since the beginning of the pandemic \u201cwhen this nightmare began.\u201d \u201cWe did it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have tamed the beast.\u201d</p><p>According to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/world/coronavirus-updates.html\">The New York Times\u2019s tally</url>, which includes deaths in some counties that have been identified as probable coronavirus patients, the state had 80 new deaths from the virus on Friday.</p><p>Mr. Cuomo expressed concern that New York\u2019s progress was not being replicated across the nation. More than 20 states, he noted, have had their number of coronavirus cases rise. California, Florida and Texas are reporting thousands of new cases a day.</p><p>\u201cThis is a frightening time,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cWe thought that we were past it. Well, the beast is rearing its ugly head. Half the states are seeing an increase. New York is exactly the opposite.\u201d</p><p>This week, as many as 400,000 workers began returning to construction jobs, manufacturing sites and retail stores in New York City\u2019s first phase of reopening. Other parts of the state have moved on to more advanced stages of reopening, Mr. Cuomo said. The Western Region is scheduled to move to Phase 3 on Tuesday, and the Capital Region is expected to enter Phase 3 on Wednesday.</p><p>Increased testing has also shown that the virus is spreading at a slower pace than it did three months ago, when as many as 800 people were dying a day, Mr. Cuomo said.</p><p>Across the Hudson River, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey announced 103 new virus-related deaths, bringing the state\u2019s toll to 12,589.</p><p>While some officials in states seeing increases attribute the rise to increased testing, and the number of cases per capita in Texas and Florida remains low, some health experts see worrying signs that the virus is continuing to make inroads.</p><p>\u201cWhenever you loosen mitigation, you can expect you\u2019ll see new infections. I think it would be unrealistic to think that you won\u2019t,\u201d Dr. Anthony S.

Just out of college, he'd gotten a job writing software for YY, a livestreaming company based in the massive city of Guangzhou, in China's Pearl River Delta. More than 100 million users every month stream themselves, or tune in to broadcasts of others, singing, playing videogames, or hosting talk shows from their Beijing apartments. The audience chats back, prolifically, via voice or text.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The programmer thought YY should try something new: use its proven streaming technology to run a dating service, which would operate kind of like a TV dating show. A host would set up an online lounge, then invite in some lonely singles and coax them to ask each other questions and maybe find a partner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Company executives were dubious. \"The CEO almost killed it,\" says Eric Ho, chief financial officer, sitting in YY's headquarters, atop three floors of furiously coding engineers and designers. Are you sure you want to do this? the CEO asked the kid. This is very stupid. I don't think people will like it! But the programmer was hungry and persistent, so they waved him on: Give it a try.</p><p>In China, this type of employee didn't used to exist. Ten years ago, high tech observers complained that the nation didn't have enough bold innovators. There were, of course, wildly profitable high tech firms, but they rarely took creative risks and mostly just mimicked Silicon Valley: Baidu was a replica of Google, Tencent a copy of Yahoo, JD a version of Amazon. Young Chinese coders had programming chops that were second to none, but they lacked the drive of a <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>or Steve Jobs. The West Coast mantra-fail fast, fail often, the better to find a hit product-seemed alien, even dangerous, to youths schooled in an educational system that focused on rote memorization and punished mistakes. Graduates craved jobs at big, solid firms. The goal was stability: Urban China had only recently emerged from decades of poverty, and much of the countryside was still waiting its turn to do so. Better to keep your head down and stay safe.</p><p>That attitude is vanishing now. It's been swept aside by a surge in prosperity, bringing with it a new level of confidence and boldness in the country's young urban techies. In 2000, barely 4 percent of China was middle-class-meaning with an income ranging from $9,000 to $34,000-but by 2012 fully two-thirds had climbed into that bracket. In the same time frame, higher education soared sevenfold: 7 million graduated college this year. The result is a generation both creative and comfortable with risk-taking. \"We're seeing people in their early twenties starting companies-people just out of school, and there are even some dropouts,\" says Kai-Fu Lee, a Chinese venture capitalist and veteran of Apple, Microsoft, and Google, who has spent the past decade crisscrossing the nation, helping youths start firms. Now major cities are crowded with ambitious inventors and entrepreneurs, flocking into software accelerators and hackerspaces. They no longer want jobs at Google or Apple; like their counterparts in San Francisco, they want to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">build</emphasis> the next Google or Apple.</p><p>Anyone with a promising idea and some experience can find money. Venture capitalists pumped a record $15.5 billion into Chinese startups last year, so entrepreneurs are being showered in funding, as well as crucial advice and mentoring from millionaire angels. (It's still a fraction of the US venture capital pool from 2014, $48 billion.) Even the Chinese government-which has a wary attitude toward online expression and runs a vast digital censorship apparatus-has launched a $6.5 billion fund for startups. With the economy's growth slowing after two decades of breakneck expansion, the party is worriedly seeking new sources of good jobs. Tech fits the bill.</p><p>CHINA'S TECHIES DON'T WANT JOBS AT APPLE OR GOOGLE-THEY WANT TO BUILD THE NEXT APPLE OR GOOGLE.</p><p>The new boom encompasses both online services and the hardware arena. Recent local-kid-makes-good models like Xiaomi, the fast-rising Beijing mobile phone firm, or WeChat, Tencent's globe-conquering social networking app, are leading the way forward. Homegrown firms have distinct advantages, namely familiarity with local tastes, the ability to plug into a first-class manufacturing system built for Western companies, and proximity to the world's fastest-growing markets in India and Southeast Asia. The combination of factors is putting them in a position to beat the West at its own game. Xiaomi, for example, was the fourth-highest seller of mobile phones worldwide last year, behind Samsung, Apple, and Huawei.</p><p>YY programmer Mo Wengang</p><p>YY hosts user performances, live gaming, and a dating show.</p><p>Zepp Labs' Beijing office</p><p>Zepp cofounder Robin Han</p><p>As for YY, it turns out it was good that the executives indulged their enterprising programmer. The dating show launched last year and became a hit. It also generated serious profits. YY has no advertising; it earns revenue when users fork over real Chinese currency to buy virtual items they give as gifts to each other or to the \"broadcasters\" streaming their own lives online. YY takes a 60 percent cut of each purchase, with the recipient getting the rest as actual cash. (Popular broadcasters make so much money that they live off their YY earnings.) At a laptop on Ho's table, I peer at the screen, where a dating event is livestreaming. Money is flying around as male and female guests give each other-and the host-virtual presents: rings (worth $1.55), kisses (16 cents), and love letters (5 cents). Some items are pricier yet; for about $1,000, you can buy someone a virtual Lamborghini. In its first nine months, YY's dating show brought in about $16 million, a sum growing rapidly every month. Last year YY itself brought in $580 million, and three years after going public on the Nasdaq, its market cap tops $3 billion, even after the market gyrations of 2015. The next Silicon Valley has emerged-and it's in the East.</p><p>China's tech boom in the late '90s produced its own Web 1.0: search engines, email and blogging tools, news portals, and Alibaba's sprawling online sales market. Back then, China very much needed local copies of US companies, because US firms often couldn't operate easily in China. The government blocked many foreign sites by using a complex system of filters known as the Great Firewall of China. Local firms had an edge anyway: They understood the particular demands of the Chinese digerati in the early '00s, when Internet access was still scanty. Ten years ago, for example, eBay tried to dominate in China but failed, partly because many small businesses-the places that might otherwise have used eBay to sell their products to the world-didn't yet have computers or a connection to the Internet. At Alibaba, however, founder Jack Ma understood this, so he assembled a huge sales force that fanned out across the country, teaching merchants how to get WIRED. (He also outcompeted eBay's PayPal with Alipay, which holds a buyer's payment in escrow until they receive their goods and pronounce themselves happy with the purchase; this helped build trust in online markets.) Riding that first crest, firms like Baidu and Alibaba became the \"big dragons\" of Chinese high tech, minting millionaires much as Microsoft had in the '90s.</p><p>The success of copycat firms paved the way for \"little dragons\"-creative, upstart Web 2.0 firms that emerged in the late '00s. The big dragons provided role models, but even more significantly, they built the infrastructure crucial for today's high tech boom, including the cloud services that allow any twentysomething to launch a business overnight and immediately start billing customers.</p><p>One of the most successful in this second wave is Meituan, a firm that has become an ecommerce giant by enabling small merchants across the country to broadcast deals to nearby shoppers who have opted in, on the web and within Meituan's mobile app. When I visit the Beijing headquarters, it looks like a tropical forest: There are leafy green plants plunked down between each workstation, while humidifiers puff clouds of moist air upward. It's nearly silent, but there's a lot of money flowing through the office. Suspended above dozens of coders is an LCD the size of a table for four that reads \"8,309\": the number of deals Meituan has broadcast so far today. The firm's revenue has skyrocketed in its five years of operation; in 2014 it processed more than $7 billion in deals for its 900,000 partners. It's aiming to reach $18.5 billion by the end of this year.</p><p>Meituan's CEO, the slender and soft-spoken Wang Xing, is a serial entrepreneur who tracks the emerging creative shift in Chinese startups. He had already made Chinese clones of Facebook and Twitter when, in 2008, he noticed the rise of Groupon. \"There's no doubt that we got influenced by Groupon,\" he admits. But by then he was seasoned enough to spot the flaws in the discounter's business model. Groupon took a big cut-up to 50 percent-of the revenue from each deal, which left participating merchants bitter. They'd routinely lose money by issuing Groupon deals, so they'd grit their teeth and hope it would attract new permanent customers; usually it didn't. Wang, in contrast, wanted to make Meituan the easiest way for small merchants to charge their customers and stay in contact with them. Setting Meituan's cut at only 5 percent ensured that merchants nearly always made money.</p><p>He also began developing proprietary ecommerce tech. Wang whips out his phone to show me a recent example. His programmers fanned out to movie theater chains across the country, laboriously connecting Meituan's app to their booking systems. It was a hassle, but now moviegoers can not only buy a ticket from the Meituan app, they can pick their seats. Wang clicks on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Hobbit</emphasis> to show me. \"When you go to the theater you don't have to wait in line and talk to any people-you can just go to a vending machine and scan your passcode\" to get in, he says. It's slick and simple, and now one-third of all movie tickets in China are bought via Meituan. Last year it was 10 percent of the firm's annual income.</p><p>It's an adroit move, because service-and convenience-is what China's urban middle class increasingly craves. Sporting high-end mobiles and elite fashion from Europe, they pull out their phones for nearly every purpose: using Alipay to cover a cab ride to a DJ'd party in the artistic outskirts of Beijing; opening WeChat and using its location-sharing function so their friends can find them; posting selfies on Meitu, a picture-sharing service with built-in beautifying filters. The service economy commanded 44 percent of all money spent by the Chinese middle class in 2013, a figure that consulting firm McKinsey expects will grow to 50 percent by 2022, as young urbanites splurge via their phones on everything from massages to takeout food, hairstyling, and nail salons. Even the market meltdown of this year doesn't seem to have dented middle-class consumption: During China's travel-focused Golden Week national holiday in October, box office sales were up 70 percent over the previous year, and overseas trips were up 36.6 percent, according to Bank of America-Merrill Lynch analysts.</p><p>Ecommerce, already big in China, has an astonishing amount yet to grow-a tremendous number of everyday services are not yet online. For example, 80 percent of China's hotel rooms are still booked offline. And people are eager for ecommerce not just because it's convenient, but because it's much less corrupt and opaque than brick-and-mortar businesses. As Kai-Fu Lee points out, the latter are, by American standards, riddled with inefficiencies and hucksterism. \"In the US, hundreds of years of fair competition made commerce relatively fair and transparent,\" he says. Not so in China. \"If you were to sell real estate, there is no transparency. If you buy a used car, there is no <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Consumer Reports</emphasis> or Ralph Nader.\" By removing middlemen and creating reputation systems, ecommerce firms are making transactions more transparent and trustworthy, he argues. \"So a mobile social-based solution will be dramatically better,\" Lee says.</p><p>Corruption is just one of the many challenges China faces. The country's leaders and investors also contend with nontransparent banks, government regulators on the take, rampant pollution, fierce crackdowns on political speech, and a rural population yearning for better jobs in the cities. It's not clear whether the party can solve all these messy problems.</p><p>In the short run, though, the high tech gold rush has produced manic and fierce competition. Whenever a new category opens up, it's immediately swarmed upon by dozens or even hundreds of entrepreneurs. By comparison, competition in the US is mild; for example, there are only two major firms-Uber and Lyft-duking it out for car bookings. But Lee estimates that in its early days, Meituan had to fight 3,000 competitors dotted across the country. Whoever is left standing is battle-hardened. That's Wang now. Halfway between the old guard and the new, he has become an angel investor himself, on the lookout for youngsters with daring ideas: the next little dragons. One company he's investing in is eDaijia, which, rather hilariously, lets car owners find someone to drive their vehicle home when they're drunk. \"They are totally dominant in China, and last year they went to Seoul,\" he laughs, \"because, they told me, that's the most drunk city in the world.\"</p><p>China's Creative boom in web services is significant enough, but arguably it has an even bigger edge over the US in hardware. The country has spent 30 years becoming the manufacturing capital of the world, so coastal cities like Shenzhen and Guangzhou are now crammed with electronics facilities, from tiny three-person shops to Foxconn's 30,000-employee city-factory complexes cranking out iPhones. All have a deep knowledge of how to make things, so it was almost inevitable that homegrown entrepreneurs would get in on the act.</p><p>Living next to the factories or being able to stroll the electronics markets, they're the first to know when trends in hardware emerge: for example, when a cutting-edge sensor arrives that lets you collect new forms of data-or when the cost of an existing one suddenly drops to a penny, allowing it to be sprinkled anywhere, like dust.</p><p>\"It's easier in China than in other places,\" Robin Han says, \"because we have Shenzhen.\" Han is the 32-year-old cofounder of Zepp Labs, a Beijing-based hardware startup that is the darling of the sports world: It makes a square sensor that tracks your swing-of a golf club, a baseball bat, a tennis racket-then uses an iPhone app to help you improve. Han got the entrepreneurial itch five years ago as a PhD student working in Microsoft's Beijing research office. Big-company life might be stable, but you could toil for years on a project that might never become a real product. Success was out of your control, he tells me, sitting in the brightly lit Zepp office, where, behind him, two dozen coders and designers pilot keyboards. Han had noticed gyroscopes being used in HTC and HP phones as well as Nintendo Wii remotes and figured they would go down in price as big companies continued to include them in their products. That had potential. He and a friend, Peter Ye (now Zepp's head of R&amp;D), loved sports and hit on the idea for a swing sensor. Players could analyze their motions or compare them to those of professionals; coaches could scrutinize an entire team's practice swings, even remotely. Han and Ye started with golf. They figured duffers would be willing to spend money on a sensor that promised to improve their game. They lead me to the basement, where they have constructed a huge batting-and-golfing cage. \"We spent a lot of hours in here perfecting the sensors and working on our swings,\" Han says. The walls are studded with marks from errant balls. Their prototype worked so well it attracted the attention of an Apple rep who was touring China, looking for products for the Apple Store. Satisfying Apple's precise aesthetics required them to slowly refine the design through 14 prototypes, but it paid off: Since the Zepp sensor launched in Apple Stores worldwide in 2012, Zepp has activated more than 300,000 of them. Han and Ye got Zepp Labs off the ground with $1.5 million in seed money from angel investor Xiao Wang and worked their contacts to find a good factory to help prototype and mass-produce their device. That last step-finding a talented, Foxconn-class factory that has deep experience in elegantly solving design challenges-has traditionally been the hard part of getting things made in China. But in recent years, that's gotten easier too. A set of middlemen has emerged specifically to help bridge that gap, including Highway 1, a program by the manufacturing giant PCH: It picks gadget inventors from around the world and finds topflight factories willing to take a risk manufacturing a product by an unknown new talent.</p><p>THE HIGH TECH GOLD RUSH HAS PRODUCED MANIC AND FIERCE COMPETITION AMONG THE SWARMS OF ENTREPRENEURS.</p><p>There's also been a hackerspace movement in China. The first one-Shanghai's XinCheJian-was cofounded in 2010 by Chinese Internet entrepreneur David Li, when he noticed how cheap prototyping tools were allowing kitchen-table inventors to produce increasingly slick prototypes. Now local creators from across China mix with expatriates who flock to XinCheJian from around the world, brainstorming ideas with each other and going on tours of factories organized by Li to help them understand how China's hardware ecosystem works. Much like a gym, members pay monthly fees to XinCheJian, which gives them access to the hackerspace's tools and, just as important, advice and networking from fellow inventors. \"I always encourage people: Get to your prototype fast, try to find manufacturing partners, and get your Kickstarter campaign finished,\" Li tells me, sitting at the hackerspace's main table, in front of a fridge emblazoned with a sticker that reads DO EPIC SHIT. The rooms behind him are filled with metal lathes, electric tools, and rows of 3-D printers. One successful product that recently emerged from XinCheJian is Wearhaus headphones, which enable one person to stream music from their phone while friends listen in, letting them privately enjoy the same music while, say, coworking or studying. The first run of 3,000 headphones sold out, and now a larger run is in the pipeline.</p><p>The acme of China's innovation boom can be found in four office towers that loom over a sprawl of condos in the suburbs of Beijing. These are the headquarters of Xiaomi. Founded in 2010, the company has become famous for making mobile phones comparable to the iPhone-fast processors, large screens, and a sleek operating system called MIUI-but at half the cost. It may be even more famous for its chiefly online sales model and explosive growth. Xiaomi sold 61 million phones last year, and for part of 2015 it was the top-selling mobile brand in China. Though it's still private, last year investors said it was worth $45 billion.</p><p>Xiaomi was founded by a serial entrepreneur who got a chance to make his early mistakes-and fortune-10 years ago: CEO Lei Jun founded the online bookseller Joyo, which he later sold to Amazon. He quickly became an angel investor, pouring money into the next generation of innovators, like YY, and making connections with the country's brightest young designers and engineers. By 2010, a new vision had taken hold: to build an operating system and a new business model for selling mobile phones. Lei formed Xiaomi and hired a team of crack talent to quickly produce a gorgeous mobile phone OS and put it online in August of that year. China's techies loved it. But only the most nerdy were willing to endure the hassle of downloading an OS to their existing phones. If Xiaomi wanted to get the system into the hands of millions, it would need to make-and sell-handsets. Foxconn became one of Xiaomi's primary manufacturers. Meanwhile, the startup hit upon a hugely effective sales system. Each new model would initially be sold in a limited quantity-perhaps 50,000-via a weekly flash sale on its website. The exclusivity drove fans wild. The lucky few who scored phones would flaunt them to their envious hipster friends-and later, Xiaomi would open up a larger run to satisfy pent-up demand.</p><p>Xiaomi's office is brightly lit and decorated with huge paintings. A mutt that workers adopted off the street sleeps in his doghouse on the first floor. One flight up, a sprawling room is filled with customer-service reps chattering into phones, attempting to solve users' issues around the world. Though China is Xiaomi's largest market, in 2013 the firm hired Hugo Barra, previously Google's product manager for Android, to oversee global expansion. \"These are phones for the generation that will never have access to a computer,\" Barra says. \"They're discovering the Internet from their phones.\" Xiaomi's edge, he says, is that it continuously produces new upgrades. \"We build hardware, but we take a very software way of doing it. We do a software update every week!\" These updates often incorporate the voluminous feedback that Xiaomi gets from its deeply involved fans: A single post by Xiaomi's team on the company's customer forums can receive 100,000 replies discussing the latest tweak to the operating system.</p><p>Indeed, Xiaomi's willingness to talk online with its customers has been a key part of both understanding the demands of young consumers and cultivating their manic devotion. Xiaomi sells its phones at close to cost; much of the company's revenue comes from its line of accessories, like headphones and step-tracker wristbands, as well as from app store purchases of things like new OS skins. The hope is that eventually even more revenue will come from the many ecommerce transactions that Xiaomi owners will engage in, buying everything from meals to plane tickets to clothing.</p><p>But to see the company's broader vision for the future, you need to head downstairs to a spare and elegant showroom. It's filled with Internet of Things devices that the company is bringing to market, all of which can be operated remotely via the mobile OS. There's a smart lightbulb, a connected webcam, a bathroom scale, a TV, a power strip-and an air purifier, a crucial appliance for the Chinese, who must contend with the country's out-of-control air pollution. Once you buy one product, you'll very quickly buy the others, because they all work so well together, Barra boasts. \"The game in China is building walled gardens and getting them to stay in your garden.\"</p><p>CHINA'S CREATIVE GENERATION IS READY TO COMPETE WITH THE WORLD'S TOP HIGH TECH BRANDS.</p><p>Xiaomi didn't design and manufacture this hardware itself. The executives went on a hunt for the country's hungriest cutting-edge startups, then invested in them and demanded they produce Apple-quality design. It is astonishing to see the ecosystem laid out. It makes Google's toe-dip into the Internet of Things-its Nest smart thermostat and security camera-look several years behind the curve.</p><p>China's creative generation, in other words, has proven it is ready to compete head-on with the world's top high tech brands. \"Apple and Samsung are right to be worried,\" says Bunnie Huang, a well-known hardware hacker. (Indeed, Samsung's global share of the smartphone market dropped to 21.4 percent in the second quarter of 2015, from 32.2 percent in the same period of 2012.) When it comes to hardware, Chinese inventors benefit from proximity to the world's largest base of consumers, which is growing fast. Xiaomi's first major foreign expansion wasn't to the US but to the much huger-if poorer-India, where it sold 1 million phones in the third quarter of this year. Sew up China and India, it realized, and that's a third of the planet. In context, the US, where many consumers already own smartphones, isn't a particularly big market.</p><p>Yet while Chinese firms like Xiaomi are challenging the big tech firms, the flow of opportunity goes both ways: It's getting easier and easier for Western entrepreneurs to go work in China. They now regularly flock to hardware and software accelerators in the coastal cities so they can meet local collaborators or find factories. One French woman arrived in Shanghai last year to team up with Chinese coders and create an online market for French wine, targeting the chic restaurants where urbanites dine. Young American inventors congregate at H@xlr8r in Shenzhen, where they prototype everything from retro animated-GIF cameras to customized-pill-creation robots. China is essentially becoming a mecca, a destination for people with ideas-much as Silicon Valley did a generation ago.</p><p>I saw that one day toward the end of my visit. I dropped by David Li's XinCheJian hackerspace, where Li was meeting with a startup team he'd been mentoring, including a Dutch-Italian man named Lionello Lunesu, who has lived in China for eight years, and a Latino man named Berni War. They were looking over their latest prototype, which had been sent by courier from a nearby factory. It was a little device that gives you alerts from your computer or phone, almost like an Apple Watch that sits on your desk instead of on your wrist. \"For David, we're not going nearly fast enough,\" Lunesu says.</p><p>Li picked up the gadget and stroked its sleek white sides. \"That's the same plastic they use for the iPhone 5c,\" he says. The entrepreneurs grin. A lot of this opportunity is not available in the US. That's why they're here.</p><p>XinCheJian cofounder David Li</p><p>A XinCheJian hackerspace in Shanghai</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Contributing editor</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CLIVE THOMPSON</emphasis> (@pomeranian99) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is the author of</emphasis> Smarter Than You Think.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WIRED-10591028_0116_24</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WIRED2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J5P-D221-JDMC-943H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338905</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4326\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Conde Nast Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wired</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59741\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 1059-1028</issn><volume>Vol. 24</volume><issueNumber>No. 1</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>MAGAZINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

This week, TikTok, currently the world's hottest social media app, welcomed the new decade by publishing its first transparency report\u00a0as it encounters rising scrutiny from regulators around the world.</p><p><br/>TikTok tries to demystify\u00a0The report, which arrived weeks after it tapped a group of corporate lawyers to review its content moderation policy, is widely seen as the short video app's effort to placate the U.S. government. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, is currently probing the app for possible national security risks.<br/>TikTok is owned by Beijing-based tech upstart ByteDance and has been rapidly gaining popularity away from its home turf, especially in the U.S. and India. As of November, it had accumulated a total of 1.5 billion downloads on iOS and Android devices, according to data analytics firm Sensor Tower, although how many materialized into active users is unknown.<br/>The transparency report reveals the number of requests TikTok received from local regulators during the first half of 2019. Such orders include government requests to access user information and remove content from the platform. India topped the list with 107 total requests filed, followed by the U.S. with 79 requests and Japan at 35.<br/>The numbers immediately sparked debates over the noticeable absence of China among the list of countries that had submitted requests. This could be because TikTok operates as a separate app called Douyin in China, where it claimed to have more than 320 million daily active users (in Chinese) as of last July.<br/>TikTok has taken multiple measures to ease suspicions of international markets where it operates, claiming that it stores data of U.S. users in the U.S. and that the app would not remove videos even at the behest of Beijing's authority.<br/>Whether skeptics are sold on these promises remains to be seen. Meanwhile, one should not overlook the pervasive practice of self-censorship among China's big tech.<br/>\"Chinese internet companies know so well where the government's red line is that their self-regulation might even be stricter than what the government actually imposes, so it's not impossible that [the TikTok report] showed zero requests from China,\" a person who works at a Chinese video streaming platform suggested to me.<br/>It's worth revisiting why TikTok has caused a big stir on various fronts. Besides its nationality as a Chinese-owned app and breathtaking rise, the app presents a whole new way of creating and consuming information that better suits smartphone natives. It's been regarded as a threat to Facebook and compared to Youtube, which is also built upon user-generated content. However, TikTok's consumers are much more likely to be creators as well, thanks to lower barriers to producing and sharing videos on the platform, venture capitalist David Rosenthal of Wave Capital observed. That's a big engagement driver for the app.<br/>Another strength of TikTok, seemingly trivial at first sight, is the way it displays content. Videos are shown vertically, doing away the need to flip a phone. In a\u00a0company blog post (in Chinese) on Douyin's development, ByteDance recounted that most short-video apps budding in 2016 were built for horizontal videos and required users to pick from a list of clips in the fashion of traditional video streaming sites. Douyin, instead, surfaces only one video at a time, full-screen, auto-played and recommended by its well-trained algorithms. What \"baffled\" many early employees and job candidates turned out to be a game-changing user experience in the mobile internet age.<br/>Douyin's ally and enemy\u00a0A recent change in Douyin's domestic rival Kuaishou has brought attention to the intricate links between China's tech giants. In late December, video app Kuaishou removed the option for users to link e-commerce listings from Taobao, an Alibaba marketplace. Both Douyin and Kuaishou have been exploring e-commerce as a revenue stream, and each has picked its retail partners. While Kuaishou told media that the suspension is due to a \"system upgrade,\" its other e-commerce partners curiously remain up and running.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Some speculate that the Beijing-based company could be distancing itself from Alibaba and moving closer to Tencent, Alibaba's nemesis and a majority shareholder in Kuaishou. Yunfeng Capital, a venture firm backed by Alibaba founder Jack Ma, has also funded Kuaishou but holds a less significant equity stake. That Douyin has long been working with Alibaba on e-commerce might have also been a source of discordance between Kuaishou and Alibaba.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-476427</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXC-DJ01-JBYT-H27P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 6, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Its decision to exclude high-risk vendors in August 2018 was marked by a refreshing openness about the grounds on which it was made. The thinking about risk and security was very similar to that in the EU security assessment of 5G released in October 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two core factors in these assessments are that 5G providers that have legal and other imperatives to cooperate covertly and deeply with their home governments pose a greater security risk than providers without these obligations and imperativesand that governments do not want to be beholden to the governments of states with which they do not share values or interests. Both these factors apply in the case of the Chinese state and its two 5G 'national champions', Huawei and ZTE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While there has been a burgeoning and critical debate inside and between governments, there's been strikingly less talk about what the future 5G world means for 'big tech' in China and the USthe two homes of the globe's tech giants.</p><p>That's surprising, because arguably the strategic and economic competition between Xi Jinping's China and Donald Trump's America has at its centre a contest over advanced technology and the future of global data and communications. Xi's China Dream can't be achieved without China's big tech firms dominating their US counterparts globally, because gaining strategic and economic power depends so heavily on having technological ascendancy, especially in data and communications.</p><p>But even without the state-on-state great-power competition, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon, Apple and Microsoft all have existential stakes in the future of global communications. The odd thing is they don't seem to be acting like it.</p><p>If, as some experts predict, Huawei and ZTE win the race to build and operate much of the world's 5G infrastructure, US tech firms will be dependent on them to transmit their services and products. American big tech will live in a Chinese walled garden of technology and be subject to the curators' choices about what it can and can't do, at least in major markets like Southeast Asia, Africa and chunks of Europe.</p><p>On the flip side, China's non-5G tech giants Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT) will ride on the digital infrastructure of Huawei and ZTE. Given the Chinese Communist Party's digital authoritarian model of fused statecorporate cooperation, this puts BAT in an advantageous positionnot just in the China home market, but wherever the Chinese 5G champions provide the digital infrastructure.</p><p>The worst-case scenario for big US tech is that Apple, Facebook and Google in effect become apps inside a Chinese global information ecosystem. Chinese state policies and BAT, Huawei and ZTE would decide which of their products and services can be hosted on Chinese digital infrastructure and services. That looks like a very bad business plan, unless entering bankruptcy or becoming CCP-compliant in your global operations is the end goal.</p><p>So far, Apple's and Google's forays into 5G have been about 5G smartphoneswhich will also ride on the underlying 5G infrastructure.</p><p>So why are these US tech giants seemingly snoozing at the wheel on 5G and future communications infrastructure? Maybe they're like great white sharks, lurking deep but ready to break the surface and show us that they knew what they had to do all along. But there's no sign of that.</p><p>Maybe they're planning to get a jump on 6G, thinking that new communications concepts and systemslike cheap and ubiquitous constellations of small satelliteswill deliver a new source of communications business advantage that undercuts terrestrial 5G networks.</p><p>Maybe the real reason Google insisted on continuing to develop the now apparently defunct model of its search engineDragonfly, which was being designed to comply with Chinese state censorshipis because it's preparing for the corporate dystopia of the future, not just trying to find a way to get bigger in the Chinese market.</p><p>Maybe they all think the competition between the US and China is just the business of governments and therefore doesn't concern them. If so, they're failing to see that the same factors which are driving renewed great-power competition mean that they too are in strategic and economic competition not just with BAT, Huawei and ZTE, but with their chief supporter, the CCP.</p><p>Or maybe they're stuck in a mindset that governments around the world already know is dead: the idea that globalisation is a process that 'de-states' the world, rendering state boundaries and powers less relevant. According to this long-gone vision of globalisation, companies and consumers could be 'country agnostic' about where services and products came from because global supply chains and capital would move and reconfigure in ways that had no little or connection with individual nations.</p><p>That was the arc of logic operating in much of the world politically and economically until the return of assertive authoritarian powerRussia, and now, most particularly, the Chinese state under Xi. And the truly globalised world was the dominant paradigm when many of the leaders of US big tech rose to prominence, so it wouldn't be surprising if they're finding it hard to let go. For all their genius, they too are products of their environment and their times.</p><p>Xi and great-power competitionalong with 'Made in China 2025', the Digital Silk Road and militarycivil fusionhave killed that vision.</p><p>There's a way out of the Chinese walled garden for Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. These companies have enormous capital and human capital strengths. And they have potential 5G, data and communications partners in places other than ChinaSamsung in South Korea; Japanese tech giants like Sony, NEC and Fujitsu; Europe's Nokia, Ericsson and even Siemens; and US partner-competitors like Qualcomm and Oracle (as well as India's growing tech world).</p><p>Certainly, democratic governments from Canberra to Washington, Seoul, Berlin, Delhi and Tokyo all have deep interests in creating policy and regulation that supports alternatives to a unitary Chinese tech future. Fraying international cooperation, the disdain for Trump in much of Europe, and Trump's own disdain for alliances and partnerships make these interests harder to give effect to. Yet letting those difficulties prevent positive action to shape our future communications world would be a defining and generational error for each of the democratic world's leaders.</p><p>Big tech companies and their home governments outside the authoritarian world need to reset their relationship from a contested one around privacy, data and regulation to one that supports government and corporate strategic and competitive interests. That seems a remote prospect in the world we're in right now, but what seems remote has a habit of happening when the need is sufficient.</p><p>Even without supportive policies and regulation from their home governments, it makes sense as a simple matter of future corporate existence, success and competition for the US tech giants to be able to live on alternative digital infrastructure to that brought to them by China Tech Inc.</p><p>Who from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft will be the first to get this party started?</p><p>Michael Shoebridge is director of the defence, strategy and national security program at ASPI.

SHANGHAI: Trading begins Monday on a new Nasdaq-style technology board in Shanghai that represents one of China's most significant market reforms, and a potential weapon in its growing tech rivalry with the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twenty-five stocks will debut on the Shanghai Stocks Exchange's Sci-Tech Innovation Board -- dubbed the STAR Market -- in which listing and trading rules have been eased to help channel funding to start-ups. China's government envisions the board being mentioned in the same breath someday as the tech-heavy US Nasdaq, encouraging firms to list at home after the likes of Alibaba and Baidu chose Wall Street.</p><p> But the initial impact is expected to be slight. \"I think the science and technology board will develop into a major and important sector in China's capital markets, but it will take a long time, maybe 10 years, 20 years, or even longer,\" said Jiang Liangqing, a money manager at Ruisen Capital Management.</p><p> China hopes to draw listings from among the country's rich stable of tech \"unicorns\" -- start-ups valued at a minimum $1 billion -- such as Alibaba-linked mobile-payments pioneer Ant Financial, ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing, and online-services platform Meituan-Dianping. None of those are among the initial listees, however, which include no household names.</p><p> The biggest is China Railway Signal and Communication Corporation, which has reportedly raised 10.5 billion yuan ($1.53 billion), the most of any board constituent. It's a leap of faith for China's volatility-averse authorities, as stocks have relatively free rein.</p><p> For the first time, Chinese companies can list without a track record of past profits or restrictions on IPO pricing. There will be no limits on price movements for the first five days of trading, after which a daily 20 percent band is imposed.</p><p> China's main exchanges are subject to a 10%band to contain volatility on the often rumour-driven markets. The tech board was announced in November by President Xi Jinping as a battle with the United States for technological supremacy heated up.</p><p> Xi has called on China's tech leaders to become global champions, while the US has fought back in part by taking steps to clip the wings of Chinese telecom giant Huawei. When big tech companies list overseas, the government in Beijing loses influence over their fund-raising, and capital controls prevent Chinese investors from sharing in those companies' success due to restrictions on purchasing overseas shares.</p><p> China realised it needed to give ground on market reform. \"If China didn't launch this new tech board now, it would miss the chance to transform its economic development into this 'new economy' mode,\" said Yang Delong, chief economist at First Seafront Fund.</p><p> Much of the lead-up to the trading launch, however, has involved officials tamping down concern that it would weigh on China's main markets -- already pressured by slowing economic growth and the US-China trade war -- by siphoning off liquidity.

China\u2019s president was to attend the conference until changing his plans at the last minute, according to local media reports. Wang Yang, China\u2019s vice premier, spoke of the country\u2019s commitment to a \u201cnondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies.\u201d Another senior Chinese official promised a level playing field for foreign businesses.</p><p>But the messages of openness contrasted sharply with actions taken in Beijing and elsewhere in the country. China wants its giant national companies to be world leaders in sectors like electric cars, robotics and drones, but the authorities are accused of curtailing foreign firms\u2019 access to Chinese consumers.</p><p>A government-led effort to help Chinese companies at home and abroad has set up a potential trade battle with the United States, as a growing number of American businesses complain that Chinese trade practices like forced technology transfer are putting them at a disadvantage.</p><p>At the conference in Guangzhou, multiple officials promoted what they called the \u201cspirit\u201d of the ruling <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/24/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-communist-party.html\">Communist Party\u2019s recent congress</url>, which tightened Mr. Xi\u2019s grip on the state gave his policies an exalted status in a sign of the role the party intends to play in China\u2019s economy. The crowd in the cavernous ballroom at the Shangri-La Hotel thinned out as one official after another spoke over the course of an hour.</p><p>Surveys of China business leaders by the American Chamber of Commerce in recent years have shown that many American companies do not think the playing field is even.</p><p>\u201cChinese government statements reaffirming China\u2019s commitment to providing a nondiscriminatory environment for foreign companies are always welcome, but need to be accompanied by real progress,\u201d said Kenneth Jarrett, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.</p><p>\u201cThe challenges of China\u2019s regulatory environment \u2014 its opaqueness, unpredictability and basic problems of market access \u2014 make it difficult for U.S. companies to realize their full potential,\u201d he added.</p><p>Others were more blunt in their assessments.</p><p>\u201cYou can get WeChat in America, but you can\u2019t get Facebook here in China,\u201d Terry Branstad, the United States ambassador to China said on Wednesday, referring to the popular Chinese social media app that is used by nearly 1 billion people. Facebook, by contrast, is blocked in China, although the company is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/technology/facebook-china-moments-colorful-balloons.html\">still</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/reporters-notebook/xi-jinping-visit/a-chat-in-chinese-with-mark-zuckerberg-as-tech-giants-jostle-for-facetime\">trying</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/08/a-trip-to-california-for-chinas-internet-czar/\">to</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/23/zuckerberg-speaking-chinese-shows-up-at-beijing-forum/\">get</url> into the country.</p><p>\u201cWe are hopeful that we can still continue to make progress, but there are still basic areas of concern,\u201d Mr. Branstad added, referring to the growing frustration that China is demanding too many concessions from companies that want to compete in the country.</p><p>One company that has sought to make concessions in hopes of maintaining its access to the Chinese market is Apple. The company has been criticized for recently <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/business/skype-app-china.html\">removing some apps from its China app store</url>, including those meant to help users circumvent the country\u2019s heavily censored internet. The company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, expressed respect for China\u2019s rule of law at the conference on Wednesday.</p><p>\u201cWhen you go into a country and participate in the market, you are subject to the laws and regulation of that country,\u201d Mr. Cook said, underscoring the notion that some American business leaders are willing to play by China\u2019s rules. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring the laws and regulations that you wish were there,\u201d he added.</p><p>Mr. Cook had come to Guangzhou from the<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/world/asia/china-internet-censorship-wang-huning.html?_r=0\">World Internet Conference</url>, which was organized by the Cyberspace Administration of China. His attendance at that event raised concerns that he was lending his support to the government\u2019s heavy-handed control over the internet.</p><p>Mr. Cook, responding to those concerns, said, \u201cMy view is that you show up and you participate because nothing ever changes from the sidelines.\u201d He also said he hoped that some of the apps the company had made unavailable in China would one day be available there again.</p><p>Against this backdrop, Chinese companies are beginning to claim some of the dominant positions that their foreign counterparts once had around the world. One of the many statistics that officials here cited to support China\u2019s growing strength on the global stage was this one: The Fortune 500 list now includes 115 Chinese companies, nearly equal to the number of American companies.</p><p>One thing is clear: The days when foreign companies thought they could come to China and make a quick profit are over.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot just be in the market to make money,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at venture capital firm GGV Capital. \u201cI think that if you can help the Chinese government to achieve its objective of being a model of growth, you\u2019ll have achieved your own objective as well.\u201d</p><p>Not everyone every business leader here was quite as diplomatic.</p><p>\u201cPeople complain too much,\u201d said Jack Ma, the founder of the e-commerce giant Alibaba. Mr. Ma\u2019s company plays a dominant role in the lives of most Chinese consumers, and it has become a darling of United States investors and almost as valuable as Amazon.</p><p>\u201cIf you cannot survive in China, I barely think you can survive in other countries,\u201d Mr. Ma added, citing the success in China of American companies like IBM, Starbucks and Walmart.</p><p>His advice for foreign companies was simple: \u201cHave patience and respect the rule of law.\u201d</p><p>Follow Alexandra Stevenson on Twitter: @jotted.</p><p>PHOTO: President Xi Jinping of China has made plain his country\u2019s ambitions to be a leader in global commerce.

CDs and DVDs were easily copied and sold for cheap at roadside markets. If you had a computer and an internet connection, top selling albums and Hollywood movies were widely available for free online. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's changing. And as is the case with many tech trends in China, it's changing fast. </p><p>New technologies and a long-running crackdown on pirated content mean members of the country's growing, smartphone-wielding middle class are increasingly willing to pay to stream videos and music online. </p><p>\"When you have to spend two-to-three hours digging up pirated content, users are willing to pay a [small] amount of money to get non-pirated content,\" said Karen Chan, an analyst with research firm Jefferies. </p><p>Workers in China earn far less on average than their U.S. counterparts. But for the better paid inhabitants of Chinese cities, streaming content is pretty affordable.</p><p>Across major Chinese video platforms, the monthly fee is about 20 yuan ($3); streaming music is even cheaper, ranging from 8 to 15 yuan ($1-$2) per month. Compare that with a basic monthly Netflix subscription in the U.S. at $8, or a Spotify one at $10.</p><p>'It became really easy to pay'</p><p>The rapid spread of digital payment platforms like Tencent's WeChat Pay and Alibaba-affiliated Alipay has also played a role, according to Xue Yu, an analyst with research firm IDC. </p><p>The platforms created a market of young Chinese consumers comfortable with buying goods and services for a few yuan online, Xue said. </p><p>Amber Zhang, a 27-year-old office assistant in Beijing, told CNNMoney that WeChat Pay was one of the key reasons she started spending money on music and video subscriptions back in 2013. </p><p>\"It became really easy to pay,\" she said. </p><p>Like many other parts of China's cloistered tech industry, domestic companies are reaping most of the profits from online content while foreign firms have faced difficulties.</p><p>The video market is dominated by Tencent Video and iQiyi, a subsidiary of internet company Baidu. The country's top ecommerce company, Alibaba, is also a big player with its video streaming platform Youku.</p><p>Tencent also has a near stranglehold on the streaming music industry through its QQ Music, KuGou and Kuwo platforms. </p><p>\"These services are good enough now, it's very convenient, you can download an app on your phone, you can stream all the videos or audio that you want,\" said Kevin Chang, a 28-year-old engineer who lives in Beijing. </p><p>China's big tech companies dominate</p><p>The competition for paying customers like Chang is intense. </p><p>Tencent has a virtual monopoly on the streaming of mainstream western music in China. It struck a deal with Sony Music, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group for the exclusive rights to stream their music in China. Under the deals, Tencent also gets to decide which songs rivals get to stream. </p><p>The hope is that by holding the keys to such a vast catalog, Tencent will get more users to sign up for subscriptions on its various music platforms. At the moment, it has around 15 million subscribers. It sounds like a big number, but it's only about 2% of the company's total active user base. </p><p>Video streaming has had more success -- both Tencent Video and iQiyi report about 10% of their monthly active users pony up for subscriptions (about 40 million and 30 million users respectively). </p><p>Even the Chinese users who are watching videos or listening to music for free on established platforms, are no longer doing so illegally. They generate revenue for the tech companies by sitting through ads. </p><p>Although the ads bring in money, the margins from paying subscribers are much higher, according to Chan, the Jefferies analyst. </p><p>Premium content is the driving force for getting people to convert to subscriptions -- if you can only watch your favorite TV show with a VIP streaming account, for example, you are more likely to subscribe to such a service.</p><p>As a result, Chinese video platforms \"have to compete quite fiercely\" for content, IDC's Xue said.</p><p>Some of the most coveted shows come from U.S. companies, which remain largely shut out from offering content directly to Chinese consumers in the face of heavy government censorship and regulation. Instead, they're opting to go through the big local players.</p><p>iQiyi struck a deal with Netflix in April, giving its Chinese subscribers access to popular original series like \"Black Mirror,\" \"Stranger Things\" and \"Mindhunter.\" Tencent became the exclusive online partner for HBO in China back in 2014, giving its subscribers access to hits like \"Game of Thrones\" and \"True Detective.\"</p><p>Domestic players are also developing original series for the local market. Tencent Video has had a string of successes producing dramas and variety shows in house, as has iQiyi. </p><p>And original series give Chinese streaming platforms an even stronger incentive to respect intellectual property laws because they can now make money from their own content by selling it overseas. </p><p>Youkou produced \"Day and Night,\" a 32-episode detective series that became a runaway success, garnering some 4 billion views since its debut in August.</p><p>It became Youkou's first Chinese internet series to be distributed overseas when Netflix snapped up the exclusive worldwide distribution rights for the show in November.</p><p>-- Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

It sounds like a big number, but it's only about 2% of the company's total active user base.</p><p>Video streaming has had more success -- both Tencent Video and iQiyi report about 10% of their monthly active users pony up for subscriptions (about 40 million and 30 million users respectively).</p><p>Even the Chinese users who are watching videos or listening to music for free on established platforms, are no longer doing so illegally. They generate revenue for the tech companies by sitting through ads.</p><p>Although the ads bring in money, the margins from paying subscribers are much higher, according to Chan, the Jefferies analyst.</p><p/><p>Premium content is the driving force for getting people to convert to subscriptions -- if you can only watch your favorite TV show with a VIP streaming account, for example, you are more likely to subscribe to such a service.</p><p>As a result, Chinese video platforms \"have to compete quite fiercely\" for content, IDC's Xue said.</p><p>Some of the most coveted shows come from U.S. companies, which remain largely shut out from offering content directly to Chinese consumers in the face of heavy government censorship and regulation. Instead, they're opting to go through the big local players.</p><p>iQiyi struck a deal with Netflix in April, giving its Chinese subscribers access to popular original series like \"Black Mirror,\" \"Stranger Things\" and \"Mindhunter.\" Tencent became the exclusive online partner for HBO in China back in 2014, giving its subscribers access to hits like \"Game of Thrones\" and \"True Detective.\"</p><p>Domestic players are also developing original series for the local market. Tencent Video has had a string of successes producing dramas and variety shows in house, as has iQiyi.</p><p/><p>And original series give Chinese streaming platforms an even stronger incentive to respect intellectual property laws because they can now make money from their own content by selling it overseas.</p><p>Youkou produced \"Day and Night,\" a 32-episode detective series that became a runaway success, garnering some 4 billion views since its debut in August.</p><p>It became Youkou's first Chinese internet series to be distributed overseas when Netflix snapped up the exclusive worldwide distribution rights for the show in November.</p><p>-- Serenitie Wang contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180110china-streaming-music-video1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RGP-FM41-DY60-K438-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"887\"/><timeReceived>10:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 10, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000CSBD</classCode><className>YOUKU TOUDU INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0006EHC</classCode><className>UNIVERSAL MUSIC GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS515210 CABLE &amp;

China recorded GDP growth of 6.0 percent in the third quarter, the lowest in 27 years. Analysts projected that as the trade war with the US continues to weigh on the world?s second-largest economy, China?s economic growth rate could fall further in 2020. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Eyeing High-tech </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But many Chinese analysts see some positive signs in the figures. For example, the data shows high-tech manufacturing output increased by 8.7 percent in the first three quarters of 2019, 3.1 percent higher than overall industrial output growth. Also, in the same period, investment in high-tech manufacturing and services increased by 12.6 percent and 13.8 percent, more than doubling the growth of the overall investment in the manufacturing and service sectors. </p><p>Since Chinese President Xi Jinping assumed power in 2013, China has highlighted the importance of upgrading its industries in response to problems from its investment and debt-driven development. Under this approach, in 2015 China launched the Made in China 2025 initiative, which focuses on 10 keynote high-tech industries. </p><p>But since US President Donald Trump assumed office, his administration has waged an escalating trade war with China which explicitly targeted the Made in China 2025 initiative. Since then, China has downplayed the initiative and refrained from using the term in official documents. </p><p>But with its defiant position in the trade war, China has become ever more determined to promote the role of technology and innovation in its economic growth. </p><p>In recent months, China?s leadership has championed the buzzword ?new economy.? The concept, which originates from the internet boom of the mid-1990s, is often used to describe new, high-growth industries resulting from cutting-edge technologies and innovation that go beyond traditional industry. </p><p>The concept is not new for the Chinese leadership. In 2014, Xi used the term in a keynote speech, saying that the world is entering an era marked by the development of an emerging new economy. In 2016, China mentioned the new economy in its government report for the first time, saying that the new round of technological innovation presents a major opportunity for China. </p><p>Challenged with internal and external uncertainties, development of the new economy has become a top priority for the Chinese leadership. The New Economy Forum, a high-profile global forum co-hosted by Bloomberg and the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE), a Chinese government-backed think tank, held in late November in Beijing, offered a glimpse of China?s high-tech strategy. </p><p>?ABCD? </p><p>During the forum, Huang Qifan, former mayor of Chongqing and vice president of the CCIEE, highlighted the importance of digitalisation, which he referred as ?ABCD?: A for artificial intelligence, B for blockchain, C for cloud computing and D for big data. </p><p>Huang, who spearheads China?s digital economy initiatives, told China Report that the four fields will comprise a new internet platform that will not only inject vitality into the traditional economy, but also transform the fundamental production relationships of the entire economy. </p><p>In the past couple of years, China has launched initiatives in all four areas. In 2017, Beijing laid out plans to become the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030, aiming to increase its market to 1 trillion yuan (US$142b). More recently, China has rolled out AI applications, such as facial recognition technology, on a large scale. </p><p>China?s Alibaba Group Holding became the world?s fourth biggest cloud computing provider in 2019. Despite US efforts to dissuade countries from using equipment from Chinese firm Huawei, the company?s status as the world largest telecommunications gear maker appears to remain solid. </p><p>On November 1, China?s 5G network went online, two months earlier than its original 2020 target. All three of China?s major operators ? China Telecom, China Unicom and China Mobile ? unveiled 5G plans. Experts believe that China is on track to becoming the world?s largest 5G market. </p><p>According to Huang, the emerging digital economy will not only provide a new source of growth, but will help China achieve more balanced growth by addressing the development disparity between the prosperous coastal regions in eastern China and its inland western regions. </p><p>As the digital economy transforms the traditional production relationship, China?s inland regions will find new opportunities to catch up with coastal regions, Huang said. </p><p>For example, Southwest China?s Guizhou Province, one of the country?s most mountainous and poorest areas, has become a major centre for big data thanks to its abundant and cheap hydroelectric resources. Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in Northwest China, known for its arid land, is an established cloud-computing centre powered by its booming wind and solar power infrastructure. </p><p>In October, the central government designated Xiongan New Area in Hebei Province, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and Sichuan provinces and the city of Chongqing as ?pilot areas? for ?national innovation of the digital economy.? Two of the pilot areas are located in China?s southwest. </p><p>During a Politburo symposium on November 25 on drafting China?s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), Chinese Premier Li Keqiang warned that the ?external environment may become more complicated with increasing uncertainties and challenges? in the following years. He said that China is ?at a crucial stage of transforming economic development modes, optimizing economic structures and converting growth drivers.? </p><p>While Li did not mention the digital economy particularly, considering that China?s 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) already stressed the role of the digital technology and AI in the development of the country?s strategic technological development, the digital economy is expected to be among China?s top priorities for the next five years. </p><p>Blockchain Battle </p><p>Among all the digital technologies, the nascent blockchain technology has attracted particular attention from China?s leadership. At a Politburo meeting held in November, Xi highlighted the importance of blockchain technology, saying that blockchain would play ?an important role in the next round of technological innovation and industrial transformation,? and called for China to become a ?world leader? and ?rule maker? in the field. </p><p>Best known for its use in Bitcoin, blockchain has potential that goes far beyond digital currencies. According to Xi, with its capabilities in promoting data sharing, optimizing business processes, reducing operating costs, improving collaborative efficiency and building a trusted system, blockchain can be applied to public security, public transportation, crime investigation and anticorruption campaigns, potentially making it a major feature in China?s governance. </p><p>China?s blockchain ambitions are at direct odds with the US. Well aware of blockchain?s potential, the US Senate Committee of Commerce, Science and Transportation approved the Blockchain Promotion Act, which aims to lay the regulatory framework for blockchain technology and to see how the government could benefit from its use. In the meantime, US tech giant Facebook has been actively promoting its cryptocurrency Libra. </p><p>In a speech at the Bund Financial Summit in Shanghai on October 28, Huang Qifan laid out a vision for China?s own digital currency. Huang said that China has been developing a digital currency for six years, and it is likely to be the first country to launch a State-backed cryptocurrency, which he said would have the potential to replace the US SWIFT system. </p><p>According to Huang, the SWIFT system, which has functioned as a global network for bank transactions for over 40 years, is not only outdated, inefficient and expensive to use, but also has been weaponised as a financial instrument for the US to exercise global hegemony and carry out long-arm jurisdiction. </p><p>Huang also cast doubt on the future of digital currencies developed by private firms such as Libra. ?The basis of their issuance cannot be guaranteed; the value of the currency cannot be stabilised and it is difficult to truly form social wealth. I do not believe that Libra will succeed,? Huang said. </p><p>Huang did not offer a timetable for the release of China?s digital currency. But as China is still locked in a trade war with the US, which is partially fuelled by a battle over technological supremacy in 5G and other technologies, China?s blockchain ambitions will no doubt draw new battle lines between the world?s two largest economies in the coming years. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHNREP-202001026</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHNREP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2X-2MF1-DXG4-Y01S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463108</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1475\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Foremost 4 Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>China Report Magazine</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2283\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>80th Edition</edition><publicationDate month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

TTD's chat software, used by 17 million people since its 2014 launch, is one of the hundreds of smartphone-enabled applications and innovations that have kicked into high gear to help China beat back the Covid-19 outbreak. </p><p>During the initial days when epidemiologists struggled to find the cause and transmission path of the then little-known disease, Chinese authorities resorted to the most primitive way to block its spread, locking an estimated 50 million people under quarantine across dozens of cities. Now, as the focus of the global pandemic shifts offshore from mainland China, the country's technology companies are using their participation in the world's largest health crisis to turbocharge the deployment of so-called HealthTech solutions. </p><p>Remote access to health services, from consultations to the sales of medical products, is the entry point into the nascent, fast-expanding HealthTech market, especially in a country with the world's largest population of smartphone users. </p><p>There are at least seven platforms in the market that connect doctors with patients. TTD, which claims to connect 450,000 certified doctors with 17 million patients in a single platform, offered online consultation to Wuhan residents - who were put into quarantine on February 11 - for a token 1 yuan, instead of the usual 49 yuan. That enabled TTD to quadruple its consultations during the first five days of the Lunar New Year, compared with the same period last year. </p><p>Also doing its part is TTD's competitor Ping An Healthcare &amp; Technology, better known as Ping An Good Doctor, a unit of China's largest insurer Ping An. The application's daily sign-ups for free online Covid-19 consultations soared 10-fold between January 22 and February 6, compared with a 21-day average in January. </p><p>Asia's most valuable technology company is also in on the rush, with Alibaba Health Information Technology connecting an average of 200 patients per day to each of its network's specialists in respiratory diseases since its January launch for Hubei's residents. </p><p>\"As the deployment of big data, artificial intelligence and technologies related to the Internet of Things (IoT) speeds up, digital health care will emerge as the new key infrastructure of the industry,\" said Gary Wang Qiang, senior vice-president of Alibaba Health, a unit of this newspaper's owner Alibaba Group Holding. \"Backed by Alibaba's technological advantages, Alibaba Health can innovate quickly in the realms of drugs retailing, chronic diseases management, online health care and digital public health service solutions.\" </p><p>Digital health care solutions have long been a key application within China's internet technology boom, even before the current pandemic changed the way people interact, live and work. </p><p>Targeting medical needs <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3075095/what-has-chinas-public-healthcare-system-learned-twin\">unmet by China's hospital-centric health care system</url> that lack primary general care, online health care platforms including 111 Inc's 1 Clinic, WeDoctor, Spring Rain Doctor and Haodaifu Online sprang up in the past decade. </p><p>\"Relative to many nations, China has more experimentation on internet hospital and online pharmacy service deliveries because of big unmet needs and hence the potential for improvement in the nation's health care system,\" said Helen Chen, head of L.E.K. Consulting's China biopharmaceuticals and life sciences practice. </p><p>Telemedicine is also a nascent development in the US, held back partly by the fact that physicians are licensed by states. </p><p>\"It is starting to gain ground but has not taken off to the extent it has in parts of Asia, but I think it will change after Covid-19,\" said Brad Loncar, chief executive of Kansas-based investment firm Loncar Investments and compiler of the Loncar China BioPharma Index. </p><p>\"If you are a physician in Kansas, you would not be able to do telemedicine with a patient who is in California if you are not licensed there,\" Loncar said. \"Some of the telemedicine companies help doctors who actively use their service to get licensed in many states, but that is rare and expensive.\" </p><p>That may change soon, as President Donald Trump said on March 13 that the US federal government plans to waive laws to enable tele-health in certain situations, and ease some federal licensing requirements to enable interstate medical care. </p><p>In China, lengthy waits for services have long been the features of hospitals, where health care takes up 9 per cent of government spending, less than half of the budget in Britain, Japan and Germany. </p><p>Many rural residents often make long trips to big city hospitals due to the concentration of the nation's best medical resources there, despite health care reforms including the assignment of city doctors to rural communities. </p><p>China had 18 doctors for every 10,000 inhabitants in 2018, a fraction of the 24 per 10,000 in Japan, 26 in the US and 28 in Britain, according to the World Health Organisation. China's doctors are also more overworked, less respected and underpaid than their overseas counterparts, according to L. E. K Consulting's Chen. </p><p>To reduce hospital trips and infection risks during the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing early this month covered for the first time such online follow-up consultations for certain common and chronic diseases in the national health insurance scheme. Previously, consumers had to pay, except at one hospital in Gansu province that was conducting a pilot in late 2019 to include online consultations in the scheme, according to a Pacific Securities report. </p><p>Doctors are not allowed to arrive at a diagnosis for patients online without physical check-ups, or prescribe drugs under existing regulations in mainland China. This means most health care services are still provided offline. </p><p>To make their business models work, online platform operators typically have to build a huge national user base, from which they develop multiple revenue streams. They include general and specialist doctors' recommendation and appointment booking, repeat consultation for chronic diseases, and online sales of drugs and health-related products. </p><p>While Ping An Good Doctor - China's largest health care platform - boasts over 315 million registered users, only 3 million are monthly fee-paying users. The company is expected by analysts to earn its first profit next year, as it turns more users into paying customers for its \"family doctor\" packages, aiming them at the fast-growing middle-class, which is increasingly willing to pay to get faster medical services by private doctors. It is also helping government hospitals build internet hospital platforms in Zhejiang and Henan provinces to broaden its revenue stream. </p><p>Rival TTD differentiates itself through an online-plus-offline strategy that includes a large network of its own clinics. The firm was formed through a 2018 merger of Tencent Doctorwork's online clinical platform with Trusted Doctors' network of 450,000 online specialists and day surgery centres. </p><p>Besides connecting patients with doctors, technology is also going deeper and broader into the search for a cure for Covid19. Damo Academy, Alibaba's research unit, has an analytical tool that can distinguish Covid-19 from other strains of respiratory tract infections through computerised tomography (CT) scans of patients' lungs. A second tool cuts the diagnostics time to 30 minutes, from several hours. The analytical tools, deployed at 26 hospitals in Alibaba's hometown in Hangzhou, are also being offered to Italy and France. </p><p>Robots have also been deployed to pick out suspected coronavirus carriers from a crowd. Hong Kong start-up Roborn Technonology designed a mobile robot equipped with thermal scanners that can live-stream temperature readings to a control centre, and can send an alert when necessary. Commercial deployment at various government departments are expected soon, Roborn's co-founder Mark Mak Hin-yu said in an interview with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">South China Morning Post</emphasis>. </p><p>When it comes to digitalising the health care supply chain, executives with a technology background may have different approaches from those coming from the medical field. </p><p>\"Why go to hospital when you have a mobile phone? That's a technology people's view of health care,\" TTD president Martin Shen, an Australia-trained physician-turned-health care information technology entrepreneur, said in an interview during the JP Morgan health care conference in January. </p><p>\"The health care practitioners' view is: how do I use technology to make health care delivery better?,\" Shen said. \"We provide an online and offline integrated health care experience.\" </p><p>After raising over US$250 million from investors, TTD plans to launch a \"completely integrated\" family doctor services, including general and specialist care and day surgery through to dental and ophthalmology. </p><p>\"Three decades ago all surgeries were performed in hospitals, now two-thirds are performed in day surgeries worldwide,\" Shen said. \"Redefining health care in the 21st century is our goal.\" </p><p>Through greenfield projects and acquisitions, it plans to expand its network from 107 clinics currently - almost half of which in Shenzhen - to over 400 by the end of next year, Shen said. It will focus on 30 cities, within each it aims to have a \"citywide\" network presence, he added. </p><p>While some rivals are expected to follow suite, he said success will depend on whether the right company culture, health care and clinics management expertise can be established. </p><p>For 111, whose founders are former senior executives at computer and e-commerce firms, digitalising the drugs supply chain will remain its focus, even though it has over 2,000 in-house and affiliated doctors providing online follow-up medical consultations and prescription extensions. </p><p>Bulk sourcing from 150 drug manufacturers, 111 also helps 210,000 pharmacies in China cut procurement and administration costs by pooling their orders through its online wholesale platform. </p><p>The start-up will invest this year to link up its platform with public hospitals in mid-size cities and towns, and offer online seminars to inform doctors about new drugs as part of its services to drug makers, said chief executive Liu Junling. </p><p>As Beijing's health care reform resulted in faster new drugs approval and the allocation of more funding for innovative drugs prescription, he expects most pharmaceutical firms will be busy launching new drugs this year. </p><p>\"One can safely bet that lots of new drugs will be launched in China,\" Liu said. \"If we could play a role in helping to commercialise them, we can accumulate many chronic patients, to whom we can provide mobile App-based services such as health education, medicine adherence monitoring and online drugs refills.\" </p><p>As the online pharmacy industry grows, regulatory issues have also arisen, such as how to ensure prescriptions presented online are genuine. To address the issue, several provincial government-run pilot prescription drugs distribution platforms have been set up to link up the hospitals' pharmacy dispensing systems to those of online drug distributors, and 111 is \"actively participating\" in them, Liu said. </p><p>\"There are also safety mechanisms to check the identities of consumers who uploaded their prescriptions, and most pay with online payment Apps, which provide another layer of identities authentication,\" he said, adding that 111 excludes a small number of high risk prescription drugs from its offering. </p><p>The coronavirus pandemic has sickened 2244,517 people in 160 regions and countries around the world, as of Friday . Mainland China, where the disease was first reported, had no new confirmed cases for the second day, with 33 per cent of the global caseload and a third of the worldwide death toll. </p><p>For Liu, who sought help through TTD in Wuhan, it was a false alarm as her test came back negative for the coronavirus from her community hospital; it was a case of flu, combined with a panic attack, her doctor said, according to the application provider. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Additional reporting by Peggy Sito</emphasis></p><p>Illustration: Henry Wong </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Purchase the China AI Report 2020 brought to you by SCMP Research and enjoy a 20% discount (original price US$400).
