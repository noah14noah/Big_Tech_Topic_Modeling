(Nasdaq: TRIP), has long criticized an issue that came under scrutiny during the hearing: the role that Google plays when ranking search results. It's a key issue for Needham-based Tripadvisor, which relies on online traffic to get customers, causing <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2020/03/12/tripadvisor-was-already-facing-pressure-from.html\">struggles in recent years</url> that have been one factor in <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2020/04/28/tripadvisor-lays-off-900-people-shuts-down-boston.html\">the layoffs of hundreds of workers</url> locally.</p><p>\"The Congressional oversight hearing illustrates the importance of the multiple, global investigations into Google's search business,\" Kaufer wrote in an email to the Business Journal in response to questions about the hearing. \"Tripadvisor welcomes enforcement of competition and consumer protection laws on what Rep. Cicilline described as Google's deceptive efforts to, \"[keep] users on Google's sites even if Google doesn't have the most relevant information.\"</p><p>The competition with Google has been causing headaches at Tripadvisor for the past several years. The big problem for Tripadvisor is that Google leverages its map products to occupy larger portions of search result web pages. When people based in the U.S. search for 'San Diego hotels' on Google, the resulting map ends up pushing Tripadvisor's links down on the page, limiting the amount of traffic that would otherwise go to Tripadvisor's website.</p><p>Jed Kelly, a senior analyst at Oppenheimer, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2020/03/12/tripadvisor-was-already-facing-pressure-from.html\">said earlier this year</url> that this type of competition from Google has been a main driver of Tripadvisor's stock underperformance over the past few years.</p><p>During the hearing, Rep. David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, accused Google of manipulating its search results to promote its own digital services. \"Increasingly, Google just shows whatever is profitable for Google via Google Ads and Google's own sites,\" <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0gJYFX8WVc\">he said</url>.</p><p>The hearing included some of the most notable names in the whole tech industry. The chiefs of Amazon Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN), Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL), Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) and Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB) were all grilled before Congress about their companies' practices as part of an investigation on market dominance in the industry.</p><p>It's unclear, however, what direct impact the hearing will have on how the biggest tech companies in the world are regulated.</p><p>Dan Wasiolek, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar who covers Tripadvisor's stock, said that these hearings don't often lead to much change in the U.S.</p><p>\"In Europe, they're more aggressive on protecting consumer interests,\" he said.</p><p>Last year, the European Commission <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_19_1770\">fined</url>Google (EURO)1.49 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Always fun to be here.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: So a year ago, when we were up here on the stage together, you had just announced the new TripAdvisor, which includes a travel social feed. So how has that been going in the past first year?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: We love it. It's a great step forward in terms of how we try to personalize the experience. TripAdvisor has always been around helping other -- helping people help other people plan that trip. It's really what differentiates us. It's the secret sauce. It's the millions in -- practically billion reviews out there. If you take those reviews and you now combine it with those famous names, those influencers, those other sources of trusted opinions, it makes such a nice map.</p><p>So you take the travel feed in there, you take other personalization elements that are coming, you take more info from people like me and that's really what we believe will help make the best travel trip.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: Now travel inspiration is a state of the funnel that no travel company has truly won or dominated yet. We see a lot of failed start-ups that try and do it. So what have been some of the big learnings as you guys made this foray up into the inspiration stage?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: It's really hard. I've seen a number of companies really trying to do an excellent job at inspiring travelers. But to have an economic model that just inspires and then say, hey, go off, finish the trip later hasn't worked really for anyone. TripAdvisor is in a unique position because we can do the inspiration, we can have amazing pictures, video, and again, back to that social feed, reasons why I'd love to take that trip, I'd be inspired. And now we're not sending you somewhere else, we're actually helping you plan the trip.</p><p>You click the little heart icon and you save into an itinerary all the different things that you want to do. You're looking at where you're going to stay, you're going to look at the fun things to do and you're going to be inspired by all the different pieces of content. As we help you through that travel planning process, we're there to guide you and we want to do more when you're in destination, taking that trip with you, et cetera.</p><p>So as you see, it's the whole picture that really makes inspiration come to life.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: Now when you first launched the travel feed, content from brands, right, it was -- you didn't have positions for sponsored content or ads yet. So is that still the case now?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: It's not really -- it never was the focus. We weren't trying to build the Facebook or the Twitter of travel. You're trying to help travelers. At the end of the day, looking for that juicy, that inspiring bit of content that could really help make or break this particular trip. So we look at it from the point of view of if that content is what we think is the most relevant to you, the travel planner at that moment in time, that's what we want to put there. If we think a better recommendation for something to do, not from the social feed but from other people like you or from our recommendation engine, that's what we want to put in front of you. Again, all to help that travel planning process.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: So are there paid spots then within the travel feed now?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: There might be, but I mean it's so not a focus of ours. We have a fabulous media business. It's growing annually and we expect it to double in the next 3 to 5 years. It's media for major advertisers, major brands. And actually, this morning, we just announced a TripAdvisor media manager. This will allow smaller brands, smaller companies to come on -- come on to the site, buy a particular audience looking to go to a particular destination, practically self-service. Again, it's the close to 0.5 billion monthly eyeballs that we have on the site, people with high intent trying to figure out where to go, what to do when they get there and that's really quite valuable to perhaps a whole bunch of people in the audience here.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: Yes. And I know you guys had mentioned that media and advertising is going to be an important source of growth for you now that the hotel metasearch growth has kind of slowed. So my question is, is it going to be difficult to maintain a good user experience when you have to focus so much on ads?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: Great question. Not a problem for us. When we think about it, and you can look throughout our history, we've really done, we feel, a very good job focusing on the traveler, helping that traveler figure out where they want to go, what they want to do and all the different options. Now here's an opportunity for a travel brand, be it a hotel, a thing to do, a place to go to say, hey, you should consider our destination or our property, especially with our dynamic ads where a hotel, for instance, can put our bubble rating right on the ad, a sign of, hey, it's not just a bit of marketing material, it's an opportunity to engage a traveler and pick my property, my attraction, my destination.</p><p>There's so many great places to go, so many wonderful things to see. If the ads are relevant, which on our site, they are; if they are served in the timely and noninvasive manner, you don't have the things popping up, taking over your screen, you have contextual, personalized advertising. And that's we -- I mean, obviously, it's the way we choose to do it. It's the way we think advertising works best.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: Great. So you guys recently announced an alliance with Trip.com Group, Ctrip, over in China having a JV. So what's in it for you guys? Tell us why you decided to do this.</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: We think it's a great partnership. So we've been in China for quite a few years. And as you saw just a few minutes ago, the market in Asia in general, and China in particular, continues to grow by leaps and bounds. So many of these travelers are traveling for the first time and then another set that are taking their first international trip and another set that are becoming international travelers in general, repeat visits.</p><p>We looked at our offering and then we looked at what could our offering do with the assistance of another major player, and frankly, who better to pick in the marketplace than someone like Ctrip or Trip.com Group. Tremendous industry knowledge, the ability to look at the demand that's on both their sites and on TripAdvisor, craft a package that's really suitable for the outbound audience and deliver that. We benefit from some of the supply. We benefit from a minority ownership in this joint venture. And it's -- as many would say, partnership isn't right way to tackle a market or to address an opportunity that may not be in our core wheelhouse.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: And as you mentioned, you've been in China for a number of years, almost a decade, right? And so you had a rebrand there a couple of years back as well. So why the JV route now?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: Well, if you wind back the clock, we started as, hey, let's replicate the TripAdvisor model in China, period, full stop. That didn't get enough traction to our liking so we really focused on where we thought we could be unique, which was the outbound travel, leveraging our point of interest database, all the different things and really did it quite well for a number of years. But you have to have -- you have to have fortitude, you have to have amazing content, you have to play by the rules that exist in China. And for us to achieve the next level -- we could have kept going as we were. But to really achieve the next level, to have that shot at greatness in that marketplace, we felt partnership was the clear right way to do things. And there are several partners that we had considered. We thought Ctrip, obviously, given their strength in the -- or Ctrip.com Group, given their strength in the travel category, would be the perfect partner.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: And so they invested just north of $300 million or so, right? So is that a down payment for something bigger?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: Let's just say, TripAdvisor, being a category of one in the travel ecosystem, close to 500 million unique users, 800 million reviews that we, by an Oxford Economics study, influence 10% of all global travel. It's just an incredible number. Ctrip, of course, or Trip.com Group and perhaps others would look at TripAdvisor and say, ooh, this could be quite interesting as part of a bigger company. I don't think about that. I think about running TripAdvisor. I think about helping the next billion travelers, wherever they live, in all of our different categories of opportunity.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: Okay. So you have been very transparent with how Google has been impacting TripAdvisor's business as they stuff their page more with ads and with their own travel products so...</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: I like the way you phrased it, stuff their page more with ads. That's perfect. I'm going to use it.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: So what can online travel companies do to stay relevant and battle that slip in value as Google makes stronger moves into the space?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: A challenge for us, a challenge for many, many travel companies, a challenge for a whole lot of different companies in verticals completely different than travel. When you look at how they have stepped forward and said, look, anyone on Google should essentially stay on Google. It's more and more the traffic. I'm a believer that, that's a challenge for the Internet ecosystem, period. People love Google as a search engine. Please stay a search engine to help people find the best things that's out there.</p><p>The competitive landscape when it gets concentrated just becomes a burden on innovation everywhere. What can TripAdvisor do about it? What can other companies? We have to build better products. We have to build and deliver the value proposition to travelers so that the next time you plan that trip, you'll come direct to TripAdvisor, you'll open up our app. You won't start at any search engine, Google included.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: Looks like we have an audience question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Steve, thanks for being here. On the last earnings call, you talked about plans next year to reintroduce a completely new mobile app. Can you just give us a sense of what to expect? And maybe what some of the driving principles are that you're thinking about as you redevelop the mobile app?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: Sure. Great question. So when you think of our mobile app today, it looks reasonably similar in functionality and navigation to our desktop application and to our mobile application. Yet when you think about travel in general, there's 2 rather distinct phases at least. First, I'm planning the trip. Not too many people want to arrive and then figure out where they're going to stay. So there's how do I get there, where am I going to stay and maybe some iconic things that I want to make sure I do when I get there. That's travel planning in advance.</p><p>And then I arrive, and maybe I haven't selected all the places I'm going to eat. Maybe I kept an afternoon free in order to experiment, to play. I still need in the moment to be able to figure out what's the best thing to do. Where do I want to eat? What type of food does my family wish to eat tonight? And what's the best restaurant near where I'm actually standing?</p><p>And so we have a lot of that functionality already on the site or in the app, but is it convenient for an in-destination use case? And our answer is not nearly enough. So the app actually has to do double duty in terms of I download it and I use it as a travel planning tool. I create my itinerary. I put all the things I'm interested in it. And it's not a fully planned itinerary most of the time. I arrived in destination and now how can I get everything that's contextual to where I am, to what I want to do right now, nonavailability 2 weeks out, but availability this afternoon. And bringing those things to the forefront with different navigation, we expect will deliver a much better app experience.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: Great. So I have one more question on Google. So back in 2010-ish, right, when Google was talking about buying ITA, there was an alliance that was formed, FAIR SEARCH, it included you, a couple of the other big brands, Expedia, KAYAK, where you guys lobbied together against this. Is this a good time to maybe rally back your old friends?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: Well, I think we do have a different landscape in terms of the political landscape now, both in the EU and in the U.S., looking at activities around big tech companies and what they can do with the power that they have. I think that scrutiny is a great thing. I think it doesn't have to lead to explicit regulation, but I think holding everyone to make sure that they're truly always acting in the consumer's interest. And when you've accumulated monopoly power, I think there is a special obligation to make sure that the rest of the ecosystem thrives.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: Now Experiences, right, is another important segment for you guys and you have the first-mover advantage. But now as GetYourGuide and Klook, they're having big piles of money behind them, Airbnb is investing in tickets, how are you going to ensure that you stay ahead in this space?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: Well, a big pile of money is wonderful to have, but it does not actually deliver a great consumer experience as someone is traveling. And so TripAdvisor and Viator are blessed with millions of travelers a day who are planning a trip somewhere. And it's generally a considered vacation, it tends not to be a 1-night stay. What makes that vacation amazing? Yes, the lodging is an important piece, but what else are we going to do there? So having the footprint of supply that we have, adding the recommendations, the curation, the other ways that is certainly within our capabilities of being able to deliver that inspiring trip, the thing you really want to come home and rave about, that's what builds the loyalty we're looking for. That's what builds the desire for people or the feeling that, of course, I had a great time on this trip. Thank you, TripAdvisor. Not the transaction. I actually bought the ticket, that's nice. That's some of the frictionless stuff you talked about, it's a -- you need to have it. But the discovery and the actual adventure that you took, that's what makes the memories and that's what we're aiming for.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: And how are you helping the travelers discover what they should be doing, right? So with activities, one of the hardest things is that you're really plagued by choice, right, in the segment. So aside from, yes, making things digital and bookable online is great. But beyond spitting out a laundry list of potential things in a single city, like what are you doing to help them identify this is what's for me?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: Great question. And I'd say we have -- we're in early, early innings in being able to do a good job at that. When I'm a traveler and I'm using TripAdvisor and I see all the things, I do feel like I have a lot of choice, yay, but I wish it was easier. I wish TripAdvisor or any site knew me a bit better and I wish the experiences, the ways I could form my days were sort of better advised, better recommended so that I could enjoy the actual activity even more than I enjoy the planning.</p><p>And I'd like to plan. I'd like to figure out what I want to do. But I, of course, don't need to wade through all the other products that I'm not interested in. And frankly, I'm willing to tell a site, TripAdvisor, a bit about what I'm looking for in order to get better results. If I can get those results and I make that happy trip and my family is happy, then I'm good to go.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Alice, we've got a question on Slido for Steve. Mafengwo is often called the TripAdvisor of China. How do you respond to that?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: Well, I'd say the joint venture is one way that we have responded to that. Mafengwo is very good company. They have a fair amount of traffic. They have a lot of content. They are certainly respected. On the other hand, TripAdvisor with Trip.com Group brings the ability to not only talk about where to go, not only the trust factor that you get from 800 million opinions on things all around the world, but also the security of being able to finish the transaction, buy it on Tripadvisor.cn or on Ctrip or Trip.com or any of our collective sites. So I think it's early days still in the travel landscape in China. We found a fantastic partner and so I think we'll do quite well there.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: So TripAdvisor, you guys are celebrating your 20th birthday next year in 2020. Did you plan that? And so you're one of the last remaining from that early wave of online travel that has remained CEO of the company that he founded. So how do you continue to innovate and inspire and stay motivated through all these changing times?</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: A great challenge. And I do think TripAdvisor has done a good job innovating, trying new things, building out new pieces. Some work better than others. That's just an aspect of being in the travel space and being willing to take risks. Of course, I wish all the things that we've tried had worked beautifully. But I don't regret, even with the benefit of hindsight, giving the things a go. We have tremendous assets at our disposal in terms of cash flow, in terms of points of interest, in terms of traffic, in terms of supply, in terms of trust of travelers. How do we better use that to deliver on that end story? I'm still here because we haven't solved that problem. We're not anywhere near the point of like optimizing a flow of something and getting an extra point or 2 out. Us and so many other companies in this room are clearly innovating in ways to help generate the type of travel excitement that we've seen in the past 20 years, going forward for 20 more.</p><p>ALICE JONG;PHOCUSWRIGHT INC.;RESEARCH MANAGER: Awesome. Thank you so much for joining us on stage again this year. Ladies and gentlemen, Steve Kaufer.</p><p>STEPHEN KAUFER: My pleasure.

I'm Willow Bay.</p><p>VARNEY: And I'm Stuart Varney.</p><p>Our top story tonight: a pre-election rally for the Dow. Americans won't begin casting their votes in the presidential election for 12 hours or more.  And while everyone agrees that its the closest contest in decades, investors today seemed to be betting on a winner in George W. Bush.  Stocks that would potentially benefit from a Bush administration shot higher, drug stocks in particular.  And blue chip stocks overall seemed to benefit from a flight to safety, in the midst of the political uncertainty.</p><p>The Dow broke back above 11000 at its high today.  It ended with a gain of 159 points at 10977.  The volume came in at about 930 million shares.</p><p>But the Nasdaq was under pressure all day long, awaiting after- the-bell profits from Cisco.  It fell 35 points to 3416.  The volume there was nearly 1.6 billion shares.  The S&amp;P 500 gained 5 1/2 points. It ended at 1432.</p><p>Allan Chernoff looks at today's Dow rally and Wall Street's focus on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Wall Street appears to be betting on a Bush victory.  Industries to which Governor Bush has been relatively sympathetic rose in today's trading.  Most important: pharmaceutical companies, Merck, Shering-Plough, American Home Products, Pfizer and Lilly among the winners, an early relief rally following Vice President Gore's attacks on drug makers.</p><p>AL GORE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's just wrong for seniors to have to choose between food and medicine while the big drug companies run up record profits.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Managed health care stocks were higher except for Wellpoint, which has lost ground in recent days after a huge rally in October.  Bush favors restricting the right to sue HMOs, while Gore wants to expand that right.</p><p>RONALD HILL, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN: It does look like some of the stocks, which would do reasonably well under a Bush victory are sort of leading the charge upwards, especially in health care sector.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Defense and aerospace stocks were mainly higher. General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and Northrup Grumman climbing, while Boeing was unchanged in spite of a downgrade from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.  A reaction, analysts say, to the governor talking tough.</p><p>GOV. GEORGE W. BUSH (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And America's armed forces need better equipment, better training and better pay.</p><p>CHERNOFF: Microsoft resumed its recent climb, up 1 1/4, partly on speculation that a Republican administration might ease pressure for a Microsoft breakup.</p><p>Governor Bush has said he would drop the Justice Department suit against tobacco companies.  And today their stocks withstood the negative news the Engle class action case was sent back to the Florida state judge who oversaw the $145 billion jury award against the industry.  Phillip Morris lost only 1/8 of a point.  R.J. Reynolds, which has also been rallying lately, was off 3/8.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHERNOFF: And the bond market was anticipating a Bush victory as well today.  The long bond down 12/32 in late trading on concerns that the governor's tax cut plan could very quickly eat away the federal surplus.  As for the stock market, if Bush does win, there will not necessarily be a big market rally.  We all know the old Wall Street adage: buy on the rumor, or in this case, the poll, sell on the news -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, said, Allan Chernoff.  Thanks very much Allan.</p><p>Well, on the eve of the election, let's take a look at where we stand in the markets so far this year.  The Dow is down 4 1/2 percent in 2000.  The last time it hit a record high was January 14th.  The Nasdaq is off 16 percent and down more than 32 percent from its last record, which it hit on March 10th.</p><p>BAY: The election, as we've said, wasn't the only event Wall Street was waiting for today.  Tech investors were anxious ahead of Cisco's profit report, the company considered a pillar of the Nasdaq. And while Cisco didn't disappoint with after-the-bell numbers, it didn't quite dazzle either.  The company earned 18 cents a share, maintaining a long tradition of beating expectations by a penny. Sales jumped more than 65 percent to $6.5 billion.  That wasn't enough for investors trading the stock in after hours, the shares fell 1 1/2 after losing ground in the regular session.</p><p>Bruce Francis has been listening to the company conference call and he joins us now with the very latest on the results and, of course, the outlook -- Bruce.</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Willow, thanks.</p><p>Cisco's results delivered no negative surprises.  That alone makes Cisco stand out alongside stumbling competitors like Lucent and Nortel.  Here are some of the highlights of the quarter: CEO John Chambers bragged that Cisco's bottom line is benefiting from good geographic and product line balance, something that he vows to communicate better to Wall Street.  Sales to enterprise, so-called \"corporate customers,\" were robust, as companies beef up their information technology infrastructures.</p><p>But Cisco did acknowledge that smaller, scrappier competitive telephone companies are spending at slower rates than before.  Cisco sees 2001 revenues rising 50-60 percent, including a sequential increase in the coming Q2, the current quarter, this will prompt many analysts to raise their earnings numbers, but since that faster growth comes from slightly less profitable products, profit margins will decrease.</p><p>CEO Chambers says that he was more concerned now about the U.S. economy and demand from telecom companies than he was before.  And Cisco spelled out its loan arrangements with its customers, something Wall Street has been worried about, but maintained that the portfolio is managed conservatively.</p><p>Well, looking out further, analysts are expecting Cisco's revenues to grow anywhere from 23-50 percent in 2002.  The company is telling the street right now to keep those projections right where they are -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Bruce Francis reporting -- thanks, Bruce.</p><p>FRANCIS: My pleasure.</p><p>BAY: Later on MONEYLINE, we'll talk with John Chambers, the CEO of Cisco, just minutes after he finishes up the company conference call with analysts.</p><p>VARNEY: Cisco was one factor holding the Nasdaq back today, but there was no stopping the Dow, where some of the oldest of the old- economy stocks took off ahead of voting tomorrow. Let's go to Terry Keenan at the New York Stock Exchange with a look at the big board standouts -- Terry.</p><p>TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And, Stuart, there are a lot of them.  Well, there was a lot of talk here that this pre-election rally was signaling a Bush victory at the polls tomorrow.  No one was really getting too excited about the outcome, noting that election years and particularly the eve of a presidential election is usually a good time for stocks.</p><p>The Monday before Election Day in both 1996 and the more hotly- contested election in 1992, stocks did rally in advance of Election Day, although today's gains were stronger on a percentage basis.  A lot of traders here were also pointing to strong mutual fund inflows in early November and that seems to have increased the appetite for stocks by money managers.</p><p>Whatever the reason, the Dow had another strong day.  Helping out to the upside, J.P. Morgan, this after its merger partner Chase said that the combination will add even more to earnings going forward than they initially expected.  Financials as a group pretty strong today, as were those old-economy stocks, the economically-sensitive issues.</p><p>Look at that move in GM, back above $60 a share.  3M and United Technologies also enjoying standout sessions, while AT&amp;T, one of the few losers, down another 50 cents.  As for the market breadth, just slightly positive, as you can see there by 35 stocks.  Trading action, though, was light, 10 percent below recent levels, not surprising ahead of both the Cisco numbers and tomorrow's election -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, during the day tomorrow, can't investors get some indication of how the vote is going from somewhere or other tomorrow? Because that could affect trading.</p><p>KEENAN: It definitely could, because trading is open for the full day.  And there really isn't much expectation that traders will have a look at the exit polls, but there was some buzz today whether that key exit polling information might be available on the Internet. Now, television networks keep this information very close to the vest, and it's actually accumulated by a company, a consortium of the different television networks.</p><p>But some Web sites, most notably Matt Drudge, did publish some exit polls during the primaries, and Mr. Drudge says that if he can get his hand on that information, he will put it on his Web site tomorrow -- Stuart.  So stay tuned.</p><p>VARNEY: Which means the stock market could become a leading indicator for the polls tomorrow night.</p><p>KEENAN: If that information becomes available, we'll have to see.</p><p>VARNEY: We shall.  Terry Keenan at the big board, thanks -- Willow. BAY: Stuart, coming up next, what just may be a photo finish in the race for the White House.  We'll have the very latest poll numbers, as the candidates zero in on the battleground states.</p><p>And later, a spectacular tumble for VA Linux: What ever happened to Linux, the software that was going to shatter the Windows monopoly?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Now, a special MONEYLINE look at the race for 2000, the most expensive election season in political history. \"The Washington Post\" today offered up its own tally for spending in the presidential and congressional contests: a total of $3 billion.  And it was clear early on that the campaign trail to the White House would be paved in cash, when Governor Bush raised more than a hundred million dollars just to win the primary.</p><p>Kelli Arena looks at how much money the candidates raised and where it came from.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The stakes are admittedly high.</p><p>SCOTT HARSHBARGER, COMMON CAUSE: You have money and power intersecting in the search for the most powerful office in the free world.</p><p>ARENA: But the numbers nonetheless are staggering.</p><p>LARRY MAKINSON, CENTER FOR RESPONSIVE POLITICS: If Alan Greenspan were monitoring inflation in political spending, he probably would have had a heart attack by now.</p><p>ARENA: Despite all the rhetoric about campaign finance reform, the fund-raising cycle is as vicious as ever.  Check the tally: George W. Bush pulling in $187 million in hard money, that's money that goes directly to his campaign, and $129 million in soft money, that's money that goes to the Republican Party; Al Gore, $133 million in hard money, $91 million in soft money.</p><p>Much of that soft money coming from the usual coffers, labor unions, law firms, oil and tobacco companies.  But there's also a new kid on the block.</p><p>HARSHBARGER: The most significant new player really is the high- tech community, and particularly, Microsoft.</p><p>ARENA: Microsoft and other high-tech firms have donated $24 million so far this election cycle.</p><p>MAKINSON: The biggest movement we've seen this year by far has been the rise of the computer industry.  A decade ago, the computer industry was 55th among the 80 or so industries that we track, today they're number 8. ARENA: But unlike labor unions, which give more than 90 percent of their money to Democrats, and oil companies, which give 80 percent to Republicans, high-tech firms are hedging their bets.</p><p>PETER EISNER, CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEGRITY: The interest of corporations is to have access to power no matter who wins and to be able to influence policy.</p><p>ARENA: Much of the money raised is being spent on advertising, and with polls showing the candidates running neck and neck, most of the ads are running in swing states.</p><p>EISNER: Between 60-70 percent of all money is spent on one form or another of media advertising.  We're talking about a system in which $500-$600 million will be spent on television and radio in this cycle, which is at least a quarter more than 1996.</p><p>ARENA: There are also issue ads, put out by special interest groups.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, NRA AD)</p><p>NARRATOR: Al Gore wants government testing, licensing and registration for all firearms operators.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARENA: The money spent on those ads are not included in soft money tabulations, but it's estimated that about $300 million was doled out by special interest groups this year.</p><p>MAKINSON: When they put those ads on the air, they do not file a report with the Federal Election Commission as long as they don't use the magic words of saying vote \"for\" or vote \"against.\" These are so- called \"issue ads.\"</p><p>ARENA: Those ads are the most troubling to campaign finance reform advocates who say the entire fund-raising effort has spun way out of control.</p><p>HARSHBARGER: Reform is really about not taking money out of politics, it's taking the abuse of money out of politics.  It's making it that money doesn't influence who gets to play.</p><p>ARENA (on camera): And despite all the money being spent, voter turnout is still expected to be less than 50 percent.</p><p>Kelli Arena, CNN Financial News, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: The top of the ticket wasn't the only race that saw candidates shelling out really big bucks.  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the heftiest price tag was in the New Jersey state Senate campaign, where former Goldman Sachs executive Jon Corzine spent more money than any senatorial candidate in history, shelling out $55 million of his own money.  Across the Hudson River, New Yorkers have watched Rick Lazio raise $33 million, outpacing the $22 million taken in by Hillary Rodham Clinton.  And another milestone was set in a California congressional race, where incumbent James Rogan and challenger Adam Schiff raised a combined total of $10 million, and that too, is a record.</p><p>BAY: On this final day before the U.S. elections, our special edition of the MONEYLINE \"News Digest: Election 2000.\"</p><p>Joie Chen is at the CNN Center and she joins us now with the day's political news -- Joie.</p><p>JOIE CHEN, CNN ANCHOR: Thank you, Willow.</p><p>The presidential candidates stormed across the country today, appealing for votes on this last full day of campaigning before tomorrow's elections.  Vice President Gore and Texas Governor George W. Bush followed grueling, almost round-the-clock schedules, looking to win support in the key battleground states.  Gore had events today in Iowa, Missouri and Michigan.  He is closing the day in Florida, where he and Bush are still in a tight race for that state's 25 electoral votes, and where Gore said he expects to clinch the election.  While in Missouri, the vice president charged that Bush has set the wrong priorities for the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL GORE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Governor Bush would propose under his plan to spend more money on tax cuts to the top 1 percent than all of his new proposals for education, health care, and national defense combined.  Now, those priorities are wrong for America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHEN: Bush, too, was on a marathon campaign schedule, starting in Tennessee, another state where the two are locked in a close race. Bush was in traditional Democratic territory all day, stopping in Wisconsin, Iowa and Arkansas.  While in Tennessee, Bush predicted he would take the vice president's home state.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. GEORGE W. BUSH (R-TX), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: My opponent vows to carry his home state.  He may win Washington, D.C., but he's not going to win Tennessee.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHEN: Governor Bush tonight heads home to Texas to await the results of tomorrow's vote.  Gore heads home to Tennessee tomorrow.</p><p>The latest polls show that the race for president is closer than ever.  Results from the two-day poll by CNN/\"USA Today\" and Gallup show while Gore is up 2 percentage polls from previous polls, Bush still holds a narrow lead among the likely voters, 47 percent to Gore's 45 percent.  A six-day average of the same tracking poll shows Bush winning support from 47 percent of likely voters compared with Gore's 43 percent.  Other polls also show that Bush holds a slight lead over Gore.</p><p>The real battle tomorrow will be for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidential election.  A CNN analysis shows Bush with a lead in 26 states, worth 224 electoral votes combined.  Gore has a lead in 12 states plus the District of Columbia, with a combined total of 181 electoral votes.  In 12 other states, with a total of 133 electoral votes, neither candidate now has a clear edge.</p><p>These are some of today's top political stories.

What pushed him out the door?  We have the story.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: In tonight's CEO profile, John Chambers, king of networking giant Cisco.

An impressive feat, considering he says, quote, \"My family is first, second and third in terms of my priorities.\"</p><p>Still, $10,000 invested when Chambers joined Cisco would be worth $2.8 million today.  Just imagine if Cisco were priority No. 1.</p><p>MONEYLINE will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: No relief in sight for euro.  It dipped again today, despite another surprise effort to shore up the currency by the European central bank.  For the second session in a row, the ECB intervened in the market to buys euros, and it did so without help from other countries.  Today, the euro fell to just over 86 cents. Europe's common currency has fallen more than 25 percent against the dollar since its January 1999 debut. BAY: Some major fallout at German media giant Bertelsmann just days after the company announced its landmark deal with online music service Napster.  Two of BMG's top execs are walking, and Casey Wian has the story.</p><p>Casey Wian has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): BMG Entertainment, the home of diverse music superstar such as Britney Spears, Whitney Houston and Santana is cleaning house.  BMG's parent company, the German media giant Bertelsmann, announced the impending departure of BMG's top two executives: Chairman Michael Dornemann and president and CEO Strauss Zelnick.</p><p>Reportedly, both men were unwilling to accept diminished roles in the wake of a broader restructuring of Bertelsmann that will split the $17 billion privately held conglomerate into three business units and accelerate its transition away from traditional music retailing.</p><p>MARK MOORADIAN, JUPITER COMMUNICATIONS: Going forward, if you want to be in the growth business, you've got to be looking at things like downloads, things like subscription services and certainly at things like, given the growth of it, network file sharing.</p><p>WIAN: The catalyst for the resignations, which are effective at the end of the year, was BMG's controversial deal last week with Napster.  It has agreed to help the online music-swapping service develop a business model in return for dropping out of the music industry's copyright infringement lawsuit against Napster.</p><p>ALEC FOEGE, MUSIC INDUSTRY WRITER: I think that you're going to find at a lot of the major labels people of a high rank stepping down in coming weeks and months because there is a huge amount of disagreement at the upper ranks.</p><p>WIAN: Disagreement over how to harness the profit potential of music distribution over the Internet while controlling piracy.  The changes at the top of BMG help vindicate Arista Records founder Clive Davis.  He was forced out of his job in May by the now-ousted Zelnick. Since then, Davis has received $150 million from Bertelsmann to start his own label, J Records, in partnership with BMG.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WIAN: There have been reports in European newspapers that Bertelsmann ultimately plans to take Napster public.  A company official we spoke with called that presumptuous and total speculation, Willow.</p><p>BAY: Casey, they could probably use a working business plan first.</p><p>WIAN: And a settlement of their lawsuit.</p><p>BAY: Casey Wian, thanks -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, Willow, in tonight's \"Tech Watch,\" the pink slips at dot.com's keep piling up.  Today, Furniture.com said it will layoff 76 of its 88 employees.  The remaining workers will stick around just to shut down the site.  Furniture.com, backed by CMGI, is the second online home furnishing business to close its doors this year.  In august, Living.com shut down.  That company was partly owned by Amazon.</p><p>And it's not just the dot.coms themselves suffering.  Today, word came that a venture capital firm is slimming down itself.  Divine Interventures says it will lay off 18 of its 41 employees.  Shares of Divine finished today at 3 3/16, down more than 74 percent from their record high.</p><p>BAY: Coming up on MONEYLINE, the biggest media merger in history may soon get the nod from regulators.  We'll get the details.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: There's a lot more ahead on the second half hour of MONEYLINE.</p><p>VARNEY: That's right.  Cisco's after-the-bell earnings make the grade.  We'll go one on one with the man in charge, chief executive and president John Chambers.</p><p>BAY: Plus, a triple-digit rally on the Dow, a closer look at this pre-election pop.</p><p>And if it's the economy, stupid, why isn't Al Gore looking at a landslide victory?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: The MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR continues.  Here again, Willow Bay in Los Angeles and Stuart Varney in New York.</p><p>BAY: In tonight's headlines, Cisco sails past profit and sales forecasts, but will another strong quarter be enough to win back frazzled investors?  We'll talk with CEO John Chambers.  And a one- time tech hot shot hits hard times: VA Linux warns of a revenue slide, laid low by a drop-off of dot.com business.  Plus, with the election one day away, we look at a different kind of credit crunch.  Why has Vice President Al Gore received so little credit for the longest economic boom in U.S. history?</p><p>VARNEY: But first, more on tonight's top story: A pre-election buying-spree sends the Dow soaring to a triple-digit again, as investors grabbed up some manufacturing mainstays and drug stocks ahead of the closest presidential election in decades.</p><p>Blue chips stocks pushed higher from the outset, gaining 159 points, closing at 10977.  There volume there about 930 million.  And leading the way was General Motors.  It gained nearly four points. J.P. Morgan also up 4 3/4 there.  3M, United Technologies and Merck gained more than two points.</p><p>A different story on the Nasdaq, though, as investors shifted some funds out of tech stocks.  That drove the Nasdaq down 35.  It closed at 3416.</p><p>Now, check the movers there, JDS Uniphase down more than 3 3/4. Oracle and Sun Microsystems slipped nearly 2 1/2 piece.  Nextel was down more than two.  And Biogen lost more than 3 1/2.</p><p>BAY: The big tech news came after the bell when Cisco Systems edged past profit forecasts as the network equipment maker benefited from strong sales to Internet, cable and telecom companies.  Cisco earned 18 cents a share, a 40 percent jump to $1.3 billion.  This, driven by a 66 percent rise in revenue.  The sales numbers also outpacing estimates.</p><p>In after-hours trading, Cisco stock shed 1 1/2.  Later in the program, we'll hear from the man in charge, John Chambers, president and CEO of Cisco Systems.</p><p>VARNEY: A rough day for VA Linux systems.  Shares of the company tanked more than 40 percent after it warned of a revenue shortfall in its fiscal first quarter, saying sales to new customers in the dot.com sector were below expectations.  VA Linux dropped $12.50.  It closed off more than 12 1/2 at 17 3/8.  That beat its previous 52-week low of $23 a share.  It is now down 95 percent from its 52-week high.</p><p>The sell-off weighed heavily on the entire sector.  Amanda Lang joins us now from the Nasdaq marketsite in Times Square with all the details for us -- Amanda.</p><p>AMANDA LANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Stuart.  Well, shares of VA Linux did indeed tumble today after the company said it would disappoint investors when it reports its fiscal first quarter in two weeks time.</p><p>The company had been expected to lose 9 cents a share, but it said it could lose almost double that amount.  VA Linux did indeed say that it had softer-than-expected revenue in the quarter, and it blamed slower spending by some of its dot.com customers for the shortfall.</p><p>It was that explanation that helped rattle other Linux-related companies.  Those Internet startups had been among the most loyal adherents for Linux, the open-source operating system seen as a potential rival for Microsoft.</p><p>Rival Linux firm Redhat, which itself disappointed the Street recently with weaker-than-expected revenue, fell on the warning from its rival, ending down more than 7 percent.  And Caldera Systems ended the day down almost 10 percent.</p><p>Analysts were mixed today as to whether the whole sector should be tarred with the same brush, with many stressing that the adoption rates of Linux will likely remain strong.  But while many Linux firms are working to broaden their customer base beyond the traditional dot.com clientele, larger corporate customers take much longer to make buying decision.  So that while VA Linux did increase its customer base to include some more traditional firms, revenue from those customers won't show up this fiscal quarter.</p><p>Back to you, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: And that is Amanda Lang.  Thanks very much, Amanda -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, as we said, stocks on that New York Stock Exchange rallied today as many investors bet on a Bush victory, the time winding down on a long, tough political campaign.</p><p>A perplexing phenomenon has put the Democrats at an apparent disadvantage.  While the Clinton administration has presided over eight years of unprecedented prosperity, Al Gore does not seem to be getting much credit.</p><p>Terry Keenan at the New York Stock Exchange takes a look at why not -- Terry.</p><p>TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Willow, after Bill Clinton captured the White House in 1992 by focusing laser-like on the economy, any first-year poli-sci major could tell you that the key to winning a presidential economy -- election, that is, was the economy. Well, that's why this year is so confounding to the so-called \"experts.\"</p><p>By any measure, Al Gore has the economic wind at his back with unemployment at the lowest level in a generation, an almost decade- long expansion, and tame inflation.  In fact, given these factors, one noted professor at the University of Iowa, with a long track record of calling elections, believes the vice president should be 10 points ahead in the polls.</p><p>Well, with most polls showing Governor Bush with the advantage, many pollsters are trying to figure out what's going on this year, and there are several schools of thought.  But many experts say the vice president hasn't done a good job of linking himself to the prosperity, and that is particularly important this year, because so many voters are blase about the economic boom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEOFFREY GARIN, PETER D. HART &amp; ASSOCIATES: Frankly, people think that this economy is so good now that nobody is going to mess it up, and there's really not a consciousness that the economy is in jeopardy one way or the other in this election.  And that's obviously been a disadvantage to Gore.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEENAN: Well, then there are the conflicting signals from the stock market.  Typically, a presidential election year is a very good year for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 up an average of 11 percent.  But this year, the S&amp;P is down more than 2 percent and the Nasdaq is off 16 percent in an election where more voters own stock than ever before.</p><p>So not apparently a typical year by any measure when you look at how voters are likely to vote their pocketbooks -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: So, Terry, is it clear -- is it clear that the market is expecting a Bush victory?</p><p>KEENAN: You know, there's all sorts of indicators.  There's the one that I just showed you.  This will be the first year that the S&amp;P 500 is down in a presidential election year since 1960.  On the other hand, some people like to look at the short-term trend of the Dow over the last two or three months.  If you look at that, that would be a positive for Gore, because the Dow is up over the last couple of months, but the Nasdaq is down and down a lot.</p><p>BAY: All right, and we'll find out tomorrow.</p><p>KEENAN: That's for sure.</p><p>BAY: Terry Keenan, thanks -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Willow, next on MONEYLINE, more on why Al Gore is not getting a bigger boost from a super-strong economy.  We'll talk with two veteran Wall Street economists, Robert Brusca and David Jones. We'll be back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: More now on what seems to be an election paradox: why the vice president hasn't gotten much political capital from an economy that is going very strongly.  At the Democratic convention, President Clinton invoked Ronald Reagan by asking: \"Are you better off now than you were eight years ago?\"</p><p>All right, let's look at some statistics.  Back in 1992, unemployment was higher than 7 percent.  Now, it's at 3.9 percent, and that's a 30-year low.  The yield on the long bond has fallen more than a point and a half.  The Dow has more than tripled from where it closed the night before the '92 election.  And the Nasdaq has soared, I should say, more than 450 percent.</p><p>So why hasn't Mr. Gore gotten more credit for the boom, and how much of the credit does the Clinton administration truly deserve?</p><p>Joining us now economists Robert Brusca and David Jones. Gentlemen, welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>If Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton are not going to get the credit, who does deserve the credit?  Go first, David.</p><p>DAVID JONES, AUBREY G. LANSTON: Private sector, Stuart.  The driving force behind this 10-year expansion is a high-tech investment boom and a high-tech revolution in effect, which has pushed up productivity growth, given the chance for the economy to grow faster, efficient capital markets moving the capital to the high-return sectors where the technology revolution went, and finally, a Clinton administration, which I will admit, had two architects of this expansion, Alan Greenspan and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. It's very difficult to transfer from them to Gore this great economic miracle.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, Bob, who get's the credit?</p><p>ROBERT BRUSCA, ECOBEST CONSULTING: Well, I'd like to look back at antecedents.  I think we go to George's father.  I think that Bush had the economy improving during the elections.  People didn't realize it.  This is a guy who won Desert Storm, who had an economy that was improving with a Fed chairman who was being stingy with interest rates.  And, you know, I want to know why he didn't get more credit. You want to know why Gore doesn't get credit.  Why didn't Bush Senior get more credit for what he did?</p><p>I think the American people are kind of picky in the way they look at things.  Also, you want to give credit to monetary policy, give it to Paul Volker and Alan Greenspan.  Volker knocked inflation down.  Greenspan has kept it out for the count.</p><p>VARNEY: What about the Republican Congress that came in 1994? Because the Dow really rocketed and the economy took off after the Republicans won in November of '94.</p><p>BRUSCA: Well, that's true, and, of course, you go back farther to Ronald Reagan, who really put the economy on a different path.  I mean, this is a long, long process.  You know, fiscal policy takes a long time to work out.  This is why it's not really suited for cyclical kinds of problems and why you take a look at this economy, we're headed for this big tax cut if we get Mr. Bush in office.  We're at full employment.  You have to wonder what that's going to do to this economy.</p><p>There are questions about fiscal policy right now, I think.  And both of them are going to get rid of the surplus.  They are going to do it different in different ways, and this surplus may not even be real.  We've got two presidents, two presidential candidates, out to destroy something that may not be real.</p><p>VARNEY: Does Mr. Gore deserve any of the blame for what's happened to Microsoft?</p><p>JONES: Well, let's put it this way.  If I were voting for Gore, and I'll make that a hypothetical, I would expect him to be very tough on business because he's running a campaign that has sounded very tough on business, whether it's price controls on the pharmaceuticals, whether it's continuing the antitrust action against Microsoft.  So, I would argue that Gore is an automatic negative for the stock market, for example.</p><p>And one of the reasons the stock market has been pushing higher has been a Bush phenomenon.  As he has looked better in the polls, the market's done better.</p><p>VARNEY: Do you think that Mr. Gore should get some of the credit for NAFTA, which did introduce competition to many American corporations?</p><p>BRUSCA: You know, I have a problem with giving him credit, giving him blame, because this man is the vice president.  Since when has the vice president run an administration that he is the vice president in?  I mean, he was the vice president.  He wasn't making the decisions.  And furthermore, when he ran his campaign for election, he tried to distance himself from Mr. Clinton because of all that other political baggage Mr. Clinton had.  Now, how can he have it both ways?  How can he distance himself from him and then embrace the successes at the same time?</p><p>VARNEY: Should he have embraced Mr. Clinton's performance?</p><p>BRUSCA: Well, if you take a look at what happened in the debates, in the debates, Mr. Gore made some mistakes.  He started looking a lot like Mr. Clinton.  People have basically put him together with velcro and now he's attached to Mr. Clinton but he doesn't get those successes either.  I think he's got the worst of all worlds.  I think it's a tactical mistake in the way this is run and I really don't think in any true terms he deserves any credit for it because he wasn't the architect.  He was me too.</p><p>VARNEY: Just let me tell you, let me know how you really feel about this, Bob, OK?  Predictions: has Mr. Bush got this sewn up?</p><p>JONES: I think it's going to be a splitster.  You mentioned it earlier: Bush president, one of the two houses of Congress will go Democratic.  The public loves those kinds of things because not too much damage is done, even with fiscal policy.</p><p>BRUSCA: Well, it's no landslide for anybody.  I think it looks like Bush is ahead.  I would agree with David in this scenario.  And I think that means that we muddle through another four years where we don't get any dramatic changes in policy.  But if Bush does get elected, he's going to have to try like crazy to have some kind of a tax cut go through but it won't look anything like the one he's proposing.</p><p>VARNEY: Fair enough.</p><p>Bob Brusca, David Jones, many thanks for being here tonight.</p><p>JONES: Thank you.</p><p>BRUSCA: Thank you,</p><p>VARNEY: Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, coming up next, Nasdaq heavyweight Cisco beats the street by a penny again.  We'll have the man in charge, John Chambers, Cisco's president and CEO, when we return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Topping tonight's \"MONEYLINE Movers,\" telecom equipment maker Turnstone Systems plunged more than $19.  The company lowered its revenue estimates to $38 million, far short of the $56 million Wall Street expected.</p><p>Palm lost more than 4 1/2 on news that its competitor, Symbian, has a head-start on new smart phone technology.</p><p>But Equinox Systems jumped more than 2 1/4 on nearly 88 times its average volume.  Avocent will pay $57 million in cash for the communications software company.</p><p>And British Airways gained nearly 4 1/2.  The airline announced today that operating profit more than doubled and that it will sell its low-fare subsidiary.</p><p>VARNEY: In other corporate news, a transatlantic energy deal between New York's Amerada Hess and Britain's Lasmo.  The merger gives Hess a bigger international position and an expanded role in oil exploration and production. And chalk up another deal for Broadcom. The high-speed communications company announced its 11th purchase this year: a $2 billion deal for chip maker Sibyte.  Broadcom said the deal would trim profits next year, but add to earnings in 2002.  Broadcom, today, it's stock fell nearly 3 1/2, down to $219 a share.</p><p>BAY: Tonight, Cisco does it again.  As we told you earlier, after the bell earning's from the routing giant did not disappoint, beating the street by a penny a share.  However, in after-hours trading. shares are down 1 1/2.  Cisco, traditionally a Nasdaq standout, is up just about 3 percent this year and is off its highs by more than 30 percent.</p><p>Joining us now to talk about tonight's earnings news and what's in store for next year, Cisco president and CEO, John Chambers.</p><p>John, as always, welcome to MONEYLINE.</p><p>JOHN CHAMBERS, CEO, CISCO SYSTEMS: Thank you, Willow.  Pleasure to be here.</p><p>BAY: I'd like to start, if I may, with your guidance.  You guided street upwards for your second quarter and for 2001.  What's behind the bullishness?</p><p>CHAMBERS: Well, we don't have a much more aggressive call than we had this quarter and last quarter.  Our growth rate of 66 percent is double what the market anticipated, just like in March of this last year.  We saw geographic balance across all five of our key geographies, across all of our lines of business and across nine out of or 12 product lines through $1 billion plus in a way we've not seen it before, as well.</p><p>Each of the five geographies had over 50 percent year-over-year growth, and all of them grew double digits, Q4 to Q1.  Our lines of business were really solid with the reemergence of enterprise and small to medium business growing in over 20 percent.  And the balance across the product lines were unusually good.  So, we're very optimistic.  We're in the early innings of this new ball game, if you will. BAY: John, just explain, if you would, why balance is so important to you.  It's a theme that comes up again and again after your earnings.</p><p>CHAMBERS: Well, customers are moving to an end-to-end provider, so you have got to have multiple products to be able to provide that either in enterprise or service provider.  Secondly, if you are too dependent on one market segment and that market segment goes through bumps, as all of them will, you look good when it's going well, but you look very bad when it's going the other way.</p><p>And the third element is enterprise customers and service provider customers, they share networks.  And the extent to which enterprise customers outsource will determine how fast service providers grow.  But Cisco's positioned either way it goes.  If they outsource more of their networks, then we're well positioned in service providers.  If they continue to build them up at the current pace, which is actually accelerating internally, we're in a good position there as well.  So, it's that balance that I think is so unique to Cisco.</p><p>BAY: Let's talk about what you're seeing going forward in the telecom sector.  Are you seeing signs of a slowdown?  And what about from the upstarts that make up about 15 percent of your revenues?</p><p>CHAMBERS: We're seeing very good balance on all the theaters outside the U.S.  So, we saw the double-digit growth as we had expected and service providers outside U.S.  Inside U.S., the selects were sluggish.  Our balance on products was very good.  Opticals on fair, it grew 40 percent over last quarter, 500 percent over a year ago.  Momentum looks very good, good balance across the product lines. So with the exception CLEX and one or two major service providers, we're in pretty good shape on a global basis.</p><p>Capital\u2026</p><p>BAY: What about\u2026</p><p>CHAMBERS: Go ahead.</p><p>BAY: I was going to say, what about those loan commitments that you have, two -- a little over $2 billion.  Do you have any credit concerns going forward?</p><p>CHAMBERS: Well I always have concerns about anything.  I think any company that isn't paranoid doesn't survive in this industry.</p><p>Having said that, we're very conservative in our financial recognition, and Larry is accruing within very acceptable guidelines. We're much more conservative than our peers, so I would be surprised and disappointed if this were an issue at all.</p><p>BAY: John Chambers, as always, thanks for joining us.</p><p>CHAMBERS: Willow, our pleasure.  Thank you.</p><p>BAY: Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Coming up next, AOL-Time Warner: from high-fives to a high-stakes regulatory battle.  We'll have the latest on where this media merger stands when we return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: A resolution today to antitrust charges against the fourth and fifth biggest U.S. airlines.  Northwest agreed to give up its voting control of Continental Airlines, a stake that Northwest acquired two years ago.  Under the proposed plan agreed to by the Justice Department, Northwest will sell most of its voting shares back to Continental for $450 million.  But Northwest would hold on to shares with reduced voting power and retain the ability to block the future sale of Continental to another airline.</p><p>Checking the stocks, Northwest was unchanged, but Continental fell three.</p><p>VARNEY: We now take a look at another regulatory hot button that has made headlines over the past 10 months: the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner, the parent of CNN.  Now corporate America's biggest deal ever may be nearing approval.</p><p>Greg Clarkin has been following the ups and downs of the regulatory process, and he joins us now for an update.</p><p>What do you have, Greg?</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Stuart, ever since this deal was announced in January, the hot-button issue has been open access to Time Warner's cable lines.  Now this is an issue that regulators have focused on and one that appears, at least, to be close to being resolved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(voice-over): The Federal Trade Commission and America Online and Time Warner are moving closer to an agreement over open access. Sources say a final deal on open access could be struck as early as the end of this week, which would clear one of the biggest hurdles for AOL and Time Warner's proposed merger.  Time Warner is parent of CNN.</p><p>Since the deal was announced in January, executives of both companies have promised open access.  But they've bristled at the suggestion regulators should dictate the terms.  So word the companies may be close to agreeing to open access terms was encouraging to consumer activists.</p><p>GENE KIMMELMAN, CONSUMERS UNION: This is an important step forward, because we finally have AOL and Time Warner admitting that a promise isn't enough.  They dominate the Internet service marketplace, they control 20 percent of all cable distribution, have a partnership with AT&amp;T for another 30 percent.  That's half the country.  They have an ownership stake together between the two companies and about half of the most popular programs.  They finally admit that they can't just make promises.</p><p>CLARKIN: Among the possible conditions being discussed is a requirement that at least one Internet service provider, or ISP, gain access to Time Warner cable lines before AOL service is offered.</p><p>Another possibility: depending on conditions of a specific market, AOL/Time Warner could be required to carry at least three other ISPs.</p><p>Just what will be sent over those high-speed cable lines has been the driving force behind this deal from day one.</p><p>FRED MORAN, JEFFRIES &amp; CO.: The benefit to Time Warner is they have AOL's marketing muscle behind cable modems.  They can not only go out there and market through their cable systems, but they can go out and market directly over the Web to all of AOL's customers and push those customers on to higher speed access, which not only increases your monthly bill from a subscription standpoint, but also will allow you to take streaming video and broadband services, which will stimulate even more time on the Web.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARKIN: And while the options being discussed do provide some degree of open access to Time Warner's cable lines, they don't satisfy some consumer activists, who want to see the lines open to any and all ISPs -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Greg Clarkin, thanks very much.</p><p>Let's bring you up to date on the stocks: AOL up 2 1/2 points today, and Time Warner gained 4 -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Stuart, up next, \"Ahead of the Curve,\" some of what you need to know tonight before tomorrow's markets open.</p><p>You're watching MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Taking a look at some of what could move the markets tomorrow, watch for quarterly earnings from BP-Amoco and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.</p><p>And in case you're unclear as to which Tuesday tomorrow is, it's, of course, Election Day.

From London Bridge to the Millennium Bridge, four spans have been subtly wired with an ever-changing lighting system, the work of the artist Leo Villareal, who carried out a similar project on the Bay Bridge in San Francisco.</p><p>Fifteen Thames bridges will eventually be lit by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://illuminatedriver.london/press/illuminated-river-has-started-on-site\"> Illuminated River Foundation,</url> with Philips lighting spin-off       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.signify.com/global\"> Signify</url> providing the technology. Signify is changing this city and many others after dark, and even in daytime, in the multifarious\u00a0ways that lighting is becoming\u00a0a platform through       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lighting.philips.com/main/support/connect/lighting-technology/sustainability/for-ledification-to-succeed-it-requires-a-clear-strategy\"> the LEDification</url> of the world.</p><p>The advantages of LEDs over conventional lighting, in terms of their long life and\u00a0energy and cost savings, have been understood for years, but the ability to control them and add sensors and other chips to the mix, connected through\u00a0the Internet of Things, has vastly enhanced the possibilities of technology that already has a huge installed base of light sockets and lampposts.</p><p>Joao Pola, chief executive of Signify in the UK, gave me examples such as the local council here which controls street lights so they show a pathway for crowds exiting a stadium,\u00a0while another hands over control of street lighting levels to restaurants and shops to help create an ambience. In Los Angeles, there are audio sensors in lighting that can detect disturbances in the middle of the night and are used by police to literally shine a light on what's happening. Street lamps elsewhere enable levels of pollution, salt on the roads and any flooding to be monitored.</p><p>Signify is also mimicking natural light in windowless offices to improve working conditions and providing 150Mb/s local connectivity inside workplaces\u00a0with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.signify.com/global/innovation/trulifi\"> LiFi technology</url>. Vertical farms,\u00a0where lighting can make growing crops more efficient, and light shows in stadiums are other expanding areas, and Signify is best known to consumers as\u00a0Philips Hue, the\u00a0lighting system for smart homes (see Tech Tools below for its latest product).</p><p>\u201cIt's technology that can enhance\u00a0people's lives at\u00a0home, as citizens seeing monuments and bridges lit up, it can make them more productive and feel better in the office, we're taking things to the\u00a0next level of experience,\u201d says Mr Pola.</p><p>The Internet of (Five) Things</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Netflix watching you watching Netflix</emphasis><br/>The smart TVs in our homes are leaking sensitive user data to companies including Netflix, Google and Facebook even when some devices are idle, according to this scoop from Madhumita Murgia. Researchers from Northeastern University and Imperial College London found that a number of smart TVs, including those made by Samsung and LG, and the streaming dongles Roku and Amazon\u2019s FireTV, were sending out data such as location and IP address to Netflix and third-party advertisers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Huawei says it will share 5G tech</emphasis><br/>Chinese technology group Huawei is spending $1.5bn to recruit software developers for its computing platforms and offering to share its 5G technology through licensing, as it seeks new partners in the face of US sanctions that cut it off from suppliers including Google. Huawei\u2019s search for more developers is made urgent by the fact that its new Mate smartphones, to be launched in Munich on Thursday,\u00a0will not have licensed access to Google\u2019s apps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. WeWork founder 'humbled'</emphasis><br/>WeWork\u2019s chief executive Adam Neumann has told employees he had been \u201chumbled\u201d by the aborted initial public offering of his lossmaking property group, admitting he needed to learn lessons about running a public company. John Gapper comments that it is a touchy moment for founders\u00a0who convince venture capitalists that technology and a new business model can change the world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. US antitrust overlap</emphasis><br/>Are there too many overlapping US antitrust investigations of Big Tech, with the Federal Trade Commission, Justice department and state attorneys-general all getting involved. The FTC's chairman Joseph Simons and\u00a0 Makan Delrahim, head of the justice department\u2019s antitrust division, both conceded at a Senate judiciary committee hearing that the overlap in their investigations into the tech industry was inefficient and caused confusion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. Drones for war and peace</emphasis><br/>Lex says regulators are limiting the scope of drones and best use cases may be for good causes such as the delivery of life-saving remedies or organs in Africa. We've also an analysis on the increasing use\u00a0of armed drones in the Middle East and how best to defend against them.</p><p>Forwarded from our Tech Scroll Asia newsletter</p><p>A SoftBank-cool wind is casting a pall over Asia's tech start-up universe, the latest sign of the widening fallout of the ill-fated WeWork IPO. Read more about the sterner emphasis on profitability that is zipping through the region as a result in this week's Tech Scroll Asia.</p><p>Tech tools \u2014 Philips Hue\u00a0Play HDMI Sync Box</p><p>The Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20864953/tv-light-sync-box-philips-hue-play-hdmi-passthrough-4k\"> launched this week</url>, allows users to sync\u00a0Philips Hue lights with their\u00a0TV, enabling more immersive experiences with music, movies and video games. The box is plugged in between any HDMI device and the\u00a0TV and alters the speed, intensity and colours of Hue lights installed around the TV\u00a0to match the mood of what's being watched.</p><p>George Yianni, head of Technology for\u00a0Philips\u00a0Hue\u00a0and its founder, explained to me that the tech is different from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.philips.co.uk/c-m-so/tv/p/ambilight\"> Philips Ambilight TVs</url> which makes screens seem bigger by taking colours inside them and shining them out on to the surroundings. \u201cWhat we're doing is looking at the whole screen and extracting 3D information and bringing this\u00a0into the third dimension,\u201d he said. The box is available from October 15 at \u20ac249.95 in continental Europe (UK release comes later) and\u00a0$229.99 in the US.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-78332b80da4211e98f9b77216ebe1f17</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X32-V4K1-JB77-K0N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"995\"/><timeReceived>6:42 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 18, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002Q7P</classCode><className>LG CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Those governments got tough on tech in part because of the experiences of women in politics.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NPR's Aarti Shahani dug into the backstory in the U.K. And we should note that Google and Facebook are financial contributors to NPR.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Lisa Cameron is a member of the British Parliament. She's also a victim and survivor of online trolls.             </p><p>LISA CAMERON:                 You feel very alone when this happens to you.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Cameron was new to politics in 2015 when she was elected. She'd been a psychologist, a wife and mom, a trade union rep, the kind of person democracies want to run. But once she entered public life, the sludge of the internet attacked her, not just for her policy stances. It was personal. She says her inbox, Facebook and Twitter accounts filled with rape fantasies, anti-Semitic slurs - she is Jewish - pictures of decapitated bodies, threats to her family.             </p><p>LISA CAMERON:                 It makes you question whether you are doing something wrong in your job, whether politics is right for you.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 She wondered if she'd made a mistake, if running was unfair to her family. Then a horrific attack - not against her, but against a female colleague sworn in in the same class - changed the conversation for Cameron and for the U.K.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER:                 The murder of British MP Jo Cox shocked Britain and the world.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Jo Cox, member of Parliament, was gunned down and stabbed on the streets by a white supremacist. Prosecutors said he was radicalized on the internet. His motive appeared to be policy - he was for Brexit, Cox against - but Cox's colleagues believe her gender made her a target, too.             </p><p>                The Prime Minister's office reached out to men and women in Parliament to ask if they'd been intimidated online. The final report didn't set out to spotlight women in office, but it ended up doing that because they had stories. One reported, quote, \"people wish to see me raped. They wish to come to find my sons hanging from a tree because I don't care about men.\" MP Lisa Cameron said it was cathartic to speak up.             </p><p>LISA CAMERON:                 I had kind of felt at the start that, you know, I must have been doing something wrong until I realized that this is so widespread.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 In another study, a survey of Parliament, male MPs reported being insulted online for job performance more than female MPs did. But women reported far more threats of rape, death and violence to their children and loved ones. Online attacks were affecting real-world behavior. Nearly half of women in Parliament reported making fewer social outings. For men, it was 5%.             </p><p>CHLOE COLLIVER:                 There are probably a number of politicians, especially male politicians, who were unaware that that was happening to the extent it was.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 Chloe Colliver is a researcher with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which helps governments study extremism. Colliver says the investigations didn't lie dormant in a dusty filing cabinet. They caused a sea change. Before, government leaders focused on Islamic extremism. But after, they began to see misogyny and the vitriolic hate of women as a rising organized threat. Female MPs organized in Cox's wake to explore how to keep women interested in politics.             </p><p>CHLOE COLLIVER:                 Her fellow colleagues, who obviously felt very affected by this incident, have themselves joined across parties to try and see action taken on this front.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 The clearest legal impact of this awakening came in a much anticipated blueprint for how to regulate big tech. The government wrote the abuse faced by women in office is unacceptable. The U.K. proposed hefty fines against companies that don't address this harm promptly. Chloe Colliver.             </p><p>CHLOE COLLIVER:                 A female MP who has death threats directed at her through an online platform like Facebook or Twitter or YouTube could take that complaint to a regulator if it wasn't removed in a timely manner.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 The U.K. is not troll-free, but women are now empowered in a way they were not just a few years ago. MP Lisa Cameron recently cast a vote against abortion. Pro-choice trolls sent her violent images and threatened to abort her. Now she says at least one internet giant is taking responsibility.             </p><p>LISA CAMERON:                 If someone is abusive online, I can have that dialogue with Facebook. I know who to go to.             </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:                 The company is helping her sift through the pile of attacks to ID real threats and refer them to law enforcement. That's a step up from shame, she says, and a step forward for democracy.             </p><p>                Aarti Shahani, NPR News.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF EVOCATIV'S \"CASTAWAY\")            </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRMED-2019081912</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRMED2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVJ-KHN1-DY1J-T06G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"910\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR Morning Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 19, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But \"non-innovating, non-practicing patent assertion entities\" have no qualms about suing technology users.</p><p>\"Rather than go after equipment vendors in which a licensing fee or damages award would be a one-time payment based on the cost of the equipment,\" Long said, PAEs and</p><p>NPEs \"prefer to go after the MSO</p><p>that purchased the equipment and get some running royalty based on a percentage of the revenue generated from using the equipment.\"</p><p>Despite the increasing attacks, many cable-industry officials and organizations are loath to discuss the festering patent-troll situation. They cite factors ranging from confidentiality to concerns that Wall Street may downgrade the cable industry if the patent attacks become more frequent.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"mediafirms\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media><br/>The Consumer Electronics Association returns fi re at trolls in print ads</p><p>The National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association and CableLabs - two industry groups involved in regulatory and legislative strategies to stem the troll assaults - declined to comment for this report.</p><p>One view commonly held by attorneys who asked not to be quoted is that \"one man's 'troll' is another person's hero.\" PAEs, NPEs and \"Patent Monetization Entities\" (PAEs) -another recently coined phrase - claim to be the saviors of small investors and creative innovators who deserve fi nancial rewards for infringement by global corporations.</p><p>Whatever the rationale, there is no question that PAE suits against cable fi rms have required signifi cant, costly attention. Since 2008, MSOs have become enmeshed in hundreds of patent-related lawsuits. According to the Westlaw database of patent proceedings, Comcast has been involved in 48 such cases (fi ve in 2013 so far); Time Warner Cable has faced 31; Charter Communications 34; and Cablevision Systems 16. Cox Communications ranks fi rst, involved in 72 patent cases since 2008.</p><p>Overall, media companies last year faced just slightly fewer lawsuits than the highly contentious \"mobile communications and devices\" sector, according to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2012 NPE Activity Report</emphasis> compiled by RPX, a San Francisco fi rm specializing in patent research and litigation.</p><p>Most of the cases are brought by NPEs and PAEs, which acquire underutilized patents and then seek payments from operating companies that use technology or systems which, they claim, are covered by them.</p><p>Although it's impossible to know which patents the trolls are hoarding, the past few years have shown that such outfi ts will go after any target they can fi nd. Despite a new Federal Trade Commission investigation into PAE activities launched last month, the litigation-minded trolls have plenty of opportunities to continue their attacks and are unlikely to back off since they have almost nothing to lose, according to lawyers involved with cable fi rms under attack.</p><p>Companies and law firms decline to put a precise cost on cable patent litigation and settlements; many such cases are sealed.</p><p>Overall, these patent attacks may cost the media industry nearly $5 billion this year, based on research that puts an $80 billion annual price tag on patent suits overall and indicates that 6% of the cases involve \"media content and distribution\" fi rms. (The $5 billion fi gure is an estimate based on the vastly diff erent sums paid in various sectors to handle the patent cases, but represents a reasonable range, according to knowledgeable observers.)</p><p>Paperwork is a major expense for cable companies defending against NPE. For example, in its suit against Cox and others, Cambrian Science claimed that \"getting billing statements was 'critical' to their case,\" Long said. Compiling such billing information, then redacting customers' personal data, would have been extraordinarily costly for the defense, Long said.</p><p>After extended legal maneuvers in late 2012 and early this year, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles ruled that Cox and other providers did not have to produce that billing minutiae, despite Cambrian Science's insistence that such data was essential for its damages model.</p><p>Cambrian was fi shing for anything it could get, Long said, using a common NPE tactic: Making the cost of defense so expensive that carrriers would fi nd it cheaper to pay Cambrian to go away.</p><p>\"NPEs don't have the restraint that practicing entities would have,\" Long said. \"They want to be able to throw a big dollar fi gure in front of a jury and say, 'We just want a small portion.' \" Moreover, non-producing companies such as Cambrian Science can request overly burdensome discovery without \"having to worry about responding in kind,\" he noted.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"mediafirms\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"17461\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p><p>\"They are not looking to enter business relationships with the target company,\" Long said. \"Their only business goal is to maximize fi nancial return on the patent - take the money and run.</p><p>\"Litigation is not disruptive to their business because litigation is their business,\" he added. \"In contrast, a target operating company, such as an MSO, may have thousands and thousands of documents and many witnesses.\"</p><p>Long calls such litigation \"a distraction\" from the operating company's core business, as well as a major expense.</p><p>Mark Chandler, general counsel of frequent troll target Cisco Systems, took it a step farther. He called the NPE lawsuits a \"tax\" because they are \"an extraction that is unrelated to any product that is provided.\"</p><p>\"If you can credibly tax an end user of a service that includes a semiconductor, you can get more money than if you sue the company that actually makes the semiconductor,\" Chandler said. \"The bad news is that these suits are proliferating; the good news is that the courts have caught on\" and may soon curtail egregious suits.</p><p>The attacks on MSOs have upped the ante for vendors such as Cisco.</p><p>\"We have a number of cases in which we're indemnifying customers,\" Chandler said, underscoring the extended fi nancial impact of the PAE's attacks on the cable industry.</p><p>As cable operators fend off patent attacks in court, Washington is accelerating eff orts to curb abuses. At least a half-dozen patent-reform bills are moving through Congress; the Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation into PAE practices; and the White House and Government Accountability Of ce have also weighed in.</p><p>In late September, the FTC initiated an investigation of 25 PAEs, seeking to \"better understand how they impact innovation and competition.\" The agency's examination surfaced barely a month after the GAO recommended in its report Intellectual Property: Assessing Factors That Affect Patent Infringement Litigation Could Help Improve Patent Quality\" that the U.S. Patent and Trademark of ce \"improve patent quality and examination\" procedures to reduce abusive lawsuits.</p><p>In early June, the Obama Administration issued a fi ve-point \"Patent Assertion and U.S. Innovation\" report to improve incentives for \"future innovation in high-tech patents.\" The White House plan also seeks to curb abusive patent litigation.</p><p>Congressional anti-troll action has accelerated. Last week, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) introduced the Patent Litigation Integrity Act, a companion to Rep. Bob Goodlatte's (R-Va.) bill introduced a week earlier that would make it harder for PAEs to attack legitimate businesses. For example, Goodlatte's plan would protect \"covered customers\" (such as cable operators) from being drawn into infringements suits against manufacturers. The proposal would also require PAEs to specify infringement claims, rather than broad fi shing expeditions, and would require PAEs to bear court and attorney costs if they lose the suit. Such approaches would be disincentives for frivolous suits, supporters have claimed.</p><p>Cisco's Chandler said he sees \"more momentum for patent reform than in the past half decade\" and expects Congress to act as a \"broad swath of customers [are] now aff ected\" by patent abuses.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MCHNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MCHNWS2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:59S3-3511-DY5H-11PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">241792</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2059\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 NewBay Media LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Multichannel News</publicationName><volume>Vol. XXXIV</volume><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>November 4, 2013</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC00027XO</classCode><className>NORTEL NETWORKS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC0001V67</classCode><className>EMC CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002CQG</classCode><className>COX COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS334220 RADIO &amp;

They are staying through the weather and they say that they have brought in additional supplies, because this is going to put a pause on relief efforts to those areas that were hardest hit two weeks ago.</p><p>[05:05:00]</p><p>GALLAGHER: Because they simply can't fly to those islands to bring in supplies.</p><p>They have search and rescue teams on standby who will be spending the night through the weather just in case there is flash flooding or people need to be rescued.</p><p>And they've been going around giving hard, thick plastic tarps to the people who are trying to stay in what is left of their homes so they can best prepare for some more weather coming their way.</p><p>The Bahamian government would like for everyone to evacuate to shelters. Here in the Nassau area, there are 2,000 people who have come from those areas that were hardest hit by Dorian, who are staying in shelters right now.</p><p>And that is when you get to the other effect, the emotional, the mental anguish, of yet another storm, more howling wind and heavy rain coming to the same areas you just fled from.</p><p>Hearing those sounds, knowing what is on the horizon, adding to the trauma that all of these people have already experienced. There are some 1,300 people on that official list of the missing and so much more to do to even begin to talk about recovery here in the Bahamas.</p><p>First, they have to get through another bout of weather -- Dianne Gallagher, CNN, Nassau, the Bahamas.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: Dianne, thank you.</p><p>Shifting now to U.S. politics: one of the key moments in Thursday night's debate of presidential candidates, it came when the former cabinet secretary, Julian Castro, appeared to slam the former vice president, Joe Biden, about his memory. Other candidates pushed back against Castro.</p><p>Castro himself later said it was not a personal attack; rather, he said a discussion over policy. Biden hasn't responded directly about the exchange but his campaign has. Here's Biden's deputy campaign chairman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATE BEDINGFIELD, BIDEN CAMPAIGN DEPUTY CHAIRMAN: Secretary Castro likes to talk about who has learned the lessons of the past and I think it's very clear that he hasn't learned the lesson, that by attacking Joe Biden in incredibly personal terms is not the way to advance yourself in the polls.</p><p>It certainly hasn't been true for anybody else who has tried to attack Joe Biden in these debates over the last few months.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL: And the U.S. president Donald Trump is also blasting the Democratic candidates but that's not all, he's also going after those who want to impeach him. And for good measure, he's even taking on light bulbs. Our Jim Acosta has this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Brushing off talk of impeachment coming from the House tweeting, \"You don't impeach presidents for doing a good (great) job.\" President Trump is spoiling for a fight with the Democratic contenders for 2020.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: More than 130 Democrats in Congress have signed up for the Bernie Sanders total government takeover of health care. Crazy Bernie. He's a crazy guy.</p><p>ACOSTA: Slamming his Democratic rivals in a speech in Baltimore as they were holding their debate in Houston, the president once again resorted to racially loaded attacks as he blasted Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and raised questions about former Vice President Joe Biden's mental fitness.</p><p>TRUMP: I hit Pocahontas way too early. I thought she was gone. She's emerged from the ashes. And now it looks like she could beat sleepy Joe. He's fallen asleep. He has no idea what the hell he's doing or saying.</p><p>ACOSTA: As the president mocked Biden's occasional gaffes, Mr. Trump had one of his own.</p><p>TRUMP: Sat around and Chuck Grassley was there and Joni Ernst and John Thune and Mike Pounds -- just a whole group of great people.</p><p>ACOSTA: The White House later said the president meant to refer to Senator Mike Browns and the president also mocked environmentalist taking a dim view on energy efficient light bulbs because of how they make him look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The bulb that we're being forced to use, number one, to me, most importantly, the lights no good. I always look orange. And so do you. The light is the worst. But number two, it's many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb that worked very well. ACOSTA: In his own speech to GOP lawmakers Vice President Mike Pence poked fun at Biden too.</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He said, I'm the vice president of the United States. So, let me be clear. I am the vice president of the United States.</p><p>ACOSTA: Pence then pounced on former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>PENCE: When they were talking about hire taxes, they were talking about gun control. And not just gun control, you had leading candidates for the highest office in the land talking about taking firearms away from law-abiding citizens.</p><p>ACOSTA: That was in reference to this moment.</p><p>O'ROURKE: Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15 and your AK-47.</p><p>ACOSTA: Moderate Democrats are not on board with that idea and worry O'Rourke may have just jeopardized efforts in Congress to find a compromise on new gun control laws.</p><p>SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): I don't think the majority of the Senate or the country is going to embrace mandatory buybacks.</p><p>We need to focus on what we could get done and we need to focus on the challenge here.</p><p>[05:10:00]</p><p>COONS: Which is that majority leader Mitch McConnell and the Republicans in the Senate and our president are refusing to listen to the 93 percent of Americans who want us to do something on background checks.</p><p>ACOSTA: The president promised to unveil a tax cut during the next year but the president has not said how he plans on paying for that. The Treasury Department said the nation's deficit passed the $1 trillion mark for this year.</p><p>As a candidate, Mr. Trump promised to eliminate the national debt. The truth is, he's expanding it rapidly -- Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: A lot to put into focus with Natasha Lindstaedt, a professor of government at the University of Essex joining us from England.</p><p>Good to have you with us.</p><p>NATASHA LINDSTAEDT, UNIVERSITY OF ESSEX: Thanks for having me.</p><p>HOWELL: Again, the left-right binary; two issues you will hear on conservative talk shows that are the Right's bogeyman. The first the suggestion that the Democratic Party is shifting further to the Left, no room for moderates, they say.</p><p>And that Democrats will take Americans' guns. So the comments from Beto O'Rourke check off both boxes for the Right. It has lawmakers also concerned, Natasha, that those comments could make it harder to find compromise. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): And I frankly think that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people, that say Democrats are coming for your guns.</p><p>I'm a gun owner. My sons and I have gone skeet shooting and hunting and, frankly, I don't think having our presidential candidates like Congressman O'Rourke did, say that we're going to try and take people's guns against their will is a wise either policy or political move.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: Did he hurt the party?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL: Poppy Harlow asked the question, did he hurt the party here and how will this play moving forward when it comes to the issue of gun control?</p><p>LINDSTAEDT: Yes, I think it's a good question. And I would disagree with what Chris Coons is saying, that it's going to hurt the party. Because Republicans are going to vote for Trump no matter what. And Democrats are going to vote for whoever is against Trump.</p><p>So it's really all about riling up their bases and then trying to somehow attract independents at the same time.</p><p>If we look at polls, we've already talked about this before, you have almost or over 90 percent of the American people in favor of background checks; 87 percent are in favor of red flag laws where guns can be confiscated from people who appear to be dangerous to themselves or others.</p><p>And you have 56 percent of the public in favor of banning assault weapons. And 52 percent are actually agreeing with O'Rourke and are in favor of some sort of buyback process. So what O'Rourke said wasn't that out of the norm.</p><p>And if you look at what Democrats said, 74 percent of Democrats are in favor of a buyback process and 49 percent of independents. We look at assault weapons. You know, it's only been 15 years that Americans have been able to purchase assault weapons since the 2004 ban ended.</p><p>And assault weapons are only 3 percent of all rifles that Americans own. What he's saying it's not that radical or that crazy and it was going to rile up the Democratic base. You hear the crowd erupting when he said this.</p><p>Of course, the Republicans are going to play this over and over again. And they're going to try to rile up their base.</p><p>But what O'Rourke has been saying is that there are more Americans than not that are actually in favor of gun control. And that the U.S. congress men need to stop being afraid of the NRA. So in this regard, I would disagree with what Chris Coons is saying. I think what O'Rourke is saying is actually getting the base energized.</p><p>HOWELL: It is interesting to your point, Natasha, there are those loud voices on the Right. Loud voices on the Left. And the question is what does it mean for the people in the middle of all of this?</p><p>And polling indicates that many Americans do want to see some movement on this issue.</p><p>Also, I want to talk to you about the flap over Julian Castro's comments to Joe Biden. Biden's campaign calling it a cheap shot to Biden's age. Castro denying that was the intention.</p><p>But there's also an interesting bit to see Joe Biden really embracing this issue, saying it's OK to consider age as a point of discussion. Keeping in mind, Donald Trump 73 years old, I believe. Joe Biden is 76.</p><p>LINDSTAEDT: Right. And I think when Julian Castro went after his age, I don't think that played out very well. The Democrats need to stay united because most Democrats want to beat Trump.</p><p>And they see these types of attacks -- and this attack was very personal against a candidate who is the front-runner, who is popular and who wasn't attacking him personally.</p><p>[05:15:00]</p><p>LINDSTAEDT: And so, it just seemed very vicious. And it didn't go over well when Swalwell, in a previous debate, did something similar, talking about Joe Biden's age.</p><p>So I think these types of attacks against the front-runner are going to backfire. They're better off attacking Trump, trying to remain united and trying to distinguish themselves amongst the other candidates as to why you should vote for him, not why you shouldn't vote for Joe Biden.</p><p>HOWELL: Natasha Lindstaedt giving us perspective, thank you.</p><p>The next Democratic debate, keep in mind, October 15th in the state of Ohio with a second night possible if candidates can qualify for that debate.

It says the fires caused by the drones at the Aramco oil facilities have been put out.</p><p>Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying they deployed 10 drones. The statement was reportedly made by the group's spokesperson.</p><p>In Israel, the final polls are out before Tuesday's general election and they show a race that is too tight to call. Take a look at these numbers, they're dramatically close. It leaves neither the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor his opposition Benny Gantz with a clear path to form a coalition.</p><p>Tuesday's vote is a repeat of the April election, when both parties tied at 35 seats each. As the general election gets closer, Mr. Netanyahu is coming under increased scrutiny for charges of corruption. Our Oren Liebermann explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They are the dark clouds hanging over Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political and personal life.</p><p>[05:20:00]</p><p>LIEBERMANN (voice-over): Multiple accusations of corruption stemming from three separate investigations.</p><p>The 69-year old has denied the charges and on the campaign trail, he rarely discusses them. But he's facing allegations he took gifts from overseas businessman and prosecutors say he tried to get a newspaper mogul to give him more favorable coverage.</p><p>He also faces potential bribery charges. Prosecutors say he advanced regulatory benefits worth $300 million to help his friend, a wealthy businessman, also for favorable media coverage.</p><p>Netanyahu's troubles have led to a tight race.</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Right wing voters, right now, we are losing the election.</p><p>LIEBERMANN: In the final polls before election night, all five polls show a race too close to call and neither Netanyahu nor his opponent, former Israeli military chief of staff, Benny Gantz, has a clear path to victory. The coalition's scandals go beyond Netanyahu. Interior Minister Arye Dery served two years in prison the early 2000s after he was convicted of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. He returned to politics and is once interior minister and once again under investigation for similar charges.</p><p>And there's Deputy health minister Yaakov Litzman. Police say they have enough evidence to indict him on fraud and breach of trust for illegally helping a sexual predator avoid extradition.</p><p>Coalition chair David Bitan and welfare minister Haim Katz both resigned their positions following corruption investigations. Katz has already been indicted on charges of fraud and breach of trust.</p><p>All of these politicians insist they're innocent and they all may get their day in court to prove it. Until then, they're just hoping to win at the ballot box.</p><p>LIEBERMANN: One of the questions surrounding Netanyahu is, does he want to legislate immunity for himself from prosecution?</p><p>You can see he is not the only politician who may have that interest in mind. It is also important to note that in the opposition, someone was just released from two years in prison. He was accused of illegally sneaking cellphones to security prisoners -- Oren Liebermann, CNN, Jerusalem.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: Oren Liebermann now live in Jerusalem, with our Sam Kiley.</p><p>Picking up on Oren's reporting, Sam, certainly, Benjamin Netanyahu under a great deal of pressure. Not just about an election, though.</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: No, not just about an election. If he manages to win with his Likud Party, perhaps neck and neck, perhaps one seat ahead of the rival, Benny Gantz, then perhaps he might be able to introduce an immunity law through the Israeli Knesset.</p><p>And as Oren was observing there are other Knesset members that would like to extend immunity laws to members of the legislature.</p><p>But equally, that is by no means guaranteed. Looking at the polls, they show the third largest party polling is likely to be the Joint List, the predominantly Arab party with about 12 seats, which, obviously, they're very unlikely indeed to join any coalition involving the Likud.</p><p>So far, Blue and White have been lukewarm to say the least at the suggestion of any preelection pact. And then you have Avigdor Lieberman, former member of the Likud, former ally politically of Netanyahu, likely to poll around nine votes; he's avidly, avidly secularist.</p><p>That's problem for Likud trying to get into bed with secularist parties and the religious on the right.</p><p>HOWELL: This is complicated. Sam Kiley, we'll keep in touch with you and see how this plays out in the week ahead. Thank you.</p><p>It is the 15th straight weekend that we've seen demonstrations in Hong Kong. There were some scuffles between supporters of Mainland China and pro democracy protesters. This time, though, Hong Kong authorities denied requests for permits to hold weekend demonstrations. We'll continue to follow the story for you, of course.</p><p>In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, who had a great deal of influence and power over the African continent for decades, is being remembered at a memorial service in Zimbabwe's capital.</p><p>This man who was loved by many, hated by many as well, he is being remembered this hour. You see so many people who have come together in the nation's capital. And dignitaries from across Africa around the world are there, recalling the man regarded as the founder of Zimbabwe.</p><p>The funeral planned for Sunday has been postponed, though. For more on that, let's go to our own Farai Sevenzo, a native of Zimbabwe.</p><p>Tell us, why the delay there?</p><p>FARAI SEVENZO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, there are many complications, George. First of all, remember, this is a man who was ousted from power two years ago in an apparent coup back in November 2017.</p><p>[05:25:00]</p><p>SEVENZO: And the family with regards to the current government of Emmerson Mnangagwa, about where his remains should be buried, some say he should be buried in his village or at the national shrine where many of those who fought the Liberation War are now laid to rest, including Mr. Mugabe's contemporary at the time.</p><p>These differences have faded into the background in remembrance of the man, he's a complicated man, George. I must say that. He gave Zimbabwe its independence and at the same time, ruled with such an iron fist.</p><p>He brooked no opposition and it was only -- Zimbabwe was made independent in 1980. It was only until 2000 that it saw the first real opposition to the late Morgan Tsvangirai's movement.</p><p>So right now, everybody is commemorating that legacy of this complicated man. And acknowledging, that without him, many of the Southern African states including South Africa and Namibia, will not be free, because he was such a belligerent opponent to colonialism and apartheid.</p><p>But his legacy, as you've already said, was a complicated one.</p><p>HOWELL: While you were speaking, we saw the sign that was up there, it said, \"Rest in peace, Gushungo,\" referring to Mugabe's plan.

Essentially the judge saying this wasn't about college reputations being tarnished or test-taking being compromised.</p><p>This was about kids, privileged kids, having a leg up on other college applicants. That's partly why she handed down the punishment she did.</p><p>GINGRAS (voice-over): Actress Felicity Huffman sentenced to 14 days in federal prison, ordered to pay a $30,000 fine and serve 250 hours of community service.</p><p>Huffman telling the court, \"At the end of the day, I had a choice to make.

The defendant did not.\"</p><p>Prior to today's sentencing, Huffman wrote a letter, explaining how she legitimately worked with the scheme's ringleader, Rick Singer, for a year before she agreed to cheat.</p><p>Huffman allowing Singer to hire a proctor who changed the answers on her oldest daughter's SAT, boosting her score. She said she considered using the services for her youngest daughter but backed out.</p><p>Huffman explaining in the letter how her poor decision damaged her relationship with her daughter.</p><p>\"When my daughter looked at me and asked, with tears streaming down her face, 'Why didn't you believe in me?'</p><p>\"I had no adequate answer for her.

In the late 1870s, when these engine houses were originally built, Cornwall was the world's biggest producer of tin, home to 2,000 mines dotted across its countryside.</p><p>The last of those, South Crofty, closed its doors two decades ago after tin prices plunged and developing economies cornered the market. But now it could be the first to reopen, creating 275 jobs.</p><p>And that journey towards Cornwall's mining revival begins here, around 300 meters below the surface.</p><p>Getting the mine up and running in two years won't be easy. Hundreds of miles of tunnels need to be surveyed and drained. But with demand for smart devices on the rise, South Crofty's new Canadian owners think that they can make Cornish tin profitable once more.</p><p>RICHARD WILLIAMS, STRONGBOW EXPLORATION: Tin has been aptly described today as the glue in the high-tech world. Renewable energy, electric vehicles, power generation, power storage, 5G, all of these things require tin.</p><p>What better way to avoid the concept that you're sourcing tin from potentially areas of conflict or areas where you have child exploitation than to find it here in Cornwall?</p><p>DOS SANTOS: South Crofty could become one of the only tin mines in Europe and North America, giving technology companies an opportunity to clean up supply chains, Brexit notwithstanding.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, you know, in our mines, this is Brexit-proof. One of the points that we put forward to Cornwall Council and the U.K. government in particular is that you can't move a tin deposit.</p><p>DOS SANTOS: Cornish tin's future also lies in its past. The region was once the Wild West of England as seen here in the BBC drama, \"Poldark,\" attracting prospectors from all over the country. They've left their mark on the landscape to the delight of the 4.5 visitors who flock to Cornwall each year.</p><p>Mark Wills' family have been tin miners for four generations. MARK WILLS, BLUE HILLS TIN: My father was the last one of us to actually work underground. There's no longer profit in selling it wholesale. So we, grant you (ph), renovated some old machinery onsite and started producing tin ourselves.</p><p>Whether people were just interested in the architecture of the buildings or the physical process that the mineral has to go through to get there, it seems to capture different people.</p><p>DOS SANTOS (voice-over): Even if mining doesn't return to Cornwall on its previous scale, this ancient metal is already helping this western province of the British Isles to shine again -- Nina dos Santos, CNN, Cornwall, England.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Well, it was a hit show in the United States that you could say had its friends around the world. We look back at the show \"Friends\" on the 25th anniversary of this popular sitcom.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[05:50:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT LEBLANC, ACTOR, \"JOEY TRIBBIANI\": Look, turning 30 is not that big a deal.</p><p>DAVID SCHWIMMER, ACTOR, \" ROSS GELLER\": Oh, really, is that how you felt when you turned 30?</p><p>TRIBBIANI: Why God, why?</p><p>We had a deal. Let the others grow old, not me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL: The cast of the U.S. sitcom \"Friends\" is celebrating a happy anniversary, 25 years of a show that changed television, some say, and it still has brands cashing in on that show's popularity.</p><p>Now thanks to video streaming, another generation is discovering that famous couch at Central Perk, those six friends are forever remembered. Our Clare Sebastian has this report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: From product placement...</p><p>COURTENEY COX, ACTOR, \"MONICA GELLER\": This Wonder Broom is amazing. MATTHEW PERRY, ACTOR, \"CHANDLER BING\": Hey.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: -- to memorabilia and even haircuts, \"Friends\" has always been a brand that sells.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on-camera): And 25 years on, that hasn't changed. It still not enough of viewers just to watch the show. They want to live in the world of Monica, Chandler, Ross, Rachel and Phoebe and Joey.</p><p>And that means eating their food, sitting on their couch and, of course, drinking their coffee.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): And businesses are taking advantage. Coffee chain Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf jumps to the chance of a tie-up for the anniversary, launching a special edition range of coffee, specialty drinks and memorabilia.</p><p>DARRIN KELLARIS, VP MARKETING, COFFEE BEAN AND TEA LEAF: Our \"Friends\" themed coffee mugs, we pre-released and actually sold out in about three hours.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: They also hosted two pop-up Central Perk events in Los Angeles in August.</p><p>KELLARIS: Those two locations we saw significance spikes in foot traffic. But more importantly as a business, it really bolstered system-wide sales.</p><p>JENNIFER ANISTON, ACTOR, \"RACHEL GREEN\": Isn't it cool? It's an apothecary table.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Pottery Barn also brought back the famous apothecary table, which, despite its thousand-dollar price tag, is a top seller in its department, the company says. Must be the antique properties.</p><p>[05:55:00]</p><p>LISA KUDROW, ACTOR, \"PHOEBE BUFFAY\": You can almost smell the opium.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Even Lego is getting in on the action with the $60 replica of Central Perk. Lego says it's one of its fastest selling sets ever.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on-camera): Now, of course, none of these promotions would work nearly as well if Friends haven't experienced the revival in the age of streaming. Last year, it was Netflix's second most watched show.</p><p>And the company reportedly paid around $100 million to keep the rights to the show for one more year, before it goes on a break moving to one of media's HBO Max streaming service in 2020.</p><p>DAN IVES, EQUITY ANALYST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES: It's an iconic show and, ultimately, it's really one of the crown jewels of streaming. Everything's changed now with HBO coming in a major shot across to battle Netflix, taking \"Friends.\"</p><p>And I ultimately believe 2 percent to 3 percent of Netflix viewers watch it just because of \"Friends.\"</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So for those who say friends and the money don't mix...</p><p>\"PHOEBE\": What's more important, your friends or money?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Friends.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Money.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: -- this 25-year-old sitcom still gets the last laugh.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: I know Clare really liked that story. On her Instagram she said, \"Life made, sitting there on that couch.\"</p><p>Keeping in mind \"Friends\" is owned by Warner Brothers TV, which is part of CNN's parent company, Warner Media.</p><p>Of course, watch our CNN special report \"Friends Forever: 25 Years of Laughter,\" airing at 10:00 in the morning in Hong Kong right here on CNN.</p><p>We thank you for watching this hour of the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm George Howell at the CNN Center in Atlanta. For our viewers in the United States, \"NEW DAY\" is next. For the viewers around the world \"ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT\" is next. Thanks for watching.</p><p>[06:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019091422CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X26-VV51-DXH2-6358-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6441\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 14, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Storms</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Guns</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Middle East</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Education</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Television and Radio</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Treaties and Agreements</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bahamas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tropical Storm Humberto</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

That could include digging into past tech mergers, such as Facebook Inc.'s 2014 acquisition of encrypted messaging service WhatsApp, or investigating whether Amazon.com Inc. unfairly competes with third-party sellers on its Marketplace.</p><p>The investigation is expected to last 18 months and could include demands for tech executives to testify, as well as subpoenaing internal company records, said David Cicilline, the Democratic Congressman from Rhode Island who chairs the House judiciary's subcommittee on antitrust, commercial and administrative Law.</p><p>At the hearings Tuesday, news publishers testified that tech behemoths Google and Facebook are cannibalizing the digital advertising revenues of media outlets that depend on internet platforms to reach audiences.</p><p>Media executives threw their support behind a proposed committee bill that would give publishers an exemption from antitrust laws prohibiting price collusion, allowing them to band together and press tech firms for more favourable ad revenue-sharing agreements.</p><p>\"No publisher on its own can stand up to the tech giants,\" said David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, a trade association. The alliance released a study last week estimating that Google earned US$4.7-billion in revenues last year by aggregating news content without paying publishers.</p><p>White House officials are also turning their attention to Big Tech. Earlier this month, several media outlets reported that the Department of Justice would be responsible for any antitrust investigation into Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, while the Federal Trade Commission, a federal consumer watchdog, would investigate Amazon and Facebook. The FTC also unveiled a task force this year to examine whether past tech mergers and acquisitions harm competition.</p><p>Antitrust is the latest target of the growing discontentment with Silicon Valley on both sides of the political aisle in the U.S. Congress. Lawmakers have been holding regular hearings into the privacy and content moderation policies of tech firms since revelations more than a year ago that a political consulting firm had improperly accessed the personal information of millions of Facebook users.</p><p>\"It does seem like the dam has broken all at once,\" Nicole Perrin, principal analyst with market research firm eMarketer said in an online commentary.</p><p>The new investigations under way mark a significant shift in the way that U.S. regulators approach antitrust cases, which have traditionally focused on whether acquisitions or business practices harmed consumers through higher prices. That is a difficult argument to make against tech companies, who typically offer their services for free or at low cost.</p><p>Instead, regulators have signalled they intend to broaden their probes to explore non-financial issues, such as whether tech firms have too much power over consumer data, or whether companies harm competition by controlling access to their platform in ways that favour their own products and services.</p><p>\"Where competition is harmed, consumers and markets lose with higher prices, lower quality, lower rate of innovation, less free speech and even lower privacy protections,\" Makan Delrahim, the top U.S. Justice official in charge of antitrust told a conference in Tel Aviv last week. \"Protecting competition means protecting all of those dimensions of competition.\"</p><p>Tech companies aren't sitting quietly amid the escalating scrutiny from Washington. Executives have been loudly pressing their case in recent weeks for why they their size and global reach benefits the U.S. economy.</p><p>\"I don't think anybody reasonable is going come to the conclusion that Apple's a monopoly,\" Tim Cook, the smartphone-maker's chief executive told CBS earlier this month.</p><p>Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos used his annual shareholder letter to point out that independent sellers now make up 58 per cent of the company's sales, up from 3 per cent when Amazon started in 1997. \"Third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt. Badly,\" he wrote.</p><p>Increasingly, tech leaders argue that aggressive antitrust actions could hobble their ability to develop cutting-edge innovations, creating a risk that the U.S. could lose out to China in areas U.S. President Donald Trump has said are a priority, such as 5G wireless technology. \"[Chinese] companies are not going to be broken up,\" Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg told CNBC in May.</p><p>Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai told CNN Friday that new antitrust regulations could undermine U.S. national security by threatening U.S. leadership in areas such as artificial intelligence. \"I worry that if you regulate for the sake of regulating it, it has a lot of unintended consequences,\" he said.</p><p>Your time is valuable.

'The investigation of Clearview by privacy protection authorities for Canada, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec remains open,' the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada said in a statement[1]. The probe was opened in February, following reports that Clearview was collecting personal information without consent. </p><p>The authorities still plan to issue findings from the investigation. [Read:Clearview AI can be fun \u2014 if you're dirty, stinking rich[2]] The exit is a big blow to the New York-based startup. Outside of the US, Clearview's biggest market had been Canada. More than 30 law enforcement agencies in the country had used the software, including the Toronto Police Service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). According to Canada's privacy watchdog, the RCMP had been its last remaining client in the country. The suspension of that contract brings Clearview's Canadian adventure to an end \u2014 at least for now.Clearview on the way out?Amid the protests against police brutality and racism triggered by the killing of George Floyd, tech giants have publicly stepped back from facial recognition. Not good old Clearview AI though. The startup still wants to sell its app to law enforcement agencies \u2014 all for the good of humanity, of course. 'While Amazon, Google, and IBM have decided to exit the marketplace, Clearview AI believes in the mission of responsibly used facial recognition to protect children, victims of financial fraud, and other crimes that afflict our communities,' CEOHoan Ton-That said last month. Indeed, Big Tech's departure from the market left a gaping facial recognition hole that Clearview could have filled. But regulators are starting to shove the company out before it can squeeze any further in. In Canada, it looks like Clearview chose to jump before it was pushed.

Is it any surprise that sentiment toward the tech industry giants is turning sour? The consequences of such a readjustment, however, may be dire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Related:  Trump lashes out at Amazon and sends stocks tumbling</p><p>The past two weeks have been difficult for the tech sector by every measure. Tech stocks have largely driven the year's stock market decline, the largest quarterly drop since 2015.</p><p>Facebook saw more than $50bn shaved off its value after the Observer revealed that Cambridge Analytica had harvested millions of people's user data for political profiling. Now users are deleting accounts, and regulators may seek to limit how the company monetizes data, threatening Facebook's business model.</p><p>On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed it was investigating the company's data practices. Additionally, Facebook said it would send a top executive to London to appear in front of UK lawmakers, but it would not send the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, who is increasingly seen as isolated and aloof.</p><p>Shares of Facebook have declined more than 17% from the close on Friday 16 March to the close on Thursday before the Easter break.</p><p>Amazon, meanwhile, long the target of President Trump's ire, saw more than $30bn, or 5%, shaved off its $693bn market capitalization after it was reported that the president was \"obsessed\" with the company and that he \"wondered aloud if there may be any way to go after Amazon with antitrust or competition law\".</p><p>Shares of Apple, and Google's parent company Alphabet, are also down, dropping on concerns that tech firms now face tighter regulation across the board.</p><p>For Apple, there's an additional concern that following poor sales of its $1,000 iPhone X. For Google, there's the prospect not only of tighter regulation on how it sells user date to advertisers, but also the fear of losing an important Android software patent case with the Oracle.</p><p>Big tech's critics may be forgiven a moment of schadenfreude. But for shareholders and pension plans, the tarnishing of tech could have serious consequences.</p><p>Apple, Amazon and Alphabet make up 10% of the S&amp;P 500 with a combined market capitalization market cap of $2.3tn. Add Microsoft and Facebook, with a combined market value of $1.1tn, and the big five make up 15% of the index.</p><p>Overall, technology makes up 25% of the S&amp;P. If tech pops, the thinking goes, so pops the market.</p><p>\"We're one week into a sell-off after a multi-year run-up,\" says Eric Kuby of North Star Investment Management. \"The big picture is that over the past five years a group of mega cap tech stocks like Nvidia, Netflix, Facebook have gone up anywhere from 260% to 1,800%.\"</p><p>Until recently, investors have been betting on years of unfettered growth. In a tighter, more regulated environment that bet may not look so good.</p><p>\"Most growth investors were not looking at companies' cash flow for the basis of the stock price. They were looking at momentum, but if you look at Facebook it's still trading at 30 times trailing earnings. These stocks have been largely detached from any earnings analysis so there's room for more downside pain,\" said Kuby.</p><p>Daniel Ives at GBH Insights wrote in an investors' letter that the \"last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see ... was news that Trump is targeting Bezos and Amazon over the coming months\".</p><p>The momentum of that collision seemed to build on Thursday after Trump amplified his anti-Amazon comments, alleging it shortchanges taxpayers. Trump also attacked its use of the US Postal Service and its impact on traditional retailers.</p><p>\"I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the election,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state &amp; local governments, use our postal system as their delivery boy (causing tremendous loss to the US), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!\"</p><p>The president's commentary was followed by an ominous tweet from his campaign manager, Brad Pascale.</p><p>There's significant chance that their business are going to be affected</p><p>  Eric Kuby, analyst    </p><p>\"Do not forget to mention that Amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that Facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The Washington Post. Hmm ...\"</p><p>Kevin Hassett, a White House adviser, later told Fox Business News: \"The general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom-and-pop stores.\"</p><p>For a president who frequently touts stock market highs as a totem of his success as head of the executive branch, the attack on tech appears counterproductive. \"Any political question is very confusing because you can't tell what's the issue of the day and what's a real issue. The Facebook political issue is clearly one they're going to have to work their way through. Amazon is harder to handicap,\" says Northstar's Kuby.</p><p>For now, analysts seem unfazed. On Thursday, investors seemed to shrug off Trump's attack. Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley said: \"We do not think attacking Amazon will be popular.\"</p><p>But if companies like Amazon and Facebook - data companies at their core - are forced to change the way they do business, earnings estimates will have to drop and stock markets will go with them, says Kuby.</p><p>\"Their earnings have only ever gone one way, which is up. Once they start coming down, the multiples come down, and we're going to see even bigger pressures on the stock. There's significant chance that their business are going to be affected.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-42787601</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0T-PRK1-JCJY-G4V3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"940\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Originally published at ValueWalk[1].Second-quarter gross domestic product fell 33% (on an annualized basis) according to the Commerce Department. It took years for the United States to claw its way out of the last economic recession[2] in 2008. With key second-quarter data points coming in, what do earnings at financial and tech companies suggest about the future economic landscape?</p><p>   Q2 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[3]The Fallout Of The Coronavirus On Second-Quarter EarningsLet's first take a look at the fallout of the coronavirus[4] issue and its economic impact at US financial companies. Lenders set aside significant amounts for credit loss provisions in the second quarter (April, May and June). These credit loss provisions are put away in the expectation that more people and corporations will go delinquent on payments in the coming months and years. JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, as major consumer/commercial lenders, each set aside billions of dollars. JP Morgan is the lending powerhouse in the US when measured by assets[5]. It wrote off $4.6 billion in the second quarter to shore up its balance sheet against future losses. Consequently, second-quarter earnings per share were down 51%. Trading and investment banking activities actually increased during recent volatility. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs benefitted. Goldman's total revenues were up from to $12.3 billion from $8.4 billion in the second quarter. Goldman's market making revenues rose to $5.8 billion from $2.4 billion last year. Investment banking revenues went up to $2.7 billion from $1.7 billion. (Investment banking revenues increased as Goldman helped other companies shore up their balance sheet with equity or debt issuances, whereas merger and acquisition activity was weak in the second quarter.) This revenue increase at Goldman Sachs was partially offset by a $1.6 billion provision for future credit losses[6]. All in all, earnings per share at Goldman were up somewhat (8%) from last year's second quarter. (Another investment bank Morgan Stanley saw similar benefits from investment banking and trading, and it took less of a provision for credit losses, so its earnings increased a whopping 59%!) Half of the financial companies in our finance index have not regained the stock price they saw before the Great Recession of 2008 (including Bank of America[7], Morgan Stanley and Citi). Since that time, they have dealt with more regulations. Also, financial companies tend to grow slower than tech companies, who have been the growth stars since the 2008 recession.Tech Companies See Continued Earnings GrowthFollowing this trend, most tech companies saw continued earnings growth in a time when many people stayed home. Amazon was the standout, with earnings almost doubling as people bought more online. Revenues may increase still, looking to the third quarter, but operating income will likely be lower as Amazon books coronavirus related costs - this is according to Amazon's own guidance. Second-quarter earnings at Apple and Facebook were also strong. Apple was held up by strong product sales, so its earnings were up 18%. Facebook continued to see user and advertising revenue growth. Earnings roughly doubled at Facebook. One rough patch was Google's drop in revenues, due to weakened advertising - the first quarterly decline in ad revenues in its 22-year history. This led to a decrease in Google earnings of 29%, making Google the worst performer in our 'Big Tech' index today. The morning after the earnings release, its stock[8] price was down 4%. Overall, the advertising[9] industry has been weak. Ad agencies like Publicis, Omnicom and IPG all had lower earnings which reflected a weak environment. One digital media company, Vice, is laying off 155 employees it was reported in May. The New York Times laid off 68 people in June. The weakening environment predates the coronavirus. In 2019, the New York Times already saw a huge decline in full-year digital display ad revenues (-6%). Taken together, there are some disconcerting signs in second-quarter earnings at financial and tech companies. One possibility for the future is that while big revenues related to balance sheet strengthening at investment banks may not recur in coming quarters, loan delinquencies may well increase across all banks. Furthermore, the weak digital advertising environment is already hurting Google and may spread to Facebook at some point and other parts of the economy.

It took years for the United States to claw its way out of the last economic recession[1] in 2008. With key second-quarter data points coming in, what do earnings at financial and tech companies suggest about the future economic landscape?

Q2 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2]The Fallout Of The Coronavirus On Second-Quarter EarningsLet's first take a look at the fallout of the coronavirus[3] issue and its economic impact at US financial companies. Lenders set aside significant amounts for credit loss provisions in the second quarter (April, May and June). These credit loss provisions are put away in the expectation that more people and corporations will go delinquent on payments in the coming months and years. ValueWalk's Raul Panganiban interviews Gautam Baid, CFA, portfolio manager at an SEC-registered investment advisor based in Salt Lake City, Utah. In this part, Gautam discusses 'margin of safety', the three most important words in investing, the importance of capital preservation, the behavioural biases that we face, Munger's investing principles and the education of a value Read More[4]  JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, as major consumer/commercial lenders, each set aside billions of dollars. JP Morgan is the lending powerhouse in the US when measured by assets[5]. It wrote off $4.6 billion in the second quarter to shore up its balance sheet against future losses. Consequently, second-quarter earnings per share were down 51%. Trading and investment banking activities actually increased during recent volatility. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs benefitted. Goldman's total revenues were up from to $12.3 billion from $8.4 billion in the second quarter. Goldman's market making revenues rose to $5.8 billion from $2.4 billion last year. Investment banking revenues went up to $2.7 billion from $1.7 billion. (Investment banking revenues increased as Goldman helped other companies shore up their balance sheet with equity or debt issuances, whereas merger and acquisition activity was weak in the second quarter.) This revenue increase at Goldman Sachs was partially offset by a $1.6 billion provision for future credit losses[6]. All in all, earnings per share at Goldman were up somewhat (8%) from last year's second quarter. (Another investment bank Morgan Stanley saw similar benefits from investment banking and trading, and it took less of a provision for credit losses, so its earnings increased a whopping 59%!) Half of the financial companies in our finance index have not regained the stock price they saw before the Great Recession of 2008 (including Bank of America[7], Morgan Stanley and Citi). Since that time, they have dealt with more regulations. Also, financial companies tend to grow slower than tech companies, who have been the growth stars since the 2008 recession.Tech Companies See Continued Earnings GrowthFollowing this trend, most tech companies saw continued earnings growth in a time when many people stayed home. Amazon was the standout, with earnings almost doubling as people bought more online. Revenues may increase still, looking to the third quarter, but operating income will likely be lower as Amazon books coronavirus related costs - this is according to Amazon's own guidance. Second-quarter earnings at Apple and Facebook were also strong. Apple was held up by strong product sales, so its earnings were up 18%. Facebook continued to see user and advertising revenue growth. Earnings roughly doubled at Facebook. One rough patch was Google's drop in revenues, due to weakened advertising - the first quarterly decline in ad revenues in its 22-year history. This led to a decrease in Google earnings of 29%, making Google the worst performer in our 'Big Tech' index today. The morning after the earnings release, its stock[8] price was down 4%. Overall, the advertising[9] industry has been weak. Ad agencies like Publicis, Omnicom and IPG all had lower earnings which reflected a weak environment. One digital media company, Vice, is laying off 155 employees it was reported in May. The New York Times laid off 68 people in June. The weakening environment predates the coronavirus. In 2019, the New York Times already saw a huge decline in full-year digital display ad revenues (-6%). Taken together, there are some disconcerting signs in second-quarter earnings at financial and tech companies. One possibility for the future is that while big revenues related to balance sheet strengthening at investment banks may not recur in coming quarters, loan delinquencies may well increase across all banks. Furthermore, the weak digital advertising environment is already hurting Google and may spread to Facebook at some point and other parts of the economy.

Now, four police officers have been fired. We'll have more on tomorrow night show. But let not your heart be troubled. Because Laura Ingraham is standing-by. Laura, Happy Monday -- Happy Tuesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Happy Tuesday, although those are disturbing images, Sean. And we'll see what else develops there, but people are on edge across the country. But there's a lot of room, there's a lot of room at the same time, we have challenges. A lot of room for real optimism which I'm going to hit on tonight despite the fact--</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HANNITY: That's awesome. You know what, Florida, Georgia, Texas, great stories. You've got a lot of good stories to tell.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">INGRAHAM: Absolutely, Sean. Great show tonight as always.</p><p>HANNITY: Have a good show.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Now despite declining COVID numbers, why are some governors still subjecting their citizens to these sustained absurd lockdowns. We're going to speak to a couple of folks who are suffering under the thumb of power mad leaders. Also, tonight in the states where lockdowns are loosening, Democrats are working overtime to expand mail in voting. Now why is that?</p><p>We're going to show you also why the President's warning about potential fraud is right on target. And Raymond Arroyo now it's Tuesday, so it's a little unusual, but he's here on the Trump-Biden mask showdown. And what Memorial Day could tell us about the campaign. But first, those who bet against America. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.</p><p>We know who they are. They short the market, they short the dollar and when things look unstable the situation gets a little rocky here at home, they look for the exits. Maybe they move their money or their businesses offshore because they think America has seen her best days.</p><p>But truly smart people including smart Democrats know that betting against America has always been a losing proposition. Even during our darkest hours, the Civil War, the Great Depression.</p><p>At a recent Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett who is no fan of Donald Trump discussed America's past and future trials.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARREN BUFFET, CEO, BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY: You have this testing period. And people really lost faith to some degree, they just didn't see the potential of what America could do. And we found that nothing can stop America when you get right down to it. And it may have been tested again and the Great Depression and it may be tested now to some degree. In the end, the answer is never bet against America</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: And it shouldn't surprise you, any of you that Warren Buffett is a hell of a lot smarter than Left-wing economists who've been predicting doomsday scenarios for the U.S. economy since COVID.</p><p>Well today, the Dow jumped 500 points almost closing above 25,000. Consumer confidence rising. Investors across the board are seeing light at the end of the tunnel and Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Utah, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, all run by pretty conservative governors. Well, you see their life is finally getting back to normal.</p><p>Even California's locked down lover Gavin Newsom. He's under pressure from lawsuits from small business owners and people in the faith community. And he has had to ease up also. Los Angeles County officials initially suggested the lockdown could last through the summer. But after massive backlash across the board. LA County is aiming to now reopen on July 4th. And churches are opening at 25 percent capacity starting tomorrow.</p><p>And as for those blue state governors that just won't accept yes for an answer. Well, don't believe for a second their fraudulent justifications that it's all for your own safety. You know they always say that when they're taking away your constitutional rights.</p><p>But it's becoming more obvious by the day that these power-hungry governors and radical mayors are endangering their states futures and we'll eventually see their states left behind.</p><p>Now it's horrific enough that Andrew Cuomo ended up creating death traps in New York's elderly facilities. But now his slow roll to reopen is doing untold damage to his state going forward.</p><p>The Washington Post wrote this piece over the weekend, they ran it about how the COVID shutdown has been the straw that broke the camel's back for New York, more residents now are reporting being so fed up with life in the Big Apple that they're relocating to places where they can actually have a decent standard of living, and Cuomo wants taxpayers in Florida and Texas and beyond to bail them out.</p><p>None of these lockdown liberals should get a penny more and bailout money so long as they continue this lockdown stuff, because the longer they stay locked down and they have all these other onerous and unnecessary restrictions in place, the more difficult, the more expensive. And I'd say the more dangerous it becomes for their states, the longer any kind of recovery will be.</p><p>Given that we now know that the virus is a lot less deadly than originally thought and that it's most dangerous to the confined elderly, there's no good reason to keep any part of the country completely closed. Unless that is, you don't want America to recover, at least while Trump is President.</p><p>An article in Politico, you may have heard of it, it reported over the weekend that Democrats are privately freaking out. Yes, you heard that right. That the American economy will be in a massive recovery mode. Come the fall. Check this out.</p><p>This is my big worry, said a former Obama White House official who still close to the former president. Asked about the level of concern among top party officials, he said it's high, high, high.</p><p>Now, how do you describe this except to say that Democrats see their only serious path to victory hinging on your despair? Deep down, it seems like they're rooting against life getting better for American families.</p><p>They're rooting for Americans to remain unemployed. Can you believe that, anyone? Or four schools to stay closed? Now, long after we flatten the curve, they issue these grim warnings of a second wave, a third wave that could come next month, that could come in September. It could be worse. More people dead. I mean. Or the super spreader phenomenon, or you really have to have 18 feet social distancing or 30 feet or sneeze spreads 40 feet.</p><p>I mean, every minute of every day they have to push the panic button to scare you back into your homes. They shame people who don't bow down to their new rules. But in the end, most of these people seeking to control your behavior don't apply the rules to themselves. They never do, do they? We'll share the biggest offenders with you in just a moment.</p><p>Now, what worries these hypocrites is not the dire situation they created in their own states. They're worried about the possibility of your state's economic recovery. Trump could be poised to benefit from the dramatic numbers produced during the partial rebound phrase that is likely to coincide with the four months before November. That realization has many Democrats spooked. Now, let that sink in for a moment.</p><p>Where you and I are spooked about the idea of living like masked zombies, waiting for government checks for this foreseeable future, the Democrats are spooked by the idea that things are getting better.</p><p>In March, Biden's campaign, Pelosi, Schumer, the whole gang were betting that the virus would cripple the economy right through the election. The only way that that happens now, though, is if enough blue state governors make life unlivable for the 99.99 percent of Americans who survived this virus. That's a pathetic anti-science sicko campaign strategy.</p><p>But let them make that bet. America will not allow this crisis to be get a waste. And that's THE ANGLE.</p><p>Now, while some blue state governors have heeded President Trump's call to reopen places of worship, not all of them have. New Jersey is letting beaches; bicycle stores and some retail open up. The 76ers will soon start practicing again. But Governor Murphy is keeping churches still under lock and key. He hasn't even set a date to reopen houses of worship, and he wants to subject them to an arbitrary 10-person limit. It's for those reasons that my next guest is suing to have the governor's orders overturned.</p><p>Joining me now is Pastor Bobby Bledsoe, founder of the Dwelling Place Network, which is based in New Jersey. Pastor, thanks for joining us tonight. Your governor is letting 500 people walk into a grocery store but doesn't trust you and other religious leaders from other faiths as well to keep churches, mosques, or temples safe. What's going on?</p><p>PASTOR BOBBY BLEDSOE, FOUNDER, THE DWELLING PLACE NETWORK: Laura, thank you for having me on tonight. Yes, it's a shame. Who would ever think in the 21st century, convicts would be being released and pastors would face scrutiny? I told my congregation the other day, we had outside parking lot. How many of you thought that today on your way to church you may get arrested? It's a shame.</p><p>The religious freedom that our country was founded on is one of the most essential basic human rights that we have here in America. And we have to stand up. And that's why we decided to take action against our government.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Pastor, the President said last Friday that he wants churches to open up. They need to open up. Do you want more from the federal government in states like New Jersey, where these onerous restrictions still in place or outright still shut down churches? Should the feds step in here? I know you're suing, but do you need federal help?</p><p>BLEDSOE: I hope the Attorney General do something, and I believe he will. I think they made their statement. But I have to now say, the responsibility is now on my fellow pastors. I have been saying this since day one. We have to stay open. The churches are essential to the well-being, the spirit, the psyche of people in our communities.</p><p>We ministered to people, you know when a church, the psyche of a church. The church, when you think about it, I believe that the hope of the world. When the doors of the church are closed, who do people begin to look for, for help? The government, maybe that's what they want. But I still believe the pastors now have to take a stance and you have to count the cost. It may cost you something, but you have to open.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, think about the great sacrifices of religious leaders around the world and parishioners around the world of all faiths. I mean, they're worried in Syria and other parts of world getting killed on the way to church and they still make it to church and mass and temple and so forth. Pastor, this is what Governor Murphy said about churches defying his lockdown orders. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL MURPHY, GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY: Well, there'll be repercussions in any case where someone willfully violates our executive orders. The overwhelming amount of folks who lead institutions of faith, they understand this. They're chomping at the bit. We get that. But they also understand the risks associated with it. And we've got to make sure we're all in this together and we do this the right way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Pastor, will you reopen despite the threat from Governor Murphy?</p><p>BLEDSOE: Well, what I can say is this, the last two Sundays, we'd had parking lot church and it was OK, but we need to meet in person. We need to meet in person. And all I can say is as for me and our congregation, we have a plan to get together and to worship. And I would call on all pastors in New Jersey to take a stand. Pentecost Sunday is on us here next Sunday. It's when the church was birthed on the day of Pentecost. I'm asking all churches, no matter your denomination, to stand strong and let's be the church of Jesus Christ.</p><p>INGRAHAM: There's not enough jail cells, I don't think for all Christians and people of faith throughout the state of New Jersey. They're not enough. So, thank you, Pastor. Thank you for standing up for your faith and doing it responsibly. Thanks so much.</p><p>BLEDSOE: Thank you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And are these little petty tyrants across the country adhering to the punishing lockdown's they demand of their own citizenry? Take Michigan's Gretchen Witless Whitmer. After telling Michiganders not to flood areas upstate that are reopening, her husband was caught doing just that and worse, demanding a harbormaster release the family boat early for Memorial Day weekend. Liberate the boat. When they refused, he responded. I'm the husband of the governor. Will this make a difference? In other words, saying, do you know who I am? Unreal. So, how did his witless wife respond?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRETCHEN WHITMER, GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN: My husband made a failed attempt at humor last week when checking in with the small business that helps with our boat and dock up north. Knowing it wouldn't make a difference. He jokingly asked if being married to me might move him up in the queue. Obviously, with the motorized boating prohibition in our early days of COVID-19, he thought it might get a laugh.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: That sunk. That attempted justification sunk like the Titanic. Absolute pathetic. As Whitmer's husband seek special treatment, my next guest is risking everything to keep a 60-year-old Michigan barber shop above water.</p><p>Joining me now is Karl Manke, owner of Karl Manke's Barber and Beauty. When he openly defy the governor's lockdown order, the state tried to suspend his license. A judge that struck it down. I love it. Karl, great to see you. The governor just further extended the state shutdown. It's unbelievable. Until June 12th. So, how does it make you feel to see what her own family is doing, meanwhile?</p><p>KARL MANKE, OWNER, KARL MANKE'S BARBER AND BEAUTY: Well, you know, I really - over - in a sense, I think this governor is a little bit immature for this job. This assignment that she's been given is obviously a little bit more than what she's capable of handling.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, what do you make of her husband trotting up north to get his boat released? Meanwhile, you can't be released to cut some hair and give some beauty treatments to people, even though the curve has flattened.</p><p>MANKE: This is pretty typical of people who want to rule rather than govern. You know, oftentimes they'll use these types of tactics where do as I say, not as I do. You know, it's sort of like our mothers at one time. And truthfully, she's not my mother, you know, so I don't really probably listen too much to her. I lived under 14 different administrations, starting with FDR. I was born in 1942. I've never seen anything like this one.</p><p>This one is the most ridiculous. Even back during the 1960s, you know, I remember when the Democrat Party at that time was the party of free speech, no censorship, against an oppressive government, for human rights and civil rights. She had completely turned upside down on this, saying it's become more of a police state than it has anything else.</p><p>I wrote a story. I'm an author also. I wrote a book called Age of Shame. And in that story, it takes place in a Warsaw ghetto in the 1940s. Now, at that particular time, the Jewish people were packed into one square mile by 800.000 in one square mile.</p><p>Now, the younger people knew what was going on. They knew where were these, what the Nazis were up to at that time. The older people feared that if the younger people wouldn't behave themselves, that the government, the German government would punish them. So, they would turn in their younger people and willingly listen and watch nice movies, they were going to have a wonderful day and wonderful time.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So, Karl, I don't mean to interrupt, we're running tight on time, and I love that story.</p><p>MANKE: OK.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But Karl, you're talking about the encouraging snitching on your fellow citizens and she didn't wear a mask, and he opened up too early and you cut the hair of a protester. How dare you? So, I've never seen that ever in the United States of America. But we have elected officials encouraging that type of neighbor, spying upon neighbor to tell the authorities. I don't think that washes well in the United States of America. Well, I don't think it works.</p><p>MANKE: You know, we need in Michigan right now at this point, you know, we need to stand up. We need to stand up. We need to open up our businesses. And we need to show up. This police state tactic that turns one neighbor on another, one neighbor scolding another one for not being social distance. Another one scolding another one for not wearing a mask. They love this kind of crap.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But Karl when people snitch on her, she gives a bogus excuse. Oh, it was a poor attempted humor. Oh, really? No one's buying that. All these governors, if they don't open the state, should be recalled, should be a recall petition against her and Pritzker and all the rest of them. Karl, it's infuriating to me what you guys are going through. I'm so sorry that you're going through this.</p><p>Keep up, standing up, speak the truth. And thanks for being with us tonight.</p><p>MANKE: Thank you very kindly for the opportunity.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Absolutely. And speaking of these hypocrites, Virginia Governor Ralph Blackface Northam was shaming people on Friday for not following the latest COVID fashion fad.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RALPH NORTHAM, GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA: Wearing a mask could literally save someone else's life. That is becoming clearer every day as we move further into managing this virus over the long-term.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: So, it was stunning to see him the very next day, walking around Virginia Beach, taking selfies with strangers right up against him, unmasked the very activity he just said could actually kill people. OK, so you obviously didn't believe that is what I'm saying earlier. They don't believe what they're saying. They just want to control you. Now, was he embarrassed? Not in the slightest.</p><p>In fact, he's now making what he failed to do mandatory in public for all members of the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NORTHAM: Everyone will need to wear a face cover when you're inside at a public place starting this Friday. I'm taking this step because science increasingly shows us that the virus spreads less easily when everyone is wearing face covering.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: And by the way if you think that's ever going to be rescinded. He wants us masked from here on out. OK, he's been exposed as a hypocrite. All Virginians now have to suffer. But is this even constitutional. Article 1, Section 1 of Virginia's constitution states that this is just - let me read it. Can you back it up, guys? Actually, want to read that. Yes. So, people know what I'm saying. Well, let me just read this really quickly.</p><p>That all men are, by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights of which when they enter into a state of society, they cannot by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity. And that all powers vested in and consequently derived by the people that magistrates are their trustees and servants and at all times amenable to them.</p><p>Joining me now, Harmeet Dhillon, Civil Rights Attorney, Founder of the Center for American Liberty. Do Virginians, Harmeet, have a legal case against the mask mandate and other orders such as those?</p><p>HARMEET DHILLON, FOUNDER, CENTER FOR AMERICAN LIBERTY: Well, thank you, Laura. Clearly, the governor himself is very comfortable, masked or in blackface, but most of us aren't. And so, the question is, can they do it the way that they're planning to do it? So, the way that Virginia is doing it is different than some other states, Laura. They're actually saying that they're going to find the businesses, the restaurants, those places where people go indoors, not the actual citizens of Virginia, like you or I who might walk in. So that's interesting. That becomes an economic regulation that subject to rational basis scrutiny.</p><p>Now, if it is true, as we've been told, I think you've said this on your show before, that maybe the masks don't work, or they can't prove that they work. I mean, Governor Northam didn't think they worked enough this weekend to wear one. Then maybe we can disprove the rational basis that the government is saying applies here. And I think that would be one route to go.</p><p>Other challenges to masks have included that masks are an expressive form of communication. They communicate a message. In this case, I'm scared or, you know, as the Left would say, I care about you. And can the state compel us to carry that message forward? So, I could see a cause of action where an individual going into a store says, I do not wish to convey that message. And there's no rational basis for it. So, I'd like to challenge it. So, I think it's going to raise some interesting issues in that regard, Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, well, if it's all for safety, then everyone should know this is not a temporary thing. These - they will - if they get real power, pass a rulemaking at the Department of Transportation mandating that masks from here on out on public transportation, whether it's a plane or a bus, forever, not just now, because, if that's the argument, then you've got to wear it all the time during flu season, forever masked. So, that's sort of stuff. It's not just during COVID. It's forever.</p><p>And if that's what people want, I guess that's what they're going to get. Harmeet, great work on all these religious liberty cases as well. You've got a big victory today for the barbers, and cosmeticians in California. And we're going to be watching those cases closely. So, great work, Harmeet. Thanks so much.</p><p>DHILLON; Thank you, Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And now that we're gaining a more complete picture regarding COVID in the mortality rate. Is there a greater risk now being locked down? VDH is here next. Stay there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW CUOMO, GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK: At what point do the numbers drop to the reopening threshold? Now people can speculate. People can guess I'm out of that business because we all failed at that business. Right. All the early national experts. Here's my projection model. Here's my projection model. They were all wrong. They were all wrong.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Were they all wrong, Andrew, is that what we're saying now? Well, some smart people were questioning all of this from the beginning. And it wasn't just the old models. Just three weeks ago, the experts at HHS and FEMA were predicting the daily COVID death toll would nearly double to 3000 by June 1st.</p><p>Well, the reality, only 510 new deaths were reported yesterday. Joining me now is Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. Victor, it isn't just the conventional scientific wisdom surrounding the disease itself that's been wrong, but the refusal to admit the harm of an unnecessarily long lockdown. Explain that.</p><p>VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, I think the Progressive Party has become the party of superstition and faith-based information, it's not based on science.</p><p>Almost everything they've told us has been wrong. It's not two to three people per hundred that are infected. The dialogue or two or three per thousand. And we know from past recessions, when you lose a trillion dollars a year and this, we're losing a trillion dollars in GDP a month, we know statistically how many people will die in excess because of that.</p><p>We know in Northern California; suicides are more now than deaths to the virus. So, the data's coming in of the medical cost of being locked down in addition to the economic cost. And that's not faith based. That's the actual data. And the Left refuses to look at it. It reminds me almost of that famous quote, D-Day when Colonel Taylor said, he honors two types of people on the beach. There's those that are dying. Those are dead. And those are going to die. So, let's get the hell off the beach.</p><p>And what we're here, there's two types of people locked down, those who are broke. And those who are going to go broke for the most part. So, it's time to get out of your house and take a risk. And it's a scientific risk. And I think most Americans would whether follow George Patton. And they weren't George McClellan. That's the choice we have right now. Take a reasonable risk or to get into a collective fetal position.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, well, America is built on risks. I mean, the most daring risk takers on earth were founding fathers of America on everything that they risk, their fortune, their blood, everything for freedom and liberty. And look at what we're doing. Well, Governor Newsom today issued this warning. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM, (D) CALIFORNIA: The reality is this pandemic has just begun. It hasn't ended. By no stretch of the imagination is this virus behind us. And I just cannot be more, I think, precise in terms of my, well, recommendation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Victor, he's basically prepping people to get used to this kind of rolling series of draconian controls over their daily lives.</p><p>HANSON: We are seven weeks now, Laura, from his March 19th warning that 25 million people would be infected at the given rate, we were told, of two percent. We should have had 600,000 dead Californians. We have got about 3,800. That's a tragedy. We are the largest state in the country, we have 40 million people, and we haven't seen any of that. And maybe it's because scientists have warned us, that were ignored, that viruses mutate, and often weaken in their mutations. Or maybe it's because we are developing herd immunity, or maybe it's because of the weather here. It's 103 today where I'm talking to you from.</p><p>But all of that in perfect storm fashion has not given us the predictions of doom and gloom and Armageddon of the governor. So he has no credibility anymore, none at all, and people know that. So this all begs the question, why are we doing this? In a few words, you don't have to be a cynic anymore to think that they are willing to destroy the fifth largest economy in the world without which this country cannot rebound before the November election. Just New York and California, 20 percent of the GDP -- excuse me about 15 percent, 20 percent, yes, 20 percent of the GDP of the states.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Got to go.</p><p>HANSON: We've got to have those two states.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Victor, they have their strategy. It's betting against America and holding back against America and controlling America. I think a lot of conservatives want to let loose, not the virus loose, but the people in their ingenuity and their innovation and their hard work. Let that loose and we're going to be OK in the end. Victor, thank you so much.</p><p>HANSON: Thank you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And speaking of faulty models, faulty data, remember that German study that claimed that kids were the COVID super-spreaders? It was hyped by \"The New York Times,\" \"The Guardian,\" of course Dr. Fauci touted the study initially, and Governor Cuomo recently echoed the findings.</p><p>Given all this, no one should be surprised that it all turned out to be a load of you know what. A reanalysis of the study's own data, is this sounding familiar, actually came to the exact opposite conclusion. Children have lower viral loads than adults. Our next guest said this is the scientific equivalent of a war crime. Join me now is Phil Kerpen, president of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity. Phil, despite that study coming from Germany, none of the German medical societies or governments gave it any credence. So why are we?</p><p>PHIL KERPEN, COMMITTEE TO UNLEASH PROSPERITY: It's a good question, Laura. Every major German medical society came out, condemned this paper, said that kids should all be back in school. In fact, they said they would support reopening the schools immediately with no restriction, which is not was Germany is doing. They are putting similar restrictions as a lot of the other European countries.</p><p>But this study was written for one reason and one reason only, which was to scare and frighten governments and parent all over the world into keeping schools closed. The conclusion was predetermined and prewritten before they even looked at the data. And the numbers, as much as they torture them to try to support that conclusion, just don't support it. And there have now been multiple re-analyses looking at the very data from that paper and finding that children have about a quarter of the viral load of adults.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And France is now, even though France went through obviously a horrific time with the virus, France is now reopening schools, Phil. France's education minister told the BBC it is obvious that a lack of schooling has increased inequalities. It's a social emergency is the term he then uses to describe the need to unlock the country schools. Now, France has had a lot more tragedy per capita than the United States. They are reopening schools, Phil. So what the heck is the United States waiting for?</p><p>KERPEN: It is really bizarre. We've only got a couple of states that have reopened schools. I think they're Montana and Wyoming, and maybe North Dakota started summer school. But that's it. The vast majority of the U.S. is not. Almost all of Europe now has. The United Kingdom is going back June 1st.</p><p>And in France, they had 1.4 million children go back to school, 70, 70, seven-zero, of those 1.4 million tested positive for this virus. That is such a minuscule tiny, nothing number. It shows that there's no threat and no issue here. And yet that headline was blasted all over the world and in a lot of American outlets as France school opening fails, 70 student test positive, without the context of what a tiny number that is.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, exactly. I think the scientific community is going to have a lot to answer for, the modeling community biostats, and, of course, the media in all of this. Huge, huge disservice they did to not just this country but to the globe. Phil, thank you so much.</p><p>KERPEN: My pleasure.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And in moments, Raymond Arroyo will break down Joe Biden's racial blunder culminating in a ridiculous softball interview on CNN. Plus the new development mask-gate. \"Seen and Unseen\" unmasked when we come back.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's now time for our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment where we reveal the stories behind the headlines. Joining us now with all the details, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor. Raymond, now, you think Memorial Day may have given us an insight into the campaign to come. How so?</p><p>RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Laura, if you look closely what happened during those dueling Memorial Day ceremonies, voters look at this. They are looking for signs. They are looking for impressions of how they should vote. Biden emerged from his basement for the first time in two months to lay a wreath at a war memorial near his home in Delaware. It was a grim look. He wore a black mask, the dark gray bands. Even his gait was tentative. He projected an image of trepidation, even fear.</p><p>Trump on the other hand, appeared at Fort McHenry. He is surrounded by the Drum and Fife Corps, flags are waving behind him, no mask. He seemed to be aligning himself, visually at least, with that American spirit of defiance in the face of adversity. It even had the touch of revolutionary spirit about it, Laura. And I think voters are picking up on this. Whether they recognize it or not, it is there. They see it, they feel it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I don't think America is -- I don't think they want masks long- term, even if short term they will do the mask because they think it's safe. I think they are worried that this is going to become the new normal forever, which I think the blue state governors want. They need a visual to keep this narrative going since the curve has long since been flattening, they need that visual to keep people scared. And the mask for some, not saying it has no use, but for some, it keeps that visual front and center.</p><p>ARROYO: Well, whether it has use or not, Dr. Fauci a few months ago said it had very little use. But from Joe Biden it is virtue signaling. It's a way to set himself off from Trump. And in his first in-person interview in two months he sat down 12 feet apart from CNN's Dana Bash and explained why he wore the mask on Memorial Day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I watched the president yesterday wearing no mask, and making fun of the fact that I wore a mask. The truth of the matter is that I think you're supposed to lead by example. And one of the things our governor has said, he wants to keep social distancing, stay at home has been the order until June 1.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Laura, the governor of Delaware is now setting the course for Joe Biden's national campaign? This is bizarre, really. Who is he protecting, by the way, on Memorial Day? The slab at memorial? I don't know who he was protecting? His wife he has been quarantining with for months? It was all very bizarre. But I think it's political. There's a political piece to this.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's all political. And now we are reading stuff about how you can damage yourself by wearing a mask because then you are breathing back potentially microbes --</p><p>ARROYO: The viral load.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Not everybody changes their mask every day or cleans it. They were too busy. You know we're going to read an article a month from now about how unhygienic masks are now super-spreaders of the virus. That is coming.</p><p>Raymond, Biden is still trying to clean up those comments he made on that popular radio show last week. Here is the exchange, starting with a Biden aide interrupting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's really our time. I apologize.</p><p>CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD, RADIO HOST: You can't do that to black media.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've got to do that to white media and black media, because my wife has to go on. If you have a problem figuring out whether you are for me or Trump, then you ain't black. The NAACP has endorsed me every time I have run. I mean, come on, take a look at the record.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Not only was Biden's message presumptive and inflammatory, Laura, but the NCAAP has said they never endorsed Biden and have a policy of not endorsing candidates. The fury from black Americans was immediate, including black leaders. Joe Biden tried to walk it back on CNN today. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He was being a wise guy, and I responded in kind. I shouldn't have done that. Look, the state you're sitting in here has the eight largest black population in America as a percent of vote, of population. And I've got overwhelming support every time I've run. But I've worked like hell because I work in East Side. I work in all the things I care about, making sure their houses are as valuable as the same white person's house in a white neighborhood.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Laura, how condescending is that? I'm going to make sure that a black person's house is worth what a white person's house in a white neighborhood is? This is stereotype writ large. It's almost as offensive as the other comments.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, I will say this. Biden had eight years to make all these improvements in the African-American community, and it took Donald Trump who before COVID had made more progress in helping the unemployment efforts and pushing for school choice and all the things that he's for, criminal justice reform. Obama didn't accomplish any of that stuff. So God bless these guys duking it out, but you have to operate in the realm of facts at some point. Raymond, great to see you on a Tuesday night.</p><p>ARROYO: Thank you, Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And if you think Democrats' push to expand mail-in voting would open the door to potential fraud, you're right. So why is the media and big tech, why are they claiming otherwise? Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick highlights a major ballot harvesting case coming up in Texas, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you do all mail-in voting, ballots, you are asking for fraud. People steal them out of mailboxes. People print them, and then they sign them and they give them in, and the people don't even know if they are double counted. In California, the governor sent, I hear, or is sending millions of ballots all over the state to anybody, people that aren't citizens. We are not going to destroy this country by allowing things like that to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, President Trump is not the first to warn about the potential for massive amounts of fraud from mail-in ballots. The bipartisan commission on federal election reform was cochaired by the noted right- winger Jimmy Carter. OK, well, it found in 2005 that absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud. Citizens who vote at home, at nursing homes, at the workplace, or in church are more susceptible to pressure, overt and subtle, or to intimidation. Vote buying schemes are far more difficult to detect when citizens vote by mail.</p><p>Joining me now is Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. Dan, the geniuses at Twitter subjected Trump to their first ever fact-check. But in your state, a recent two-year investigation, didn't you guys uncover an alleged ballot harvesting scheme involving mail-in ballots?</p><p>DAN PATRICK, (R) TEXAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: Well, we found many over the years, Laura, but this story just broke tonight literally. I think you're the first person to talk about. And Colleen Vera, who I know very well, a very good citizen investigative reporter spent two years on this. She found where a Democrat Congresswoman in Houston paid a convicted forger, and there was another convicted forger working on this campaign. They also have audiotapes of them talking about how they can harvest these ballots, group them up in groups of 50. The signatures were the same on the envelope as they were on every one of these ballots, the ballot signatures.</p><p>So, look, Twitter owes the president an apology. They fact-checked him, Laura, for his opinion. And by the way, his opinion was based on fact because the Democrats are trying to steal this election. I just tweeted out that the Democrat plan to have everyone vote by mail is an invitation for fraud, and it is a total scam. And tonight, I would like all of your millions of viewers to tweet their own tweet out about how mail-in ballot are a scam by the Democrats. Let's see if Twitter fact-checks me and the millions of people.</p><p>Remember that movie \"Network\" when Howard Beale said go to the window and just shout out you are mad as hell, you're not going to take it anymore? The modern day is go to your computer, millions of tweets how the Democrats plan -- you write your own tweet, folks, send it out, and let's see if Twitter goes after him like they went after the president. They owe him an apology.</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's not going to get it from Jack. I don't think so.</p><p>PATRICK: They need to stop fact-checking opinion.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Are they going to fact-check all the modelers who were wrong during the COVID? Are they going to fact-check all of the people who were wrong about all their doomsday scenarios? Jerry Nadler, by the way, a congressman, liberal from New York, said this Dan in 2004. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JERROLD NADLER, (D-NY) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: In my experience in New York, paper ballots are extremely susceptible to fraud. I want a paper trail. I want paper somewhere. But pure paper with no machines, I can show you experience which would make your head spin.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Jerry Nadler might have lost a little weight since then, but the weight of his comments are just on target there.</p><p>PATRICK: And Laura, I was one of the coauthors of our voter I.D. bill when I was a senator before becoming lieutenant governor, and that's what the Democrats said on the floor. We don't have to have photo voter I.D. because scam is in the mail-in ballots. They know that. That's why they're trying to have everyone vote by mail.</p><p>Look, here is the deal. The further away, Laura, you get from the ballot box, the more opportunity for fraud. The Democrats used to say, you don't have to show an I.D. to vote. Now they don't even want you to vote. And s far as protections, they say this is about safety.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Oh, please.</p><p>PATRICK: It has nothing to do with safety, because 65 year and older citizens in this country in Texas and almost every state can already vote by mail. What the Democrats want to do is automatically send out ballots, which is against the law in Texas. You have to request them to vote by mail. And they want to send it out to every citizen. This is their opportunity to try to rig the election. We're not going to put up with it. And if they get away with it, Laura, it's the end of democracy. It's not just the end of this presidential campaign. If they get away with this, democracy has been shredded.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I remember when we were hailing Iraqis for going into the poll to the vote for the first time with their purple fingers. They risked their lives to vote, it is so important to them. We can do it safely, in person, like everybody has done it through the history of the country. If you really need an absentee ballot for real reasons, you can get it. But this is a complete Democrat scam, 100 percent.</p><p>Dan, thank you so much.</p><p>PATRICK: You bet.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And just How proud was CNN over its socially distant Biden interview? We have a doozy for you next, Last Bite.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Today CNN outdid itself in virtue signaling of its handling of the Biden interview.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: We were socially distant. You can see that we were actually 12 feet apart. It was a very small footprint.</p><p>WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR: I know you drove by yourself in your own car. That's the safe way to do it. Obviously, our crew drove in a separate car.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: I love it when people are wearing a mask in their own cars down the street.</p><p>Shannon Bream and the \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" team take it all from here.

Developed and emerging markets outside the U.S. experienced similar whipsaw results.\u00a0 The rebound sparked concerns that the equity markets have become unmoored from economic reality.\u00a0 T. Rowe Price managers see the potential for a pause or even a pullback at some point.</p><p>Government bond yields around the world rallied strongly as global central banks and fiscal authorities rushed to inject an historic amount of liquidity into the economy amid the panic, and as investors took flight to safe haven assets.\u00a0 The rally drove 10-year government bond yields below 1% in all major economies.\u00a0 Global high yield and emerging market bonds experienced market corrections in the first quarter before surging back with returns of 9.7% and 8.1%, respectively, in the first two months of the second quarter.</p><p>In managing to the other side of this crisis, T. Rowe Price managers are mindful that there remains significant uncertainty about the pandemic, which will likely lead to continued market volatility as businesses and consumers adapt to further disruptions in the global economy.\u00a0 The extreme dislocations in the financial markets present both risks and opportunities.\u00a0 T. Rowe Price managers favor companies that have top-flight management teams, rock-solid balance sheets, and strong competitive positions in their respective industries, qualities that could help them emerge from the crisis in strong shape.</p><p>In equities, the firm is finding compelling opportunities in the technology, health care, and energy sectors and in Asia ex-Japan companies.\u00a0 Companies on the leading edge of innovation continue to prosper as the digitization of a wide range of industries and markets accelerated during the pandemic.\u00a0 Conversely, industries in the crosshairs of the pandemic such as lodging, transportation, leisure, entertainment, and dining, must adapt their business models to a new normal, though even those industries present opportunities.\u00a0 With the robust rebound of the equity markets, valuations have become stretched and investors need to remain cautious in the short term.</p><p>In the fixed income universe, T. Rowe Price managers are focused on opportunities in credit sectors such as high yield and emerging market bonds.\u00a0 In high yield, they are overweight the cable, healthcare, and utilities sectors and are finding opportunities in beaten-up areas such as energy and metals.\u00a0 They are also adding to existing positions in high-quality cyclical companies.</p><p>Developing market governments and the International Monetary Fund have the capacity to support fundamentals and valuations in emerging markets bonds. Quantitative easing, a relatively new initiative in emerging markets, is most likely to help counties with strong balance sheets and credible fiscal institutions, such as South Korea, Thailand and Israel.\u00a0 The plunge in oil prices will be beneficial for oil importers like India, and detrimental for oil-exporting countries such as Nigeria and Venezuela.\u00a0 Markets are pricing in widespread credit distress, but many issuers are expected to recover in coming months even though there may be more defaults and increased volatility.</p><p>Despite the near-term uncertainty, the firm is cautiously optimistic over the medium term that a new bull market can potentially be born from lower equity valuations as the world moves toward eventual stabilization and normalization of global economies.</p><p>For more on T. Rowe Price's mid-year outlook, please read the articlehere.</p><p>KEY 2020 MIDYEAR OBSERVATIONS</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">The near-term prospects for the financial markets depend upon several variables:\u00a0 the spread of the virus, the development of treatments to lower mortality rates, and ultimately, the development and mass deployment of a successful vaccine.\u00a0 There are signs both encouraging and disquieting:\u00a0 While cases of new infections are rising in some countries and remain stubbornly high in others, there has not been a second wave of the coronavirus as yet in countries that quickly quarantined.\u00a0 The firm anticipates that a vaccine could pass phase three clinical trials by early next year, sooner than initially expected.\u00a0 However, it could take months to get meaningful portions of the public vaccinated. Finally, there's the chance that the virus could resurface in the winter, though the world will certainly be much better prepared to take the necessary precautions to limit its spread.\u00a0 The digitization of a wide range of economies and industries has accelerated during the pandemic.\u00a0 As individuals around the world increasingly work, socialize, shop, and consume entertainment at home, companies that provide the infrastructure for the online economy have seen demand for their services boom, allowing them to extend their dominance. \u00a0 In health care, the longer-term impact of the pandemic could be that investors put an even greater premium on innovation and new drug platforms. The importance of drug development is likely to change public perceptions about the trade-off between innovation and drug pricing.\u00a0 If the regulatory overhang diminishes, valuations in the sector are likely to benefit. \u00a0 While energy was the worst-performing sector in the first quarter as the price of oil collapsed, there is potential for a powerful, counter-cyclical rally in crude oil and energy stocks over the next 12 to 24 months as low energy prices drive supply cuts and oil demand potentially recovers from an unprecedented shock.\u00a0 However, the longer-term outlook for energy stocks remains much less sanguine as ongoing productivity gains in U.S. shale fields should continue to make hydrocarbons easier and less expensive to extract.\u00a0 Despite a recent rally, the underperformance of U.S. value stocks versus their growth-oriented counterparts has widened since the outbreak of the pandemic, a trend that has been in place for a decade and likely will continue. While opportunities among value stocks are plentiful, the challenge will be to find companies that can make it to the other side of the crisis intact.\u00a0 T. Rowe value managers are finding opportunities in high-quality cyclicals, especially information technology and industrial companies that are developing innovative products, and in real estate and semiconductors firms.\u00a0 T. Rowe Price fixed income managers expect the credit default rate in this cycle, which reached a 10-year high of 4.8% in May, to peak at 10%.\u00a0 More than half of the high yield market today is rated BB, the highest percentage in history.\u00a0 Defaults among BB-rated bonds have historically been rare. There are some compelling opportunities in \"fallen angels,\" formerly investment-grade bonds that had been downgraded to below investment-grade. \u00a0 The extreme and sudden impact of the pandemic on the global economy and financial markets has reduced confidence in traditional valuation metrics such as earnings and free cash flow because the current situation is so unique.\u00a0 T. Rowe managers are finding it difficult to compare aggregate valuation metrics to past periods.\u00a0 They are spending more time understanding the unique context of each individual company to properly assess valuation.\u00a0 The outlook for corporate earnings growth is murky as many companies, particularly those in industries most impacted by the quarantine measures, have eliminated or significantly reduced earnings guidance.\u00a0 With the economy entering a recession, we expect earnings growth in the near-term to be significantly challenged, with a return to earnings normalcy perhaps sometime in 2021.\u00a0 The second quarter will likely mark the nadir for economic growth, with U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) contracting by 12% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.\u00a0 The U.S. created a somewhat surprising 3.1 million private sector jobs in May.\u00a0 For the year, T. Rowe economists expect a decline of 6.5% in U.S. real GDP.\u00a0 The International Monetary Fund is projecting a 3% contraction in the global economy this year.</emphasis></p><p>QUOTES</p><p>Rob Sharps, Head of Investments and Group Chief Investment Officer<br/>\"The central question right now is whether equity markets have risen to unjustifiably high levels given the uncertain course of the pandemic.\u00a0 We've seen a dramatic recovery in a very short period of time, with some equity indices at breakeven or even at new highs for the year. There is certainly reason for optimism due to the slowing spread of the virus in some countries, the progress toward treatments and ultimately a vaccine, the stimulus, and the reopening of economies.\u00a0 But there's still a lot we don't know about the trajectory of the disease.\u00a0 Certain parts of the market have become quite highly valued, including small- and mid-cap companies, internet-enabled businesses, mobile communications platforms, and software as a service.\u00a0 So, we may be due for a pause or even a pullback.\"</p><p>\"The pandemic has accelerated the shift to the digital economy.\u00a0 Since March, people have dramatically altered the way they work, socialize, shop, and access entertainment.\u00a0 People who were previously uncomfortable with technology have come to rely upon it.\u00a0 As a result, the longstanding trends toward mobility, e-commerce, and cloud computing have become further cemented in our daily lives.\u00a0 This has further strengthened the position of the big technology platforms and other companies that are on the right side of change.\"</p><p>\"The pandemic has accelerated the backlash against globalization that had emerged before the crisis.\u00a0 Tensions have worsened between the U.S. and China.\u00a0 Global corporations are going to re-evaluate their supply chains to diversify their exposure to key countries and vendors.\u00a0 Nations will revise their policies around the procurement of vital medical equipment, such as ventilators.\u00a0 Finally, the increasing focus on environmental, social and governance issues will compel companies to choose their business partners ever more carefully.\u00a0 Nevertheless, we believe the long-term benefits of globalization are too compelling for it to be reversed in any meaningful way.\"</p><p>Justin Thomson, Portfolio Manager and Chief Investment Officer, Equity<br/>\"We have just seen the largest global stimulus package as a percentage of global assets in history.\u00a0 In the U.S. alone, we've seen Federal Reserve stimulus amounting to 29% of gross domestic product (GDP) and fiscal measures accounting for another 15.4% of GDP.\u00a0 In addition, this has been the most coordinated response to a crisis ever on a global scale, with central bank stimulus and fiscal programs implemented in the U.S., China, the Eurozone, and Japan.\u00a0 This is the primary reason why broad equity indices are flat or even up year-to-date.\"</p><p>\"The latest skirmish in relations between the U.S. and China is the battle for hearts and minds in Hong Kong.\u00a0 Some observers are interpreting this as the gradual ending of Hong Kong's common law status and the 'one-country, two systems' principle.\u00a0 We believe it is not in China's interest for Hong Kong to lose its status as a global financial center.\u00a0 Much of Hong Kong's success has been based on its independent monetary system and particularly the pegging of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar. There is no anticipation that the renminbi will be pegged to the dollar anytime soon. So, it is vital for China to maintain the integrity of the Hong Kong dollar.\"</p><p>\"The equity bull market over the last decade has been led by growth stocks, large companies, and U.S. stocks, particularly the big tech platforms and other disruptors.\u00a0 That has continued since the pandemic, though recently there has been a reversion trade toward value over growth, small companies over their larger brethren, and non-U.S. stocks over their U.S. counterparts. However, we believe the trends propelling growth stocks before the pandemic, such as innovation and the move to a digitized economy, will continue.\"</p><p>Mark Vaselkiv, Chief Investment Officer, Fixed Income<br/>\"For the rest of this year and into 2021, we will witness a wide range of economic and market outcomes as the world recovers from the pandemic.\u00a0 What's unique about this recession is the enormous pain felt at the local level as small businesses have been closed.\u00a0 Half of Americans working in the private sector today are employed in companies with less than 500 people.\u00a0 How many of those small businesses survive is a key question.\"</p><p>\"Despite rising federal deficits and the massive monetary and fiscal stimulus injected into the global economy, we expect inflation to remain muted for an extended period.\u00a0 We have seen stimulus injected into the economy since the global financial crisis of 2008, yet inflation has remained contained.\u00a0 This is due to strong and durable\u00a0deflationary forces, including globalization, the decline in labor costs and wage growth due to new\u00a0technologies, the secular drop in energy prices, and aging populations in major economies such as the U.S.,\u00a0China, Japan and across Europe.\"</p><p>\"We're seeing extremely wide dispersion along the credit quality spectrum.\u00a0 After the initial panic in March, spreads have narrowed significantly in stable industries such as healthcare, but have remained fairly wide in challenged industries like retailing.\u00a0 Therefore, aggregate spreads today are less important than relative value analysis conducted on a case-by-case basis. Some industries, such as airlines, cruise ships, and energy are facing existential crises and will likely undergo financial restructurings.\u00a0 Many other sectors are well-positioned to benefit from changes in consumer behavior, such as health care, some media and broadcasting companies, quick-service restaurants, and supermarkets.\"</p><p>ABOUT T.

Executives with fleets and technology suppliers agreed there is more growing interest as costs fall and comfort levels rise. However, an investment that does not include an implementation and training plan will not achieve all of its gains, some of which cannot be measured in precise dollars and cents.</p><p><br/><br/>\u201cThis is a permanent change in the way fleets look at business and manage their businesses,\" said Deryk Powell, president and CEO of Velociti Inc., which specializes in the installation and service of transportation and networking technology. \u201cSpecifically, we see a lot more conversation surrounding multifaceted technology investments.<br/><br/>There are several contributing factors to this trend.<br/><br/>\u201cSome of this is driven from new players coming into the transportation space and disrupting commerce,\" Powell said. \u201cIt is forcing fleets to look at their businesses in a completely different way.\"<br/><br/>At the same time, the upcoming electronic logging mandate is requiring investment-cautious carriers to change their thinking, and \u201cthrough that process, it has opened up other conversations around other technology.\"<br/><br/>Powell was not alone in saying the ELD mandate has trigger\u00aded a larger movement.<br/><br/>Scott Hildebrand, vice president of support and customer experience at Omnitracs, said the regulation, scheduled to take effect in December, is leading to many first-time inquiries.<br/><br/>\u201cIt is an interesting nuance we are seeing this year,\" Hilde\u00adbrand said. Fleets are saying, \u201cI have to be compliant, so where else can I leverage technology?\"<br/><br/>[CHARTBEAT:3]<br/><br/>Fleet executives, many of whom juggle multiple responsibilities, think the answer is only where \u201cthey feel enough pain.\" In reality, there are usually many areas where an investment can offer monetary savings, higher productivity, and employee satisfaction.<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://fleetowner.com/site-files/fleetowner.com/files/uploads/2017/09/21/zonar.jpg\">http://fleetowner.com/site-files/fleetowner.com/files/uploads/2017/09/21/zonar.jpg</url>LarryJordan, chief product officer at    Zonar Systems, agreed that new customers are saying,    \u201cI have to buy this ELD thing, so help me out.\"    They tend to have preconceived notions on the specific pieces of their business to invest in. That often overlooks areas like fuel management, vehicle utilization, and safety compliance, where modern technology can outperform existing processes, he said.<br/><br/>Amos Rogan, productivity and efficiency leader of less-than-truckload operations at Averitt Express, said as fleets consider an investment, they should ask themselves, \u2018What does<br/><br/><br/>being more productive look like?\u2019<br/><br/>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t always mean delivering another shipment or picking up another shipment,\" he said. \u201cMaybe we are finishing up      <br/><br/><br/>quicker, taking out miles that a city driver has to drive in order to get all his shipments off because we loaded the trailer better, or are routing in a more productive way.    When you really get to looking at it,\" he continued, \u201cthere is no one true measurement.\"<br/><br/>In Averitt\u2019s case, its technology investment includes not only outside vendors but building internal systems based off the IBM AS400 platform for its LTL, truckload and supply chain/dedicated units. The company employs in-house programmers to develop and maintain these systems to improve delivery times and meet shippers\u2019 requirements.<br/><br/>\u201cOur operations are all different in terms of not only what the customer expects [regarding] measuring performance and productivity,\" Amos said.<br/><br/>\u200b<url normalizedValue=\"http://fleetowner.com/site-files/fleetowner.com/files/uploads/2017/09/21/Averitt_sidebar.jpg\">http://fleetowner.com/site-files/fleetowner.com/files/uploads/2017/09/21/Averitt_sidebar.jpg</url> Averitt has been recognized by Walmart in five of the past six years as LTL Regional Carrier of the Year. Walmart credited Averitt for \u201cimplementing technology to ensure that retail shippers meet strict delivery compliance guidelines.\" Averitt also crafted a streamlined single-day delivery solution.<br/><br/>Zonar\u2019s Jordan said the benefits of a technology investment \u201creally depend on the up-front effort that a company puts into utilizing the solution.\"<br/><br/>Velociti\u2019s Powell noted that it starts by bringing together a range of people whose divisions might be impacted. That could include operations, maintenance, finance, safety, and human resources.<br/><br/>He also cautions fleets to guard against \u201cinvestment fatigue.\" There can be so much effort into gaining budgetary approval and choosing a supplier that not enough effort is put into system implementation and employee training. There also should be a longer-term plan on technology upkeep to maximize ROI over the long term.<br/><br/>Omnitracs\u2019 Hildebrand encourages fleets that are investing in multiple areas to be patient.<br/><br/>\u201cYou can\u2019t do it all at once,\" he said, suggesting, as an example, a fleet should first transition fully to e-logs from paper before moving to other telematics offerings. Likewise, he reminds them that \u201ctechnology doesn\u2019t replace bad processes.\"<br/><br/>It is not just telematics and electronics seeing more interest from fleets. Judith Monte, vice president of marketing of Aperia Technologies Inc., maker of the Halo Tire inflation system, said, \u201cWe are starting to see some of the initial conservative feelings fall by the wayside. The technology is at the point now where it is considered tried and true.\"<br/><br/>Monte noted tires remain a top operating expense for fleets, and proper inflation can be difficult to manage manually.<br/><br/>In June, Brown Integrated Logistics announced it was making Halo a standard specification on all new and existing power units. The system is self-powered and self-contained, does not require tapping or drilling of axles, and installs in under 30 minutes.<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://fleetowner.com/site-files/fleetowner.com/files/uploads/2017/09/21/aperia.jpg\">http://fleetowner.com/site-files/fleetowner.com/files/uploads/2017/09/21/aperia.jpg</url> \u201cProper tire inflation is extremely important when running wide-base single tires,\" said Brian Kinsey, Brown\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cWe specify the Halo Tire Inflator on all of our tractors to reduce the likelihood of tire failure, optimize fuel economy, and ensure safe stopping distances.\"<br/><br/>Kinsey said his company started testing Halo units in April 2016 on 15 tractors, but it was difficult to determine the payback because a proper evaluation period would take two years.<br/><br/>After the initial evaluation, Brown took \u201ca leap of faith,\" knowing there is proven science showing that keeping tires properly inflated improves fuel economy.<br/><br/>Combined with the expectation of longer tire life, Kinsey assumed \u201cthe device would eventually pay for itself.\" Already, he said, the Halo system had paid an additional dividend. One of the tractors has used the system for less than six months picked up a \u201csubstantially sized bolt\" into one of its super single tires, resulting in a leak. The Halo system kept the tire inflated long enough for that driver to arrive safely to one of Brown\u2019s facilities for a quick repair.<br/><br/>\u201cIt saved me a road service call, a new tire expense, and downtime,\" Kinsey said. \u201cThat one event saved me the cost from that particular tractor.\"<br/><br/>In summing up Brown\u2019s lengthy history of technology investments, Kinsey said the company went \u201cwith the best option at the time,\" leading to long relationships with vendors, including PeopleNet and SkyBitz.<br/><br/>Looking at today\u2019s marketplace, he suggested \u201cthere may be some lower cost alternatives, but it wouldn\u2019t be lower for us if we had to re-outfit\" the company\u2019s equipment and network.<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://fleetowner.com/site-files/fleetowner.com/files/uploads/2017/09/21/Omnitracs.jpg\">http://fleetowner.com/site-files/fleetowner.com/files/uploads/2017/09/21/Omnitracs.jpg</url> Instead, Brown takes advantage of new upgrades that are made available for its existing systems. For trailer tracking, that means converting satellite tracking units to solar power to cut into the downtime caused by dead batteries. \u201cTrailers don\u2019t move themselves,\" he noted.<br/><br/>Upgrades on its in-cab navigation system tend to focus on driver retention. Using scanning software that allows drivers to submit paperwork via cell phones is translating into faster payments.<br/><br/>Concerns about technology investments becoming obsolete or newer offer\u00adings coming to market at lower prices are \u201cvalid,\" said Omnitracs\u2019 Hildebrand. He tells them \u201cwhat we\u2019re investing in for our customers is looking toward the future.\"<br/><br/>Dave Riordan, chief client officer of Lytx, said fleets are \u201cinvesting in a platform \u2026 that grows with you in time.\"<br/><br/>John Lobenberg, Kroger\u2019s safety director, suggested that for technologies such as Lytx\u2019s DriveCam system, fleets should not worry about the technology getting stale. Instead, they should consider the alternatives to not investing, which could mean a higher exposure to a serious incident that \u201ccould put a small business out of business.\"   <br/><br/>E-commerce fuels further tech changes<br/><br/>For less-than-truckload and delivery fleets, Amos Rogan, productivity and efficiency leader of less-than-truckload operations at Averitt Express, believes it.<br/><br/>will need to rely on more technology to handle the requirements of the booming e-commerce sector. He said it is \u201ckind of the Wild West in terms of how different companies view what will be required for final-mile delivery.\"<br/><br/>The emergence of companies like Amazon, and countermoves from retailers such as Walmart, mean \u201ctransportation companies need to think a little bit differently about what they are doing, and how they are going to handle customer requirements,\" he said.<br/><br/>Delivery firms need to work with the \u201cdot.coms that are not going away because it is too easy for people not to use them.\"<br/><br/>Currently across the supply chain, Amos said carriers are behind the discussion about shipment visibility and \u201chow to handle final mile more than customers, who just want it delivered.\" As an example, he cited cases where a 53-ft. trailer is expected to deliver a treadmill to a small residential subdivision and turn around in a cul de sac. The fleets with the best technology combining the speed, accuracy and resources to handle these tricky shipments are bound to find the most success, Rogan said.      <br/><br/>Video systems seen as next big tech investment<br/><br/>Wondering what might be the next big technology investment for the trucking industry?<br/><br/>Fleet Owner interviews with suppliers and fleet executives suggest it will be video event recorders. In fact, John Lobenberg, safety manager at Kroger, said he believes they will likely be required for all trucks sometime in the future.<br/><br/>\u201cI don\u2019t see any downside to them, and there is huge upside on liability and safe driver behavior,\" he said.<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"http://fleetowner.com/site-files/fleetowner.com/files/uploads/2017/09/21/LytxTrash.jpg\">http://fleetowner.com/site-files/fleetowner.com/files/uploads/2017/09/21/LytxTrash.jpg</url> Kroger recently adopted the Lytx Drivecam video program, which combines video capture of incidents such as hard braking and swerving with data analysis.    At the outset, he said Kroger was unsure of the exact return on investment other than a 35% reduction in accidents Lytx had referenced.<br/><br/>Within four months, Kroger saw a 50% reduction in collisions and 71% drop in handheld cell phone use, which Lobenberg called the biggest data surprise. Even more important was the outcome of a serious rollover incident involving a driver who was coached through the video system to make sure he always wore his seat belt.<br/><br/>\u201cHe walked away,\" Lobenberg said, rather than potentially a far more tragic fate.<br/><br/>Lytx is one of a number of providers of video-based services. They have been credited for helping exonerate truckers who are accused of causing an accident by leaving a lane or other negligent actions. In these situations, truckers are able to provide police arriving on scene images in almost real time.<br/><br/>Beyond accident evidence, \u201cvideo enriches everything that can be done with fleet operations,\" Gretchen Griswold, senior director of corporate communications at Lytx, said.<br/><br/>A piece of the overall ROI equation for fleets like Kroger is that better driver behavior can improve a company\u2019s brand and image, she noted.<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLEETO-344904</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLEETO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJ1-X9R1-JBKS-P3KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261383</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1955\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Penton Business Media, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Fleet Owner</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 21, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Cellular Services</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDBFODkzRTVGMjcxNEJEMkE5OEJERjZBMDUyQ0JBOEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODgzMzVFMEM4REFFNDc0MTg3NUU4OUEwQzE4MDBGRUY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Fuel Economy</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjhEQzgxMTU1MEJGNEM3QzlGRTc3OEU3MjcxRDUzQjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUI2RkNERjc3QTRCNEEyRkI5QkQwRTRFMzFBQkUxMjA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000CM7M</classCode><className>CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>N484100CC</classCode><className>GENERAL FREIGHT TRUCKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The so-called \"Digital Charter\" will outline the government's expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate - and Trudeau said the government is considering \"meaningful\" financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world's largest tech companies signed on to the \"Christchurch Call,\" a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.</p><p>In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new \"Wild West\" - and suggests the time for regulation has come.</p><p>\"It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that's unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,\" Trudeau's speech read.</p><p>\"It's up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.\"</p><p>The speech is sparse on details of what the \"Digital Charter\" will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians' right to privacy.</p><p>Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau's speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?</p><p>The international push to do just that appears to be growing.</p><p>Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant's data gathering. And the European Union's recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens' right to privacy in the information age.</p><p>The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.</p><p>In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.</p><p>\"With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,\" Trudeau's speech reads.</p><p>\"It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.\"</p><p>Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies - Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter - issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.</p><p>\"The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,\" the companies' joint statement read.</p><p>\"Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.\"</p><p>The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to \"detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,\" creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and \"working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.\"</p><p>But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.</p><p>Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.</p><p>\"(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it's not an official thing, it's just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,\" Owen said in an interview Wednesday.</p><p>\"The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.\"</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The so-called \"Digital Charter\" will outline the government's expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate - and Trudeau said the government is considering \"meaningful\" financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world's largest tech companies signed on to the \"Christchurch Call,\" a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.</p><p>In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new \"Wild West\" - and suggests the time for regulation has come.</p><p>\"It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that's unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,\" Trudeau's speech read.</p><p>\"It's up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.\"</p><p>The speech is sparse on details of what the \"Digital Charter\" will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians' right to privacy.</p><p>Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau's speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?</p><p>The international push to do just that appears to be growing.</p><p>Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant's data gathering. And the European Union's recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens' right to privacy in the information age.</p><p>The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.</p><p>In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.</p><p>\"With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,\" Trudeau's speech reads.</p><p>\"It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.\"</p><p>Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies - Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter - issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.</p><p>\"The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,\" the companies' joint statement read.</p><p>\"Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.\"</p><p>The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to \"detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,\" creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and \"working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.\"</p><p>But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.</p><p>Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.</p><p>\"(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it's not an official thing, it's just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,\" Owen said in an interview Wednesday.</p><p>\"The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.\"</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The so-called \"Digital Charter\" will outline the government's expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate - and Trudeau said the government is considering \"meaningful\" financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world's largest tech companies signed on to the \"Christchurch Call,\" a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.</p><p>In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new \"Wild West\" - and suggests the time for regulation has come.</p><p>\"It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that's unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,\" Trudeau's speech read.</p><p>\"It's up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.\"</p><p>Read more:</p><p>Rise of right-wing extremists presents new challenge for Canadian law enforcement agencies</p><p>Social media giants ignore law, don't take Canada seriously, say MPs</p><p>Star Editorial | Christchurch Call is a good step in fighting extremism</p><p>The speech is sparse on details of what the \"Digital Charter\" will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians' right to privacy.</p><p>Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau's speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?</p><p>The international push to do just that appears to be growing.</p><p>Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant's data gathering. And the European Union's recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens' right to privacy in the information age.</p><p>The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.</p><p>In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.</p><p>\"With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,\" Trudeau's speech reads.</p><p>\"It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.\"</p><p>Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies - Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter - issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.</p><p>\"The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,\" the companies' joint statement read.</p><p>\"Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.\"</p><p>The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to \"detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,\" creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and \"working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.\"</p><p>But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.</p><p>Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.</p><p>\"(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it's not an official thing, it's just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,\" Owen said in an interview Wednesday.</p><p>\"The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.\"</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The so-called \u201cDigital Charter\u201d will outline the government\u2019s expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate \u2014 and Trudeau said the government is considering \u201cmeaningful\u201d financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies signed on to the \u201cChristchurch Call,\u201d a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.</p><p>In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new \u201cWild West\u201d \u2014 and suggests the time for regulation has come.</p><p>\u201cIt used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that\u2019s unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,\u201d Trudeau\u2019s speech read.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.\u201d</p><p>The speech is sparse on details of what the \u201cDigital Charter\u201d will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians\u2019 right to privacy.</p><p>Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau\u2019s speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?</p><p>The international push to do just that appears to be growing.</p><p>Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant\u2019s data gathering. And the European Union\u2019s recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens\u2019 right to privacy in the information age.</p><p>The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.</p><p>In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.</p><p>\u201cWith the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,\u201d Trudeau\u2019s speech reads.</p><p>\u201cIt is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.\u201d</p><p>Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter \u2014 issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.</p><p>\u201cThe terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,\u201d the companies\u2019 joint statement read.</p><p>\u201cTerrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.\u201d</p><p>The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to \u201cdetect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,\u201d creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and \u201cworking collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.\u201d</p><p>But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.</p><p>Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.</p><p>\u201c(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it\u2019s not an official thing, it\u2019s just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,\u201d Owen said in an interview Wednesday.</p><p>\u201cThe institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.\u201d</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The so-called \"Digital Charter\" will outline the government's expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate - and Trudeau said the government is considering \"meaningful\" financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world's largest tech companies signed on to the \"Christchurch Call,\" a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.</p><p>In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new \"Wild West\" - and suggests the time for regulation has come.</p><p>\"It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that's unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,\" Trudeau's speech read.</p><p>\"It's up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.\"</p><p>Read more:</p><p>Rise of right-wing extremists presents new challenge for Canadian law enforcement agencies</p><p>Social media giants ignore law, don't take Canada seriously, say MPs</p><p>Star Editorial | Christchurch Call is a good step in fighting extremism</p><p>The speech is sparse on details of what the \"Digital Charter\" will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians' right to privacy.</p><p>Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau's speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?</p><p>The international push to do just that appears to be growing.</p><p>Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant's data gathering. And the European Union's recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens' right to privacy in the information age.</p><p>The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.</p><p>In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.</p><p>\"With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,\" Trudeau's speech reads.</p><p>\"It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.\"</p><p>Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies - Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter - issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.</p><p>\"The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,\" the companies' joint statement read.</p><p>\"Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.\"</p><p>The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to \"detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,\" creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and \"working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.\"</p><p>But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.</p><p>Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.</p><p>\"(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it's not an official thing, it's just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,\" Owen said in an interview Wednesday.</p><p>\"The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.\"</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The so-called \"Digital Charter\" will outline the government's expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate - and Trudeau said the government is considering \"meaningful\" financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world's largest tech companies signed on to the \"Christchurch Call,\" a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.</p><p>In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new \"Wild West\" - and suggests the time for regulation has come.</p><p>\"It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that's unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,\" Trudeau's speech read.</p><p>\"It's up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.\"</p><p>The speech is sparse on details of what the \"Digital Charter\" will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians' right to privacy.</p><p>Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau's speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?</p><p>The international push to do just that appears to be growing.</p><p>Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant's data gathering. And the European Union's recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens' right to privacy in the information age.</p><p>The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.</p><p>In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.</p><p>\"With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,\" Trudeau's speech reads.</p><p>\"It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.\"</p><p>Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies - Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter - issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.</p><p>\"The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,\" the companies' joint statement read.</p><p>\"Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.\"</p><p>The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to \"detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,\" creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and \"working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.\"</p><p>But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.</p><p>Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.</p><p>\"(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it's not an official thing, it's just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,\" Owen said in an interview Wednesday.</p><p>\"The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.\"</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The so-called \"Digital Charter\" will outline the government's expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate - and Trudeau said the government is considering \"meaningful\" financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world's largest tech companies signed on to the \"Christchurch Call,\" a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.</p><p>In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new \"Wild West\" - and suggests the time for regulation has come.</p><p>\"It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that's unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,\" Trudeau's speech read.</p><p>\"It's up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.\"</p><p>The speech is sparse on details of what the \"Digital Charter\" will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians' right to privacy.</p><p>Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau's speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?</p><p>The international push to do just that appears to be growing.</p><p>Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant's data gathering. And the European Union's recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens' right to privacy in the information age.</p><p>The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.</p><p>In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.</p><p>\"With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,\" Trudeau's speech reads.</p><p>\"It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.\"</p><p>Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies - Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter - issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.</p><p>\"The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,\" the companies' joint statement read.</p><p>\"Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.\"</p><p>The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to \"detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,\" creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and \"working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.\"</p><p>But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.</p><p>Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.</p><p>\"(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it's not an official thing, it's just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,\" Owen said in an interview Wednesday.</p><p>\"The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.\"</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

The so-called \"Digital Charter\" will outline the government's expectations on issues such as data ownership, privacy protections and the online dissemination of hate - and Trudeau said the government is considering \"meaningful\" financial penalties for companies that break the rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trudeau was expected to deliver the remarks at a gathering of political leaders and tech executives in Paris early Thursday morning, a day after dozens of countries and some of the world's largest tech companies signed on to the \"Christchurch Call,\" a pledge to curb violent extremism online. The pledge is named after the March terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw the murder of 51 people livestreamed on Facebook.</p><p>In the prepared remarks, Trudeau calls the digital sphere the new \"Wild West\" - and suggests the time for regulation has come.</p><p>\"It used to be that governments had the tools they needed to protect their citizens in every sphere. Now, citizens are living more and more in a digital space that's unregulated. This leaves people incredibly vulnerable,\" Trudeau's speech read.</p><p>\"It's up to the platforms, and governments, to take their responsibilities seriously, and ensure that people are protected online.\"</p><p>The speech is sparse on details of what the \"Digital Charter\" will include, save for principles like universal access and transparency. A government source, speaking on the condition they not be named, said it will also touch on things like data sovereignty and ownership, and Canadians' right to privacy.</p><p>Navdeep Bains, the innovation and economic development minister, will release the full Digital Charter at the end of the month. Trudeau's speech said that other ministers will announce specific plans for addressing the digital sphere, promising a government-wide approach to an issue that has confounded politicians and experts: how does a national government regulate internet giants that have become central to the lives of billions?</p><p>The international push to do just that appears to be growing.</p><p>Multiple candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination in the U.S. are talking about using antitrust laws to break up Facebook. The German government recently used such laws to limit the social media giant's data gathering. And the European Union's recent digital privacy regulations have set an international standard on citizens' right to privacy in the information age.</p><p>The Christchurch Call, signed in Paris on Wednesday, represents a growing international desire to tackle issues like hate speech, violent extremism, and election interference.</p><p>In his speech, Trudeau said the Christchurch massacre was not a wake-up call, but the final straw for governments and tech companies in the push to eliminate violent extremism online.</p><p>\"With the power of the internet, and through lack of proper oversight, the hateful can champion their views, and incite violence, from behind a computer screen and without consequence,\" Trudeau's speech reads.</p><p>\"It is our moral responsibility, as leaders in government and in business, to denounce this hatred at every turn. We must stand united. And we must fight back.\"</p><p>Internet giants, buffeted by years of widespread criticism and negative press, seem to be listening. After signing the Chirstchurch Call, five major U.S.-based tech companies - Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Twitter - issued an unprecedented joint statement pledging to do more.</p><p>\"The terrorist attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand in March were a horrifying tragedy. And so it is right that we come together, resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that lead to terrorist violence,\" the companies' joint statement read.</p><p>\"Terrorism and violent extremism are complex societal problems that require an all-of-society response. For our part, the commitments we are making today will further strengthen the partnership that governments, society and the technology industry must have to address this threat.\"</p><p>The companies pledged to work together on developing new technology to \"detect and remove terrorist and violent extremist content more effectively,\" creating crisis protocols to deal with active violent events, partnering with governments to increase education around extremist content, and \"working collaboratively across industry to attack the root causes of extremism and hatred online.\"</p><p>But the Canadian government clearly believes that the time for promises of self-regulation has passed.</p><p>Taylor Owen, an associate professor at the Max Bell School of Public Policy at McGill, said that the international push to regulate social media companies is a positive step, but ultimately it will be up to individual countries to craft their own regulations.</p><p>\"(The Christchurch Call) is never going to provide the teeth that it needs to, because it's not an official thing, it's just a group of countries who put their hands up and said they agree to do something. It has no power,\" Owen said in an interview Wednesday.</p><p>\"The institutions that have power are the national governments . . . I agree there needs to be international coordination, because it needs to happen at scale globally, across many jurisdictions. And it gives governments political cover to operate domestically, if other governments are doing it. And it creates a market incentive for the companies to adhere.\"</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

We're going to go on and get started here. I think we're a couple of minutes behind already. Thank you, guys, for making the trip. I appreciate it. We'll dive right in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: Can you start off, I think there's a lot of confusion in the marketplace, there's a lot of other kind of auto marketing platforms. Let's just -- how is TrueCar different and how do you differentiate?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW, EXECUTIVE VP OF OEM &amp; PARTNER DEVELOPMENT AND INTERIM PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, TRUECAR, INC.: Thank you, Kyle. There's a number of ways TrueCar is different than many of the folks who are bundled together and viewed as competitors to us -- CarGurus, cars.com, AutoTrader -- those folks are more media models, more upper funnel, more traffic-driven type properties. We're more new car focused, first of all, than they are. And secondly, we are mid-to-lower funnel in the shopping process, and we focus more on making connections between consumers and dealers when they're ready to buy a car.</p><p>A few other differentiating factors for us: we have a large affinity partnership that's been built, USAA is one of our big partners, Sam's Club, American Express, AAA, AARP, are all big partners of ours, where we provide a white label buying service for their members. We have 8 of the 10 largest insurance companies who are on our platform. So a big affinity network. Our traffic acquisition across those 3 channels is about 40% from our branded website, truecar.com, 30% from USAA and the other 30% from our affinity partnerships. So those are the differentiators, plus our closed-loop system as well.</p><p>We have a closed-loop system with all of our dealers. Our dealers provide us sales data daily that we use to track the quality of the business we're sending them. And our revenue model is a pay per sale model in states where we're allowed; we charge the dealer on a pay per sale basis, $299 for new, $399 for used, and then we convert that to a subscription in states that don't allow the pay per sale model. But even our subscription models are based on a projected volume of sales times those numbers.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: Great. As part of kind of the level setting here, you're my third TrueCar CEO. Can you help everybody kind of understand, walk us up to where you are today as acting?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: Yes. Absolutely. Thank you. I'm fortunate in that I've followed 2 pretty high visibility CEOs into the position. Scott Painter was the first one. Scott was probably the right guy for the company at that time. He was a disruptor. He was an innovator. He's an entrepreneur. He got us into this affinity partner business. He built our closed-loop system. He pushed some of the pricing model that we have on the site right now. And he pushed that as far as he could until the dealer side of the business kind of fell apart on him. That's when they brought Chip Perry in. Chip Perry's strength was on the dealer side of the business. He's kind of an icon in the dealer business, and he reestablished our brand with a lot of dealers across the country.</p><p>So we now have 17,000 dealers on our platform. 4,000 of those are independent dealers, about 13,000 of them are franchised dealers. So I'm fortunately third, but I get the benefits of both of those guys, the entrepreneurialship and the uniqueness to our brand from Scott and the fact that Scott -- Chip put the network back together for us, and I can kind of take it from here.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: Okay. So the network is large, it's healthy. We are all waiting for basically a redo on the experience. I'd like to just kind of get the conviction level for the two of you for this, given the fact that I feel like I've been waiting a long time for it. And then if there's something that I'm missing on the dealer side of the equation, some reason that a dealer would hate the idea of what I'm hoping that you guys are going to do, could you help us understand what that would be?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: Yes. And we appreciate your patience in waiting on the new business model. One of the challenges that Chip had through his tenure as the CEO was that we were in the prolonged build-out of an all-new tech stack. It was scheduled to take 12 to 18 months, it took a little over 3 years to get done. And when you get at the end of those processes, it really shuts down innovation. So we went through an extended period of time where we weren't able to do much innovation with the product, really weren't able to do the type of things we knew we needed to do. The shining star for us has been used. We moved our used car platform about 8 months ahead of our new car platform to the new tech stack. We were able to innovate and create new product offerings and do some interesting things there, and our used car business is growing at about 25% to 30% on a regular basis. So the used car is good.</p><p>We're excited about what we can do around new, really no conflicts with the dealers. The limiting factor on this was the technical capabilities to actually build. So what you'll see from us -- and my background, I spent 20 years on the OEM side of the business with Chrysler and then Nissan, and then I spent 14 years at Edmunds. And my experience with Edmunds -- and for you folks who know, the edmunds.com site is high-quality content, a lot of editorial, upper funnel and very consumer-focused, and that's my background. And we are going to be very consumer-focused in the product changes we make. What I've found over time is, if you create good consumer products, particularly where we sit in the funnel, if we create the best mousetrap around finding the right car, getting the right price, connecting with the right dealer, we'll be able to deliver value to the dealers.</p><p>So the perceived conflict that there is a conflict between consumers and dealers, in my mind, is a perception more than a reality. We think we can build the right product. When you have consumers who are in an enjoyable process, they tend to buy at a higher rate. They create better close rates for dealers. They do all the right things. So we're excited we can unlock that.</p><p>We've been testing for 7 months now, I think we've been actively testing. We take about 10% of our TrueCar traffic every day off the top and we test and we iterate and we run 2-week sprints on the tests. The data takes a while to come back for us because you not only have to watch the consumer behavior on the site but you've got to wait for it to turn into a sale, and we have to be able to match it back to a sold unit. So the data gets a bit prolonged as you go through this testing, but we've been doing it for long enough. We're excited. The things you're going to see, I think, in Q1, it'll start with our home page, you'll see the rebrand there.</p><p>We've got an exciting new configurator that we've built to get the consumers on the right car. We're going to introduce a new pricing page. We're going to introduce new consumer connections with dealers that are going to be really interesting. So we're excited about Q1, and then to put a brand refresh on top of that we think will give us a big boost.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: Could you dive a little bit deeper on the dealer connection part? That seems to be the gaping hole in the business that I'm waiting to see closed. What kind of prospect conversion improvements might you see? Or if you're already running tests and you want to share since we're in a public forum, feel free to do that. And then when will the dealer interaction piece of it, when it's launched, be a material part of the retold story?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: Yes. So we're testing a lot of different things on the connection piece. We track the full funnel on our site and we call it NFE, Net Funnel Efficiency. So we look at the amount of traffic we're able to pour into the top, the middle-of-the-funnel metric is conversion to a prospect, and then we track close rate and then actual sales volume.</p><p>Sometimes overfocus on conversion can create more issues than it's worth. So if you're converting people to a prospect and handing them to a dealer before they're really ready to buy, we've gotten some signals that maybe we were a little aggressive in that area. So you'll see us try different things. We're going to show inventory to consumers a little earlier in the process to get to nurture folks who aren't quite ready. We're looking at different actual means of connection. We're going to be actively testing before the end of the year texting versus direct phone, and we're going to do that through a proxy number and protect the consumer when they want to shut it off. So we're going to do some really interesting things that will deal with all of the consumer feedback we're getting, which is, \"I sent a lead in on your site and I got very aggressively followed up on by the dealers.\"</p><p>And to their credit, I mean, that's been the training that's been around this industry for years. It's crazy. You've got to get with the customer within 3 minutes or you're at risk of losing the business. You've got to follow up 5 times in the first 5 days. That's training that the industry put out there that's created these issues. So we're trying to step back from that and say, \"There's a better way to do this. Let's start listening to what the consumers are saying about how they want to be contacted.\" And it's going to create a better event at the end. So you'll see us be aggressive in that area.</p><p>One specific product I can't talk about that we're going to unveil that you'll be able to see, Kyle, is what we call lock/unlock. In many websites, when they do a lead, they prepick the dealers that the consumer engages with. We've introduced a product where the consumer can actually look at the list of dealers who are in their marketplace and make the selections on their own. And we're going to help them with identifying maybe this dealer has the closest match, this dealer has the most inventory that looks like the car you're shopping for. This dealer has the best pricing, this dealer has the best customer service records. And it will allow them to kind of pick which dealers they want to do business with. We think it'll improve our conversion, match rate, close rate, all of those things. So that's just one of the things you can start to look for.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: I have a feeling we'll come back to this in the Q&amp;A. I'll move on for now. USAA is obviously 30% of your units. It's the lifeblood of the business. When I talk to digital salespeople in the auto industry, this is the thing that makes them leave their phone on at night, and it's the Glengarry -- leads. And can you talk about the history of the relationship there, frame up the renewal that we hope is coming and just kind of tell us your long-term view for the partnership?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: Sure. So USAA is our biggest affinity partner. Like I mentioned, they are about 30% of our business. We did about 300,000 units through their membership last year. They're an amazing organization. What they stand for is fantastic. We've been partners with them for 12 years. In the latest survey of their members, we were the #3 rated service provided by the organization. I think we were right behind checking and credit card. So the members enjoy the program. They see benefits from it.</p><p>If you take the 3,000 vehicles -- 300,000 vehicles we sold, average MSRP savings was about $3,400 off of MSRP. They calculate that we served their members -- saved their members over $1 billion in their car purchases over that time period. So valuable service for them, certainly a great partnership for us.</p><p>The challenge in doing the deals with them is they're not only a great membership base, but they're also an insurance company and a bank. So there's a lot of compliance issues and regulations that you've got to make sure your deal will hold up to, and that's the process we're going through now as we're crossing all those t's, dotting all the i's. I was down there as recently as 2 weeks ago, we have an agreed-upon plan -- mutual plan to hopefully get this deal signed before the end of the year, well ahead of the February expiration.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: While we're on USAA, can you talk about -- we had a hiccup there on the units side, they kind of changed the way they were thinking about presenting car buying to their membership, and that slammed into the model here. Can you help us think about that more clearly with hindsight being 2020 and assure us that that's not going to happen again?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: Yes. And then it kind of brings me into a full circle discussion about the relationship. The original relationship was crafted in the bank. And it was part of the bank's efforts to grow finance contracts around their new car members' auto purchases. And currently, we have about a 40% attach rate for every one of those USAA members who come through to a USAA loan, which is unheard of compared to any of our other finance partners. So they're really excited about that.</p><p>The relationship started in the bank. Over a period of time, they actually built out an internal automotive shopping group of about 100 or so folks inside of USAA to manage our relationship. They started making some decisions in an effort to make sure the consumer wasn't overextending themselves -- the member wasn't overextending themselves in their vehicle purchase. And they put a number of pages in the process that qualified, asked them questions about what they could afford. You folks all know what happens when you put all those steps in there and pages in there, conversion falls off. And people got frustrated, and it took a dip in the performance. We got that fixed over about a 6-month period. And since then, that group inside of USAA has been disbanded. They're no longer there. Our relationship is back in the bank where it originally got started and is more commerce based. They're very focused on helping us grow volume and helping them drive finance contracts.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: Great. Thank you. Maybe some of the other affinity relationships now, it's another 30 points of unit volume, what you're seeing there in terms of kind of same affinity growth trajectory?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: Well, we certainly -- we press on 2 areas on our extended affinity group for growth. We try to grow the relationships we have and get deeper penetration into their member bases. You can imagine with companies like American Express and Sam's and AARP, those are huge, huge member bases and have created a lot of opportunity for us to just do a better job with them, finding their members when they're in the purchase process and getting them into the shopping funnel. We've added some new partners recently. We always get growth out of that channel by adding new partners. We added a publisher, Motor1, who does some automotive publishing, about 10 million uniques a month, going to be an interesting partner for us.</p><p>And we recently added Kroger, who's the largest grocery retailer in the nation, very interesting company once you get a chance to spend some time with them. They're very, very data-driven. And when you think about it, who knows more about us and our shopping habits than the grocery store where we go twice a week to buy products, right? They know what you buy, they know when you buy it, they make lifestyle decisions based on that. They've extended into fuel. For those of you who have been to the fuel pump recently, you probably see your grocery store popping in front of you, asking if you want to use your rewards. They see automotive as an extension from that fuel program they've built. So we're excited by that program and think they could be a big, big partner for us very quickly.</p><p>We've added business development resources into our partner channel, and that's what's creating some of the recent activity. We're excited about it. We've got some good conversations going on with the airline clubs and different folks that we think will give us an opportunity to expand that business as we go forward.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: Any particular -- you mentioned the airlines, any other particular verticals where you feel like there's opportunity? I know you kind of have insurance pretty much locked up, anywhere else?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: We're looking across a bunch of different categories. Retail seems to be a big one. We landed Kroger. We want to see how that goes. We're in conversations with Home Depot. We think that'd be interesting for our pickup truck business, certainly from a shopper perspective.</p><p>The airline clubs, we are talking to all of them, they have pretty good loyalty with their members and their programs, and we think we could provide some benefits there. So we've got 8 of the 10 biggest insurance providers. I think the State Farm relationship is back on the marketplace. That experiment they did with Edmunds didn't work very well. So we'll start having some conversations with them about that.</p><p>But there's a lot of opportunity out there, and we're working hard. We're getting more progressive with our existing partners, American Express for one, Sam's another, to do a lot of digital retargeting. You can find their members on YouTube. You can find them out in different places and then we could communicate with them. So we look to grow our penetration through those channels, too.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: Can you -- you already touched a little bit on the network health, I remember the kind of the fear of seeing AutoNation, not just go but go the way that it did. Can you speak a little bit more about the health of the network, why dealerships are still in there and getting value?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: We hear pretty consistently, particularly from our franchise dealers, that we are their best new car source for traffic and buyers. So that's the value we deliver at the franchise level. Our units have flattened out over the past year or so, so we've spent most of our time focusing on strategically filling brand holes in markets where we don't have enough coverage for consumers. But when we start -- when we turn the corner on 2020, we get the new product out there, we get our refresh brand campaign going, we expect a return to growth. We'd love to deliver that growth through our current network, and we'll continue to try to drive extra value through them. But eventually, we'll get to a point where we'll get back to aggressively adding franchise dealers. Probably in the middle of next year, you'll see us get back actively out there, adding new dealers to the network.</p><p>On the independent side, we've built up to about 4,000 dealers on the used car independent side. Used car business is growing like crazy for us. We'd love to double that coverage for next year. We don't have aspirations of doing that, but that's the type of opportunity that's there. Those folks bring a unique shopping set of vehicles versus our franchise dealers. So we're excited about the independent business and the used car business in general.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: Can you comment maybe a little bit on Texas specifically? I was at a dealer summit either last year or the year before, I'm not -- I can't remember, but the user experience in Texas, where there's sometimes almost a dozen results at the bottom of the funnel, and they're getting literally like Rugby gang-tackled, is that cleared up at all? Is that -- how's that relationship?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: We've had a lot of success in our discussions with the regulating groups in Texas. That process has been changed, I believe, and we're down to our normal process in Texas. You've got a vibrant new car business in Texas. There's a lot of really big car dealers, and most of them are part of our network. So we think we've got that cleaned up. We've got a home office and our sales office is in Austin, our biggest partner's in San Antonio. So we spend a lot of time in Texas, and we think we've got those relationships going in the right direction and kind of backed off of some of the crazy regulations that were there regarding how you had to provide connections to all the dealers in the market.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: You mentioned great growth in used. You have 3 named competitors there, 2 of them are public. The people that are in here, I'm sure, have dual interest. If they're interested in you, they probably have some working knowledge of CARG and CARS. Can you talk a little bit about how the competitive landscape has changed? Are those 3 competitors trying to confuse the consumer on the new car side and act like they have the data and the value proposition of TrueCar?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: They may be. I haven't seen -- we listened to the CarGurus call, we listened to the cars call who announced their quarters right before us. They're pretty clear on what they're trying to do. They're an eyeball play. They're a media play. They're always trying to wrestle with each other over traffic. I think Gurus reported 40 million uniques a month. Cars came back with 41 million. Those are interesting numbers, but to us, they're not as important.</p><p>We know there's 4 million cars sold through car dealers every month, 3 million of them are used and 1 million of them are new. Those are the folks we want on our site, right? If we had 10 million folks on our site and it was those 4 million buyers were part of that group, we'd be all set because those are the ones we want. Those are the connections we want to make with our dealers. Gurus, surprisingly, in their call, started talking about connections for the first time, they even mentioned maybe going lower funnel; we feel pretty strong that that's kind of where we're strong. And they're eventually going to have to prove some sort of attribution, you can only sell clicks and impressions for so long, and dealers are going to scrutinize those budgets and try to find sales.</p><p>So I think you'll see those big used car players jockey back and forth, but I don't think they pay a lot of attention to us. I don't think they feel the new car business is that interesting because of all the regulations around it. And used car business is 3x as big. So they kind of leave us alone and we like that position.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: Any encroachment from larger competitors? Any movement from Google or any of other big tech stacks out there?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: Yes. Google, they're a force, and they're out there grabbing share of wallet from the dealers. And I think that's probably where we run into Gurus -- or Google the most. If a dealer has got $50,000 that he spends in marketing every month, I think Gurus -- or Google comes in and takes theirs off the top. So the rest of us are left scrapping for that share of wallet. So Google is a force. They're mobilized. They've got a lot of folks. They got agencies out there telling their story. But again, it's more of a media play than ours. We can kind of ground ourselves in: \"Here's the number of vehicles we're sure we sold for you and here's what we charged you for that.\" So we think we're sheltered from it a bit, but the more of the budget that Google takes, the less, at least, for the rest of us to fight over.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: So I'll ask a few quick questions on trade and then I'll open it up to the floor. Can you just review the value proposition, how trade fits into your kind of end-to-end dream, what the revenue model is and kind of where we are in that curve?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: Yes. So you'll see us integrate our trade product, TrueTrade, for those of you who aren't completely familiar with it. We made an investment in a company, Accu-Trade, who built us a TrueTrade product, which is the most modern guaranteed cash value used car tool out there. So it's a TurboTax kind of execution. You put your license plate in, fill out some information about your vehicle, and it will show you an update of where the value comes in your used car trade. And at the end of the process, we'll stand behind that actual value.</p><p>So you'll see that product integrated into our core shopping channel by the end of the year. We hear the lower end of the numbers is that 50% of people who buy a new or used car have a trade-in involved in that. So there's big numbers of folks out there wanting to know what their trade is worth. And we're going to have that integrated into our shopping experience by the end of the year, and we think it will more closely align the consumer expectations to the dealer expectations when they get to the dealership and certainly raise close rate and engagement for us. So we're excited to get that product integrated, and it'll be a big piece of our business going forward.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Revenue model on it?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: There's 2 revenue models on it. There's a per engagement, meaning per appraisal and vehicle acquisition that a dealer gets. If a dealer acquires a vehicle through TrueTrade, he pays us. That's similar to our sales model. And then there's also a software subscription if he wants to use TrueTrade across the rest of his business. And we have different subscription models. One subscription level allows them to put it on his website and another is more of a -- just to use on the lot type of thing. But we think once we get more volume flowing through our system and dealers getting experience with the trades that we send them, we think we'll have more conversion to it and become part of that software competition, software landscape that's kind of going on out there.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: I'm going to go on and open it up for Q&amp;A. If you guys have questions, ask it and I'll repeat it into the mic for the webcast listeners. I can't guarantee anything. Anybody? The question is anecdotal evidence of progress in the 10% testing pool.</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: So I'll go back to the lock/unlock product I talked about -- the reason it's hard to get into the specifics is we're still iterating through what version will actually be the final launch. But we tested one version where we had one dealer preselected, and then we let the consumer pick other dealers. That product had a lift in -- caused a lift in conversion and it also raised the close rate.</p><p>So now what we're experimenting with is, it seems to be a product consumers want to engage in; what we don't know is when we launch it, should there be no dealers preselected and you let them just pick? Should we make one or two recommendations based on some information we have regarding pricing or inventory or those things and then let them pick? So it's hard to get into the specifics, but we've found some nuggets that we know we can build on. And I think you'll see those be the things we evolve around, and they'll be optimized when we get to the final launch.</p><p>So texting is another one. We want to get this texting product out there. There's challenges with not only the interaction between consumers and dealers, but the systems that support that. So when you send -- many of the lead systems that we pass our customer information into with a dealer, if the consumer has already done business with that dealer, they have all the information on file. So we tested some leads that did not have a phone number included. The system's automatically prepopulated.</p><p>So we're learning things as we're trying to evolve to a more consistent consumer approach, which is how you deal with the systems that are built to support this process and make sure that when we say to a consumer, \"We're not going to pass your phone number, you're not going to get a call for this,\" that there's not something inside the system that causes that not to be true. So those are the type of learnings we're going through. That's why it's important to test all these things. And we've got about another probably 30 to 45 days of real active testing. We'd like to be pretty well landed on where we're going to be in the latter part of December, and then we'll start ramping up traffic volume after the first of the year so that we're ready for an early Q1 launch.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: Anyone else? I've got one final one. You talked about, on your 3Q call, kind of the decision-makers in -- around the car buying process and kind of refocusing and replenishing the brand. Are you going to get rid of the smug, millennial bearded dude in the ads, please?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: Yes. The marketing department swore me to secrecy, but yes, we are going to get rid of the smug bearded dude and we're going to refresh our brand. The clarity around the new shopping demographics, we're still working through, but the data that keeps coming back to us is, millennials are going to affect 40% of the new cars purchased next year. Women are going to influence 70% to 75% of the vehicles purchased next year. And our site wasn't built with those type of numbers and shopping sets in mind. So those are the modifications we're looking to make, making sure we understand the needs of those buying groups and what they're really looking for and then how do we create products that kind of speak to that.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: Does True help the dealers collect follow-on services from new car buyers?</p><p>MICHAEL DARROW: We aren't in that space right now. We're looking at how do we kind of feed and maintain a lifelong -- lifetime relationship with consumers. Our relationships now are kind of event-based. Consumers come in and out every 4 or 5 years. And what we're working with dealers on now is how do we stay in touch. It could be through service. It could be just through announcements and engagement that keeps the consumer engaged. So we're looking at all of that, but it's not a space that we're in right now.</p><p>KYLE WILLIAM EVANS: Really appreciate you guys coming. Thank you so much.

The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020. He hailed himself as \"so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius!\"</p><p>A \"big subject\" of the summit would be \"the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies,\" Trump said in his tweets.</p><p>\"We will not let them get away with it much longer,\" he said.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations expected to participate in the White House meeting are Turning Point USA, a nonprofit; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; the Media Research Center; and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank.</p><p>Accusations commonly leveled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. By policy, Twitter prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"</p><p>Donald Trump Jr. weighed in on the subject Wednesday, tweeting, \"Twitter: We won't allow pro-life groups like @LiveAction to run ads on our 'platform' &amp; if you're a conservative we might ban you for 1st Amendment protected speech that we arbitrarily deem 'offensive.'\"</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday. \"Internet companies depend upon their users' trust from across the political spectrum to grow and succeed.\"</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories.

Regulators at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are pursuing antitrust investigations of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Trump's volley of Twitter messages Thursday had familiar targets - \"certain companies,\" the press and his Democratic rivals - that have proven resonance with his political base. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020. He hailed himself as \"so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius!\"</p><p>A \"big subject\" of the summit would be \"the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies,\" Trump said in his tweets.</p><p>\"We will not let them get away with it much longer,\" he said.</p><p>Among the conservative organizations expected to participate in the White House meeting are Turning Point USA, a nonprofit; PragerU, short for Prager University, which puts out short videos with a conservative perspective on politics and economics; the Media Research Center; and the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank.</p><p>Accusations commonly leveled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.</p><p>Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. By policy, Twitter prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"</p><p>Donald Trump Jr. weighed in on the subject Wednesday, tweeting, \"Twitter: We won't allow pro-life groups like @LiveAction to run ads on our 'platform' &amp; if you're a conservative we might ban you for 1st Amendment protected speech that we arbitrarily deem 'offensive.'\"</p><p>While some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p>\"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday. \"Internet companies depend upon their users' trust from across the political spectrum to grow and succeed.\"</p><p>Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories. Twitter broadened its policy this week to include banning language that dehumanizes others based on religion, and the company said it may also ban similar language aimed at other groups, such as those defined by gender, race and sexual orientation.</p><p>\"I've never seen evidence of tech firm bias against conservatives,\" said Rep.

In May 2010, O'Keefe and three others pleaded guilty in federal court to a misdemeanor in a scheme in which they posed as telephone repairmen in Sen. Mary Landrieu's New Orleans district office.</p><p> \"He's not controversial, he's truthful,\" Trump insisted of O'Keefe.</p><p> Playing to the friendly crowd, he said: \"You're challenging the media gatekeepers and corporate censors to bring the truth to the American people. \u2026 You communicate directly with our citizens without going through the fake news filter.\"</p><p> Earlier Thursday, Trump sent a stream of Twitter messages lashing out at social media companies and the press, familiar targets that resonate with his conservative base.</p><p> The meeting represented an escalation of Trump's battle with Facebook, Google and even his preferred communications outlet, Twitter, where he has an estimated 61 million followers. The president has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested that federal regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p> He said Thursday that he is directing his administration to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech and the free-speech rights of all Americans.\"</p><p> And Trump said he is inviting executives from major social media companies to join him at the White House over the next month or so.</p><p> The firms already are under closer scrutiny than ever by regulators and in Congress following a stream of scandals, including Facebook's lapses opening the personal data of millions of users to Trump's 2016 campaign. A bipartisan push for new data privacy legislation has emerged in Congress.</p><p> After the conference, Trump published a series of tweets slamming bitcoin and other types of digital currency \u2014 including Facebook's recently announced Libra.</p><p> Saying he is \"not a fan\" of cryptocurrency, whose value is \"based on thin air,\" he called for more regulation of digital assets. Cryptocurrency, he said, \"can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.</p><p> \"We have only one real currency in the USA,\" he tweeted, \"and it is stronger than ever. ... It is called the United States Dollar!\"</p><p> Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group, said the sites \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"</p><p> Kevin Freking and Marcy Gordon are Associated Press writers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-16fef03f376924a1ab5313c8e8bdf6f166ddfa4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJF-72D1-DXVP-V091-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"551\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Trump's volley of Twitter messages Thursday had familiar targets   \"certain companies,\" the press and his Democratic rivals   that have proven resonance with his political base. The president predicted, without foundation, the demise of the press and the social media platforms if he loses to a Democrat in 2020. He hailed himself as \"so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius!\"A \"big subject\" of the summit would be \"the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies,\" Trump said in his tweets.\"We will not let them get away with it much longer,\" he said.Accusations commonly leveled by conservatives against the social media platforms include anti-religious bias, a tilt against abortion foes and censorship of conservative political views.Trump has made it a priority to reach out to voters who oppose abortion. The anti-abortion groups Live Action and Susan B. Anthony List say Twitter has blocked their advertising. By policy, Twitter prohibits paid ads with content \"that is inflammatory or provocative and is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction.\"Donald Trump Jr. weighed in on the subject Wednesday, tweeting, \"Twitter: We won't allow pro-life groups like (at)LiveAction to run ads on our 'platform' ... you're a conservative we might ban you for 1st Amendment protected speech that we arbitrarily deem 'offensive.'\"Response to accusationsWhile some Silicon Valley company executives may lean liberal, they have asserted that their products are without political bias.Representatives for Facebook, Google and Twitter have declined to comment specifically on the White House meeting. The Internet Association, the industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other companies, said online platforms \"are the best tool for promoting voices from all political perspectives in history.\"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-07/AP_19192761873703.jpg?itok=joO3MOhZRadio\">https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-07/AP_19192761873703.jpg?itok=joO3MOhZRadio</url> host Sebastian Gorka listens as President Donald Trump speaks during the Social Media Summit in the East Room of the White House, July 11, 2019. \"Internet companies are not biased against any political ideology, and conservative voices in particular have used social media to great effect,\" the group's president Michael Beckerman said in a statement Thursday. \"Internet companies depend upon their users' trust from across the political spectrum to grow and succeed.\"Facebook has banned extremist figures such as Alex Jones of Infowars and Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. Twitter has banned hate speech on the basis of someone's race, gender and other categories. Twitter broadened its policy this week to include banning language that dehumanizes others based on religion, and the company said it may also ban similar language aimed at other groups, such as those defined by gender, race and sexual orientation.\"I've never seen evidence of tech firm bias against conservatives,\" said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who has been sharply critical of the big companies for reasons of their market dominance and effect on competition. He leads a House Judiciary subcommittee that has opened a bipartisan probe into the tech giants' market conduct.\"If someone wants to show me some empirical data, instead of some alt-right member's paranoid claims, I'd appreciate it,\" Cicilline said in a statement Wednesday.Trump has an estimated 61 million followers on Twitter and uses the platform almost daily to speak directly to them. He has a knack for tweeting outrageous, divisive or tongue-in-cheek missives that spur frenzied reactions from the mainstream press.At the same time, Trump has accused Twitter, without evidence, of making it \"very hard for people to join me\" and \"very much harder for me to get out the message.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS130912156288643583225176100053</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJB-RYC1-DXN1-C2T8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"995\"/><timeReceived>11:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!\u201d</p><p>Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council and a longtime advocate of deregulation, appeared to back Mr. Trump when asked by reporters later on Tuesday whether the administration would be pursuing more regulation of Google. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at it.\u201d</p><p>In a statement, Google said that its search service was \u201cnot used to set a political agenda and we don\u2019t bias our results toward any political ideology.\u201d</p><p>The president\u2019s tweets landed at a difficult moment for the tech industry. There is a growing sense across the political spectrum in the United States and in other countries that something must be done to rein in their influence.</p><p>Executives from many of the largest internet companies will face questions next week at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about their efforts to prevent foreign meddling in the midterm elections in November, a follow-up to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/us/politics/facebook-twitter-google-hearings-congress.html\">congressional hearings held after the 2016 elections</url>. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey are scheduled to testify in front of the committee.</p><p>Google has also been called to testify. Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate committee, has asked Google to send Sundar Pichai, its chief executive. So far, the company has offered to send Kent Walker, its senior vice president of global affairs.</p><p>Mr. Burr said he was unlikely to subpoena Mr. Pichai to testify, but that his absence would signal that Google was choosing \u201cnot to participate\u201d and be \u201cpart of the solution.\u201d</p><p>Interfering in how companies like Google and Facebook present information would be a notable departure for the federal government, which has mostly taken a hands-off approach to the internet. Free-speech scholars said companies like Google and Facebook were free to operate with few restrictions thanks to a 1996 law called the Telecommunications Act.</p><p>\u201cThat law pretty much removes free-speech liability for Google and Facebook,\u201d said Roy Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at the Newhouse School. \u201cThat being said, I think it\u2019d be a major leap to believe that the people behind Google are writing algorithms to discriminate against content.\u201d</p><p>Last month, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/technology/google-eu-android-fine.html\">regulators in Europe fined Google $5.1 billion</url> for antitrust violations. After the European fine, Mr. Trump said Google was \u201cone of our great companies.\u201d</p><p>What sort of pressure regulators in the United States could exert is not entirely clear.</p><p>The Justice Department, under both the Trump and Obama administrations, has shown little interest in pursuing antitrust cases against Google or its parent company, Alphabet. Mr. Trump has often raised antitrust questions about another tech giant, Amazon, but little has come of his threats.</p><p>Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has suggested that if internet companies are not a \u201cneutral platform,\u201d they should not be protected by a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives companies broad legal immunity for what people put on their services.</p><p>Appearing in front of reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump offered a vague expansion of his earlier criticism, saying that social news platforms were actively \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of people. \u201cWe have tremendous, we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in. And you just can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Trump said.</p><p>Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of bias appeared to be inspired by a segment Monday night from Lou Dobbs, a host on the Fox Business Network. Mr. Dobbs highlighted an article by a conservative website, PJ Media, that said that it had conducted what it called an unscientific study in which 96 percent of Google search results for the word \u201cTrump\u201d were articles from \u201cleft-leaning sites.\u201d</p><p>The piece was also featured on the website Drudge Report, whose operator, Matt Drudge, was an early supporter of Mr. Trump.</p><p>Search engine experts said Google uses many factors in its search algorithm \u2014 including how often a web page is linked to by other sites and how often certain words appear on a page \u2014 and that formula is constantly being updated.</p><p>\u201cEvery year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users\u2019 queries,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.\u201d</p><p>Even longtime Google critics disagreed with the premise of the PJ Media article.</p><p>\u201cThe industry should have plenty of concerns with Google, particularly antitrust and data collection practices, but this isn\u2019t one of them,\u201d said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. \u201cThe president\u2019s tweets this morning are flat-out absurd.\u201d</p><p>Long before Facebook, Apple and Google had removed InfoWars from their sites, conservatives were zeroing in on Big Tech as a new enemy in the political culture wars. In February, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., guests packed a ballroom for a discussion called \u201cSuppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.\u201d</p><p>Although it provided a target for those in attendance, Google was a sponsor of the conference. The company held a reception for conference attendees, with an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.</p><p>Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, has followed a similar line of attack as a writer and producer of a new documentary, \u201cThe Creepy Line,\u201d which argues that Silicon Valley is stifling conservative content. The Daily Caller, a conservative news and opinion website, recently posted the <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/08/24/creepy-line-trailer-jordan-peterson/\">trailer</url>.</p><p>During the presidential election, Trump campaign officials claimed Google was manipulating search results to favor Hillary Clinton.

With it, the president also rallied his widely followed online allies - whom he described as \"journalists and influencers\" and who together can reach roughly half a billion people - entering the 2020 presidential election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,\" Trump said.</p><p>Trump delivered his diatribe against Facebook, Google and Twitter - charges of political bias that all three companies long have denied - at an event at the White House featuring Republican lawmakers, GOP campaign strategists and social media meme-makers, a move that led some critics to express dismay that the president aimed to use the policy summit as a reelection push.</p><p>But Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups said they were most alarmed that Trump had invited supporters who have a history of targeting the president's political opponents with inflammatory tweets, misleading videos and hard-to-debunk conspiracy theories. At one point, the president praised James O'Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, which has released widely criticized, highly edited videos of his subjects.</p><p>\"Somebody said he's controversial,\" Trump said. \"He's truthful.\"</p><p>In response, critics fretted that Trump had essentially endorsed such controversial tactics in the early days of the 2020 presidential race.</p><p>\"This has the appearance not of a social media summit but a political rally and call for the right,\" said Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.). \"The fact that some of the most extreme voices on social media are coming to the White House, and they get a forum to complain about how often they're retweeted, and that the actual platform companies aren't even invited, smacks of the absurd.\"</p><p>The Southern Poverty Law Center charged that the president is \"essentially conducting a hate summit at the White House,\" said Heidi Beirich, the director of the group's work to track online extremism.</p><p>Facebook, Google and Twitter each declined to comment.</p><p>For a portion of the summit, Twitter appeared to be down, an outage the company said it was investigating. Outside the gathering, Trump's aides appeared to line the hallways with poster boards calling attention to the tech industry's alleged tactics for suppressing conservatives' speech - along with at least one tweet from Trump calling himself \"the best\" at using the service.</p><p>Trump also threatened additional scrutiny to come, promising to bring big tech companies to Washington for an upcoming meeting while directing federal agencies to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\" During a later, private portion of the summit, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said she and her fellow Republicans are launching a special task force to probe big tech, with an early focus on issues including privacy.</p><p>\"I'm hearing from so many people who are saying we need to put some guardrails in place,\" she said. \"And this is not an industry in its infancy.\"</p><p>Trump has skewered Facebook, Google and Twitter for months on allegations that they are biased against conservatives, even accusing them of trying to rig the election. In March, for example, he said the companies had engaged in \"collusion\" and worked in opposition to a \"certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.\" Repeatedly, the president also has threatened to investigate or regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter, sparking hearings and similar calls for tough new laws among Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Trump has not provided evidence for his allegations that the tech companies seek to undermine Republicans or U.S. elections, and some of the examples he has cited to illustrate industry bias have been debunked. For instance, the president has accused Twitter of tampering with his follower count, a charge he repeated Thursday. The company long has said that users with large followings often experience fluctuations as it removes spam.</p><p>\"A lot of bad things are happening,\" he said.</p><p>             Trump's attacks often have come in response to efforts by Facebook, Google and Twitter to remove hate speech, threats of violence and other troubling content from their platforms. These tech giants have been under pressure to address a litany of online ills, including the rise of disinformation, three years after Russian agents spread falsehoods on social media during the 2016 election. But Trump and his close allies have decried some of social media's content-moderation policies as censorship, putting those companies in a political bind.</p><p>\"This is largely, I think, a political event,\" said Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, a Washington-based trade group that represents Facebook, Google and other tech giants. He said there is \"no conservative bias on our platforms.\"</p><p>Some of the conservatives that Trump consulted Thursday have adopted controversial tactics on social media and even have been disciplined by Facebook, Google or Twitter for running afoul of their rules. That includes O'Keefe and Project Veritas, whose secretly recorded video of Google drew Trump's praise Thursday.</p><p>\"Project Veritas can be synergistic with the Trump administration to pull back the curtain surrounding Big Tech,\" O'Keefe said in a statement online after receiving the invitation.</p><p>Other attendees included Ali Alexander, who sent the initial inflammatory tweet questioning whether Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), a Democratic presidential candidate, is actually an \"American black,\" and Jim Hoft, the Gateway Pundit founder who has long been faulted for spreading conspiracy theories online.</p><p>\"After the 2016 election Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon (in advertising) decided the best way to prevent another Trump win was to silence conservative voices in America,\" according to a statement from the Gateway Pundit site. \"The tech giants in two years did more to destroy Freedom of Speech than at any other time in US history.\"</p><p>Initially, the White House had invited Ben Garrison, whose cartoons long have provoked the ire of groups including the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center for including hateful imagery, including anti-Semitism. But the White House this week appeared to rescind its invitation, Garrison tweeted in a statement Wednesday, out of concern his presence would be a \"media distraction from the president's message.\"</p><p>Trump also invited lawmakers such as Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) who have accused Twitter of limiting the reach of their tweets. They were joined by organizations such as the Media Research Center, a conservative group that has called for the breakup of big tech companies, and PragerU, which produces right-leaning videos that it says Google has censored - a matter the two sides are battling in court.</p><p>In an early-morning series of tweets, Trump said that the focus of the conversation would be \"the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies,\" though he did not mention any by name. \"We will not let them get away with it much longer,\" he added.</p><p>             Trump also appeared to suggest social media sites \"would be driven out of business\" once he leaves office in six years - or more, acknowledging he had made a joke about exceeding presidential term limits.</p><p>Some lawmakers bristled at the summit, saying that the Trump administration had missed an opportunity to explore real challenges facing social media ahead of the 2020 election, amid heightened fears about the spread of hate speech and even harder-to-detect viral falsehoods.</p><p>\"It's not surprising that one of the loudest disseminators of misinformation is inviting known extremists and conspiracy theory peddlers to the White House social media summit,\" tweeted Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), who leads the House's top tech committee. \"It's a shame President Trump would prefer to fan the same fires of online social discord that Russia sparked in the 2016 election rather than bring real experts together to address the issue of content moderation in a thoughtful and rational manner.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-be82c98054724fcf8ed54683a07f49a3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJ7-DFJ1-JB4M-V26D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1422\"/><timeReceived>12:28 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000CLIC</classCode><className>SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In doing so, the president also sought to rally his widely followed online allies, whom he described as \"journalists and influencers\" that together can reach roughly half a billion people, entering the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>\"Some of you are extraordinary. The crap you think of is unbelievable,\" Trump said.</p><p>Trump delivered his winding diatribe against Facebook, Google, and Twitter \u2014 charges of political bias that all three companies long have denied \u2014 at an event at the White House featuring Republican lawmakers, GOP campaign strategists, and social-media meme makers, a move that led some critics to express dismay that the president actually aimed to use the policy summit as a reelection push.</p><p>But Democratic lawmakers and watchdog groups said they were most alarmed that Trump had invited supporters who have a history of targeting the president's political opponents with inflammatory tweets, misleading videos, and hard-to-debunk conspiracy theories. At one point, the president praised James O'Keefe, the founder of Project Veritas, which has released widely criticized, highly edited videos of his subjects.</p><p>\"Somebody said he's controversial,\" Trump said. \"He's truthful.\"</p><p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, meanwhile, charged that the president is \"essentially conducting a hate summit at the White House,\" said Heidi Beirich, the director of the group's work to track online extremism.</p><p>Facebook, Google, and Twitter each declined to comment.</p><p>For much of the summit, Twitter appeared to be down, an outage the company said it was investigating. Outside the gathering, Trump's aides appeared to line the hallways with poster boards calling attention to the tech industry's alleged tactics for suppressing conservatives' speech \u2014 along with at least one tweet from Trump himself calling him \"the best\" at using the service.</p><p>And Trump threatened additional scrutiny to come, promising to bring big tech companies to Washington for an upcoming meeting while directing federal agencies to explore \"all regulatory and legislative solutions to protect free speech.\"</p><p>Trump has skewered Facebook, Google, and Twitter for months on allegations that they're biased against conservatives, even accusing them of trying to rig the election. In March, for example, he said the companies had engaged in \"collusion\" and worked in opposition to a \"certain group of people that happen to be in power, that happen to have won the election.\" Repeatedly, the president also has threatened to investigate or regulate Facebook, Google, and Twitter, sparking a series of hearings and similar calls for tough new laws among Republicans on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Trump has not provided evidence for his allegations that the tech companies seek to undermine Republicans or US elections, and some of the examples he's cited to illustrate the industry's bias have been debunked. For example, the president has accused Twitter of tampering with his follower count, a charge he repeated Thursday. The company has said that users with large followings often experience fluctuations as it removes spam.</p><p>\"A lot of bad things are happening,\" he said.</p><p>Trump's attacks often have come in response to efforts by Facebook, Google, and Twitter to remove hate speech, threats of violence, and other troubling content from their platforms. These tech giants have been under pressure to address a litany of online ills, including the rise of disinformation, three years after Russian agents spread falsehoods on social media during the 2016 election. But Trump and his close allies have decried some of social media's content-moderation policies as censorship, putting those companies in a political bind.</p><p>\"This is largely, I think, a political event,\" said Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, a Washington-based trade group that represents Facebook, Google, and other tech giants. He stressed there is \"no conservative bias on our platforms.\"</p><p>Some of the conservatives that Trump consulted Thursday have adopted controversial tactics on social media \u2014 and even have been disciplined by Facebook, Google, or Twitter for running afoul of their rules. That includes O'Keefe and Project Veritas whose secretly recorded video of Google drew Trump's praise on Thursday.</p><p>\"Project Veritas can be synergistic with the Trump administration to pull back the curtain surrounding Big Tech,\" O'Keefe said in a statement online after receiving the invitation.</p><p>Other attendees included Ali Alexander, who sent the initial, inflammatory tweet questioning whether Senator Kamala Harris of California, a Democratic presidential candidate, is actually an \"American black,\" and Jim Hoft, the Gateway Pundit founder who has long been faulted for spreading conspiracy theories online.</p><p>\"After the 2016 election Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon (in advertising) decided the best way to prevent another Trump win was to silence conservative voices in America,\" according to a statement from the Gateway Pundit site. \"The tech giants in two years did more to destroy Freedom of Speech than at any other time in US history.\"</p><p>Initially, the White House had invited Ben Garrison, whose cartoons long have provoked the ire of groups including the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center for including hateful imagery, including anti-Semitism. But the White House this week appeared to rescind its invitation, Garrison tweeted in a statement Wednesday, out of concern his presence would be a \"media distraction from the president's message.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-fb06420e-a423-11e9-8ec5-d9f4fcf3f71f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJC-S8S1-JC2G-C356-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1013\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC000CLIC</classCode><className>SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

'We are taking this very seriously. We are certainly looking at it,' Pompeo told[1] Fox News after being asked about whether President Donald Trump is making a move against the company. </p><p>His comments come as national security experts warn that TikTok, Huawei, and other Chinese tech companies are a threat to national security. 'Whether it was the problems of having Huawei technology in your infrastructure we've gone all over the world and we're making real progress getting that out. We declared ZTE a danger to American national security,' Pompeo said, citing telecommunications companies Huawei[2] and ZTE. 'We have worked on this very issue for a long time,' he said. TikTok dismissed concerns about the company's connection to China, telling CNBC in a statement Monday that the social media app is helmed by a former Disney executive, Keven Mayer. The company hired Mayer in May amid speculation that TikTok operated under the direction of Beijing. 'TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the U.S. We have no higher priority than promoting[3] a safe and secure app experience for our users,' a spokesperson said in a statement, according to CNBC. 'We have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked,' the spokesman added.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) In 2012, Chinese internet entrepreneur Zhang Yiming founded TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, which now has a number of apps including TikTok, where users create and share short dance, lip-sync and comedy videos. The social media app announced[4] in March that it would stop using China-based moderators to monitor overseas content, which will require TikTok to relocate more than 100 China-based moderators to other positions inside the company. Sen. Josh Hawley and other lawmakers have scrutinized the company. Hawley, a Missouri Republican, warned[5]in a March press statement that ByteDance 'includes Chinese Communist Party members in leadership,' adding that, 'TikTok has admitted that it has sent user data to China.' The U.S. Army banned the app on all devices over national security concerns, Hawley said during his 'Dangerous Partners: Big Tech &amp;#38; Beijing[6]' hearing in March. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York has also asked the U.S. intelligence community to assess TikTok's national security risks, saying in a statement in October that such apps could be used to spy on US citizens or become targets of foreign influence campaigns. TikTok joined[7] Twitter and Facebook in plans to suspend requests from Hong Kong officials to review user information after China imposed a law placing heavy regulations on the city's use of the internet. 'In light of recent events, we've decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong,' a company representative said, according to CNBC.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

TikTok dismissed concerns about the company\u2019s connection to China, telling CNBC in a statement Monday that the social media app is helmed by a former Disney executive, Keven Mayer. The company hired Mayer in May amid speculation that TikTok operated under the direction of Beijing.    \u201cTikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy here in the U.S. We have no higher priority than promoting a safe and secure app experience for our users,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement, according to CNBC.    \u201cWe have never provided user data to the Chinese government, nor would we do so if asked,\u201d the spokesman added.   (Article Continues Below Advertisement)    In 2012, Chinese internet entrepreneur Zhang Yiming founded TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, which now has a number of apps including TikTok, where users create and share short dance, lip-sync and comedy videos.    The social media app announced in March that it would stop using China-based moderators to monitor overseas content, which will require TikTok to relocate more than 100 China-based moderators to other positions inside the company. Sen. Josh Hawley and other lawmakers have scrutinized the company.    Hawley, a Missouri Republican, warned  in a March press statement that ByteDance \u201cincludes Chinese Communist Party members in leadership,\u201d adding that, \u201cTikTok has admitted that it has sent user data to China.\u201d    The U.S. Army banned the app on all devices over national security concerns, Hawley said during his \u201c Dangerous Partners: Big Tech &amp; Beijing \u201d hearing in March.    Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York has also asked the U.S. intelligence community to assess TikTok\u2019s national security risks, saying in a statement in October that such apps could be used to spy on US citizens or become targets of foreign influence campaigns.    TikTok joined Twitter and Facebook in plans to suspend requests from Hong Kong officials to review user information after China imposed a law placing heavy regulations on the city\u2019s use of the internet.    \u201cIn light of recent events, we\u2019ve decided to stop operations of the TikTok app in Hong Kong,\u201d a company representative said, according to CNBC.

The lawsuit was brought in June by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a Washington-based tech group funded by Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google and Twitter Inc. It marked the first major legal test of President Donald Trump's directive.    Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting. Trump threatened to scrap or weaken a law known as Section 230, which protects internet companies from litigation over content posted by users.    The lawsuit by CDT argued Trump's social media executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies, will chill future online speech and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online.    The administration argues that the executive order only directs government agencies, and not private companies, to act.    \"The EO challenged here imposes no obligations on any private party,\" said the motion filed by the Department of Justice in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was seen by Reuters.    \"It directs executive officials to take steps that could lead various agencies to examine ... allegations that large social media online platforms have displayed political bias in moderating content,\" the motion said.    The lawsuit reflects long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and social media companies that have become key tools in Trump's political arsenal.    Avery Gardiner, CDT's general counsel, called Trump's executive order \"unconstitutional.\" CDT's lawsuit argues that the White House ran afoul of the First Amendment, which prohibits government officials from retaliating against an individual or entity for engaging in protected speech.    \"Instead of actually trying to address the merits of the issues, and to engage in litigation that will show the severe constitutional deformities of the executive order, it is resorting to legal maneuvering,\" Gardiner said on Wednesday, referring to the Trump administration's move.    The CDT has negotiated a briefing schedule with the DOJ. CDT will be filing its response by the end of August and the government is likely to respond by Sept. 21, she said.    White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration moved to dismiss the case because \"it is not a valid legal argument.\"    \"The left-wing lobbying organization's brief seems to suggest it doesn't understand how administrative action works or possibly that it doesn't understand the nature of the judicial system,\" he told Reuters on Wednesday.    The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.    Twitter called the executive order a \"reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law.\" It declined comment on the CDT lawsuit. Google and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.    Trump's order seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission. At a recent Senate hearing, the agency's chairman, Joseph Simons, said the FTC has not taken any action to enforce the order.    The U.S. Commerce Department has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeking new transparency rules in how social media companies moderate content after Trump's executive order directed the action. Earlier this month FCC Chairman Ajit Pai agreed to open the petition to public comment for 45 days.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The Trump administra...</p><p>Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting.    The Trump administration has filed a motion asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit against the president's executive order targeting social media companies, calling it a \"profound misunderstanding,\" according to a copy of the motion seen by Reuters.   The lawsuit was brought in June by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a Washington-based tech group funded by Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google and Twitter Inc. It marked the first major legal test of President Donald Trump's directive.   Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting. Trump threatened to scrap or weaken a law known as Section 230, which protects internet companies from litigation over content posted by users.   The lawsuit by CDT argued Trump's social media executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies, will chill future online speech and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online.   The administration argues that the executive order only directs government agencies, and not private companies, to act.   \"The EO challenged here imposes no obligations on any private party,\" said the motion filed by the Department of Justice in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was seen by Reuters.   \"It directs executive officials to take steps that could lead various agencies to examine ... allegations that large social media online platforms have displayed political bias in moderating content,\" the motion said.   The lawsuit reflects long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and social media companies that have become key tools in Trump's political arsenal.   Avery Gardiner, CDT's general counsel, called Trump's executive order \"unconstitutional.\" CDT's lawsuit argues that the White House ran afoul of the First Amendment, which prohibits government officials from retaliating against an individual or entity for engaging in protected speech.   \"Instead of actually trying to address the merits of the issues, and to engage in litigation that will show the severe constitutional deformities of the executive order, it is resorting to legal maneuvering,\" Gardiner said on Wednesday, referring to the Trump administration's move.   The CDT has negotiated a briefing schedule with the DOJ. CDT will be filing its response by the end of August and the government is likely to respond by Sept. 21, she said.   White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration moved to dismiss the case because \"it is not a valid legal argument.\"   \"The left-wing lobbying organization's brief seems to suggest it doesn't understand how administrative action works or possibly that it doesn't understand the nature of the judicial system,\" he told Reuters on Wednesday.   The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.   Twitter called the executive order a \"reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law.\" It declined comment on the CDT lawsuit. Google and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.   Trump's order seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission. At a recent Senate hearing, the agency's chairman, Joseph Simons, said the FTC has not taken any action to enforce the order.   The U.S. Commerce Department has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeking new transparency rules in how social media companies moderate content after Trump's executive order directed the action. Earlier this month FCC Chairman Ajit Pai agreed to open the petition to public comment for 45 days.   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The lawsuit was brought in June by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a Washington-based tech group funded by Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Twitter Inc. It marked the first major legal test of President Donald Trump\u2019s directive.    Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting. Trump threatened to scrap or weaken a law known as Section 230, which protects internet companies from litigation over content posted by users.    The lawsuit by CDT argued Trump\u2019s social media executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies, will chill future online speech and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online.    The administration argues that the executive order only directs government agencies, and not private companies, to act.    \u201cThe EO challenged here imposes no obligations on any private party,\u201d said the motion filed by the Department of Justice in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was seen by Reuters.    \u201cIt directs executive officials to take steps that could lead various agencies to examine \u2026 allegations that large social media online platforms have displayed political bias in moderating content,\u201d the motion said.    The lawsuit reflects long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and social media companies that have become key tools in Trump\u2019s political arsenal.    Avery Gardiner, CDT\u2019s general counsel, called Trump\u2019s executive order \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d CDT\u2019s lawsuit argues that the White House ran afoul of the First Amendment, which prohibits government officials from retaliating against an individual or entity for engaging in protected speech.    \u201cInstead of actually trying to address the merits of the issues, and to engage in litigation that will show the severe constitutional deformities of the executive order, it is resorting to legal maneuvering,\u201d Gardiner said on Wednesday, referring to the Trump administration\u2019s move.    The CDT has negotiated a briefing schedule with the DOJ. CDT will be filing its response by the end of August and the government is likely to respond by Sept. 21, she said.    White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration moved to dismiss the case because \u201cit is not a valid legal argument.\u201d    \u201cThe left-wing lobbying organization\u2019s brief seems to suggest it doesn\u2019t understand how administrative action works or possibly that it doesn\u2019t understand the nature of the judicial system,\u201d he told Reuters on Wednesday.    The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.    Twitter called the executive order a \u201creactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law.\u201d It declined comment on the CDT lawsuit. Google and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.    Trump\u2019s order seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission. At a recent Senate hearing, the agency\u2019s chairman, Joseph Simons, said the FTC has not taken any action to enforce the order.    The U.S. Commerce Department has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeking new transparency rules in how social media companies moderate content after Trump\u2019s executive order directed the action. Earlier this month FCC Chairman Ajit Pai agreed to open the petition to public comment for 45 days.

The lawsu...</p><p>The Trump administration has filed a motion asking a court to dismiss a lawsuit against the president's executive order targeting social media companies, calling it a \"profound misunderstanding,\" according to a copy of the motion seen by Reuters.   The lawsuit was brought in June by the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), a Washington-based tech group funded by Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google and Twitter Inc. It marked the first major legal test of President Donald Trump's directive.   Trump issued an executive order in May against social media companies in an attempt to regulate platforms where he has been criticized, just days after Twitter took the rare step of fact-checking one of his tweets about mail-in voting. Trump threatened to scrap or weaken a law known as Section 230, which protects internet companies from litigation over content posted by users.   The lawsuit by CDT argued Trump's social media executive order violates the First Amendment rights of social media companies, will chill future online speech and reduce the ability of Americans to speak freely online.   The administration argues that the executive order only directs government agencies, and not private companies, to act.   \"The EO challenged here imposes no obligations on any private party,\" said the motion filed by the Department of Justice in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was seen by Reuters.   \"It directs executive officials to take steps that could lead various agencies to examine ... allegations that large social media online platforms have displayed political bias in moderating content,\" the motion said.   The lawsuit reflects long-simmering tensions between the Trump administration and social media companies that have become key tools in Trump's political arsenal.   Avery Gardiner, CDT's general counsel, called Trump's executive order \"unconstitutional.\" CDT's lawsuit argues that the White House ran afoul of the First Amendment, which prohibits government officials from retaliating against an individual or entity for engaging in protected speech.   \"Instead of actually trying to address the merits of the issues, and to engage in litigation that will show the severe constitutional deformities of the executive order, it is resorting to legal maneuvering,\" Gardiner said on Wednesday, referring to the Trump administration's move.   The CDT has negotiated a briefing schedule with the DOJ. CDT will be filing its response by the end of August and the government is likely to respond by Sept. 21, she said.   White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration moved to dismiss the case because \"it is not a valid legal argument.\"   \"The left-wing lobbying organization's brief seems to suggest it doesn't understand how administrative action works or possibly that it doesn't understand the nature of the judicial system,\" he told Reuters on Wednesday.   The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.   Twitter called the executive order a \"reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law.\" It declined comment on the CDT lawsuit. Google and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.   Trump's order seeks to channel complaints about political bias to the Federal Trade Commission. At a recent Senate hearing, the agency's chairman, Joseph Simons, said the FTC has not taken any action to enforce the order.   The U.S. Commerce Department has petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) seeking new transparency rules in how social media companies moderate content after Trump's executive order directed the action. Earlier this month FCC Chairman Ajit Pai agreed to open the petition to public comment for 45 days.

And President Donald Trump pushed his campaign against Big Tech on Wednesday, touting curbs on legal protections for social media platforms he denounces as biased against conservative views.    \u201cIn recent years, a small group of technology platforms have tightened their grip over commerce and communications in America,\u201d Trump declared at a White House event with Attorney General William Barr and Republican attorneys general from several states. \u201cThey\u2019ve used this power to engage in unscrupulous business practices while simultaneously waging war on free enterprise and free expression.\u201d    The anticipated lawsuit against Google by the Justice Department could be the government\u2019s biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the ground-breaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.    Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.    For over a year, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have pursued sweeping antitrust investigations of big tech companies, looking at whether Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have hurt competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. And a bipartisan coalition of 50 US states and territories, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, announced a year ago on the steps of the Supreme Court that they were investigating Google\u2019s business practices. They cited \u201cpotential monopolistic behaviour.\u201d    Now with some 40 days to the presidential election, the Justice Department appears to be approaching legal action against Google and soliciting the support of state attorneys general on an issue of rare bipartisan agreement, while Trump appeals to his political base by amplifying a longstanding grievance of conservatives against Silicon Valley.    Along with the antitrust drive, the Justice Department has asked Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms like Facebook, Google and Twitter, putting down a legislative marker in Trump\u2019s drive against the social media giants. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.    Trump signed an executive order earlier this year challenging the protections from lawsuits under a 1996 telecommunications law that have served as the foundation for unfettered speech on the internet.    The White House said Wednesday the legislative proposal would protect the open internet and prevent hidden manipulation by social media. In addition, Barr said, the government will provide individuals the ability to pursue legal claims against online platforms for \u201cbad-faith censorship.\u201d    Social media platforms can abuse consumers\u2019 trust \u201cby deciding which voices they are going to amplify and which they are going to throttle, and by improperly tracking, collecting user data and even facilitating criminal activity,\u201d Barr said.    Separately, the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust officials are expected to discuss their planned action on Google in Washington meetings and a conference call with the state attorneys general on Thursday.    \u201cBig Tech has a powerful influence on commerce and our daily lives, warranting significant scrutiny,\u201d Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAny effort to abuse that influence for competitive gain calls for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws.\u201d    Support from the states would bolster the Justice Department\u2019s case against Google. It\u2019s a tricky political calculus for states, however. If a Biden administration takes over next year, the status of the lawsuit against Google would be unclear. A state signing on to the federal case also could limit the tools, such as state consumer laws, that it might want to use to pursue its own action _ and the political benefit locally of taking up a cause for consumers.    Some Republican attorneys general could be expected to join the federal case, while another group of states may opt to pursue their own actions.    The Trump administration has long had Google in its sights. A top economic adviser to the president said two years ago that the White House was considering whether Google searches should be subject to government regulation. Trump himself has often criticized Google, recycling unfounded claims by conservatives that the search giant is biased against conservatives and suppresses their viewpoints, interferes with U.S. elections and prefers working with the Chinese military over the Pentagon.    The company, based in Mountain View, California, has denied the claims and insists that it never ranks search results to manipulate political views. Google has argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. It maintains that its services face ample competition and have unleashed innovations that help people manage their lives. Most of its services are offered for free in exchange for personal information that helps Google sell its ads.    A House Judiciary subcommittee has pursued its own bipartisan sweeping investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance. The panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., accused Google in a July hearing of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites, and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost profits.    Antitrust regulators in Europe have cracked down on Google in recent years by imposing multibillion-dollar fines and ordering changes to its practices.    Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., controls about 90% of global web searches. Its dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data. Google dwarfs other search competitors such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing and Yelp, and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favouring its own products over competitors at the top of search results.    Google also owns the leading web browser in Chrome, the world\u2019s largest mobile operating system in Android, the top video site in YouTube and the most popular digital mapping system.

He\u2019s trying to build evidence, and a bipartisan consensus, for changing the laws.</p><p>Antitrust had been dormant in Congress for years. But under Mr. Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, the panel has opened an investigation, held hearings and collected thousands of documents into possible anticompetitive practices by Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Antitrust experts say this is the most serious congressional inquiry into potential anticompetitive corporate behavior in decades.</p><p>The stagnant incomes of middle-class workers and the growing wealth gap in the U.S. are at least partly related to an increasing concentration of economic power, and in particular, the market clout of the tech giants, Mr. Cicilline has come to believe.</p><p>His panel plans to complete its investigation and publish its findings and recommendations early next year. The prospect for legislative action hinges on several unknowns.

The agencies have lengthy standards for reviewing horizontal mergers, in which a company buys a direct competitor.The rules covering vertical mergers, where a company buys a supplier \u2014 such as a pay-TV provider buying a network \u2014 are shorter and haven't been updated in decades. Details: Under the guidelines, a would-be vertical merger could be deemed harmful if there's evidence that it would help the buyer raise costs for competitors, shut rivals out of markets or access sensitive information that would give it a competitive edge.Yes, but: The standards that the agencies are looking to codify with the new guidelines include some of the very factors the Justice Department used in trying to block the merger between distributor AT...nd content provider Time Warner. </p><p>That case failed to convince a federal judge, and the companies closed their deal.What they're saying: The FTC's two Democratic commissioners both said they're in favor of updating the vertical merger guidelines, but couldn't support the proposal as written. Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said in a statement[2] that her \"biggest concern\" involves a note in the guidelines that regulators are unlikely to challenge mergers proposed by companies that control less than 20% of the market in which they operate.Fellow Democrat Rohit Chopra said[3] the proposed rules \"clearly fall short\" and should have included more metrics for weighing if a merger will hurt competition. Between the lines: The cooperation between the two agencies comes at a time of some tension over the antitrust investigations[4] of the major tech platforms and the Justice Department's weighing in[5] against the FTC's case against Qualcomm.What's next: The agencies are taking comments on the guidelines until Feb. 11. After that, they can move toward finalizing and adopting them.Go deeper: T-Mobile's trial to close Sprint merger heads toward closing arguments[6] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1233741/download?utm_medium=email..._source=govdelivery\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1233741/download?utm_medium=email..._source=govdelivery</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2020/01/statement-rebecca-kelly-slaughter-ftc-doj-draft-vertical-merger-guidelines\">https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2020/01/statement-rebecca-kelly-slaughter-ftc-doj-draft-vertical-merger-guidelines</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2020/01/statement-commissioner-rohit-chopra-regarding-request-comment-vertical\">https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2020/01/statement-commissioner-rohit-chopra-regarding-request-comment-vertical</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-antitrust-enforcers-signal-discord-over-probes-of-big-tech-11568663356\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-antitrust-enforcers-signal-discord-over-probes-of-big-tech-11568663356</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.law360.com/technology/articles/1233177/doj-wants-to-argue-against-ftc-in-qualcomm-s-appeal\">https://www.law360.com/technology/articles/1233177/doj-wants-to-argue-against-ftc-in-qualcomm-s-appeal</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/t-mobile-sprint-merger-california-new-york-trial-c7a32b88-65f2-4925-a3d7-acc2e40de1d7.html\">https://www.axios.com/t-mobile-sprint-merger-california-new-york-trial-c7a32b88-65f2-4925-a3d7-acc2e40de1d7.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544157893363844975776100131</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYX-89X1-F03R-N52D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"538\"/><timeReceived>4:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 13, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

In prior years, the event has drawn fewer senior U.S. officials -- typically just one cabinet official -- and did not draw any in 2019 because of a government shutdown.\u00a0The event, which runs from Jan. 7-10, draws more 175,000 visitors and 4,500 companies exhibiting new technologies, including airlines, automakers, battery manufacturers and hundreds of tech start-ups.\u00a0The White House has touted technology improvements as a way to boost U.S. employment and is working to ease regulatory barriers to advanced technologies like drones and self-driving cars. At the same time, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are probing whether big tech firms like Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc, Amazon.com and Apple Inc are violating antitrust laws.\u00a0The largest tech firms generally skip CES in favor of holding their own events.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Federal Communications Commission<br/>\u00a0Chairman Ajit Pai and Federal Trade Commission Chairman Joseph Simons will speak at a fireside chat, and three of the other four FCC commissioners will attend as will two other FTC commissioners.\u00a0</p><p><br/>Pai has proposed shifting part of a block spectrum set aside for auto safety to accommodate the rapidly growing number of wireless devices. Numerous companies are displaying new wireless devices at CES. Chao is expected to talk about self-driving car policies.\u00a0<br/>Elena Hernandez, spokeswoman for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said Friday that Kratsios will be at CES to discuss the administration's national strategy for artificial intelligence launched in 2018.\u00a0<br/>\"Recognizing the significance of technology on the American workforce, our national security, and the U.S. economy, the Trump administration continues to make leadership in the cutting-edge industries of the future a top priority,\" Hernandez said. President Donald Trump, who has had strained relations with technology companies and criticized several major firms for alleged bias against conservatives, has met repeatedly with major tech company CEOs since taking office, including meetings in 2019 with the chief executives of Facebook, Apple and\u00a0<br/>Google<br/>.\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-492913</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY8-CHW1-JBYT-H422-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"441\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Driving the Day    VIRUS EMERGENCY DECLARATION TO CONTINUE, OFFICIALS SAY \u2014 In  a move that could assuage concerns that pandemic telehealth coverage will end abruptly in a matter of weeks, Vice President Mike Pence signaled to governors the administration\u2019s plans to extend the public health emergency before it expires, our colleagues Rachel Roubein and Adam Cancryn report.    Without an extension, temporary flexibilities encouraging rapid telehealth adoption would expire, including Medicare\u2019s waiver to pay for more telehealth services for more patients. Federal law typically limits telehealth coverage to rural patients; Medicare went from covering a few thousand telehealth visits a week to more than a million a week during the pandemic period.   The emergency also  gives FDA authority to usher through a breadth of digital health products aimed at easing care from a distance.   Uncertainty about whether these allowances will last past the emergency may be discouraging clinics from investing in telehealth long-term, and some are already returning to in-person care as the end date of the current emergency declaration approaches, recent research suggests. HHS must renew public health emergencies every 90 days; the current one expires July 25.   Powerful lobbying groups including the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association have urged regulators and policymakers to make some of the recent telehealth changes permanent or to at least temporarily extend some waivers.   The recent flexibilities \u201cprovided for a better patient experience and high-quality outcomes in the long term, regardless of whether they are operating in a public health emergency environment,\u201d AHA said to CMS last month.   FUNDING BOOSTS \u2014 Several health institutions are going to enjoy funding boosts, even amid these straitened times:   \u2014 Startups: Many veteran digital health watchers expected economic uncertainty and turbulence to keep startup funding grounded in 2020 \u2014 and those observers are, at least so far, wrong. Investors at Rock Health say the digital health sector\u2019s boom times have continued, with startups raising $5.4 billion through the first half of the year. That\u2019s a record \u2014 and more than the sector raised in the entirety of 2016.   Funding is particularly concentrated in behavioral health, on-demand health care and monitoring, dovetailing well with the demands of the pandemic: a need to attend to mental health, while not crowding people together.   It\u2019s not all sunshine for startups: Exits have mixed news. The investors say acquisitions of startups are on a downward trend, which complicates the process for investors\u2019 cashing out. Stock markets\u2019 boffo performance \u2014 with digital health companies surging by 30 percent \u2014 surely cheers investors and their startups.   \u2014 Appropriations: HHS and FDA are in line for modest funding boosts \u2014 at least if the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has its way. Under the House appropriations draft bills, HHS funding would rise by $1.5 billion , while FDA would get a more modest $40 million bump .   HHS RULES FINALIZED \u2014 HHS quietly finalized its landmark health IT rules, with both taking effect June 30. That process starts the clock ticking on future compliance and enforcement of the wide-ranging regulations, whose effects include making patient data available for downloading to smartphones and enforcing information blocking.   Portions of the rules will become applicable at the end of the year; enforcement of the application programming interface rules \u2014 which will allow more apps to access patient data \u2014 will begin July 2021 under current timelines.   As we\u2019ve previously written, HHS delayed enforcement of the rules back in April amid concern that compliance with the rules would unduly stress providers and hospitals while they\u2019re trying to manage the coronavirus pandemic.

CONTACT TRACING BLUES \u2014 Contact tracing continues to pick its way through tricky ground:   \u2014 Apps have weak security: The early contact-tracing apps are easy prey for hackers , with vulnerabilities allowing them to scoop up sensitive health data. The data could also be used for mischief \u2014 for example, by flooding regions with spurious coronavirus positives, disrupting elections or other activities.   The problem is international. In the U.S., where the technology is starting to ramp up, the patchwork of apps has privacy weaknesses \u2014 for example, North Dakota\u2019s app sent location data to social media firm Foursquare.   \u201cThe speed and scale transitioned at such a rate that they didn't really consider security in the beginning,\u201d one expert told our Cybersecurity colleague Tim Starks. \u201cIt was a topic for them, but not top of mind.\u201d   \u2014 Subpoenas for contact tracing compliance?: Rockland County in New York has been using subpoenas to ensure cooperation with contact tracing, our colleague Amanda Eisenberg reports . Eight individuals had been withholding information from the tracers about a recent party they\u2019d gathered in.   \u2014 Flights lagging: Data-sharing on the passengers of international flights has stalled, complicating efforts to contact trace, our colleague Brianna Gurciullo reports . It\u2019s been difficult for airlines and travel websites to funnel information to the CDC.     What We're Reading    Big tech companies have health ambitions \u2014 but haven\u2019t been doing much visible work to bridge racial disparities, STAT reports .   Google searches can reveal coronavirus hotspots before official government statistics, OneZero reports .   ONC should prioritize measurement efforts to track the effects of its big health IT rules, a trio of UCSF officials write in Health Affairs .   Price transparency won\u2019t pave the way to a low-cost health system, researchers write in the British Medical Journal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42548677180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609M-4RN1-JCSC-J51G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1300\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Politico</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FOOD &amp;

And more. But first, the jump.    eHealth tweet of the day: Pearl Freier @PearlF \u201cOH on Zoom: I\u2019m not a doctor but I play one on Twitter\u201d    WEDNESDAY: Hoping everyone had a nice, restful Fourth of July weekend. It\u2019s a bit of a clich\u00e9, but your correspondent had a happy break hiking and watching Hamilton for the first time. Share your Fourth experiences by email at [email protected] . Discuss the Fourth socially @dariustahir, @ravindranize, @POLITICOPro and @Morning_eHealth.    VIRUS EMERGENCY DECLARATION TO CONTINUE, OFFICIALS SAY \u2014 In  a move that could assuage concerns that pandemic telehealth coverage will end abruptly in a matter of weeks, Vice President Mike Pence signaled to governors the administration\u2019s plans to extend the public health emergency before it expires, our colleagues Rachel Roubein and Adam Cancryn report.    Without an extension, temporary flexibilities encouraging rapid telehealth adoption would expire, including Medicare\u2019s waiver to pay for more telehealth services for more patients. Federal law typically limits telehealth coverage to rural patients; Medicare went from covering a few thousand telehealth visits a week to more than a million a week during the pandemic period.    The emergency also  gives FDA authority to usher through a breadth of digital health products aimed at easing care from a distance.    Uncertainty about whether these allowances will last past the emergency may be discouraging clinics from investing in telehealth long-term, and some are already returning to in-person care as the end date of the current emergency declaration approaches, recent research suggests. HHS must renew public health emergencies every 90 days; the current one expires July 25.    Powerful lobbying groups including the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association have urged regulators and policymakers to make some of the recent telehealth changes permanent or to at least temporarily extend some waivers.    The recent flexibilities \u201cprovided for a better patient experience and high-quality outcomes in the long term, regardless of whether they are operating in a public health emergency environment,\u201d AHA said to CMS last month.    FUNDING BOOSTS \u2014 Several health institutions are going to enjoy funding boosts, even amid these straitened times:    \u2014 Startups: Many veteran digital health watchers expected economic uncertainty and turbulence to keep startup funding grounded in 2020 \u2014 and those observers are, at least so far, wrong. Investors at Rock Health say the digital health sector\u2019s boom times have continued, with startups raising $5.4 billion through the first half of the year. That\u2019s a record \u2014 and more than the sector raised in the entirety of 2016.     Funding is particularly concentrated in behavioral health, on-demand health care and monitoring, dovetailing well with the demands of the pandemic: a need to attend to mental health, while not crowding people together.    It\u2019s not all sunshine for startups: Exits have mixed news. The investors say acquisitions of startups are on a downward trend, which complicates the process for investors\u2019 cashing out. Stock markets\u2019 boffo performance \u2014 with digital health companies surging by 30 percent \u2014 surely cheers investors and their startups.    \u2014 Appropriations: HHS and FDA are in line for modest funding boosts \u2014 at least if the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has its way. Under the House appropriations draft bills, HHS funding would rise by $1.5 billion, while FDA would get a more modest $40 million bump.    HHS RULES FINALIZED \u2014 HHS quietly finalized its landmark health IT rules, with both taking effect June 30. That process starts the clock ticking on future compliance and enforcement of the wide-ranging regulations, whose effects include making patient data available for downloading to smartphones and enforcing information blocking.    Portions of the rules will become applicable at the end of the year; enforcement of the application programming interface rules \u2014 which will allow more apps to access patient data \u2014 will begin July 2021 under current timelines.    As we\u2019ve previously written, HHS delayed enforcement of the rules back in April amid concern that compliance with the rules would unduly stress providers and hospitals while they\u2019re trying to manage the coronavirus pandemic.    CONTACT TRACING BLUES \u2014 Contact tracing continues to pick its way through tricky ground:    \u2014 Apps have weak security: The early contact-tracing apps are easy prey for hackers, with vulnerabilities allowing them to scoop up sensitive health data. The data could also be used for mischief \u2014 for example, by flooding regions with spurious coronavirus positives, disrupting elections or other activities.    The problem is international. In the U.S., where the technology is starting to ramp up, the patchwork of apps has privacy weaknesses \u2014 for example, North Dakota\u2019s app sent location data to social media firm Foursquare.    \u201cThe speed and scale transitioned at such a rate that they didn\u2019t really consider security in the beginning,\u201d one expert told our Cybersecurity colleague Tim Starks. \u201cIt was a topic for them, but not top of mind.\u201d    \u2014 Subpoenas for contact tracing compliance?: Rockland County in New York has been using subpoenas to ensure cooperation with contact tracing, our colleague Amanda Eisenberg reports. Eight individuals had been withholding information from the tracers about a recent party they\u2019d gathered in.    \u2014 Flights lagging: Data-sharing on the passengers of international flights has stalled, complicating efforts to contact trace, our colleague Brianna Gurciullo reports. It\u2019s been difficult for airlines and travel websites to funnel information to the CDC.    Big tech companies have health ambitions \u2014 but haven\u2019t been doing much visible work to bridge racial disparities, STAT reports.    Google searches can reveal coronavirus hotspots before official government statistics, OneZero reports.    ONC should prioritize measurement efforts to track the effects of its big health IT rules, a trio of UCSF officials write in Health Affairs.    Price transparency won\u2019t pave the way to a low-cost health system, researchers write in the British Medical Journal.
