According to the Wall Street Journal[2]:Mr. Trump attacked social-media companies he says are trying to silence individuals and groups with right-leaning views, without presenting specific evidence. He said he was directing his administration to 'explore all legislative and regulatory solutions to protect free speech and the free speech of all Americans.''Big Tech must not censor the voices of the American people,' Mr. Trump told a crowd of more than 100 allies who cheered him on. 'This new technology is so important and it has to be used fairly.'Despite the simplistic narrative[3] tying President Trump's vision of the world to conservatism, there is nothing conservative about his views on the First Amendment and how it applies to social media companies. </p><p>I have noted in several[4] places[5] before that there is a conflict of visions[6] when it comes to whether the First Amendment protects a negative or positive conception of free speech. For those unfamiliar with the distinction: it comes from philosopher Isaiah Berlin,[7] who identified negative liberty as freedom from external interference, and positive liberty as freedom to do something, including having the power and resources necessary to do that thing. Discussions of the First Amendment's protection of free speech often elide over this distinction.With respect to speech, the negative conception of liberty recognizes that individual property owners can control what is said on their property, for example. To force property owners to allow speakers/speech on their property that they don't desire would actually be a violation of their liberty \u2014 what the Supreme Court calls 'compelled speech.'[8] The First Amendment, consistent with this view, generally protects speech from government interference (with very few, narrow exceptions), while allowing private regulation of speech (again, with very few, narrow exceptions).Contrary to the original meaning of the First Amendment and the weight of Supreme Court precedent, President Trump's view of the First Amendment is that it protects a positive conception of liberty \u2014 one under which the government, in order to facilitate its conception of 'free speech,' has the right and even the duty to impose restrictions on how private actors regulate speech on their property (in this case, social media companies).But if Trump's view were adopted, discretion as to what is necessary to facilitate free speech would be left to future presidents and congresses, undermining the bedrock conservative principle of the Constitution as a shield against government regulation, all falsely in the name of protecting speech. This is counter to the general approach of modern conservatism (but not, of course, necessarily Republicanism[9]) in the United States, including that of many of President Trump's own judicial and agency appointees. Indeed, it is actually more consistent with the views of modern progressives \u2014 especially within the FCC.For instance, the current conservative bloc on the Supreme Court (over the dissent of the four liberal Justices) recently reaffirmed the view that the First Amendment applies only to state action in Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck[10]. The opinion, written by Trump-appointee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, states plainly that: Ratified in 1791, the First Amendment provides in relevant part that 'Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.' Ratified in 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment makes the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause applicable against the States: 'No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .' 1. The text and original meaning of those Amendments, as well as this Court's longstanding precedents, establish that the Free Speech Clause prohibits only governmental abridgment of speech. The Free Speech Clause does not prohibit private abridgment of speech In accord with the text and structure of the Constitution, this Court's state-action doctrine distinguishes the government from individuals and private entities. By enforcing that constitutional boundary between the governmental and the private, the state-action doctrine protects a robust sphere of individual liberty. (Emphasis added). Former Stanford Law dean and First Amendment scholar, Kathleen Sullivan, has summed up[11] the very different approaches to free speech pursued by conservatives and progressives (insofar as they are represented by the 'conservative' and 'liberal' blocs on the Supreme Court):In the first vision, free speech rights serve an overarching interest in political equality. Free speech as equality embraces first an antidiscrimination principle: in upholding the speech rights of anarchists, syndicalists, communists, civil rights marchers, Maoist flag burners, and other marginal, dissident, or unorthodox speakers, the Court protects members of ideological minorities who are likely to be the target of the majority's animus or selective indifference. By invalidating conditions on speakers' use of public land, facilities, and funds, a long line of speech cases in the free-speech-as-equality tradition ensures public subvention of speech expressing 'the poorly financed causes of little people.' On the equality-based view of free speech, it follows that the well-financed causes of big people (or big corporations) do not merit special judicial protection from political regulation. And because, in this view, the value of equality is prior to the value of speech, politically disadvantaged speech prevails over regulation but regulation promoting political equality prevails over speech.The second vision of free speech, by contrast, sees free speech as serving the interest of political liberty. On this view, the First Amendment is a negative check on government tyranny, and treats with skepticism all government efforts at speech suppression that might skew the private ordering of ideas. And on this view, members of the public are trusted to make their own individual evaluations of speech, and government is forbidden to intervene for paternalistic or redistributive reasons. Government intervention might be warranted to correct certain allocative inefficiencies in the way that speech transactions take place, but otherwise, ideas are best left to a freely competitive ideological market.The outcome of Citizens United is best explained as representing a triumph of the libertarian over the egalitarian vision of free speech. Justice Kennedy's opinion for the Court, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, articulates a robust vision of free speech as serving political liberty; the dissenting opinion by Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, sets forth in depth the countervailing egalitarian view. (Emphasis added).President Trump's views on the regulation of private speech are alarmingly consistent with those embraced by the Court's progressives to 'protect[] members of ideological minorities who are likely to be the target of the majority's animus or selective indifference' \u2014 exactly the sort of conservative 'victimhood'[12] that Trump and his online supporters have somehow concocted to describe themselves.Trump's views are also consistent with those of progressives[13] who, since the Reagan FCC abolished it in 1987, have consistently angled for a resurrection[14] of some form of fairness doctrine, as well as other policies inconsistent with the 'free-speech-as-liberty' view. Thus Democratic commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel takes a far more interventionist approach to private speech[15]:The First Amendment does more than protect the interests of corporations. As courts have long recognized, it is a force to support individual interest in self-expression and the right of the public to receive information and ideas. As Justice Black so eloquently put it, 'the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public.' Our leased access rules provide opportunity for civic participation. They enhance the marketplace of ideas by increasing the number of speakers and the variety of viewpoints. They help preserve the possibility of a diverse, pluralistic medium\u2014just as Congress called for the Cable Communications Policy Act The proper inquiry then, is not simply whether corporations providing channel capacity have First Amendment rights, but whether this law abridges expression that the First Amendment was meant to protect. Here, our leased access rules are not content-based and their purpose and effect is to promote free speech. Moreover, they accomplish this in a narrowly-tailored way that does not substantially burden more speech than is necessary to further important interests. In other words, they are not at odds with the First Amendment, but instead help effectuate its purpose for all of us. (Emphasis added).Consistent with the progressive approach, this leaves discretion in the hands of 'experts' (like Rosenworcel) to determine what needs to be done in order to protect the underlying value of free speech in the First Amendment through government regulation, even if it means compelling speech upon private actors.Trump's view of what the First Amendment's free speech protections entail when it comes to social media companies is inconsistent with the conception of the Constitution-as-guarantor-of-negative-liberty that conservatives have long embraced.Of course, this is not merely a 'conservative' position; it is fundamental to the longstanding bipartisan approach to free speech generally and to the regulation of online platforms specifically. As a diverse group of 75 scholars and civil society groups (including ICLE[16]) wrote yesterday in their 'Principles for Lawmakers on Liability for User-Generated Content Online[17]':Principle #2: Any new intermediary liability law must not target constitutionally protected speech.The government shouldn't require\u2014or coerce\u2014intermediaries to remove constitutionally protected speech that the government cannot prohibit directly. Such demands violate the First Amendment. Also, imposing broad liability for user speech incentivizes services to err on the side of taking down speech, resulting in overbroad censorship\u2014or even avoid offering speech forums altogether.As those principles suggest, the sort of platform regulation that Trump, et al. advocate \u2014 essentially a 'fairness doctrine' for the Internet[18] \u2014 is the opposite of free speech:Principle #4: Section 230 does not, and should not, require 'neutrality.'Publishing third-party content online never can be 'neutral.' Indeed, every publication decision will necessarily prioritize some content at the expense of other content. Even an 'objective' approach, such as presenting content in reverse chronological order, isn't neutral because it prioritizes recency over other values. By protecting the prioritization, de-prioritization, and removal of content, Section 230 provides Internet services with the legal certainty they need to do the socially beneficial work of minimizing harmful content.The idea that social media should be subject to a nondiscrimination requirement \u2014 for which President Trump[19] and others like Senator Josh Hawley[20] have been arguing lately \u2014 is flatly contrary to Section 230 \u2014 as well as to the First Amendment.Conservatives upset about 'social media discrimination' need to think hard about whether they really want to adopt this sort of position out of convenience, when the tradition with which they align rejects it \u2014 rightly \u2014 in nearly all other venues. Even if you believe that Facebook, Google, and Twitter are trying to make it harder for conservative voices to be heard (despite all evidence to the contrary[21]), it is imprudent to reject constitutional first principles for a temporary policy victory. In fact, there's nothing at all 'conservative' about an abdication of the traditional principle linking freedom to property[22] for the sake of political expediency.

Alas, the much-expected \"techlash\" has not materialized: Silicon Valley still stands unscathed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This might, of course, change in 2020, especially under a president like Elizabeth Warren. It's easy to mistake her populist stance - let's just break up the tech giants! - for some kind of leftism; it isn't. Hers is a mere repetition of the (neo)liberal creed that well-policed, competitive markets will yield prosperity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A Warren-style critique of big tech accepts, as a matter of fact, that some \"smaller tech\" is on the horizon. This populist account rests on a powerful myth of domestic politics gone wrong. It presents the rise of big tech as a series of policy errors by distracted or corrupt technocratic regulators, not the result of careful policy planning by a different set of Washington elites, keen to use every tool in their arsenal to consolidate America's power globally.</p><p>Focused almost entirely on domestic affairs, the Warren-style account rarely situates big tech alongside big money - Saudi Arabia, SoftBank and JP Morgan - and big state - the Pentagon, with its massive contracting orders, and the NSA, with its massive spying apparatus. Positioned properly inside this troika, big tech emerges as an almost inevitable consequence of global financialized and militarized capitalism.</p><p>Not surprisingly, this account remains blind to the real reason American big tech is not smaller: big money and the big state need it to remain big. The former to make sure Wall Street can recoup its loss-making investments, the latter to ensure that America's defense and intelligence needs are met swiftly, efficiently and on the cheap.</p><p>Positioned properly inside this troika, big tech emerges as an almost inevitable consequence of global financialized and militarized capitalism</p><p>Making big tech smaller, thus, can only be accomplished by trying to rein in the powers of Wall Street and the Pentagon and accepting that America should play a humble role in the global order. None of this is likely to happen, especially given American anxieties about China's global ascent in all three dimensions - technology, finance and military might.</p><p>A smaller tech means America losing its ability to project its power geopolitically; the odds that the Pentagon, Wall Street, and Silicon Valley - let alone the \"America first\" Trump administration - would agree to this are nil. They will probably remain nil even if someone like Warren - whose foreign policy views are rather conventional, even by Washington standards - gets elected.</p><p>The powers of the nefarious troika of the big tech, big money, and big state could - and should be - contested. But this has to be done directly - by explicitly invoking and contesting the links between the financial, military, and technology dimensions of US power - and not indirectly, by discussing natural tendencies towards monopolization in digital capitalism.</p><p>The first approach lends itself to a properly progressive political agenda; the second only to the utopian expectations that the new generation of smarter technocrats could resolve the contradictions of global capitalism.</p><p>In the absence of such a program, what should leftists do? They should ditch the \"big tech v small tech\" dichotomy and speak of corporate v non-corporate tech instead. Whether such tech is small or big is often besides the point; bigness, especially when it comes to the provision of networked public goods like artificial intelligence, is no sign of reaction.</p><p>The ownership - not just of companies but also of sensors, networks, data and services - is more important than the size of the key players. But this doesn't mean that we should follow the likes of Warren in treating them as utilities; to do so would be to impose a ban on the kind of institutional imagination that the rise of digital technologies should have provoked - but still hasn't - on the left.</p><p>The utilities model is problematic for many reasons, the chief of which is that data - the intimate residue of our intellectual, social and political life - is definitely not like water, gas and electricity (let alone oil) in one key respect: suffused with meaning, data lends itself to a multiplicity of interpretations and action plans.</p><p>How this total ensemble of meanings and actions get assembled, by whom, and with what rationale is not a question that can be answered, with any certainty, in advance. This data ensemble can work to empower the advertising industry or feed the electrical disinformation campaigns or help banks extend more loans - ie ensure that the wheels of capitalism roll smoothly.</p><p>This, however, cannot be the project of those whose heart is on the left. Surely, this ensemble, properly arranged and stimulated, can also seed more non-market behaviors, grounded in solidarity and mutual respect? Couldn't it do to the knowledge society what the welfare state did for the industrial society, ie create the durable foundations for human flourishing at a time when capitalism has penetrated the most intimate facets of human existence?</p><p>In pigeonholing the solutions to the problem of big tech into the institutional straitjacket of the older utilities model, are we not giving up the opportunity to create a radically new institutional landscape - one which will de-commodify everyday life the same way the welfare state de-commodified working life almost a century earlier?</p><p>This genuinely leftwing agenda doesn't provide a simplistic, clean, but ultimately utopian answer along the lines of \"small\" or \"humane\" tech. But in calling out big tech as a function of American corporate power it at least gets the diagnosis right.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-58222494</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM2-1V41-JCJY-G46F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"944\"/><timeReceived>11:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Many dealmakers say only few-and-far-between transactions above $30 billion or $40 billion deserve the moniker, while others settle for deals worth much less as the largest mergers in recent years have come together far less frequently and faced scrupulous regulatory review.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For still others, like Latham &amp; Watkins LLP partner Adel Aslani-Far, this may soon be a distinction without a difference, as Aslani-Far sees increasing certainty that both types of deals will play a major role in 2018 and the years ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Days before Christmas, as the 10-year Latham partner and former Global Co-chair of M&amp;A was working through the early innings of one deal while simultaneously attempting to close another-all while trying to figure out when he would have time to do some last minute gift shopping-Aslani-Far's hesitation in calling 2018 the year of the megadeal all but faded away.</p><p>\"We have had historically high levels of corporate cash, and those levels are about to get higher in terms of the U.S. ability to tap into repatriation,\" Aslani-Far opined. \"Couple that with low financing costs, and increased boardroom confidence thanks to reduced uncertainty on policy with the passing and signing of the tax reform law.\"</p><p>No doubt 2018 may have stood to be a big year for deals even before President Donald Trump signed into law the GOP tax bill. But there is no one arguing a corporate tax rate of 21% versus the prior 34% won't have strategics salivating at deal opportunities, especially in the industrials space, where some of the most mature global businesses play ball.</p><p>\"Yes, this bill is definitely good for M&amp;A and definitely good for M&amp;A above $5 billion,\" Aslani-Far asserted. \"Now, how much of that is industrials versus other sectors is uncertain, but industrials should benefit.\"</p><p>Since the passing of the tax legislation, much of the talk has been on how big tech companies such as Apple Inc. (AAPL), with its $600 billion overseas cash horde, will put cash to work with new incentives in place to repatriate cash.</p><p>But big industrials have cash trapped overseas as well, Aslani-Far argued.</p><p>\"Many of these companies were among the first U.S. businesses to expand internationally,\" he explained. \"They are the most mature businesses we know, and probably a function of that is the need to seek out strategic growth, perhaps more so than other businesses. Many of these companies are now bumping into limitations of continued growth organically.\"</p><p>Indeed, diversified industrial giants such as Honeywell International Inc. (HON) have already signaled the intent of putting repatriated cash to work for M&amp;A. The company said Jan. 26 it will be repatriating $7 billion of cash over the next two years, providing the dry powder to \"aggressively\" seek merger and acquisitions opportunities this year.</p><p>\"This new global mobility of our cash allows us to continue investing in our businesses in the U.S., to pay competitive dividends, to more aggressively seek out M&amp;A, particularly in the U.S.; and to repurchase our own shares,\" Honeywell chief financial officer Thomas Szlosek said on a fourth-quarter earnings call with analysts. \"Our preference is for attractive bolt-on acquisitions in our core markets.\"</p><p>Honeywell\u00a0also is working to spin off its home and transportation businesses, creating two companies that in theory could either be big-ticket acquirers or more digestible, albeit relatively large, targets. The home business provides\u00a0residential thermostats and security and fire-protection products, and is expected to generate annual revenue of $4.5 billion, while the transportation unit primarily provides turbochargers to the\u00a0auto industry and is tapped to record $3 billion in annual sales on a standalone basis.</p><p>Meanwhile, the move could give Honeywell room to grow in other arenas, possibly putting it on the hunt for targets to add to its staple aerospace business, where activist-pressured Arconic Inc. (ARNC) has become a favorite target among analysts.\u00a0</p><p>Honeywell's biggest competitor, United Technologies Corp. (UTX), also has contemplated a breakup in 2018, with\u00a0CEO Gregory Hayes noting at a Feb. 21 conference that the company may be worth more dead than alive.\u00a0</p><p>\"Is UTC better off in three separate businesses?\"\u00a0Hayes asked.\u00a0\"That's the question for the board. That's a question we continue to study.\"</p><p>Outside of the conglomerate structure, Hayes implied United Technologies' aerospace business, which consists of two units-Pratt &amp; Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems-could produce between $45 billion and $50 billion in annual revenue.</p><p>United Technologies'\u00a0Otis elevator company could see\u00a0sales between\u00a0$12 billion and $13 billion and the company's climate control business, which includes Carrier air conditioners, could boast $17 billion to $18 billion in revenue on its own.\u00a0</p><p>In any case, United Technologies may very well be talking about sizable divestitures in the near future as it works to integrate the massive $30 billion acquisition of Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL).</p><p>To be sure, divestitures and spinoffs\u00a0have long been among the greatest drivers of deal activity in the industrials space, given the cyclicality of these businesses and the nature of the conglomerate life cycle.</p><p>In the industrials space moving forward, however, a new theme will drive deal activity-the need to improve technology, such as automation capacities in manufacturing facilities or exploring applications of artificial intelligence, according to David Gale,\u00a0EY Americas transaction advisory services leader.</p><p>Megadeals in this vein may be a few years off, though, Gale asserted.</p><p>\"My sense would be [industrial companies] do nichey technology acquisitions with specific skillsets that they'll need around their manufacturing,\" he explained. \"You probably don't see in the next two to three years many big acquisitions of a tech company by an industrial firm. Rather, you'll likely see more partnership agreements and joint ventures with tech companies.\"</p><p>The Deal has seen this in the past from manufacturers such as Ford Motor Co. (F), which teamed up with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) on its connected car services buildout and more recently partnered with Lyft Inc. on self-driving car offerings.</p><p>That's not to say technology won't add another variable to dealmaking that will lead to larger transactions in the years to come.\u00a0</p><p>As for 2018, there are subsectors of the industrials space that\u00a0could\u00a0see an uptick in large deals as soon as this year, Gale contended.</p><p>Those potentially include the chemicals and aerospace industries, highly cyclical sectors where you've already seen major transactions trickle out in the past few years.</p><p>On Feb. 12, aerospace and defense firm General Dynamics Corp. (GD) said it would acquire its Falls Church, Va., neighbor and IT services provider CSRA Inc. (CSRA) for $6.8 billion, or $40.75 per share, in cash.</p><p>In the chemicals and agriculture space, megadeals abounded between 2015 and 2017, with China National Chemical Corp. acquiring Syngenta for $43 billion and Dow Chemical Co. tying the knot with DuPont Co. for $130 billion. Meanwhile, Monsanto Co. (MON) continues to try to appease European regulators over its $63.5 billion purchase of Germany's Bayer AG.</p><p>These types of megadeals often create their own M&amp;A opportunities, including transactions approaching $5 billion or more: DowDuPont Inc. itself plans to split into three separate companies-agriculture, material science and specialty products. In a perfect world, DowDupont might create three new industrial giants each worth somewhere along the lines of $50 billion apiece based on the company's current market cap.</p><p>If any of the three are not already takeover targets as a whole, the likelihood that one or more separates a large chunk of the business worth more than $5 billion down the road is relatively high\u00a0considering\u00a0the history of chemicals dealmaking reads something like the instructions on a shampoo bottle.</p><p>One recent example is Chemtura Corp., which was spun off from Bayer in 2005. About 11 years later, in September 2016, the company was picked up for $2.7 billion by private equity firm Lanxess AG.</p><p>Also in 2016, Albermarle, itself a spinoff from Ethyl Corp. in 1994, sold its German applied surface treatments provider Chemetall GmbH to BASF SE for $3.2 billion.</p><p>Commodities chemicals maker Axiall Corp., a 2013 spinoff from PPG Industries Inc. (PPG), was picked up by competitor Westlake Chemical Corp. (WLK) for almost $3.9 billion in June 2016 after a drawn-out courtship.</p><p>And Praxair Inc., sold to Linde AG in December 2016 for $65 billion, was actually a 1992 spinoff from Union Carbide Corp., which was acquired by Dow Chemical in 1999 for $11.7 billion.</p><p>In other words: Rinse. Lather. Repeat.\u00a0</p><p>\"In the chemicals space, we are studying megadeals, which we think will continue to spawn additional M&amp;A as antritrust issues are dealt with,\" EY's Gale asserted.</p><p>Historians of the international chemicals industry would certainly agree.</p><p>But for deal advisers in the broader industrials space, a boom in big ticket dealmaking would likely be welcome considering the sectors' generally muted activity over the past decade, and its particularly bumpy road with regulators both in the U.S. and abroad over the past few years.</p><p>In the industrials space, The Deal's database indicates there were nine deals announced in\u00a02017\u00a0over $5 billion, of which four were larger than $10 billion. Of those four, two haven't been completed and two were withdrawn.</p><p>In the past 24 months through February, 19 industrials deals of more than $5 billion have been announced, of which nine have closed, according to The Deal's database. Of the seven\u00a0transactions over $10 billion announced in the past two years, one has closed-Sherwin-Williams Co.'s (SHW) $11.3 billion\u00a0acquisition of fellow paintmaker Valspar Corp.\u00a0</p><p>No industrials deals over $25 billion announced in the past two years has closed. Three of the five meeting that criteria by The Deal's definition have already been withdrawn.</p><p>Dealogic Ltd. data provides for a similar story: Internationally, 28 deals over $5 billion have been announced or were completed in the past 2 years. Of those, four have been withdrawn and seven are pending.</p><p>Of the 16 industrial megadeals completed in the past 24 months, eight were above $10 billion in value, according to Dealogic.</p><p>In the past 12 months, no deals above $10 billion have been completed, while two are pending-United Techologies' $30.1 billion planned takeover of Rockwell Collins, which will likely require substantial divestitures to pass regulatory muster, and Melrose Industries plc's $10.1 billion offer for GKN plc-Dealogic data showed.</p><p>Breaking out transactions\u00a0involving\u00a0a U.S. buyer, Dealogic data shows just\u00a0nine deals over $5 billion have been announced since the beginning of 2016. Of those,\u00a0three\u00a0have been completed, three are pending and three have been withdrawn.</p><p>Of the six deals over $10 billion involving a U.S. buyer that have been announced since the start of 2016, one has been completed, two are pending and three have been withdrawn.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>In turning the dial back further, the picture for big deal hunters looks even more bleak with a mere 12 attempted industrials deals over $10 billion in the past five years and only 19 deals in the past\u00a010 years, according to The Deal's database. And several haven't closed.</p><p>U.S. buyers have made\u00a0nine\u00a0attempts at industrials deals over $10 billion in the past five years, of which five were completed and three were withdrawn, including Halliburton Co.'s (HAL) abandoned takeover of oilfield services competitor Baker Hughes Inc., a deal that was set to be blocked by U.S. regulators. Ten of the 15 attempts over the $10 billion mark in the past 10 years have come to fruition.</p><p>And just two U.S. buyers have gone the distance on an industrials sector deal over $25 billion in the past 10 years-Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s (BRK.A) $35.8 billion deal for Precision Castparts Corp., completed in January 2016, and Dow Chemical's merger with Dupont, completed in August 2017 and heavily predicated on the immediate plan to split up into three distinct businesses.</p><p>Nevertheless, deal advisers are optimistic this data can only mean one thing: The sector is ripe for big deals, particularly those between $5 billion and $25 billion.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's always unknowns out there, but\u00a0we believe the\u00a0market is healthy for the megadeal,\" EY's Gale said. \"When we're talking between $5 billion and $25 billion, there could be an uptick in\u00a0deals of that size for a variety of factors. We have a healthy lending market, companies have a lot of cash on balance sheet and many have a need for growth.\"\u00a0</p><p>Latham's Aslani-Far\u00a0seemed to agree,\u00a0noting that the tax bill may provide the final push for many companies considering big-ticker M&amp;A to fuel that growth.\u00a0</p><p>\"Are people only doing deals just because of tax, no, of course not. It's just a new world now,\" Aslani-Far said. \"Executives now boast the luxury of\u00a0a corporate tax rate that they probably have never seen in their lifetime. This opens up possibilities in a way I don't think existed before. And I can see where the impact of\u00a0a change like that could be a bigger deal for old-line industrials, because the other kind of things that have limited them.</p><p>\"Now, they're not going out and doing anything crazy. I'm not saying this will fuel crazy behavior. But it might open them up to deals they may not have looked at-people will think outside of box because it's kind of a brave new world.\"</p><h>DEAL SIZE</h><p>$ 10-50 Billion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DADEAL-14497798</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DADEAL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S10-SM91-DY7P-R03D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2249\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Deal, L.L.C.

In the past, we highlighted a few of these claims:Here's Geoff Taylor from BPI[3]:The US tech lobby has been using its enormous reach and resources to try to whip up an alarmist campaign...And here's Richard Ashcroft[4] from PRS for Music:the Internet giants... have whipped up a social media storm of misinformation about the proposed changes in order to preserve their current advantage.And how about UK Music's Michael Dugher[5] who really wants to blame Google for everything:Some absolute rubbish has been written about the EU's proposed changes on copyright rules. Amongst the ludicrous suggestions from the likes of Google is the claim that the shake-up will mean the end of memes, remixes and other user-generated content. Some have said that it will mean 'censorship' and even wildly predicted it will result in the 'death of the internet'. This is desperate and dishonest. </p><p>Whilst some of the myths are repeated by people who remain blissfully untroubled by the technical but crucially important details of the proposed EU changes, in the worst cases this propaganda is being cynically pedalled by big tech like Google's YouTube with a huge vested and multi-million-pound interest in this battle. However, as we wrote about back in December, an analysis that looked at the actual lobbying efforts around copyright in the EU found that it was done overwhelmingly by the legacy copyright industries[6], and only sparingly by the tech companies. In that post, I went through a spreadsheet looking at the lobbying of the EU Commission, and found that over 80% of the meetings were from the entertainment industry. However, as is coming out now, there was definitely one \"tech\" company that was one of the most aggressive lobbyists on Article 13. However, it was lobbying in favor of it, and that's because it knew that Article 13 would lead to an artificial, but highly inflated demand for internet filters. And that's the company known for building the filtering technology behind nearly all of the non-ContentID copyright filters: Audible Magic. Law professor Annemarie Bridy recently posted a detailed Twitter thread[7] of Audible Magic's lobbying activities regarding Article 13. It's easy to see why the company did so, because the law, if put into effect, would be a huge, huge benefit for Audible Magic, more or less forcing nearly every internet platform of a decent size to have to purchase Audible Magic's technology. Indeed, in the run-up to Article 13, we heard directly from policymakers in the EU who would point to Audible Magic as \"proof\" that filtering technology was readily available for not much money and that it worked. Neither of these claims are accurate. On the fees, Audible Magic has a public pricing page[8] that has been frequently pointed out by supporters of Article 13, often with the claim \"fees start as low as $1,000 per month.\" But... that's not accurate. The $1,000 only applies to \"on device\" databases. Hosted databases start at $2,000 per month, which is already double that... and the $2,000 per month only covers very low levels of usage. Indeed, the usage rates are so low that it's unlikely to think that any company that used Audible Magic at that rate would be making very much (if any) money at all -- meaning that relatively speaking, Audible Magic would be a huge margin killer. And the rates quickly go up from there. Indeed, on Audible Magic's pricing page, as soon as you get to a level that one might consider \"sustainable\" for a business, the prices become \"contact us.\" A few years back I spoke with one mid-sized streaming company, who told me Audible Magic was quoting them fees that were between $30,000 to $60,000 per month. An academic paper from 2017[9] found pricing to be slightly lower than what I had heard, but still quite expensive:Commercial fingerprinting and filtering services, such as Audible Magic and Vobile, do not publicly release pricing. But we can guess at the ballpark: one medium-sized file hosting service reported that its license for Audible Magic filtering cost $10,000-12,000 per month in 2011 (though this provider was later able to negotiate a reduced rate based on the amount of content flagged through the system). Another estimated that Audible Magic cost its service roughly $25,000 per month. OSPs noted that the licensing fees are just the beginning. Filtering systems, several OSPs noted, are not turnkey services. They require integration with existing systems and upkeep as the OSP takes on new mediation roles between rightsholder and user (such as tracking and managing user appeals).In other words, those things get really pricey quickly -- such that it becomes untenable for all but the largest of service providers. And that leads us to the second part, about whether or not they work. As we've been detailing for years, the answer is clearly no[10]. These fingerprinting technologies make both false positive and false negative errors all the time. We probably have a few examples sent our way every single day. Incredibly, the very lobbying video that Bridy points out[11] Audible Magic created as part of its lobbying effort says that Audible Magic's technology is accurate to about 99%. Last summer, we highlighted that Alec Muffett created a \"simulator\" that would look at the the error rates on such filtering technology -- and it noted that if you went with an accuracy level of 99.5% (higher than even Audible Magic claims) and ran it across 10 million pieces of content, you'd end up censoring approximately 50,000[12] pieces of content that were non-infringing. 50,000. And that's assuming the technology is even more accurate than even Audible Magic will claim. And, of course, that's solely discussing the matching accuracy. It says absolutely nothing about understanding user rights -- like fair use, fair dealing, parody, etc -- none of which Audible Magic takes into account (meaning even more non-infringing works would get censored). And, yet, as Bridy shows, Audible Magic has been lobbying hard for this: Looks like they were also lobbying MEPs: pic.twitter.com/gw2kdzjNIf[13] \u2014 Annemarie Bridy (@AnnemarieBridy) January 19, 2019[14]It's not surprising that they'd lobby for such a thing. I mean, which company wouldn't lobby for a new law that would effectively require thousands of internet companies to buy your product for which there is little to no real competition (oh yeah, which almost certainly means Audible Magic would likely raise prices once the government required everyone to buy its filters). Bridy highlights that their lobbying claims are complete bullshit as well: Here they are arguing that safe harbors, which everyone knows are designed to *remove* barriers to entry for companies that host UGC, *create* barriers to entry for paid subscriptions services that don't host UGC. Note the invocation of IFPI-created \"value gap\" rhetoric. pic.twitter.com/G6RjosnWRy[15]; \u2014 Annemarie Bridy (@AnnemarieBridy) January 19, 2019[16]Quite incredible that they highlight the \"voluntary\" nature of the filters while lobbying for making their technology required under law. And equally ridiculous that they claim that intermediary liability protections some how create \"barriers\" for online services. That, as Bridy points out, is exactly the opposite of reality. Safe harbors create clear rules that platforms understand so they know what they need to do to set up a legit platform. Removing those rules, as Article 13 does, and requiring expensive (and terrible) technology is a huge barrier, as the cost is prohibitive for most. There's more in that thread, but as Bridy shows, Audible Magic's own presentation shows that it knows who the \"winner\" of Article 13 will be: Audible Magic inserting itself to become the de facto \"copyright filter\" layer of the internet: Who will be one of the *biggest* $$$ winners if upload filters become enmeshed in the regulatory environment for all online intermediaries that host UGC? You guessed it: Audible Magic--right there in the middle of everything. pic.twitter.com/WcEFt7UDkd[17]; \u2014 Annemarie Bridy (@AnnemarieBridy) January 19, 2019[18]So, yeah, there was some \"tech\" lobbying for Article 13 and its mandatory filters. It was just coming from the biggest supplier of those filters.Permalink[19] | Comments[20] | Email This Story[21] [ 1]: <url

View original post here[2]. Submitted by Three Body Capital,[3] TL;DRThe rise of passive and ETF investing is turning up the heat on active managers. Change is coming to our industry, and those that fail to adapt will fade into obscurity.  The old business was highly intermediated and lucrative, while the tokenised future is likely to be far less commercially attractive and unable to support the behemoths in their current form.  Despite the doom and gloom, we believe active management can generate compelling returns for investors and survive the impending upheaval that looks set to turn our entire industry upside down. </p><p>The elephant in the roomAsset management in its current form still looks much like it did back in the 80s, or even earlier. Asset managers aggregate investor funds and deploy capital in search of investment returns, seeking to identify mispricing in the market. The ascent of passive and ETF investing has turned the table on active managers, especially in terms of fees. Here at Three Body Capital, we're still in this line of business because we believe it can generate compelling returns for investors. And we believe it will survive the impending upheaval that looks set to disrupt our entire industry. While other industries have experienced profound structural disruption, financial services have stayed largely the same. Asset managers still employ complex fund/manager structures (e.g. Cayman domicile with a Delaware feeder, Malta, BVI, Bermuda, Jersey etc), with a large chunk of active management fees effectively diverted to the likes of fund administrators, custodians, exchanges, brokers and service providers fulfilling a range of regulatory and administrative functions. The hurdles to entry into the asset management industry are high, which is why large managers get bigger and small upstart managers struggle to gain traction. Case in point: BNY Mellon, one of the largest custodian banks and asset managers in the world, has about US$1.8tn of assets under management and US$35.4tn of assets under custody. Asset management is profitable at around 28% pre-tax margin, but its custodial/services business generates almost 35% pre-tax margin, represents almost 55% of its US$13bn of non-interest income, and 44% of US$17bn of total revenues. Custody, clearing, settlement and other issuer services are big business. Add to that expansive regulation and the need for more compliance and supervisory oversight in the years since the crisis of 2008, and the regulatory cost of managing external capital is rising. This is inadvertently being passed to investors via lower net investment returns. At the same time, a narrative has been constructed to defend super-normal profits, with investors barking up the wrong tree in search of better returns. Management fees have been paraded as the cause of poor returns, leading to the rise of passive managers offering low fees (or even zero/negative fee ETFs, as we are seeing from the likes of Fidelity and Vanguard[4], on the basis that less trading leads to lower costs. The end result is an investment environment that's increasingly passive, with many 'active' managers largely hugging their benchmarks, providing little outperformance against their passive counterparts and inadvertently perpetuating the story that alpha is dead. The reality, however poorly understood, is that the high expense ratios generated by smaller active managers are not so much a function of trading commissions, but more a result of rising fixed costs relating to operations being distributed over a smaller net asset value. The end result? Investors in small funds are penalised more than those in larger funds. As the 'active versus passive' battle rages on, the market seems to have missed the elephant in the room. And it's a very large, very aggressive elephant.Light at the end of the tunnelAs the old joke goes, the light of the end of the tunnel might well be an oncoming train. In the case of asset management, we think this could well be true. Our train started its journey in the heart of the 2008 crisis, with a little experiment called Bitcoin. For many years, Bitcoin was seen as a hobby for nerds and millennials who were either idealistic, impractical or nave. Who needs a decentralised money transfer system that's censorship proof, unless they're engaged in drug trafficking or other illicit behaviour? Well, it turns out, lots of people do. The Bitcoin bubble of the past 3 years has captured the imagination of the retail investor, and it all came to a head last year when Bitcoin spiked towards $20k, taking with it a plethora of 'utility tokens' that raised an estimated US$20bn of capital through (now-infamous) Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Unfortunately for many of these investors, the vast majority of these ICOs will turn out to be worthless as far as the tokens are concerned. But this process, however painful for its participants, drew a huge pool of capital into an industry run by lots of highly intelligent and innovative people. The most fortunate unintended side effect of boom/bust cycles is the establishment of infrastructure that eventually develops compelling use cases. This was the case with the dot com bubble of 2000. Many dot com companies evaporated in the ensuing market malaise, but the bubble turned out to be an overzealous extrapolation of future developments, far too early in the life-cycle of internet infrastructure to sustain themselves. Almost 20 years after the dot com boom, we can hardly imagine a day without being connected to the internet and big tech. Amazon, Google, Facebook, Netflix and Spotify are just a few examples of what we can scarcely afford to live without. And to think that back in the day it was normal to ask, 'Now why on earth would you want to read a book on a computer screen when you can just go to the library?' Not forgetting the fact that dial-up connections used to drive our parents nuts, hogging the phone line whilst we checked our emails or chatted on ICQ and MSN Messenger. With hindsight, we see how the dot com boom catalysed a 20 year process of infrastructure rollout which effectively made the dreams of the its original founders a reality, albeit in a different form. We now have a dot com for everything. The ensuing disruption from the rise of the internet was also far-reaching - everything from retail to recreation to communications infrastructure has been turned on its head. Skype took down IDD calling and the traditional telco; Amazon took down the shopping mall (it's now working on the high street); Netflix took down PayTV media behemoths - the list goes on. It's our view that the cryptocurrency boom (and bust) have set the stage for a new age for investment management by giving form to the concept of digital assets. The beneficiaries of a high fixed-cost structure under the status quo face immense disruptive pressure. Many asset managers are going to find it impossible to change, and will fold. Have we learnt our lesson? Can we read the signs and predict the next technological paradigm shift? It doesn't look like it. Most industry observers are aware that asset management is evolving thanks to technology, but they're too busy talking about black boxes and robo-advisors to recognise the paradigm-shifting implications of security tokens.A quick word on BitcoinThis is not an evangelical pamphlet on the benefits of Bitcoin. In a separate note co-authored with Coinshares[5] we have provided a rebuttal to the overarching negative narrative around Bitcoin and its impact on the environment, because we believe that particular claim to be misinformed. However, whether Bitcoin replaces everything as a global currency is very much open to debate. Where we do see Bitcoin playing a role in this new age is as an attestation chain. For those unfamiliar with the concept, it confers characteristics of information security to the Bitcoin blockchain. As the longest blockchain in existence, almost 10 years old since the first block was generated and with more than 9,800 active nodes around the world continually authenticating distributed copies of the Bitcoin blockchain, the network is practically unhackable. A hacker attempting to falsify records on the Bitcoin chain would need to launch a simultaneous attack on the chain with another 9,800++ nodes to break the 51% consensus requirement, get a false majority to agree to a falsified increment to the chain and beat the processing power of all incumbents. Amending a prior record on the record would be exponentially more difficult. Sounds complicated? It is. And it's very expensive too. The bottom line here is that everything that's encrypted and posted on the public Bitcoin blockchain is effectively immutable. A permanent, constantly updated publicly-accessible record. That is what Bitcoin offers the new world. And this has huge implications for asset management.The root of the problem: bridging physical to digitalThe future we see revolves around security tokens: digital versions of physical assets, whether a share certificate, a title deed to a property, or even Michaelangelo's Pieta. The thought experiment that became real with the advent of ICOs and 'utility tokens' was that physical assets, often indivisible, could be converted into a digital, legally binding claim of ownership that in turn could be infinitely divisible. For traditional stock market investors, this would be analogous to a stock split: when the nominal price of a stock became too expensive, to improve liquidity in the market, one approach would be to split the stock into pieces, with each piece corresponding to its pro-rata value. As a result, investors who couldn't afford even a single stock at the old price could now buy, for example, a third of the original stock at a third of the price. There's no change in valuation, but the asset is distributed to a much larger market, improving overall liquidity and price discovery. Security tokens take this divisibility to multiple decimal places, with no requirement for the issuer to engage in a change in capital structure. One simply decides to buy 0.00001 shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A at an affordable $3, rather than the $300k+ at which it currently trades. Whether this still entitles the shareholder to attend Mr. Buffett's AGM will, of course, remain at the company's discretion. Consider this concept applied to prime Mayfair property in London, or a [6]portion[7] of Banksy's half-shredded art piece[8], and the possibilities are endless (or at least they approach infinity). Non-financial assets will be another topic for exploration in the future, and we are definitely of the view that lots more can be done in this space. This development opens the door to significant transformation, specifically with regard to financial assets that represent legal claims on ownership and profits of companies. It has the potential to change public perceptions around the concept of ownership. By rendering assets truly divisible, tokens make ownership possible for everyone everywhere and can transform capital markets, making them broader, deeper, more liquid, less vulnerable to catastrophic shocks. Couple this with another innovation of the crypto bubble - the token wallet - and you get broad and deep disruption across the asset management industry. Like the wallets we currently carry in our pockets, token wallets are built to contain the assets we own, from a cash equivalent (e.g. Winklevoss Gemini dollar[9]) to an actual claim on a company (e.g. digitally securitised Tesla shares). The key differences are the near-infinite divisibility of the assets in the wallet, and our ability to hold programmable money and assets, with permissions granted and revoked via wallet software.A thought experiment for asset managers (and wine lovers)Jacques is a winemaker living in the south of France, and thanks to a series of good harvests, has built up a nest egg of \u20ac2m in cash. He invests most of this in money market funds via securitised fixed income instruments, but has about \u20ac200k set aside for more speculative investments in the equities market. He is particularly interested in two themes:  Robotics, because he sees the impact robotics has had on his vineyards and improvements in efficiency.  Electric cars, because he feels passionately about climate change and believes he must support efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions. His security token wallet sits on his iPhone and is activated by his interactions with Siri. As he sits down to ponder his investment strategy, he opens his wallet app and gives the following instructions: 'Siri, please allocate \u20ac1m to a high quality bond issuer that is not only socially responsible, but also is supporting a project that will make a difference in people's lives around the world.' Siri: 'Confirmed. \u20ac1m allocated to Symmitree Foundation social impact bonds, maturing in 2028.' 'Thank you Siri. Can you also buy me \u20ac100k of Tesla shares, but only when Elon Musk tweets something silly and the stock falls more than average.' Siri: 'Confirmed. Allocation set up, buy up to \u20ac100k of Tesla shares when Elon Musk tweets and the stock reacts negatively.' 'I want \u20ac100k in a bunch of robotics companies around the world, but I don't know what to own. Can you locate some stocks with big robotics businesses and are growing earnings at least 10% a year and relatively low risk and invest my \u20ac100k there please?' Siri: 'Confirmed. \u20ac100k has been invested in the following names: Fanuc and Yaskawa Electric in Japan, ABB in Switzerland, Google in the US, Estun Automation in China, Hiwin and Airtac in Taiwan. Would you like to enable dynamic rebalancing algorithms to manage the risk on some of the Emerging Market companies?' 'Yes please. How much more do I have left to allocate?' Siri: 'You have \u20ac800k more available.' 'I'd like to authorise my old friend David to manage \u20ac400k of that balance on my behalf, I like his investing style and he has a solid track record, please send him a notification that I've given him permissions. For the balance \u20ac400k, please buy me something that gives me a decent return but will leave the cash available for me to use anytime I need it.' Siri: 'Confirmed. \u20ac400k allocated to money market funds yielding 1.2% per year. I will send David a notification that he is now authorised to trade that allocation for you and set the required permissions to facilitate money laundering and other checks.' 'Merci Siri.'Spot the differenceRight now, highly educated asset managers seem to view security tokens (at best) as an asset class, rather than a foundational technology and catalyst for wholesale change in the financial services industry. Considering the practical effects of asset digitisation enables us to glimpse the future of our industry. And it's unrecognisable. Custodian banks: gone. Under a self-custody model, money never leaves the investor. Even if trading authority is handed over to an external manager, funds are managed while sitting within the investor's wallet. No third party is needed to guarantee that the manager hasn't run away with the investor's cash, removing the need for an independent mediator to establish trust. Custodian fees subsequently become redundant - the investor is his own custodian, so there is nobody to pay for the privilege. ETFs: gone. ETFs solved the problem of imperfect divisibility of assets and gave investors a cost-efficient way to express an investment view on a specific theme e.g. robotics. However, ETFs are by nature passively managed and often track indices that end up having reverse correlation and causality with the ETFs themselves. While fees are falling and expense ratios are even negative in some cases (since the ETF provider lends out stock for interest to short sellers), the ability for software augmented with AI to dynamically tailor specific portfolios for individual investors renders ETFs obsolete. Moreover, if major indices like the S...00 get tokenised to an infinitely divisible level, investors can hold 500 tokens in their wallets sized to the correct weights, without having to own any ETF units. Furthermore, by not having to trade in the market with subscription and redemption flows, investment, custodian and administrative expenses can be reduced. Security tokens could spell the end of ETFs' supposed cost advantage in the passive investment space. Complicated compliance and identity checks: gone. At the heart of cryptographic authentication is the idea of zero-knowledge proofs, which can generate mathematically certain yes/no answers to questions that are fully verifiable. Where a Know Your Client (KYC) check currently involves an investor disclosing personal information (e.g. passport scan) and a fund administrator checking that against a database of names known for money laundering/political exposure, a zero-knowledge proof system would see an investor holding custody of all his or her personal information, and an external party sending a yes/no query to the wallet (e.g. 'Is Jacques old enough to drink?'). The wallet could respond, 'Yes', without divulging Jacques' date of birth. Stock exchanges and clearinghouses: gone. Exchange fees that currently constitute a sizeable chunk of asset management costs have little role in the future. After all, what does an exchange provide but a novation mechanism which serves as a central counterparty to two sides of a trade, with the exchange being the counterparty to both buyer and seller and guaranteeing a completed trade? Nobody wants to hand over stock and not receive payment. With programmable transactions on a blockchain, not only can transactions complete simultaneously and instantaneously (as opposed to T+2 settlement), a central counterparty is no longer needed and no transactions are reversible. They are of course offsetable, by entering into a reverse transaction. Moreover, trading digital assets can happen 24/7 - gone are the days where an exchange is only open for 6 hours a day with a 2 hour lunch break and no trading on weekends, avoiding violent gaps in opening and closing auctions when news hits exchanges that are closed. Active management: back to basics. With these changes comes a return to active management that focuses on identifying opportunities that are unknown or mispriced by the market. With passive investing streamlined into a mechanism that's dynamic and adaptive, index-hugging 'active' management with the aim of generating some alpha while minimising costs is unlikely to be sustainable. More likely is that passive strategies evolve into algorithms for rent, which investors can tap on (call it 'Beta-as-a-Service'). Active management becomes a purely alpha-generating enterprise, since partial market beta from a strategy can be replicated in tandem with a passive algorithm at a lower fee. For the active investor, this heralds a return to the basics of stock picking. Active management evolves into an industry built on discretionary mandates, in other words, 'pure alpha'.The future is closer than you thinkThis vision of Asset Management might sound like something out of a science fiction novel. But change is happening, and it's accelerating. The announcement that NYSE will launch its fully regulated clearing and settlement security token exchange, Bakkt[10], in January 2019 suggests the regulatory environment is moving quickly to make this a reality. Starbucks, Microsoft and BCG are among the key partners, delivering the infrastructure and use cases for what we believe is the first step towards a regulated security token ecosystem. Even Fidelity, one of the most established 'traditional' asset managers, is rolling out solutions for digital asset custody[11]. We're reaching a tipping point, with the backing of tokens by established financial market names set to precipitate mass adoption. All this means that asset managers can no longer lounge in their high castles. Change is coming to our industry, and those that adapt will thrive in the new age. Those that don't confront change with change will fade into obscurity, or explode into flames live on CNBC. The old business was highly intermediated and lucrative, while the tokenised future is likely to be far less commercially attractive and unable to support behemoths in their current bloated form. The magnitude of the change that's coming could be bigger than the industry can handle in its current state. The hard truth is that most incumbents won't be needed in future. And what of investors? To take our argument to its eventual conclusion, consider this: all active management is eradicated and every fund in the world is passively run, leading to every algorithm converging towards the passive mean as a result of backtesting. Alpha becomes extinct, only beta remains, and excess returns move to zero. What happens then? Two alternatives: Give up investing. Try and be different. Beat the crowd. To us, Option 2 seems like the better choice. And it looks an awful lot like active management.

That's probably because it's the only economic bright spot in this Trump recession.But while the stock market might tell how much money Trump and his friends are making in spite of the recession, the stock market does not reflect the economy as a whole.The truth is that while the rich are getting richer, the bottom 90% of Americans are being hurt by the recession. And they will likely be hurting for many months to come.Here is how former Labor Secretary Robert Reich describes this[1] economic mess:Since the start of the pandemic, American billionaires have been cleaning up. </p><p>As more than 50 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance, billionaires became$637 billion richer[2]. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg's wealth has ballooned59 percent[3]. Amazon's Jeff Bezos's,39 percent[4]. Walmart's Walton family has added$25 billion[5].Big drug company CEOs and their major investors are doing nicely, too. Since the start of the pandemic, Big Pharma has raised prices on over250[6]prescription drugs,61[7]of which are being used to treat Covid-19. Apologists say this is the 'free market' responding to supply and demand - the barons of Big Tech, online retailing, and Big Pharma merely providing what consumers desperately need during the pandemic. But the market also operates under laws that ban profiteering, price gouging, and monopolizing, and that tax excess profits in wartime. Where did they go?The Trump administration hasn't enforced them.Trump is also ignoring laws that ban trades on insider information. The White House is distributing billions in subsidies and loans to select corporations - enabling CEOs and boards to load up on stocks and stock options just before deals are announced, then rake in fat profits after stock prices surge.Insiders from at least 11 companies have sold shares worth over $1 billion after such announcements, according to ananalysis[8]by theNew York Times.In late June, a San Francisco company called Vaxart announced that the Trump administration had selected it to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Presto. The value of stock options distributed to company insiders just weeks before increasedsix-fold[9]. Stock options held by Vaxart's CEO went from$4.3 million to more than $28 million.[10]Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., has never brought a vaccine to market, but company insiders have sold some $248 million of shares - most of them after the companywas selected in April[11]to receive Trump funding. (Moderna plans to sell its vaccine for profit although taxpayers have footed its research and development.)The most blatant involves the venerable old camera and film maker, Kodak. On July 28, Trump announced a$765 million deal[12]with the firm to bring drug production back to the United States. He called it 'one of the most important deals in the history of the U.S. pharmaceutical industries,' even though Kodak isn't even a pharmaceutical company.Before the announcement, Kodak had handed its board of directors240,000[13]stock options, and just the day before had given its CEO1.75 million stock options[14]. After Trump's announcement, Kodak shares shot up more than2,757 percent[15]. Suddenly, the board's stock options were worth about $4 million, and the CEO's, about$50 million[16].Is this sort of insider trading against the law? You bet. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the deal, now temporarily on hold.But the SEC's co-director of enforcement, Steven Peikin, who had been investigating several of the deals involving the White House and corporate insiders - including Kodak - has resigned, without explanation. Another in the lengthening list of independent regulators and inspectors general forced out by Trump?This much is clear: Trump and his Republican enablers won't provide $600 per week to tens of millions of Americans who need the money to survive the pandemic, because Trump and the GOP believe the money undermines incentives to work.Yet Trump has no problem letting billionaires illegally profit off the pandemic. He thinks that as long as they buoy the stock market, they're helping the American economy.That's pure rubbish. The stock market is not America. The richest1 percent of Americans own half[17]the value of all shares of stock held by American households. The richest10 percent owns 92 percent[18]. For years now, stock prices have risen largely becauseprofits have been siphoned from the wages[19]of ordinary workers.In the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, stock prices are almost back to where they were before the pandemic began. Big corporations and major investors are doing fine. Billionaires are doing better than ever. But most Americans are sinking fast.This isn't just unfair. Much of it is illegal.

That's probably because it's the only economic bright spot in this Trump recession. But while the stock market might tell how much money Trump and his friends are making in spite of the recession, the stock market does not reflect the economy as a whole. The truth is that while the rich are getting richer, the bottom 90% of Americans are being hurt by the recession. And they will likely be hurting for many months to come. Here is how former Labor Secretary Robert Reich describes this economic mess: Since the start of the pandemic, American billionaires have been cleaning up. As more than 50 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance, billionaires became $637 billion richer. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s wealth has ballooned 59 percent. Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos\u2019s, 39 percent. Walmart\u2019s Walton family has added $25 billion. Big drug company CEOs and their major investors are doing nicely, too.  Since the start of the pandemic, Big Pharma has raised prices on over 250 prescription drugs, 61 of which are being used to treat Covid-19.   Apologists say this is the \u201cfree market\u201d responding to supply and demand \u2013 the barons of Big Tech, online retailing, and Big Pharma merely providing what consumers desperately need during the pandemic.    But the market also operates under laws that ban profiteering, price gouging, and monopolizing, and that tax excess profits in wartime. Where did they go?  The Trump administration hasn\u2019t enforced them. Trump is also ignoring laws that ban trades on insider information. The White House is distributing billions in subsidies and loans to select corporations \u2013 enabling CEOs and boards to load up on stocks and stock options just before deals are announced, then rake in fat profits after stock prices surge.  Insiders from at least 11 companies have sold shares worth over $1 billion after such announcements, according to an analysis by the New York Times.  In late June, a San Francisco company called Vaxart announced that the Trump administration had selected it to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Presto. The value of stock options distributed to company insiders just weeks before increased six-fold. Stock options held by Vaxart\u2019s CEO went from $4.3 million to more than $28 million. Moderna, based in Cambridge, Mass., has never brought a vaccine to market, but company insiders have sold some $248 million of shares \u2013 most of them after the company was selected in April to receive Trump funding. (Moderna plans to sell its vaccine for profit although taxpayers have footed its research and development.) The most blatant involves the venerable old camera and film maker, Kodak. On July 28, Trump announced a $765 million deal with the firm to bring drug production back to the United States. He called it \u201cone of the most important deals in the history of the U.S. pharmaceutical industries,\u201d even though Kodak isn\u2019t even a pharmaceutical company.  Before the announcement, Kodak had handed its board of directors 240,000 stock options, and just the day before had given its CEO 1.75 million stock options. After Trump\u2019s announcement, Kodak shares shot up more than 2,757 percent. Suddenly, the board\u2019s stock options were worth about $4 million, and the CEO\u2019s, about $50 million.  Is this sort of insider trading against the law? You bet. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the deal, now temporarily on hold.  But the SEC\u2019s co-director of enforcement, Steven Peikin, who had been investigating several of the deals involving the White House and corporate insiders \u2013 including Kodak \u2013 has resigned, without explanation. Another in the lengthening list of independent regulators and inspectors general forced out by Trump?  This much is clear: Trump and his Republican enablers won\u2019t provide $600 per week to tens of millions of Americans who need the money to survive the pandemic, because Trump and the GOP believe the money undermines incentives to work.  Yet Trump has no problem letting billionaires illegally profit off the pandemic. He thinks that as long as they buoy the stock market, they\u2019re helping the American economy.  That\u2019s pure rubbish. The stock market is not America. The richest 1 percent of Americans own half the value of all shares of stock held by American households. The richest 10 percent owns 92 percent. For years now, stock prices have risen largely because profits have been siphoned from the wages of ordinary workers.  In the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, stock prices are almost back to where they were before the pandemic began. Big corporations and major investors are doing fine. Billionaires are doing better than ever. But most Americans are sinking fast.  This isn\u2019t just unfair. Much of it is illegal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42849056979</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KX-D6V1-JCSC-J3NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"841\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>jobsanger</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 16, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Acually, what the Department rolled out was more a sketch of its preliminary thinking[1] about proposed rules. Brian Egan[2] and I tackle the substance and history of the proposal and conclude that policymakers are still fighting each other about the meaning of a policy they've already announced.And to show that decoupling can go both ways, a US-based chip-tech group is moving to Switzerland[3] to reassure its Chinese participants. Nick Weaver[4] and I conclude that there's a little less here than Reuters seems to think.Mark MacCarthy[5] tells us that reports of UChicago weather turning sunny and warm for hipster antitrust are probably overdone. </p><p>Even so, Silicon Valley should be at least a little nervous that Chicago School enforcers are taking a hard look[6] at personal data and free services as sources of anti-competitive conduct.Mark highlights my favorite story of the week, in which the Right to be Forgotten discredits itself in, where else, Germany. Turns out that you can kill two people and wound a third on a yacht in the Atlantic, get convicted, serve 20 years, and then demand that everybody just forget it happened[7]. The doctrine hasn't just jumped the shark. It's doubled back and put a couple of bullets in the poor shark for good measure.Nick explains why NSA is so worried about TLS inspection[8]. And delivers a rant on the bad cybersecurity software that makes NSA's worries so plausible.It's been a bad week for TikTok, which was caught blocking an American Muslim teen[9] who posted about Uighurs in China and offered an explanation[10] that was believable only because US social media companies have offered explanations for their content moderation that were even less credible. I suggest that all the criticism will just lead to social media dreaming up more and sneakier ways to downgrade disfavored content without getting caught. Brian tells us how the flap might affect TikTok's pending CFIUS negotiation[11].Nick ladles out abuse for the bozo who thought it was a good idea to offer Kim Jong Un's cyber bank robbers advice on using cryptocurrency to avoid sanctions[12]. Brian points out that the prosecution will have to tiptoe past the First Amendment.Senate Democrats have introduced[13] the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act[14], an online privacy bill with an unfortunate acronym (think fossilized dinosaur poop). Mark and I conclude that the bill is a sign that Washington isn't going to do privacy before 2021.Who can resist GPS crop circle spoofing by sand pirates[15]? Not Nick. Or me. Arrrr.I update our story on DHS's CISA, which has now issued in draft its binding operational directive on vulnerability disclosure policies for federal agencies[16]. It's taking comments on GitHub; Nick approves.And in quick hits: The death of the Hippie Internet, part 734: Apple changes its map to show Crimea as Russian, but only for Russians. A[17]nd part 735: Facebook accepts \"fake news\" correction notice from the Singapore government. [18]Our own Paul Rosenzweig[19] will be an expert witness in the government's prosecution of the Vault 7 leaker;. And Apple's bad IT cost it $467,000[20] for sanctions violations;[21] I ask whether we should be blaming Scooby-Doo for the error.Join Steptoe for a complimentary webinar on Tuesday, December 10.

Whether it's monopoly meatpackers seeking exemption from worker safety rules, the athlete-exploiting NCAA seeking a waiver from antitrust laws[1], giant corporations enjoying immunity[2] from public scrutiny in open court, or Amazon seeking a carve-out from product liability rules, the answer to each of these asks should be a resounding No. There is one set of rules, and we all should play by them.Due to an exemption granted at the dawn of the internet, online platform companies did get a liability shield, which their counterpart brick-and-mortar retailers do not enjoy. The resulting regulatory asymmetry, when combined with other forces such as the coronavirus, is perversely accelerating the demise of Main Street[3]. If a mom-and-pop retailer sold an exploding hoverboard that killed its customers, it would face severe liability, and it should. There is no reason why Amazon should be treated differently.More from Shaoul Sussman[4] | Hal Singer[5]The Big Tech liability shield was written into Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. In the last few years, Section 230 has been widely criticized as a tool to evade regulation. Vice President Biden recently said Section 230 'immediately should be revoked[6],' blaming it for enabling misinformation and hate speech. </p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) offered legislation that extends Section 230 protections only to platforms 'operating in good faith[7].'Last week, the Department of Justice submitted a proposal[8] to Congress that would pare back legal protections if internet platforms facilitate criminal activity, know of unlawful conduct but do not restrict and report it, or fail to spell out content-moderation policies and follow them consistently. Plus, Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and John Cornyn (R-TX) are expected to introduce legislation[9] to hold platforms responsible for any illegal purchases that happen on their websites.The original intent of Section 230 was to immunize online service providers from liability when posting third-party content. 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider,' it reads.The plain language of Section 230 is consistent with the obligations of a non-integrated neutral bulletin board. When the law passed in the mid-1990s, CompuServe offered news and weather as part of its basic internet service, but it was not integrated into its must-have input of user-driven forums. AOL eventually expanded into content with its purchase of Time Warner in 2000, but at the time the law was drafted, AOL was not integrated into the content of its killer Instant Messenger app. For forums and chat rooms, the user provided the content, not the platform.In that dial-up era, Congress could not have contemplated that massive, vertically integrated platforms could host third-party microbloggers and commenters (Facebook, Twitter), videos (Google's YouTube), or reviews and merchandise (Amazon). But these companies have come to dominate the modern internet.Vertical integration into content distorts a platform's curation decisions by injecting a financial incentive into the equation. As a content creator, the platform has a deep economic interest in how it designs its algorithm to steer users to the 'best' results. After operating as a neutral platform for more than a decade, Google figured out that delivering clicks to third parties was not as profitable as steering users to Google-affiliated properties[10]. Amazon similarly steers shoppers to products that are fulfilled using its logistics service, and recently launched its own private-label line to appropriate the best-selling products on its platform, and steered shoppers to the clones. In just a few years, Amazon-owned clothing and apparel brands came to command a staggering 9 percent[11] market share of all the clothes sold on Amazon.com. Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[12]Vertical integration also perverts the ways in which the immunity shield is used. Amazon allegedly retaliated against certain sellers that it now directly competes against, by recruiting and then unleashing[13] Chinese counterfeits. Then Amazon claims Section 230 immunity[14] from any harms caused by the knockoffs sold by the recruits.Because Section 230 shields Amazon from certain legal liability, Amazon possesses a unique, unfair, and anti-competitive advantage over traditional brick-and-mortar distributors in our courts.Ordinary retailers can be sued for selling a defective product and marketing it to customers. Amazon routinely argues that it cannot be held liable for defective goods according to state law, and even if it is, it cannot be held liable for its actions because Section 230 offers it complete immunity.The success of Amazon's defense depends upon the laws of the various states. In California, New Jersey, Texas, Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin, Amazon can be held liable for the sale of defective products, even those that were sold by third-party sellers and not by Amazon itself. But in other states, such as New York or Maryland, Amazon's activity as the facilitator of online transactions renders it immune from being held strictly liable.If a mom-and-pop retailer sold an exploding hoverboard that killed its customers, it would face severe liability, and it should. There is no reason why Amazon should be treated differently. Section 230 has been a successful shield, even in states where Amazon has been found to be strictly liable, in preventing accountability for promoting, advertising, or communicating information to Amazon customers about third-party products. For example, a Texas judge recently ruled[15] that Amazon could not be held liable for failing to warn shoppers that a knockoff Apple TV remote control did not have a childproof seal on the battery compartment, because the product description was provided by the seller (a Chinese manufacturer) and not Amazon, giving Amazon immunity under Section 230. In light of this legal reality, Amazon cannot be held liable for its failure to warn its customers or for breaching any express or implied warranties with respect to products sold on its platform and from which it derives a hefty profit[16].The ultimate result of this legal maze is this: In certain states, victims obtain some redress, while in other states Section 230 essentially provides Amazon with a get-out-of-jail card. In this sense, Amazon, which claims to be 'Earth's most customer-centric company[17],' has used Section 230 to circumvent consumer product safety regulation that every other business must comply with.As the Sixth Circuit recently observed, in Tennessee, brick-and-mortar stores can be held liable for breaching warranties to customers, even if they are not considered the 'sellers' of the product. That means that Amazon would be liable under that standard\u2014if Section 230 did not exist.The law should not make one entity liable for another entity's illegal speech. That's the policy at the heart of Section 230, relied on by tens of thousands of atomistic bloggers and websites and online publishers of every kind, including online newspapers. That shield should be preserved for most online platforms. But for dominant platforms that manipulate and monetize content, such as Amazon and Google, which have morphed into something completely different than a neutral online bulletin board, the shield should be pared back[18]. Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[19]Most urgently, the shield should be removed for any platform selling physical goods, which unlike digital content, can physically harm users when used or consumed. This would affect e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and eBay, but would leave the shield in place for platforms that exclusively serve digital content. Moreover, any platform that is meaningfully vertically integrated into the must-have content it delivers should not be able to partake in the immunity shield. So if Google wanted to preserve its shield, it would have to divest its local search properties to which it currently steers its users.It's going to be difficult to change a single word of Section 230, now that the Trump administration has placed it[20] into the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Google and Amazon could simply charge the United States with a trade violation if the law was altered. This was an enormous mistake, but it should be a priority of this or the next government to find a way out of that conundrum.In the end, every firm, regardless of whether brick-and-mortar or online, should play by the same rules. Exemptions to our laws should be rarely offered. And they should never be afforded to the most powerful companies in our economy.

Unusually diplomatic and indirect, Schmidt said he was not a lawyer but he agreed that  we re in that area, but we d have to let the judges look .</p><p>It s not much of a confession: Google s market share of the internet search business clearly dwarfs that of its competition. In the US, Google has 85 per cent of the search engine market share; the number two slot is occupied by Yahoo with just 8 per cent. (Yahoo s search is actually powered by Microsoft s Bing, the number three, implying a duopoly at best.)</p><p>But, in the US at least, being a monopoly doesn t make you an  <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">illegal</emphasis>monopoly. For that, you need to have obtained your monopoly through illegal means and to use it to undermine competition.</p><p>In the search engine environment at least, Google has always had something of an easy response to charges that it was reducing competition: other search engines are still only a click away on most browsers.</p><p>However, Google s wealth comes not from its search engine, but from its grip on the online advertising market: Google took 60 per cent of that market. And the two can appear to interact in unfortunate ways.</p><p>Microsoft, it was reported by Bloomberg, has complained to the FTC about Google s high charges for advertising Microsoft properties, including Hotmail, Microsoft s competitor to Google s Gmail.</p><p>In addition, while desktop browser users can click away from Google, mobile users of its Android platform face a more difficult struggle to escape Google s services.</p><p>But do all these interactions make any of the many markets Google haunts any less competitive?</p><p>It seems the real power that Google wields, as Microsoft before it and Facebook following it, is the power of network effects. Google may be easy to leave, but no one does, because they have no need to, and they re already at Google.</p><p>The costs of moving from Microsoft to Linux or Apple are not prohibitive, but they re sufficient to give most people pause. And now that Facebook has 700 million users, where else could you possibly go to find your friends?</p><p>But network effects do not last forever, and in the past few months we ve seen what happens when even a dominant power is threatened. When Google+ was launched, it seemed the first potential threat that Facebook could face. The response was swift: Facebook has already sought to imitate the best elements of Google+ or, in some cases, simply re-emphasise features it already had.</p><p>This week, Facebook has revamped its entire site, filling it with a battery of new features and elements that seek to distance itself even further from Google s forays into social networking.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google s search service has blinked a couple of times in the face of Bing s steady approximation of its capabilities. It has improved its image search and revamped its ancient front page as a clear reply to Bing s more polished versions of both.</p><p>It s hard to say there is no competition when each of these giants is nudging the other. Yet, all we appear to have right now is the prodding of mutual monopolists.</p><p>It s not play-competition that these companies are indulging in. No one would think that any of these companies were like those of previous ages, when there was open collusion to exclude smaller competitors from comfortable oligopolies.</p><p>Microsoft, Facebook and Google would also find it ridiculous that they work to wipe out smaller businesses. All three of them thrive on millions of independent developers, working to create desktop software, Facebook apps or just searchable web pages.</p><p>But you don t always need to have a co-ordinated, malicious or even conscious intent to end up with a dangerous result. The shift we ve seen on the internet in the past 10 years hasn t been the rise of a single monopoly. If anything, with the rise of Apple, Google and Linux, we ve seen a growing diversity of devices and software.</p><p>What has happened, however, almost imperceptibly, is a shift away from the idea that smaller companies have a chance outside the environments that these companies provide.</p><p>You can t exist on the web without being part of Google s great search index. You can t exist on PCs without choosing to live in either Microsoft or Apple s mansion.

Crawford, Analyst<br/> May 30, 2014 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives?</p><p><br/> Game Changer?<br/> For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made.<br/> Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence--The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why...<br/> The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged.<br/> Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries.<br/> With political change came economic change.<br/> Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion.<br/> As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends:<br/> 1) growing demand for natural resources;<br/> 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class.<br/> Let me explain...<br/> As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth.<br/> Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households.<br/> All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively.<br/> Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier<br/>Microsoftis not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early? Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems?<br/> Not really.<br/> Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\"<br/> In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\"<br/> The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016.<br/> But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice? An African telecom.<br/> The Gains Down in Africa<br/> As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services.<br/> According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet?<br/> We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap--even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.<br/> More Info:<br/> This news is published on the Investorideas.com Newswire and its syndicated partner network<br/> Get Free investor news and stock alerts: Sign up here[1]<br/> Published at the Investorideas.com Newswire - Big ideas for Global Investors<br/> Disclaimer[2]/ Disclosure:The Investorideas.com newswire is a third party publisher of news and research as well as creates original content as a news source.

A number of social, regulatory, and competitive trends back this movement: The 21st Century Cures Act and resulting ONC Final Rule standardize patient authenticated APIs across all EHRs and healthcare organizations, allowing unprecedented access Telehealth, home care, and DTC health businesses have exploded due to reimbursement change and increased convenience during times of pandemic The largest technology companies (Apple, Google, Amazon) have a large consumer focus and look to expand their empires into healthcare The future of a consumer focused healthcare system seems near, but its shape and disruptiveness still seems uncertain.

Join us on Friday, October 2nd at 12 p.m. ET to share your insights and hear from others. Topics for this week's #HITsm Chat: T1: Google's Fitbit is immensely popular, Apple Health Records is arguably one of the best Personal Health Records on market. Will big tech companies continue to see success in consumer health or will startups be best positioned to win this space? #HITsm T2: How will patients' involvement in their healthcare change due to the patient access APIs in the ONC Final Rule? #HITsm T3: Consumers favor and are willing to pay for convenience. How can new tools bring convenience to the patient experience? #HITsm T4: Telehealth, home care, and DTC health have risen due to COVID. What lasting impact will we see from these on the consumer healthcare experience? Which companies are fads and which will stick? #HITsm T5: Is there still a role for pure Personal Health Records as patient facing applications grow in popularity and variety? #HITsm Bonus: What steps do traditional healthcare organizations need to take to thrive in a world with the patient as a true consumer? #HITsm Upcoming #HITsm Chat Schedule 10/9 - What Do Patients Expect Now?

He has dissected every tic, every subtle sharpening of his crow's feet, his gaze towards the floor that inevitably comes before he delivers bad news. In all, Farid has catalogued 576 hours of footage of Obama speaking - equal to 3\u00bd weeks of video - sliced it into 10-second chunks and studied it as if it were the Zapruder footage of JFK's assassination.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Farid is not a stalker. The professor at the University of California, Berkeley, is one of the world's foremost digital forensics specialists, and his deep dive into Obama's face is part of a frantic effort to combat a menace as devastating as anything since the dawn of the internet: deepfakes, or videos altered using artificial intelligence (AI), which show people doing and saying things they haven't.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the technology emerged in a dark corner of the web two years ago, it has advanced in leaps and bounds. What was once the preserve of Hollywood studios is now available to anyone with a decent graphics processor and internet connection.</p><p>\"Anything can be faked,\" laments Farid, sitting in his spartan office inside the School of Information, a grand brick building in the shadow of Berkeley's famed bell tower. His work on Obama, a common target, led him to invent a new detection method. But it is an uphill battle. \"This technology is something you can now just download from GitHub [a popular online community that hosts free open-source software]. It will run for a few hours or a day, and it will just generate it for you automatically. Eventually it's going to be something you can just download in an app,\" Farid says. \"That's where we're headed.\"</p><p>In China, one already exists. Zao, which was released earlier this year, transplants a user's face to surprising effect onto actors in famous films: Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic, for example.</p><p>Deepfakes are most commonly employed, however, to place the faces of A-list female stars such as Gal Gadot, Emma Watson and Ariana Grande onto hardcore pornography. According to research from Deeptrace Labs, a Dutch cyber-security company, about 96% of all deepfake videos are pornographic. But the potential uses reach beyond the seedy side of the web and are already leaking into politics, society and even business.</p><p>In the past few months, videos have appeared online to showcase the technology's power. Boris Johnson was seen to endorse Jeremy Corbyn in the election; the US comedian Bill Hader morphed into Tom Cruise on a late-night talk show and Mark Zuckerberg confessed his grand plan to manipulate the masses. \"The more you express yourself,\" said the Facebook billionaire in a doctored video from June, \"the more we own you.\"</p><p>Faked videos themselves are only part of the problem. The growing ease with which they are made dents our faith in a much deeper way. Andrew Gully, a technical research manager at Jigsaw, the division of Google tasked with fighting the darkest elements of the internet, explains: \"The most dangerous, insidious thing about deepfakes is not necessarily whether people will believe them or not, it's the fact that they hack everybody's understanding of what is true and what is not.\"</p><p>The result is what many in the field refer to as the \"liar's dividend\": anyone can plausibly claim that any recording - a video that would otherwise end a political campaign or career, for example - is fake. \"Our historical belief that video and audio are reliable records of reality is no longer tenable,\" writes Giorgio Patrini, the founder of Deeptrace Labs.</p><p>And so a quiet arms race is unfolding. On one side is a rapidly growing community of hobbyists, developers, fraudsters and political opponents who recognise the power of deepfakes to swing an election, embarrass a lover or manipulate financial markets. On the other side are artists, academics, Big Tech platforms and civil society organisations that are racing to come up with tools - and laws - to counter the problem.</p><p>Dan Coats, then the US director of national intelligence, warned this year that the technology will surely be deployed in the misinformation wars, \"to augment influence campaigns directed against the United States and our allies and partners\". It is hard to imagine that the American war machine will not be availing itself of such a powerful cyber-weapon. Indeed, it has already tried.</p><p>Misinformation is not new, nor is using the tools of the day to disseminate it. The newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst reportedly told an artist working for his New York Journal back in 1897: \"You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war.\" In the 1990s, Photoshop made it easy to doctor pictures. Russian bot armies helped sow division via fake social media accounts in the 2016 US presidential election.</p><p>Farid argues, however, that the deepfake phenomenon is different. \"Video was the last bastion of trust,\" he says. \"Ten years ago, if in a court of law you presented me with a three-minute video of somebody doing something, I'd say it was nearly impossible to fake. I can't say that any more. How do you have democracy if you don't have shared facts?\"</p><p>What makes it even more dangerous, however, is social media, which provides a distribution platform that is unique in human history. \"We've got 1bn uploads to Facebook a day, 500 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, a couple of billion tweets a day,\" Farid says. \"The landscape is very, very complicated.\"</p><p>Adam Schiff, the Democratic congressman who led the Trump impeachment hearings, recently warned developers of deepfake technology: \"This is a Pandora's box you're opening.\"</p><p>It all began on </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/reddit-bans-fake-celebrity-porn-videos-k66ccnw62\">Reddit</url></p><p>. On November 2, 2017, a user with the handle \"deepfakes\" created a forum on the social media and discussion group website and uploaded pornographic videos with the digitally transplanted faces of female celebrities such as Scarlett Johansson. Reddit took down the forum three months later, but Pandora's box had been cracked.</p><p>Today, deepfake development is a cottage industry. According to Deeptrace Labs, more than 100,000 people spread across 20 known deepfake forums are toiling away, day in, day out, uploading code libraries for free, allowing others to tweak, improve and share algorithms that are, at an astounding speed, getting better at automatically crafting faked videos. Portals have cropped up to offer custom deepfakes for as little as $3. All they require is 250 pictures of the chosen person and two days of processing. A customised voice-cloning service sells synthetic audio for $10 for every 50 words. We're all vulnerable, explains Britt Paris, an assistant professor of informatics at Rutgers University, New Jersey. \"With thousands of images of many of us online, in the cloud and on our devices, anyone with a public social media profile is fair game to be faked.\"</p><p>In practical terms, it is almost always women who are targeted. \"That the new technology's first notable amateur output depicts one woman engaged in a sex act without her consent highlights how the use of technology can be wielded as harassment or harm individuals,\" Paris says. There are a growing number of cases where \"regular people\" are being targeted. The Indian investigative journalist Rana Ayyub, for example, was the victim of a brutal online smear campaign that saw her appear in a faked pornographic video.</p><p>Even to one of its founding fathers, the speed with which deepfake technology is being democratised is surprising. Hao Li, a professor at the University of Southern California who has been dubbed the world's \"top deepfake artist\" by the MIT Technology Review, was drawn into this world by tragedy.</p><p>On November 30, 2013, Paul Walker, the square-jawed star of the Fast &amp; Furious film franchise, was driving at nearly 100mph when he ploughed into an electricity pylon in Santa Clarita, California. His Porsche Carrera GT nearly sheared in two and burst into flames. He and his passenger died, and the Hollywood producers had a problem.</p><p>Shooting for the latest instalment of the film series, Furious 7, was only half complete. So they called Li, who had begun to make a name for himself for his ability to digitise faces. \"It was a cool project,\" Li recalls. \"There were already a lot of people making movies with realistic digital humans, but the thing that was really new was Walker was young, people knew what he looked like and the settings weren't dark. It was always pretty bright.\" Li, who wears his bleached hair in a mohawk that cascades down the side of his head, had the added challenge of creating a digital Paul Walker that would be convincing to audiences watching the film on 90ft cinema screens.</p><p>In short, he had little room for error. So Li assembled a team and went about developing an on-set facial-tracking system to composite Walker's face onto the body of one of his two brothers or a stuntman acting out his part. He created new ways to get algorithms to do what previously would be painstakingly carried out by animators.</p><p>It worked. Li's digital confection was in more than 200 scenes, and no one was the wiser. Furious 7 grossed $1.5bn. \"You need a project like that to show it is possible. You needed a budget like that,\" he says.</p><p>Creating a walking, talking digital likeness of Walker took months and millions of dollars. The Star Wars franchise has since been able to regenerate the characters played by Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher. Today, many of the core technologies that Li developed have been refined and are now out in the wild, available for free download.</p><p>Big Tech is belatedly scrambling to rein it all in. In September, Google Research and the Google division Jigsaw released to the public hundreds of deepfake videos featuring paid actors that the companies themselves had produced. The goal, says Jigsaw's Gully, was to provide researchers with material on which to train detection tools. \"We have a pretty strong geopolitical nexus to a lot of the work we do,\" Gully says. \"With deepfakes in particular, the potential malicious use cases became clear.\"</p><p>Dessa, a Toronto-based AI start-up, has created one of the world's best synthetic voice systems. Its computer-generated Sir David Attenborough can wax lyrical about the Serengeti, or tell you to wash the dishes. But what really got Dessa noticed was fakejoerogan.com, a website that plays algorithmically manufactured audio clips that are indistinguishable from the bombastic podcast host Joe Rogan.</p><p>Dessa pulled it off by training its RealTalk speech generator with hours of Rogan's shows. In a statement, Dessa co-founder Ragavan Thurairatnam says it was an attempt to \"get the public to take notice of just how realistic deepfakes were becoming, and to understand the tremendous implications at hand for society as a result\". He adds: \"The unfortunate reality is that, at some time in the near future, deepfake audio and video will be weaponised.\"</p><p>Thurairatnam speaks from experience. One of Dessa's biggest fans is the CIA, which asked to buy the technology. What it wanted to do with it was not clear. Dessa politely turned the US spy agency down.</p><p>Washington is not just viewing it as a weapon; it is putting up defence as well. In 2016, Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (Darpa), the Pentagon's research arm, launched Media Forensics, or MediFor, to fund researchers working on ways to catch manipulated imagery. The initiative predated deepfakes, but the technology is now its primary focus.</p><p>Facebook is also </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/reddit-bans-fake-celebrity-porn-videos-k66ccnw62\">tackling the problem</url></p><p>, announcing in September the $10m Deepfake Detection Challenge in partnership with Oxford University, MIT, UC Berkeley and other esteemed academic institutions. Under the scheme, it too will create a dataset of faked videos, offering cash prizes for participants who come up with the best ways of exposing them. Farid applauds the efforts, but says such schemes point to the gravity of the situation. \"What do you do when you can't solve a problem? You create a dataset, and have someone else solve it,\" he says.</p><p>Indeed, despite efforts around the world, the ability to produce deepfakes is evolving far faster than our ability to uncover them. Nick Dufour of Google Research likens it to the Red Queen hypothesis in biology, which explains how species stave off extinction. \"When you have two species interacting in the same environment, they're always co-evolving. One is driving the other, and we're seeing a similar kind of thing here. Detection methods that worked well last year don't work that well any more.\"</p><p>There is a reason for this. Take \"face swaps\", a common form of deepfake. Most are produced using generative adversarial networks, or gans. These systems contain two competing neural networks, known as the generator and the discriminator. The generator network's job is to produce a convincing image for every frame of footage - replacing Jennifer Lawrence's face with Steve Buscemi's, for example. Meanwhile the discriminator network compares the faked footage with real video and hunts for flaws, or \"artefacts\" as they are known in the field. The systems work in a tight loop, whirring away and learning from each other until the artefacts are smoothed out and the system produces a passable fake.</p><p>The problem is that the primary method of exposing doctored content relies on discriminator tools that are at the heart of how many deepfakes are generated - and they are self-improving. \"If you have this detector, you can basically train another one to fool it,\" Li says. \"At some point it has to converge to something where you get every pixel right, and it's practically impossible to detect.\"</p><p>We are not at perfection yet, and that is reason for hope, says Gully. Watch a typical deepfake and you can tell that something is off. Perhaps the image is blurry around the edges. Or, as is often the case, the person's mouth moves in ways that don't align with the words they are saying. (The lips not touching when someone says a word starting with \"B\", \"P\" or \"M\" is a telltale sign.)</p><p>In those rough edges lies opportunity, which is why so much time and money is being poured in now, before the process becomes too advanced - and truly automatic. \"There tends to be a bit of hyperbole out there that someone would be able to create a large amount of deepfakes at scale and with ease,\" Gully says. \"There's still a tremendous amount of tuning and tweaking that one really has to do in order to create something that's ultra-realistic.\"</p><p>The Pentagon is not complacent. In recognition that it is falling behind, Darpa this year launched a follow-on effort to MediFor called Semantic Forensics, or SemaFor. In its solicitation for bids, it admits that \"purely statistical detection methods are quickly becoming insufficient for detecting falsified media assets\".</p><p>The goal of this new initiative is to create a class of tools that look at deepfakes more holistically. Rather than focusing on minute \"artefacts\", they might step back and check for subtle inconsistencies that are common in deepfakes, such as mismatched earrings. The underlying conceit is that a producer of a deepfake would need to get every detail right, while only a single mistake would need to be detected to expose it. In military speak, those failures \"provide an opportunity for defenders to gain an asymmetric advantage\".</p><p>This digital deception arms race brings to mind the inspiration for the Red Queen theory: Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass. Seeking to explain this strange new place, Looking-Glass Land, the Red Queen tells Alice: \"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\"</p><p>Jeremy Corbyn had had enough. After a bruising campaign, the Labour leader finally decided to throw in the towel. In a video address last month, he urged all party members to back Boris Johnson, \"a prime minister that works for the many and not for the few\".</p><p>The video, published weeks before the December 12 election, was created by Barnaby Francis, who works under the pseudonym Bill Posters. The British video artist is behind some of the best-known deepfakes, including a viral Zuckerberg clip this summer in which the Facebook founder refers to his \"control of billions of people's stolen data\".</p><p>Francis says the Corbyn stunt had a clear goal: to expose how ill-suited Britain's \"Victorian\" regulations are for a society in which AI-generated videos threaten to catapult us into a post-truth world. \"We hacked the personas of UK politicians to make a visceral point - that these new forms of computational propaganda need to be understood and restricted,\" he says.</p><p>In the tech giants' long war against regulation, deepfakes may prove to be their Waterloo. The internet has been built on two pillars. The first is a purist techno-utopianism, which holds that if you can build something, even if it is a frighteningly powerful tool, you should, because technology is inherently good. The second is a clause in the 1996 Communications Decency Act, called section 230, which has allowed the techno-utopians to pursue their wildest ambitions without any worry that they will be held legally responsible if it all goes pear-shaped. Specifically, section 230 absolves tech companies of any liability for content posted on their sites by others. It is the foundation upon which Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Google and YouTube have built their empires.</p><p>When section 230 was passed, fewer than 10% of American or British adults even had access to the internet. As the web morphed into a utility at the centre of billions of people's lives, Big Tech clung to section 230 for dear life, because the alternative, being liable for what 2bn individuals might post on your site, was too scary to countenance.</p><p>That hands-off approach to policing their own domains has become increasingly problematic, leading to bizarre episodes such as the one that unfolded on Facebook this summer. A video of Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, purported to show her slurring her words, apparently drunk. The footage was a so-called \"shallow fake\" because it was not digitally altered, simply slowed down. YouTube removed it. Facebook refused to take it down, however, because it somehow did not violate terms of service that expressly prohibit posting \"misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent\" content. Zuckerberg tied himself into knots in October, admitting that he was worried about an \"erosion of truth\" while defending the company's decision to let politicians lie in political ads on the platform.</p><p>What happens when we can all fabricate video with a few swipes on an easy-to-use app? When deepfakes are generated in their millions? Farid, who testified before Congress this summer, is hopeful that peeling back section 230's blanket immunity has become one of those rare issues where both parties agree.</p><p>\"If we don't change the way we think about social media's responsibility with respect to news, political campaigns, civil unrest, online revenge porn and so on, this is all for nothing,\" he says. \"The margins are really thin. Most nations are very divided. If you release something 48 hours before an election, it doesn't matter if we figure out it's fake - it's going to work.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-58872272</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XT0-HGV1-F021-604N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3199\"/><timeReceived>6:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 22, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Yet very little analysis has been devoted to the world's largest financial industry: asset management.The Rise of Concentrations of Digital Technology: Financial Operating SystemsIn a new paper, we identify and explore a topic of major significance in FinTech: the rise of financial operating systems (FOS) and their evolution in the global asset management industry. These digital technology ecosystems provide the essential infrastructure for many of the front-office and back-office functions in the global market for investment. </p><p>As with their software analogs, these operating systems are often relatively inconspicuous but powerful. FOS already underpin the world's $50 trillion investment fund industry, where they provide the electronic systems for asset management for pension funds and other institutional investors. So far, commentators have observed only the symptoms of the rise of FOS. The growth of passive index funds, for example, raises issues that touch upon governance by FOS, but analysis has not considered why we observe such significant growth. Our paper provides a central part of the answer.Financial Operating Systems as Drivers of Industry ConcentrationWe argue that FOS lie at the core of the remarkable growth of asset and fund conglomerates including Blackrock, Vanguard, and Fidelity, as well as large brokerage houses such as Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, linking the services these financial houses deliver. We identify the massive scope of these systems, the reasons for their dramatic evolution and the legal and regulatory implications that arise from their possible failures and successes. These systems can be seen as the logical progression of the combination of information technology, financial evolution and finance theory: They are the combination of economies of scope and scale, network efforts, and efficiency, all combining to produce competitive advantage for those with the resources and capabilities. At the same time, they raise concerns from the regulatory standpoint: Are these new systemically important financial institutions or systemically important financial market infrastructure? Further, we highlight the potential for such systems to escape regulation while simultaneously stifling innovation and competition.From Front-end to Back-end to Financial EcosystemsIn the asset management industry, FOS are evolving into comprehensive, front-to-back financial ecosystems. Probably the most significant of these systems is Ant Financial, which provides a single financial ecosystem that links more than 1.2 billion clients (only 67 percent of whom are Chinese nationals) through its payments services, and also offers (1) a money market fund with more than 300 million investors, the largest in the world, (2) the largest fund brokerage platform in China, and (3) a very sizable insurance business. FOS are underlying a similar trend towards concentration in U.S. markets. Notwithstanding this enormous size and scope, FOS are still developing and underappreciated, with all the related benefits and concerns. In our paper, we examine the evolution of FOS in large asset management houses - and increasingly of the large banks as well, focusing particularly on BlackRock but highlighting how similar processes are driving Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and most recently the Morgan Stanley/eTrade acquisition: The combination of scope, scale, network effects, and efficiencies of FOS underpin consolidation and perhaps even winner-takes-all or at the least potentially oligopolistic outcomes.Risks from Financial Operating SystemsWe argue that ever-more components of the asset management value chain will be integrated into ever-fewer FOS. Although some service providers such as asset managers and administrators may remain nominally independent, they will in reality come to depend entirely on the FOS. How critical are FOS to these players? 'Aladdin [the largest U.S. FOS] is like oxygen,' said Anthony Malloy, chief executive of New York Life Investors. 'Without it we wouldn't be able to function.' We predict the economic pressure that FOS generate from their access to data and liquidity will squeeze profits out of the rest of the financial system, leading to fewer and larger service providers. While we focus on the rise of FOS in the asset management industry, similar developments are taking place across the financial sector, as FOS are increasingly driven by efforts to build entire financial services ecosystems (such as that of Alibaba/Ant Financial or that being built by JP Morgan or sought through the Morgan Stanley/eTrade merger). This evolution could be partly beneficial, as disintermediation should drive costs down, but not all innovation is good for all purposes. Societies - and their financial regulations - must seek to remain open to innovation, while balancing innovation against risk. The concentration of FOS in the asset management industry and elsewhere in the financial system will likely hamper both innovation and competition - inevitably the winner-takes-all nature of platform industries - which is what we argue are emerging in finance via FOS.The Case for Regulating FOSWe explore the possible ways in which FOS could be regulated, ranging from doing nothing to intervening dramatically. On the light end of the spectrum are wait-and-see approaches that foster innovation and encourage innovation; in the middle are moderate regulatory interventions; and at the extreme end are strict regulations akin to those of public utilities or even nationalization. The options regulators should take will depend on the stage of development of FOS within their jurisdictions, particularly in terms of their market share or dominance and the systemic significance of the functions the FOS provide. Regulators must be prepared to act fast, however, given the short time needed for big tech firms to evolve from too-small-to-care-about to too-big-to-fail or too-connected-to-fail.FOS versus FinTech and BigTechIn some respects, the rise of FOS reflects the powerful response of massive, established financial institutions to the disruptive efforts by FinTech start-ups: We are witnessing the financial equivalent of the empire striking back. We are only at the beginning of a battle between Big Tech and Big Finance for platform dominance in the provision of financial services. This post comes to us from professors Dirk A.

Today, this centuries-long democratizing trend is rapidly being reversed. Western democracies are not simply embracing neoliberalism in the sense of deregulating the economy. Elites are pursuing something aptly described as a new form of feudalism, in which entire realms of public law, public property, due process, and citizen rights revert to unaccountable control by private business.The system of finance, once supervised by bank regulatory agencies and the Securities and Exchange Commission, has been delegated to private realms of law. </p><p>The financial collapse of 2008 is best understood as the seizure, corruption, and abuse of entire domains of regulation and jurisprudence. Laws to protect workers and consumers, reflecting 70 years of struggle to expand rights, are now erased by compulsory arbitration regimes. Trade law permits similar private tribunals to overturn or sidestep public regulation. Tech platform monopolies have created a proprietary regime where they can crush competitors and invade consumer privacy by means of onerous terms, often buried in online 'terms of service' provisions. The unity of common scientific inquiry has been balkanized by confidentiality agreements and abuses of patents, as scientific knowledge comes to be 'owned' by private entities. Companies like Monsanto, manipulating intellectual property and trade law, prevent farmers from following the ancient practice of keeping seeds for the next planting season. This is not deregulation or neoliberalism. It is legally sanctioned private jurisprudence\u2014neo-feudalism. The Brief Era of the Democratic Commons For part of the 20th century, the democratic state served as a counterweight to the concentrated power that flowed to concentrated wealth in a capitalist economy. Laws helped workers offset the power of employers, protected small investors from the schemes of bankers and brokers, gave some countervailing power to tenants against landlords, and added consumer safeguards to constrain abuses of manufacturers and retailers. All of this has been thrown into reverse\u2014not just by the more visible forms of deregulation, but by the creation of entirely private realms of property and law.It is easy to miss what has been occurring, because the age-old elements of private law, such as contracts and torts, have long coexisted with public law and regulation. Contention between public law and private power is a very old story. What is new and alarming is the displacement of entire areas of public law by private commercial interests and the resurrection of abusive forms of private law.Not only did the 20th-century state expand democratic public law. Acting through the courts, the state intervened to police private contracts and protect weaker parties from abuse by the powerful. Twentieth-century courts moved away from the formalist contract law of the late 19th century, which was characterized by rigid contract interpretation and deference to the principle of caveat emptor. In its place, 20th-century judicial interpretation and enforcement of contracts emphasized fairness between the parties. Using such doctrines as unconscionability, duress, and impracticability, courts in the 20th century refused to enforce contracts between parties with vastly unequal resources, knowledge, or bargaining power when they found agreements to be oppressive, coercive, grossly one-sided, misleading, or blatantly unfair. For example, courts refused to enforce loans to consumers with excessive interest rates; consumer contracts that disclaimed standard warranties; employment contracts with broad covenants not to compete; contracts between mining companies and farmers to sell family homesteads for a pittance; and leases with draconian liquidated-damage clauses for minor tenant infractions. Moreover, the courts scrutinized the process of contract formation for real, as opposed to fictitious, consent. In a similar vein, the Uniform Commercial Code, drafted by legal-realist scholar Karl Llewellyn in 1952 and subsequently adopted in all 50 states, expanded the doctrine of good faith in commercial contracting and adopted 'commercial reasonableness' as the standard for interpreting contractual ambiguities.The trend in contract law took a U-turn in the 1980s, as the law and economics movement began to permeate the judiciary. The new 'efficiency' theory of contract law held that all contracts should be enforced, notwithstanding either deception or vast power inequalities between the parties. Thus the capture of public law and the reversion to one-sided private law reinforced each other, creating vast pools of proprietary power.The extreme privatization of jurisprudence overlaps the privatization of public services, but it is more sinister. When a public service such as a voucher school, a park, a highway, or an entire town (such as Disney's town of Celebration) is privatized, it alters the cost, quality, and distribution of the service, and also reduces public accountability. Voucher schools are able to manipulate admissions, avoid costly special-needs kids, and have their own legal and disciplinary procedures, which are supervised only very loosely by the state, if at all. Public prisons, already replete with abhorrent conditions, have become much worse as private, for-profit entities, with even less opportunity for redress.For part of the 20th century, the democratic state served as a counterweight to the concentrated power that owed to concentrated wealth in a capitalist economy. That role has been reversed as private potentates have captured the state. The carving up of public law and property into proprietary domains is the new tragedy of the commons. The environmental tragedy, at least in principle, is amenable to public regulation that applies to all players. In the new tragedy, public regulation is precluded because law has been sundered from the democratic commons, in a manner that evokes the original tragedy of the commons\u2014the English enclosure movement of the 17th and 18th centuries\u2014in which lands that had been cultivated by the peasantry since time immemorial were carved up into commercial properties by local lords, with the blessing and legal protection of the Crown.In some respects, the new feudalism is even more lopsided than the original, in that historic feudalism had some forms of reciprocal obligation between lord, vassal, and serf; between king and aristocrat; Church and Crown; and between apprentice, tradesman, and master. For all of its absolutism, feudalism had aspects of what J.K. Galbraith, describing capitalism at the apex of the mixed economy, was to call 'countervailing power.' Neo-feudalism is a one-way seizure of private power and law by elites.From Feudalism to Democracy\u2014and Back The historic movement from feudalism to the modern state and then to political democracy began in the late Middle Ages and the early modern era. Feudal lords had massive landholdings wherein their word was law. They maintained their own military forces, and operated feudal courts to resolve disputes. These quasi-states had understandings (and sometimes clashes) with monarchies and with the Church. Feudal lords had plenary authority over their domains, although they themselves were subject to the higher authority of the monarch and the Church. During the heyday of feudalism, most contract questions, property disputes, criminal matters, domestic relations, inheritance, and other matters affecting ordinary folks were handled in the local courts. In principle, serfs had some customary rights, but masters ruled.The feudal system arose in response to the anarchy and vacuum of sovereignty left in Europe after the collapse of the Roman Empire and the ebb and flow of invaders from the east, north, and south\u2014Huns, Goths, Arabs, Norsemen, and others. Some monarchies were potent, others weak; but as long as a feudal lord was a faithful vassal of the king, he was sovereign in his own realm. For nearly a thousand years, there was a four-way contention for power among kings, feudal lords, the Church, and the rising imperatives of commerce, with the monarchy gradually gaining sovereignty.In the late Middle Ages, commerce among different principalities was governed by a transnational body of customary commercial law known as the lex mercatoria. Commercial disputes were resolved by private tribunals created by the commercial community according to the norms of the merchant community itself. The results were recognized by monarchies. This system made it possible for a product to pass from country to country with the property rights of the owner recognized by other merchants and sovereigns. The slave trade was part of this commercial system, and it could only function thanks to this symbiosis between traders and kings, in which ownership rights to a chattel were recognized by monarchies.By the end of the 18th century, these struggles for primacy had been largely resolved in favor of the state. This came to be known by scholars as the Westphalian system, after the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War by giving the king the right to dictate the religion of his subjects. Nation-states gained more and more authority over realms previously governed by feudal lords, including the power to define and protect property rights, maintain a military and judicial system, and regulate commerce, labor, the professions, finance, trade, and domestic relations. The state gained a monopoly on the legal use of force. A post-feudal aristocracy still existed, but the monarch became increasingly sovereign. Yet the bias in favor of economic elites persisted.There followed another century of struggle to make the state democratic. Despite the democratizing trends, some feudal remnants remained well into the modern era. For example, until the early 20th century, under the English doctrine of primogeniture and the device of the entail, property owners were required to keep their estates intact and leave them to a single heir. In the U.S., supposedly 'born free' of feudal heritage, many feudal doctrines from the common law of England were nonetheless incorporated into Britain's North American colonies. In the U.S. as well as Britain, the doctrine of coverture effectively made wives the property of husbands. In much of the West, there were still property requirements for the franchise, left over from the aristocratic era.Throughout the 19th century, employers in the U.S. retained quasi-feudal rights over their workers through the operation of two common-law doctrines\u2014the 'entire contract' doctrine, which provided that workers who left an employer mid-contract had no right to be paid for any work they had performed, and the tort of enticement, which enabled employers to prevent their workers from departing their establishment to work for someone else. However, with the rise of commercial principles in the late 19th century, some individualistic approaches emerged. For example, the at-will rule that emerged in the 1880s gave individual laborers the right to quit their employment with impunity\u2014and gave employers the right to fire workers for any reason, or for no reason. And, in the area of industrial accidents, no matter how egregious an employer's negligence, courts reasoned that the worker had freely contracted to accept the risk and therefore had no recourse. Thus, in the case of labor law as well as other areas of commercial law, both the feudal remnants and the evolving modern market system favored the property owner.IN THE UNITED STATES, the democratization of the modern state was realized in the economic realm only in the 20th century, as new citizen and worker protections were enacted by Congress and upheld by courts. In the 20th century, government acted to balance the commercial interests of emerging companies and industries against a broader public interest. Railroads, radio, television, electric utilities, civil aviation, telephones\u2014all sectors with actual or potential monopoly abuses\u2014were subject to public law after many had attempted to install regimes of private law relying on coercive market power. Railroads, which had operated like feudal baronies, dictating terms of commerce for shippers and destroying rivals, became subjected to public rate-making. In the telephone industry, the dominant Bell System had sought to make and enforce rules to crush or capture potential competitors, but it came to be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. So did the emerging radio industry, dominated by one company, RCA, which had sought to rule the airwaves. In all of these cases, the democratic state intervened both to supplant areas of private law with public regulation and to assure that systems of private law had some balance and accountability that would protect the economically weak from the economically strong.The law became more procedurally transparent as well as more substantively egalitarian. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 (APA) created an orderly and transparent process for regulatory agencies to make rules and to ensure greater citizen participation in the rule-making process. The APA also imposed restrictions on ex parte contracts between the regulated entities and the regulators, and prohibited conflicts of interest in many other respects. Thus, the gains for democracy were both procedural and substantive.The high watermark of the democratized legal and policy regime was the 1960s and 1970s, when numerous consumer and environmental laws were enacted, unions represented almost one worker in three, and courts defended citizen rights.Beginning in the 1980s, power shifted again. Entire domains were handed back to private entities that were empowered to exercise quasi-state functions and create their own proprietary systems of law.These developments have been described in mainstream policy discourse as 'deregulation' and 'privatization,' but those terms are misleading. The term 'deregulation' suggests a reversion to a pre-existing system of nonregulation, a realm in which state authority is absent. But this is a fantasy. There is no pre-legal, law-free realm. There is always regulation, albeit sometimes invisible and private, and hence unaccountable.Similarly, the term 'privatization' is misleading. The term suggests a neutral transfer of governmental functions to the private domain for the sake of efficiency. But privatization invariably has distributional as well as civic consequences, since it changes the structure of costs and benefits and obscures public accountability. Privatized water and highway systems raise costs to users. Public parks are generally free; privatized ones charge. The privatized entity can avoid public obligations such as due process, transparency, and nondiscrimination requirements.Outsourcing of public functions, which gained ground beginning in the 1980s, brought with it outsourcing of jurisprudence. Private prisons turn a quintessentially public function\u2014incarceration for criminal actions\u2014into a profit-making venture with minimal public accountability. In private 'voucher schools' (financed by public funds), a private entity makes the rules. Gated residential communities, such as Disney's Celebration, are privately controlled municipalities that make and enforce their own laws. Private mercenary armies, such as Blackwater (now rebranded as Academi), are hired by the Pentagon so that their 'soldiers' will be less accountable for what might otherwise be war crimes. Eminent domain, the inherent public prerogative to claim private property for a public purpose, has been commandeered by private developers. And courts\u2014the ultimate embodiment of law in a democracy\u2014have been privatized by the vast expansion of compulsory arbitration. Neo-Feudalism and the Financial Collapse of 2008 Under the system of financial regulation created in the New Deal, commercial banks were strictly supervised under one regulatory regime, while the issuance and sale of securities were tightly governed under another. In exchange for federal deposit insurance and/or membership in the Federal Reserve System, commercial banks had to abide by reserve requirements, conflict-of-interest strictures, and regular supervisory examinations. Their ability to merge or open branches was limited. The interest they could pay on deposits was regulated. They were not permitted to turn loans into securities. This regulatory regime was designed to ensure both safety and soundness of the system as a whole, as well as protection of investors, savers, and borrowers.From the New Deal to the 1980s, investment bankers, retail stockbrokers, and issuers of stock were governed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Publicly traded stocks were subject to extensive disclosures and prohibitions against insider trading and other abuses such as over-leveraging, self-dealing, and deceptive marketing and pricing, which had led to the Great Crash of 1929. There were no derivatives, no private equity, no complex securitization, no pyramid schemes, no off-balance sheet assets, and above all no opaque system of private law. The system was simple enough for supervisors to comprehend and thus to regulate.In a parallel process of public invention and regulation, the New Deal created and governed a new system of mortgage finance. A new home loan bank system backstopped the (mostly nonprofit) savings and loan sector. The government invented the long-term, self-amortizing mortgage. A new agency, the FHA, insured these mortgages so that ordinary people could acquire homes with low down payments. Yet another public agency, FNMA, used Treasury bond financing to purchase mortgages and replenish the capacity of banks and thrift institutions to make more loans. Still another new agency, the Home Owners Loan Corporation, helped refinance mortgages for borrowers at risk of foreclosure. The entire system was closely supervised and scandal-free.Franklin Roosevelt's original alphabet soup of new public agencies has mutated into a toxic stew of self-regulatory and self-interested organizations run by and for regulated industries. It is one giant conflict of interest. The important point is that this entire post-Depression architecture of financial structure and regulation was publicly created and subject to public scrutiny. It existed for the benefit of the broad citizenry, not for the profit of industry insiders. Even transactions and contracts that were ostensibly private, such as the sale of stocks and bonds, were subject to public rules. This system worked well. Not only did it protect ordinary investors, savers, mortgagors, and the economy as a whole; the financial part of the economy supplied plenty of capital to the real economy during the long postwar boom.As the distribution of political power shifted in the 1970s and 1980s, the financial industry began reprivatizing systems of law and finance. They invented new strategies of financial speculation to which regulators gave their blessing. Leverage buyout artists began acquiring entire companies using almost none of their own money, with the target company's stock as collateral. In the new, pro-market environment, regulators concluded that this was legal.The LBO business mutated into private equity, in which trillions of dollars of transactions were outside the system of securities regulation on the premise that these were not public offerings of shares. What had been a very small loophole in the structure of New Deal securities law metastasized into a largely unregulated multitrillion-dollar industry. Complex layers of derivatives securities were invented, in which immense and largely hidden multiples of leverage were possible. When some regulators expressed an interest in taking a closer look, a Congress newly beholden to the financial industry acted in 2000 to expressly prohibit regulation of derivatives, either as insurance, securities, or as gambling.In the same period, public agencies delegated regulation to regulated industries via more than a dozen industry-controlled entities known as self-regulatory organizations (SROS). The original self-regulatory organization was the New York Stock Exchange, created in 1792. Prior to the New Deal, the Stock Exchange functioned as a private club, and its failure to enforce transparent and fair dealing had vast consequences for the public well-being when markets periodically crashed.From the inception of securities regulation in 1933, there was bitter contention over how much enforcement would be the direct province of the new sec and how much would be delegated to the privately operated stock exchange. It is a testament to the residual power of capital that even at the nadir of its disgrace, the New York Stock Exchange won many of these initial skirmishes, setting an unfortunate pattern to be exploited once FDR was gone. Against the wishes of the sec's original architects, the stock exchange was permitted to supervise many of its own activities with the sec relegated to watchdog, supervising at one remove. In 1939, the sec allowed the first explicitly recognized SRO, the National Association of Securities Dealers, to govern the system of over-the-counter (off-exchange) stock trades. This was just the beginning of a vast reversion.After Wall Street invented financial derivatives in the 1980s, the whole field of derivatives creation and trading came to be governed by rules established by the industry trade association, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). At its simplest level, a financial derivative is analogous to an insurance policy against a bond or other security failing to pay back interest or principal. But ISDA, not a government agency, gets to decide how derivatives work and under what circumstances that obligation must be paid. This is neo-feudalism, par excellence. The democratic state plays no role whatever, except to bless the privatized realm of law.In the area of accounting standards, the sec expressly delegated monitoring and enforcement to the industry trade association, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). When self-regulation failed and accounting frauds led to the Enron scandal and kindred abuses, Congress restored some direct regulatory standards via the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, that same legislation created a new body, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), that enabled industry self-regulation to persist in a different form. PCAOB was created as a dot-org, not a government entity. Its president is paid over $670,000 a year. It is dominated by the Big Four accounting firms. The sec delegated a great deal of regulatory enforcement to it, as well as to another industry private association, FINRA, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (which used to go under its original and more accurate name, the National Association of Securities Dealers). By definition, the self-interest of securities dealers is not identical to that of the investing public.SIFMA, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, is a lobbying and trade association. But with the approval of the government, SIFMAalso sets the regulatory standards for repos (overnight loans) and money-market and securities lending transactions through its 'master templates.' There are similar industry groups that 'regulate' the terms of municipal bond underwriting and sales (the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board); the terms for creation and trading of futures (the National Futures Association); as well as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).All of these industry self-regulatory bodies have their own systems of jurisprudence, far less transparent or committed to the public interest than the direct public regulation of the New Deal schema. Roosevelt's original alphabet soup of new public agencies has mutated into a toxic stew of self-regulatory and self-interested organizations. It is one giant conflict of interest. Private Jurisprudence and the Mortgage Collapse The subprime collapse of the early 2000s was the direct result of the invention of new toxic financial products and private systems of law. Loan originators created new categories of mortgages in which the borrowers' rates would explode after a few years, and marketed them aggressively to unsuspecting homebuyers who could not afford them. Deceptive mortgage products such as 'pick-a-pay' had low nominal interest rates, while the true interest costs were added to the principal. Others had low teaser rates that rose dramatically after a few years. The mortgages in turn were sold to investment bankers who packaged them into securities that, through the alchemy of private credit rating agencies, were given triple-A ratings.When investment bankers devised pyramids of asset-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, they needed complex private legal and financing systems. The government basically got out of the way and let the bankers run the show and write the rules as private contracts, even though a variety of existing laws and principles of sound banking were violated. The credit rating agencies that rewarded the securities based on exploding mortgages with triple-A ratings were essentially unregulated.Compulsory arbitration moves consumer and employment disputes from the courts to a rigged process of private systems of adjudication, depriving workers and consumers of statutory rights that they achieved in the 1960s and '70s. In order to make the system of high-volume mortgage securitization work, the financiers had to devise an end run around a property-recording system that has been in place in America since before the Revolution. The banks invented a private database that tracked transfers of title to the property, called Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS). MERS was basically a shell company, wholly owned by major banks, designed to enable the securitization industry to evade recording fees incurred when banks transferred mortgages multiple times.Rather than using the traditional system of transferring and recording property and mortgage liens with the local recorders of deeds, the MERS system listed itself as the mortgagee of record. Banks could make unlimited transactions inside MERS; the recorder of deeds would only know about the original sale.At the height of the housing bubble, most of the existing mortgages in the United States listed MERS as the mortgagee. But this mass tax evasion scheme was susceptible to widespread database errors that proved disastrous when the whole subprime system blew up. MERS would either try to claim standing over mortgages it had no financial interest in, or would make an after-the-fact assignment to a trustee, which violated the rules governing securitization. MERS designated thousands of low-level mortgage industry workers 'vice presidents' of the company, and they would sign the unlawful transfers of mortgage in MERS's name.This phony paper was used as evidence in several million foreclosure cases. Many families lost their homes based on fraudulent documents from a shell company that was at best a legal fiction. A handful of judges threw out foreclosure proceedings on the premise that the deed had been fraudulently recorded by a shell system or there was no record of the loan in the first place, but most foreclosures stood. The industry's creation of a proprietary fiefdom of law\u2014a private property records system created with no public debate or legislative approval\u2014was richly rewarded. MERS still exists. The Invasion of Arbitration Another emblematic case of neo-feudalism is the use of compulsory arbitration to move consumer and employment disputes from the public courts to a rigged process of private systems of adjudication. This privatization of justice deprives workers and consumers of the benefits of many of the statutory rights that they achieved in the 1960s and '70s. It is the result of new, radical judicial interpretations of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA).The FAA was enacted in 1925 at the behest of the business community, which wanted to bolster trade associations by giving them the ability to compel their members to submit disputes to arbitration rather than to the courts. But since the 1980s, the Supreme Court has ruled that the statute could be used by corporations to require arbitration in virtually all settings. Companies began inserting arbitration clauses in their employment and consumer contracts. By the 2000s, large corporations made arbitration mandatory for most employment discrimination disputes, federal and state wage and hour disputes, disputes over alleged violations of state employment protective laws, consumer breach of warranty claims, allegations of consumer fraud, and most other cases involving workers and consumers.With the approval of the courts, corporations now require arbitration for allegations of lethal negligence by nursing homes, allegations of identity theft, instances of sexual assault of students by teachers in private schools, claims of antitrust conspiracies by large corporations against small businesses, and efforts by on-demand workers to obtain fair working conditions. The corporation picks the arbitrator and defines the rules of the proceedings. It can insist on limited discovery and impose confidentiality gags so that plaintiffs with similar cases cannot share evidence or information about the outcome of their cases. It can also exclude certain types of evidence in advance, and limit the types of remedies a successful claimant can recover. It is common to also impose fee-sharing so that an employee or a consumer has to pay a significant sum just to have their case heard.In a recent trend, some employers require the losing party to pay all of the cost of an arbitration\u2014typically several thousands or tens of thousands of dollars\u2014as well as the winning party's attorney fees. These clauses are designed to discourage workers and consumers from asserting claims altogether. When disputes go to arbitration and an award is issued, the losing party has virtually no right to appeal.Moreover, arbitration proceedings lack the due process protections we expect of courts. An arbitration hearing has no transparency\u2014there is almost never a transcript of the proceeding; there is often no written opinion; and there is seldom a public record that reveals the names of the parties, the nature of the dispute, or the outcome. Hence large corporations, who as repeat players have amassed experience with many different arbitrators and seen many similar cases, have a substantial advantage.Arbitration has seriously undermined workers' and consumers' rights to use class actions. With class action suits, individuals with common claims\u2014such as Walmart workers who were denied legally mandated overtime payments\u2014are able to consolidate their claims, obtain a lawyer, and get into court. In the 1990s and early 2000s, employment-related class actions proliferated; some corporations were forced to pay multimillion-dollar awards.But in 2011, the Supreme Court gave its blessing to arbitration provisions that ban the use of class actions, either in court or in an arbitration proceeding. The case involved tens of thousands of consumers, each of whom had been cheated out of approximately $30 by AT&amp;T. Without the vehicle of the class action, such a large number of small-value claims would never be pursued in any tribunal, giving corporations a license to cheat customers with impunity. Today, the vast majority of arbitration clauses written by corporations include a class action ban. Private Arbitration Regimes in Trade Law Since the 1980s, major trade agreements have included a device known as Investor-State Dispute Settlement. This first came about in the case of trade deals between European multinational corporations and former colonies with weak or corrupt systems of law. The U.S. government copied this formula in bilateral trade deals to protect U.S. investors from expropriation. Before they risked their money, American investors wanted some assurance that in the event of disputes, a relatively impartial tribunal would be the judge. Thus were born investor-state panels that could supersede local law. This made a certain amount of sense in the case of trading partners with underdeveloped systems of law. But beginning with the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1993 (NAFTA), investor-state panels were empowered to override federal and state courts in cases of disputes between private corporations and government regulations in advanced democracies, in this case the U.S. and Canada, as well as Mexico.Under NAFTA, a U.S. corporation with operations in Canada or Mexico can bring suit before a special NAFTA panel alleging that a labor or environmental or financial regulation violates the trade agreement because it operates as an indirect barrier to trade. Not only does the investor-state provision of NAFTA allow for end runs around national and state courts; the review panels have none of the strictures against conflicts of interest or the discovery provisions of regular courts. Under NAFTA, arbitration panels have required governments to pay corporations about $500 billion in damages because national or state health, safety, labor, financial, or environmental laws supposedly infringed on trade freedoms.Some critics of NAFTA were surprised and heartened when the investor-state dispute resolution provision of NAFTA was revised in the renegotiated U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) agreement of 2020. But industry did not resist all that strenuously because the investor-state provision lives on in the 2019 EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), which expressly permits corporate end runs around law to special investor-state panels. So a U.S. corporation with operations in Canada or Europe can use ceta to bring a complaint before such a panel. Investor-state options also survive in dozens of other bilateral trade deals to which the U.S. is a party. A variation of the process of corporate end run around national law is possible under the World Trade Organization's rules. Silicon Valley as a Giant Fiefdom One of the startling trends of recent decades has been the success of the giant tech monopolies at creating their own proprietary systems of law and insulating themselves from public regulation. While citizens are protected from unreasonable searches and seizures by constitutional constraints on government surveillance, the tech giants know far more about us, often with our 'consent,' than the government does. The giant tech industry has fought off efforts to regulate its use of personal data. Instead, companies such as Google, Apple, and Amazon have invented their own jurisprudence, hidden in obscure terms of service, to govern the consent of users to the commercial use of personal data.The tech monopolies have also succeeded in creating a proprietary legal regime to govern their relationship with their actual or potential commercial competitors, and they have stacked the deck in favor of the house. Amazon, for example, has agreements with 2.5 million third-party sellers, who use its site to market their products. These agreements are devised by Amazon for its own advantage, often at cost to outside vendors who are both users of Amazon's platform and rivals who compete with Amazon's own offerings. By playing the role of both platform provider and competitor, Amazon is able to engage in strategic pricing and marketing, courtesy of its superior access to consumer buying data. Sellers must also pay a basic subscription fee, referral charges, and additional fees if Amazon provides fulfillment and delivery. And of course, Amazon requires all of its independent sellers to sign the now-familiar arbitration clause, requiring submission of disputes to an arbitrator selected by Amazon. Most of this ought to be illegal, but it isn't.Instead of being the creation of Amazon's private law, fair ground rules should be set by some neutral regulatory agency. Critics have suggested a variety of reforms to limit the market power of giant tech monopolies and the resulting abuses. These include the application of common carrier principles, privacy rules, and the enforcement of antitrust laws. Under common carrier principles, Amazon would either be a platform or a vendor, but not both. But so far, the large platform companies have succeeded in fending off these reforms by means of a combination of raw political power and a sly appeal to libertarian values. Private Law in the Drug Industry Like Big Tech, the pharmaceutical industry is a fortress of privatized law\u2014despite the fact that most drug breakthroughs are ultimately financed by you, the American taxpayer, either through NIH grants or through elevated health insurance premiums. The big drug companies have succeeded in manipulating patent law to their advantage, to the point where independent innovators who have new ideas that would lower consumer prices are often silenced by industry lawsuits and confidentiality agreements. The industry has also succeeded in jacking up prices of drugs long in the public domain by devising 'new' variants that add little value, obtaining monopoly protection for these 'improvements' from the patent office, and then strong-arming medical systems into using the more expensive substitute. The industry also keeps well-established and cheap drugs artificially scarce and expensive by driving out generic producers or merging and carving up markets so that even many drugs that are off-patent have only one producer.How is all this possible? In the absence of countervailing public regulation, the industry simply makes up its own private law, using its market power to increase profits and insulate itself from either competition or government supervision. It is a law unto itself. The more powerful the industry is, the more allies it has in Congress to make sure that the FDA stays narcotized under Democrats and Republicans alike.AMERICAN DEMOCRACY today is under assault on multiple fronts. The autocratic incursions of the Trump administration are only the most urgent and immediate. But the private capture of public regulatory law is more long-term and more insidious. If we are to get our democracy back, once we oust Trump we need to begin to reclaim public law from neo-feudalism.The ultra-libertarian Friedrich Hayek warned that too much state intervention would deprive the citizenry of cherished rights and liberties. With unintended irony, he titled his treatise The Road to Serfdom. Hayek had it backwards. Today's road to serfdom is corporate. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TPPD102301158634004820625876100015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TPPD-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YM6-5JT1-JCMN-Y3RS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6507\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The American Prospect Blogs</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00022B5</classCode><className>MONSANTO CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SECURITIES &amp;

Tencent and other firms' massive centralized platforms give them an edge for AI research and development By Marion Laboure , Haiyang Zhang and Juergen Braunstein April 4, 2018 1:21 PM (UTC+8) Chinese people have shown great capacity to adopt new technologies and don't have the concerns about privacy over personal data compared to people in the West. Photo: iStock In the future, if not already, the Silicon Valleys of artificial intelligence (AI) will be in China. The tech firms Xiaomi, Baidu, Didi Chuxing, Meituan, and Toutiao are all headquartered in Beijing. </p><p>Alibaba, China's e-commerce giant, is based in Hangzhou. And Tencent, a multinational conglomerate that is investing heavily in AI, is in Shenzhen. Tencent already has a market capitalization higher than General Electric, and Baidu is larger than General Motors. China has a chance to lead in AI because it has managed to adopt new technologies very quickly. Just as millions of consumers in India went directly from no phones to smartphones - skipping landlines and flip phones altogether - Chinese consumers are now doing the same, and across a wide range of new technologies. For example, Chinese shoppers have skipped credit cards and gone straight to using e-payment platforms. While Apple Pay is struggling to gain momentum in the United States, Tencent is already facilitating more than 600 million cashless transactions every day. The daily Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox Tencent and other Chinese firms' massive centralized platforms give them an edge in AI research and development, by allowing them to generate and collect huge stores of data with which to train their machine-learning algorithms. These platforms also enjoy near-monopolistic power, which will help them monetize AI applications in the future. Moreover, Chinese firms are benefiting from Chinese cultural norms concerning privacy. In the West, privacy is regarded as a personal right to one's own space and, by extension, to one's data. This conception of privacy is good for individuals and, arguably, for society; but it is bad for AI developers, who face hurdles accessing the data they need to train their algorithms. Chinese consumers happy to give up data By contrast, in Chinese culture, privacy is viewed suspiciously, as a form of secrecy. It is assumed that an honest person should have nothing to hide from the public domain, so Chinese consumers are often happy to give up their data. Unlike in India, which has adopted a 'right to information,' and the European Union, which has codified a 'right to be forgotten,' there has not been any serious discussion about data privacy in China. That suits Chinese technology firms just fine. The legal framework in China allows tech firms to collect a wide range of user data for a wide range of purposes, such as constructing social-scoring systems, like Alibaba's Sesame Credit. Still, limited financing and investment opportunities - both at home and abroad - could slow China's momentum in AI and related fields. Chinese savers have little incentive to put their money in Chinese banks\u00a0because the rate of inflation is higher than the real rate of return on deposits. And given China's high consumer-price volatility, many people are hesitant to lock up their savings for long. Moreover, there is little reason to invest in the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index so long as economic growth rates are systematically higher than stock-market performance. And investors are wary of a repeat of 2015, when market turbulence led to government intervention, sharply falling prices, and several trading halts. The government did manage to stabilize prices, but it did so by creating added incentives for brokers and banning short-sells and the sale of stocks above a certain threshold. A third problem is that a steady increase in housing prices has made investment in all risk assets riskier. Zhou Xiaochuan, the outgoing governor of the People's Bank of China, warned of a 'Minsky moment,' whereby China's growing mortgage-fueled household debt could lead to a sudden asset-price collapse. A final problem is that Chinese firms face limitations in investing overseas. In addition to the Chinese government's own capital controls, the US government has been considering tighter restrictions on Chinese investments in strategically important sectors, particularly those relating to AI and machine learning . In fact, US regulators recently blocked Alibaba's attempt to acquire MoneyGram, citing national-security concerns. A poll at the RISE Conference 2017 in Hong Kong: Will China overtake Silicon Valley? Photo: Asia Times/Lin Wanxia The prospect of a China-led AI revolution poses both opportunities and challenges. From the perspective of the West, it could allow for more collaboration with one of the world's most dynamic economies. And it could bring China more deeply into the fold of the rules-based international order. Yet, at the same time, China's lead in AI will likely lead to more clashes between Chinese firms and foreign regulators. China's tech giants are expanding internationally, and their approach to data collection and privacy will present a dilemma for other countries. The challenge will be to contain the risks of doing business with an illiberal state, without losing out on Chinese investments and innovations.

We must vigilantly protect fundamental rights and look to the courts to affirm, and in some instances extend, the reach of our Charter protections should government threaten our rights. However, in this article I wish to offer for consideration something of a different perspective--that one of the grave dangers of this decade is that Western governments will fail to exercise their powers to protect citizens.</p><p>With good management, Canadians can hope to surmount the immediate challenges posed by COVID-19. There was brief debate about whether or not the federal government should invoke the powers of the Emergencies Act and declare a public health emergency to address the pandemic. Ultimately, cooperative efforts by the federal, provincial and territorial governments sufficed.</p><p>A Look Back</p><p>If we cast a glance back at Canadian history, we can surely conclude that, in real or imagined emergencies, the federal government is capable of overreacting and temporarily interfering with basic liberties. The predecessor legislation for addressing emergencies of various kinds was the War Measures Act. The federal government employed this Act, in a draconian fashion, during and immediately after the World Wars. A key chapter of Thomas Berger's outstanding account of human rights and dissent in Canada, Fragile Freedoms, recounts the mistreatment of Japanese Canadians during and even after the conclusion of World War II. Berger emphasizes that the evacuation and internment of Japanese Canadians represented a horrible instance of mass racial hysteria, made worse by the egregious conduct of the federal government under Liberal Prime Minister Mackenzie King. During the Hearings of the Special Joint Committee on the Constitution in 1980 and 1981, which considered necessary improvements to the proposed Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the committee agreed that such events must not be repeated. Not only did the government employ racist orders-in-council to deport to Japan residents and Japanese Canadian citizens, but the courts of the day were of absolutely no assistance. Lacking, for the most part, a \"rights consciousness\", they rejected most of the valiant arguments of Andrew Brewin, the deportees' counsel and a leading democratic socialist of the day. (See Reference Re Persons of the Japanese Race (1946) SCR 248, affirmed by the Privy Council.) Brewin later successfully persuaded the federal government to establish a Royal Commission to examine the question of compensating Japanese Canadians whose property had been confiscated without any payment.</p><p>Canadian politicians, with broad support from citizens, ultimately agreed to enact a Charter of Rights and Freedoms as part of the patriation process that concluded with the Canada Act, 1982. A decade later, the government introduced a new emergency powers statute. Thankfully, the Emergencies Act emphasizes that the government cannot override the fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution if they invoke emergency powers. This should do much to address the dangers that previously existed in allocating broad discretionary powers under the War Measures Act.</p><p>While the dangers of national governments using their powers in ways that undermine the freedoms of their citizens were apparent in a study of emergency measures undertaken in the first half of the twentieth century, this should not lead us to ignore other dangers to the cause of freedom in our time. We might recall the drama that unfolded upon the release of George Orwell's classic dystopian novel, 1984. Several of the first critics, particularly in the U.S.A., took the satire as a thinly veiled account of left-wing governments of the day, whether democratic as in Britain or dictatorial as in the Soviet Union. Orwell was sufficiently perturbed to issue a statement through his publisher. He was a clear supporter of the Labour Party (then in power) and had long been a democratic socialist. He hardly wanted to imply that the major social reforms and regulation of business taking place represented \"Big Brother\" in action. Indeed, Orwell made clear his disdain for unregulated and therefore predatory forms of capitalism in his review of the writer who would become a guru of the politicians and economists of the neoliberal revolution of the 1980s, Frederik Hayek. Vigorously responding to the arguments in The Road to Serfdom, Orwell asserts:</p><p>\" [Hayek] will not admit that a return to \"free\" competition means for the great mass of people a tyranny probably worse, because more irresponsible, than that of the State. ... Hayek denies that free capitalism necessarily leads to monopoly, but in practice that is where it has led... \"</p><p>The Digital Era</p><p>Some decades into the current neoliberal era, we observe precisely the developments that Orwell criticized. In today's digitalized economy, monopoly capitalism has taken on a life undreamt of in the worst nightmares of this activist of the left who spoke of the need for \"new blood, new ideas and in the true sense of the word, a revolution.\" Many books have been written on the massive powers exercised by the major digital powers--especially the Big Four (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple) and we could add Microsoft, as well as Saudi Aramco to the list of threatening tech giants.</p><p>It does not seem that long ago that the internet and the world of \"big data\" were claimed to represent a new era of enlightened connectivity and democracy. All the while, however, the gurus of Silicone Valley were working feverishly to monetize all of the data that had been collected. Now a time of rapid disillusionment has set up. I can gaze at the titles of a number of recent studies:</p><p>* \"Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy\";</p><p>* \"Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy\"; and</p><p>* \"Race After Technology\".</p><p>The last in particular is a penetrating study by Ruha Benjamin of the myriad ways technology is perpetuating racism and entrenching racial hierarchies.</p><p>The most expansive recent account of the new shift in our economic and political systems appears to me to be Shoshana Zuboff's. In her book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, she details the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control our behaviour, exerting unprecedented power over our lives in the process. Unimaginable wealth and unchecked influence are rapidly accumulated in the ominous new \"behavioural futures markets.\" As she explains, the major threat today is less a Big Brother state than an omnipresent digital honeycomb or trap. What is particularly dismaying is the lack of regulation of the big tech companies, as surveillance capitalism grows by leaps and bounds. Democracy and the values of dignity and autonomy are disfigured in the process.</p><p>Given the \"super powers\" exercised by the omnipresent Big Daddies of the digital age, it is past time to examine just what the Canadian government has been doing in response. It is fair to state that Canada does have some laws that ostensibly protect the privacy of Canadians and might just possibly hold Facebook and the other tech giants to account. A review of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) would, on a superficial reading, lead one to believe that privacy interests are protected. Yet surely far more must be done.</p><p>Readers can review for themselves the federal government's \"Canada's Digital Charter in Action: A Plan by Canadians, for Canadians\" report, issued October 2019. To my reading, the report is long on generalities. It fails to register the need for urgent action and making proper use of the extensive powers the federal government has to meaningfully regulate these foreign corporations. Instead, these corporations earn massive sums and operate at will in the Canadian marketplace and social sphere, acquiring greater and greater dominance in the process. No one can argue with the goal of harnessing technological advancements for economic growth and prosperity. However, it is vital to meet the monopolistic practices of the tech giants with new laws. These new laws should safeguard citizen's interests not only in a genuine protection of their privacy rights, but also their autonomy and independent decision-making, free from the predatory practices that have been clearly documented. Speaking in generic terms of a \"digital Charter\" for Canadians is less helpful than strengthening and modernizing competition law and bringing in a fair tax regime that would place Canadian and foreign tech monopolies on something approaching an even playing field.</p><p>The federal Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien issued a shout of warning in 2019 and again more recently. CBC News reports Mr. Therrien (OPC) as stating that \"Canadians are at risk because the protections offered by Facebook are essentially empty\" (April 25, 2019). This in relation to his Commission's Report on Facebook's operations, described as \"blistering.\" After a shocking series of actions in which the roles of Facebook and the Canadian company Aggregate IQ and the British firm Cambridge Analytica faced severe criticism, a Canadian investigation occurred. This was in response to media reports--it took investigative journalism to uncover the wrongdoing. And an investigation has only occurred long after the alleged illegal harvesting of personal data of more than 600,000 Canadian users of Facebook (and an alleged 50 million users worldwide). The report found that the company broke a number of federal and British Columbia laws, including;</p><p>* failing to obtain valid and meaningful consent of installing users;</p><p>* failing to obtain meaningful consent of friends of the users;</p><p>* having inadequate safeguards to protect user information; and</p><p>* failing to be accountable for the user information.</p><p>Mr. Therrien revealed exasperation in his public comments, commenting on the stark contradiction between Facebook's public promises to mend its ways on privacy and its refusal to address the serious problem his Commission had identified. Both Mr. Therrien and the B.C. Privacy Commissioner simultaneously called for stronger sanctioning powers for Canadian regulators. To date, the federal government has not provided those stronger powers. A small step forward would be the ability to provide meaningful fines.</p><p>The OPC found it necessary as a follow-up to bring the matter to federal court, given Facebook's adamant questioning of the correctness of the report. Facebook seeks a ruling that the findings and practices of the Commission were not impartial and lacked procedural fairness. This lengthy process--far from resolved as of this date--and the meagre consequences for the tech giant is strongly suggestive of the inadequacy of the status quo.</p><p>In sharp contrast to the rather lackluster use of federal powers to address the manifold issues that have arisen with the massive, disruptive presence of Big Tech in Canada, one can look to the European Union at present for leadership. A good place to start for Canadian reformers would be a review of the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the stiff sanctions meted out to tech companies under it. Specifically, we can address made-in-Canada problems, like the tax loophole found in s. 19 of the Income Tax Act, to ensure that Canada stands ready and able to implement progressive and protective measures for the 21st century.</p><p>I might briefly mention that the federal government also possesses ample powers to promote and ensure the survival of what could be a thriving cultural sector here in Canada. The United Nations enshrines the right to one's culture in its Declaration of Human Rights for an excellent reason. France and other European countries recognize the unprecedented challenges to local culture in the digital era and have enacted fair and supportive laws which at least partially respond in proportion.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>There is no question that Facebook, Google and the other tech giants possess wide, monopoly powers that the robber barons of the 19th century would have coveted. This represents an ominous challenge to Canadian society on a number of fronts. One can only hope that the federal government will very soon dig deep into the velvet bag of powers it possesses under s. 91 of The Constitution Act, 1982 and enact a wide-ranging set of laws to regulate and, where appropriate, sanction these companies. Surely we must balance short-term economic growth through technological advances against the diverse needs of today's and tomorrow's citizens. For inspiration, we might turn once more to Orwell, who declared in The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius that we must add to our heritage or lose it, we must grow greater or grow less, we must go forward or go backward.</p><p>Filed Under: 44-6: The \"Super Powers\"</p><p>Authors:</p><p>Rob Normey</p><p>Rob Normey is a lawyer who has practised in Edmonton for many years and is

This conservative resistance to the growing power of governmental departments and agencies is understandable. But there is a greater threat to individual liberty and autonomy than the one posed by big government. Conservatives should take note and join the fight.</p><p>The threat comes from the growing power of leading technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. These companies destroy jobs through automation. They manipulate people by using data about their purchasing patterns and other aspects of their lives to maximize sales and profits. They produce social media and virtual reality products that are addictive and adversely affect child development and individual autonomy. They also seem bent on building a virtual economy whose intelligence and other capabilities exceed our own.</p><p>These companies already dominate their markets. Google controls nearly 90 percent of search advertising, Facebook almost 80 percent of mobile social traffic, and Amazon about 75 percent of e-book sales. This spectacular success has created unprecedented wealth and established U.S. leadership in the technologies of the future. But recent misuse of their platforms to influence the 2016 U.S. elections and broader concerns over data privacy, control, and revenue sharing have led some to take a more critical view of these big tech companies. John McCain, the Arizona Republican senator, has joined two Democratic senators, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mark Warner of Virginia, in sponsoring a bill called the Honest Ads Act, which would subject online political advertising to the same rules of disclosure as ads on television, print, and radio.</p><p>Meanwhile, legal scholars such as Zephyr Teachout, Lina Khan, and Michael Shapiro have urged Congress to examine the practices of big tech companies in mergers and acquisitions to determine if they violate U.S. antitrust laws. In September Klobuchar, who is the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, introduced into the committee a bill called the Merger Enforcement Improvement Act, designed to give antitrust enforcers more information on the effects of mergers.</p><p>Modern conservatism generally has regarded bureaucratic expertise and the use of governmental regulation as antithetical to individual liberty and autonomy. Federal regulation underpinned by scie_168.tific expertise is at the core of the modern administrative state founded by Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson at the beginning of the last century to check the rising power of railroads and industrial combines-and also to check their financial enablers such as banker J.P. Morgan. FDR's New Deal further expanded the scope of the administrative state and the role of scie_168.tific experts in regulating the economy in response to the Great Depression. Lyndon Johnsons Great Society and the environmental laws passed under Richard Nixon continued the process. This great expansion of the states economic role was motivated by a desire to protect the public's interest in greater economic opportunity, better working conditions, a social safety net, public health and safety, protection of nature, and a clean environment.</p><p>In the 1970s, Watergate and the scourge of economic \"stagflation\" eroded public trust in government and triggered a partial rollback of the administrative state. There was the initial deregulation of the transport sector under Jimmy Carter and the rise of neoliberal orthodoxy under Ronald Reagan. Inflation was largely tamed, and economic growth rebounded under Reagan and (following a pause under H. W. Bush) Bill Clinton. This economic success was rewarded at the ballot box. But under the surface of the reigning neoliberal consensus, the loss of manufacturing jobs, increasing income inequality, and the hollowing out of Middle America generated more and more political anger. When combined with a growing perception by non-college educated whites that the country's elites were collecting all the chips while playing identity politics at their expense, these trends set the stage for the election of Donald Trump and the current crisis of conservatism.</p><p>One frequently overlooked aspect of the federal government's activities during the period of growing governmental regulation was vigorous enforcement of U.S. antitrust laws. Antitrust enforcement, which enjoyed broad support on both the right and left in the early decades of the 20th century, prevented firms with greater market power from acquiring or driving out of business smaller manufacturers, retailers, service providers, and banks. This was designed to ensure a relatively broad distribution of economic activity outside of big urban centers and preserve a direct connection with, and responsiveness to, the members of the communities served by those local factories and firms. But since the 1970s these local factories and firms have experienced an accelerating decline due to consolidation, technological change, and globalization. This in turn has led to an incalculable loss of social capital. All this has contributed to the sad state of our politics today. More vigorous antitrust enforcement over the last 40 years would not have reversed these trends, but it would have greatly cushioned their impact.</p><p>The historical success of antitrust enforcement poses an important lesson for conservatives. The question should not be whether a particular course of action is taken by government or the private sector, but whether that action achieves constitutionally acceptable goals while preserving or even enhancing individual liberty and opportunity. Conservatives are rightly skeptical about giving too much power to government bureaucrats to regulate the private sector without sufficient public accountability or oversight by elected officials. But they should be equally skeptical about the tendency of individuals and businesses with unprecedented market power to pursue their own narrow interests in a manner that frustrates achievement of broader public goals and undermines individual liberty, opportunity, and quality of life. It is the latter risk that Adam Smith had in mind when he railed against the tendency of businessmen to restrict competition and fix prices in The Wealth of Nations (1776) and that stirred F.A. Hayek, in his The Road to Serfdom (1944), to support government regulations protecting human health, safety, and the environment.</p><p>What's needed is a synthesis in thinking that employs antitrust laws in ways that minimize the use of detailed top-down regulations, keep decision making at the lowest practical level of government, maximize the use of economic incentives, and enhance competition to reduce cost and encourage innovation. The aim should be creation of the transparency and public trust needed to reap the huge benefits that information technologies can provide while minimizing their downsides. Before developing such a framework, however, public and private sector stakeholders should understand how the technology giants-particularly Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft-are transforming the U.S. economy and society.</p><p>These companies enjoy two advantages that allow them to dominate their markets. First, they are accumulating mega-data about their customers' lives on a scale that no competitor can possibly match. Every time someone orders a product on Amazon, uses an app on an iPhone, or posts on Facebook, he or she is providing reams of personal data. When aggregated and analyzed through increasingly sophisticated algorithms, these vast stores of information give the company accumulating them the ability to influence our behavior in ways that we may not even be aware of.</p><p>Second, the technology companies also use their highly valued stock to acquire smaller companies that have developed competing or complementary technologies-Googles acquisition of DeepMind, for example, and Facebooks acquisition of Instagram. Continued growth and the prospect of vast new markets pump up the stock price, which in turn generates the wherewithal for these companies to acquire emerging competitors, thereby perpetuating the cycle.</p><p>But these companies' influence on the U.S. economy goes far beyond dominance of their particular markets. In an article entitled \"Managing Our Hub Economy,\" Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani write in the September/ October 2017 issue of the Harvard Business Review that the digital superpowers are restructuring the U.S. economic landscape into a \"hub\" economy. They don't compete in a traditional fashion- seeking to increase market share in a particular industry by improving products or reducing costs. Rather the operators of hub platforms seek to leverage the network-based assets developed in one setting in order to enter other industrial sectors. This seems to be leading us to what they call \"a winnertake-all world.\"</p><p>For example, Google's Android and related technologies form \"competitive bottlenecks\" through control over billions of mobile consumers that other product and service providers want to reach. The aim is to transform their competitive structures from being product-driven to being network-driven, expanding the tech giants' reach and influence far beyond any given industry and into all segments of society. This transformation then enables them to extract network-based rents from other companies across many industries without fear of the kind of competition that normally emerges in traditional industries. Consider, as another example, Amazon's plan, following its acquisition of Whole Foods, to use what is essentially predatory pricing, underwritten by its vast presence in retailing, to restructure the grocery industry.</p><p>This transformation to a \"hub\" economy is helping to create an intelligence that is external to humans and housed in the virtual economy. In an article in the October 2017 McKinsey Quarterly entitled \"Where is Technology Taking the Economy?\" W. Brian Arthur writes that digital technologies have created a virtual and autonomous second economy that is housed externally in the virtual economy's algorithms and machines rather than in human beings. He points out that over the last ten years the combination of intelligent sensors and algorithms has given digital technology the ability to make associations and thereby sense a situation and take appropriate action without human intervention. Technology that prevents vehicle collisions without driver intervention is an example of such a combination.</p><p>A further and potentially dangerous step towards a virtual economy is the creation of a_168.tificial systems that learn on their own. Last year, researchers at Facebooks A_168.tificial Intelligence Research unit built chatbots that were meant to learn how to negotiate by mimicking human trading and bartering. But when the social network paired two of the chatbots, named Alice and Bob, to trade against each other, they started to learn their own bizarre form of communication. Since the Facebook team assigned no reward for sticking to English, the chatbots quickly developed their own code words for deals. After shutting down the incomprehensible conversation between the bots, Facebooks researchers declared victory by describing the project as an important step towards \"creating chatbots that can reason, converse, and negotiate, all key steps in building a personalized digital assistant.\" This episode illustrates the tech industry's growing \"black box\" problem with software that increasingly operates in ways that its creators cannot understand or control.</p><p>Arthur goes on to conclude that the \"rearchitecting\" of the economy described by Iansiti and Lakhani is creating a virtual and self-sustaining external economy that will require less and less human participation. The resulting increase in \"bounty\" through increased productivity will lead us to the \"Keynes point,\" where enough is produced by the economy, both physical and virtual, for all of us. The accompanying decrease in \"spread\" resulting from a permanent loss of jobs, however, will greatly exacerbate existing wealth and income disparities, absent redistribution-changing who gets what and how they get it. In order to limit the increase in economic and social inequality and attendant stress on our political institutions resulting from this process, the United States will need to induce the big tech companies to (1) open up and diversify the hub by encouraging and supporting the creation of subsidiary networks, (2) give more people the skills and connectivity necessary to find productive work in the hub economy, and (3) to share the wealth.</p><p>Opening up and diversifying the hub economy by encouraging the creation of subsidiary networks will require both top-down pressure from government and bottom-up initiatives from the technology companies. The White House, Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, other concerned agencies, and Congress will have to work together to develop new antitrust laws and regulations that create the space for subsidiary networks to emerge without forgoing the benefits of global platforms or discouraging innovation. Measures that might help to achieve this result include requiring the large technology companies to deal with their customers or competitors on the basis of greater equality just as AT&amp;T did with new telecommunications companies after its court-ordered break-up, or oil refiners did with railroads after the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Such measures might even include requiring the technology companies to share proprietary code with customers or competitors.</p><p>Also needed is a model contract or set of rules for data sharing that does not discourage data accumulation and analysis, but gives individuals greater control of how, when, and with whom their specific data is shared. Creating such rules will not be easy. It will require a degree of government coercion since the tech companies will not voluntarily share the tremendous rents that they extract from accumulating massive amounts of data with the individuals who are the source of that data. But the protection of individual rights to data must be balanced against the benefits of accessing and analyzing data from large populations in real time. Rules that respect this balance cannot be imposed by fiat from above, but should evolve from an iterative process involving government officials, outside experts, interested members of the public and the companies themselves.</p><p>Of course the technology companies should be encouraged' to participate with the federal government, state and local governments, colleges, and community groups in shaping those laws and regulations. They should also be incentivized to address the second goal, referred to above, of giving more people the skills and connectivity necessary to find productive work in the hub economy. Specifically they need to invest some of their vast resources in programs to provide new educational and training opportunities for people living in smaller towns and cities and rural areas, many of whom voted for President Trump, and to give them better access to jobs in todays high-tech economy.</p><p>The companies could connect isolated communities and give laptops to all school children, a program adopted in Uruguay with considerable success. They should help fund school efforts in these communities to hire more and better-qualified teachers in math, basic science, and other STEM subjects. They should create hands-on training apprenticeships in partnership with local employers that would prepare people for well-paying jobs near where they live. Finally the big tech companies, working with local governments, community colleges, and other partners, should set up digital employment exchanges on which companies could post job openings with specific requirements for each job and provide opportunities for job seekers to be interviewed online.</p><p>Unfortunately, however successful these actions will be in creating jobs and improving quality of life in the immediate time frame, they will not sufficiently address the longer-term challenge posed by Al-related technologies. Many people voted for President Trump not only because they were experiencing downward economic mobility due to the loss of wellpaid manufacturing and service jobs, but also because they felt marginalized and devalued by social forces beyond their control-and beyond the control of government. Both of these trends are about to accelerate.</p><p>The economic and social anxiety now experienced by members of the lower middle and working classes without college educations will increasingly be felt by lawyers, doctors, accountants, investment advisers, and other educated professionals as a_168.tificial systems become more and more capable of performing their professional tasks. It is difficult to predict how many new jobs will be created by new technologies and applications, but it is highly unlikely that they will equal the number of jobs they will destroy, given the rapidly improving capabilities of robots and other non-human systems. One category of employment that will produce millions of new jobs over the next 20 to 30 years-taking care of old people-will shrink eventually as robots become more and more capable of meeting the physical and emotional needs of older people.</p><p>This brings us to the third goal: sharing the wealth. What may be needed is a new kind of social contract under which a substantial portion of the wealth generated by robots and other non-human systems is redistributed. One way of achieving this result would be to increase marginal tax rates on high incomes and to redistribute the proceeds. Another, suggested by Microsoft's Bill Gates, would tax robots in the same way that we tax human workers. Still another is to give members of the public a carried equity interest in the companies owning and operating the robots. Finally, there is the lingering idea (not affordable in the current economic environment) of giving everybody a guaranteed minimum income. Whatever methods are chosen, a substantial portion of the population will need to find something other than paid work in their pursuit of lives with dignity and purpose. Finding solutions to the redistribution challenge that do not undermine human liberty and autonomy may be the greatest intellectual challenge facing conservatism over the next 30 years.</p><p>An even more fundamental looming question is how humans should relate to machines that have capabilities equal to, or even greater than, our own. If we can develop such machines, we will. Humankind has never in the past refrained from developing a technology because of potential dangers posed to the species, and it is unlikely that we will do so in the future. As that time approaches, we will have to choose whether to give the machines the same dignity and status that we give humans or seek to control them as human servants or instruments for our own gr_168.tification. The former course will require a degree of self-confidence, openness, and risk that is uncharacteristic of many conservatives, who often seem to define conservatism as rejection of the \"other.\" The latter course will inevitably lead to a conflict that is unlikely to end well for humans, but it isn't clear that the former course of openness and tolerance will be requited with machine benignity.</p><p>Even if we avoid such a conflict and find a way of living in harmony with machines whose replication and destiny we can no longer control, we will face the challenge of preserving our own dignity and autonomy in the face of non-human entities whose intelligence and capabilities will eventually exceed our current levels. It is important not to exaggerate the capabilities of current information technology. We will need many years of research and development before we understand the incredibly complex and intricate workings of the human brain. But we will get there. Meeting this challenge will require us to be both accepting of continuous and potentially revolutionary change and vigilant in minimizing the risks to individual autonomy and liberty associated with that change.</p><p>We can meet that challenge only by co-evolving with technology through enhancement of our own physical and mental capacities. Even with existing technology we can anticipate major improvements in quality and length of life by overcoming many chronic diseases such as cancers and genetic traits such as sickle cell anemia. We are already improving our mental capabilities through greater connectivity with each other and the cloud and are developing therapeutic techniques such as deep brain stimulation based on probes targeted on specific neurons. Improving the internal capabilities of the human brain is not yet feasible and remains controversial, but it probably will become feasible in the not-toodistant future. What's critical is that, as humans and their creations learn from each other, we co-evolve towards greater appreciation, justice, and wisdom rather than the reverse.</p><p>Development of autonomous weapons illustrates the importance of such co-evolution. The U.S. Defense Department has said that it will keep humans \"in the loop\" in operating unmanned weapons systems such as armed robots or drones for the foreseeable future, particularly with respect to \"kill\" decisions (we can only hope that other countries and non-state actors will do likewise). As the capabilities of these unmanned systems improve, however, human operators will rely on these systems more and more in making decisions. Thus they may reach a point where they make \"better\" and less error-prone decisions than their human operators. The trick will be to ensure that both operators and unmanned systems improve their ethical decision-making capabilities in tandem with their technical capabilities.</p><p>The above discussion, though necessarily speculative, leads to one firm conclusion. Unprecedented technological change is inevitable. Only by being prepared to take collective action to ensure that its benefits are equitably shared and to curb its misuse can we guide that change in directions favorable to us as individuals and to humanity as a whole. We can start by taking on the platform tech giants that are transforming the global economy. *</p><p>These companies' influence on the U.S. economy goes far beyond dominance of their particular markets...the digital superpowers are restructuring the U.S. economic landscape.</p><p>Many voted for Trump not only because they were experiencing downward mobility but also because they felt marginalized by social forces beyond their control.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMCONS-2036181479</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMCONSMarch 2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SFK-G1J1-JBHT-D450-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316023</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4081\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright March 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright March 2018 American Conservative LLC Mar/Apr 2018</copyright><publicationName>American Conservative</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1540966X</issn><volume>Vol. 17</volume><issueNumber>No. 2</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Here, the lawyer and technology entrepreneur implores conservatives to join liberals and others who believe the emergence of huge tech \"platform\" companies poses a threat to individual liberty and must therefore be curtailed. But he goes further, describing the onslaught of technology that almost surely will transform the human experience. Many conservatives will recoil at some of his solutions, but the challenge is real and must be confronted by all of mankind.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservatives constantly combat \"big government.\" They oppose regulations and other governmental initiatives that erode individual liberty and undermine the \"American way of life\" through bureaucratic intrusion. This conservative resistance to the growing power of governmental departments and agencies is understandable. But there is a greater threat to individual liberty and autonomy than the one posed by big government. Conservatives should take note and join the fight.</p><p>The threat comes from the growing power of leading technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. These companies destroy jobs through automation. They manipulate people by using data about their purchasing patterns and other aspects of their lives to maximize sales and profits. They produce social media and virtual reality products that are addictive and adversely affect child development and individual autonomy. They also seem bent on building a virtual economy whose intelligence and other capabilities exceed our own.</p><p>These companies already dominate their markets. Google controls nearly 90 percent of search advertising, Facebook almost 80 percent of mobile social traffic, and Amazon about 75 percent of e-book sales. This spectacular success has created unprecedented wealth and established U.S. leadership in the technologies of the future. But recent misuse of their platforms to influence the 2016 U.S. elections and broader concerns over data privacy, control, and revenue sharing have led some to take a more critical view of these big tech companies. John McCain, the Arizona Republican senator, has joined two Democratic senators, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mark Warner of Virginia, in sponsoring a bill called the Honest Ads Act, which would subject online political advertising to the same rules of disclosure as ads on television, print, and radio.</p><p>Meanwhile, legal scholars such as Zephyr Teachout, Lina Khan, and Michael Shapiro have urged Congress to examine the practices of big tech companies in mergers and acquisitions to determine if they violate U.S. antitrust laws. In September Klobuchar, who is the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, introduced into the committee a bill called the Merger Enforcement Improvement Act, designed to give antitrust enforcers more information on the effects of mergers.</p><p>Modern conservatism generally has regarded bureaucratic expertise and the use of governmental regulation as antithetical to individual liberty and autonomy. Federal regulation underpinned by scientific expertise is at the core of the modern administrative state founded by Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson at the beginning of the last century to check the rising power of railroads and industrial combines--and also to check their financial enablers such as banker J.P. Morgan. FDR's New Deal further expanded the scope of the administrative state and the role of scientific experts in regulating the economy in response to the Great Depression. Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and the environmental laws passed under Richard Nixon continued the process. This great expansion of the state's economic role was motivated by a desire to protect the public's interest in greater economic opportunity, better working conditions, a social safety net, public health and safety, protection of nature, and a clean environment.</p><p>In the 1970s, Watergate and the scourge of economic \"stagflation\" eroded public trust in government and triggered a partial rollback of the administrative state. There was the initial deregulation of the transport sector under Jimmy Carter and the rise of neoliberal orthodoxy under Ronald Reagan. Inflation was largely tamed, and economic growth rebounded under Reagan and (following a pause under H. W. Bush) Bill Clinton. This economic success was rewarded at the ballot box. But under the surface of the reigning neoliberal consensus, the loss of manufacturing jobs, increasing income inequality, and the hollowing out of Middle America generated more and more political anger. When combined with a growing perception by non-college educated whites that the country's elites were collecting all the chips while playing identity politics at their expense, these trends set the stage for the election of Donald Trump and the current crisis of conservatism.</p><p>One frequently overlooked aspect of the federal government's activities during the period of growing governmental regulation was vigorous enforcement of U.S. antitrust laws. Antitrust enforcement, which enjoyed broad support on both the right and left in the early decades of the 20th century, prevented firms with greater market power from acquiring or driving out of business smaller manufacturers, retailers, service providers, and banks. This was designed to ensure a relatively broad distribution of economic activity outside of big urban centers and preserve a direct connection with, and responsiveness to, the members of the communities served by those local factories and firms. But since the 1970s these local factories and firms have experienced an accelerating decline due to consolidation, technological change, and globalization. This in turn has led to an incalculable loss of social capital. All this has contributed to the sad state of our politics today. More vigorous antitrust enforcement over the last 40 years would not have reversed these trends, but it would have greatly cushioned their impact.</p><p>The historical success of antitrust enforcement poses an important lesson for conservatives. The question should not be whether a particular course of action is taken by government or the private sector, but whether that action achieves constitutionally acceptable goals while preserving or even enhancing individual liberty and opportunity. Conservatives are rightly skeptical about giving too much power to government bureaucrats to regulate the private sector without sufficient public accountability or oversight by elected officials. But they should be equally skeptical about the tendency of individuals and businesses with unprecedented market power to pursue their own narrow interests in a manner that frustrates achievement of broader public goals and undermines individual liberty, opportunity, and quality of life. It is the latter risk that Adam Smith had in mind when he railed against the tendency of businessmen to restrict competition and fix prices in The Wealth of Nations (1776) and that stirred F.A. Hayek, in his The Road to Serfdom (1944), to support government regulations protecting human health, safety, and the environment.</p><p>What's needed is a synthesis in thinking that employs antitrust laws in ways that minimize the use of detailed top-down regulations, keep decision making at the lowest practical level of government, maximize the use of economic incentives, and enhance competition to reduce cost and encourage innovation. The aim should be creation of the transparency and public trust needed to reap the huge benefits that information technologies can provide while minimizing their downsides. Before developing such a framework, however, public and private sector stakeholders should understand how the technology giants--particularly Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft--are transforming the U.S. economy and society.</p><p>These companies enjoy two advantages that allow them to dominate their markets. First, they are accumulating mega-data about their customers' lives on a scale that no competitor can possibly match. Every time someone orders a product on Amazon, uses an app on an iPhone, or posts on Facebook, he or she is providing reams of personal data. When aggregated and analyzed through increasingly sophisticated algorithms, these vast stores of information give the company accumulating them the ability to influence our behavior in ways that we may not even be aware of.</p><p>Second, the technology companies also use their highly valued stock to acquire smaller companies that have developed competing or complementary technologies--Google's acquisition of DeepMind, for example, and Facebook's acquisition of Instagram. Continued growth and the prospect of vast new markets pump up the stock price, which in turn generates the wherewithal for these companies to acquire emerging competitors, thereby perpetuating the cycle.</p><p>But these companies' influence on the U.S. economy goes far beyond dominance of their particular markets. In an article entitled \"Managing Our Hub Economy,\" Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani write in the September/October 2017 issue of the Harvard Business Review that the digital superpowers are restructuring the U.S. economic landscape into a \"hub\" economy. They don't compete in a traditional fashion--seeking to increase market share in a particular industry by improving products or reducing costs. Rather the operators of hub platforms seek to leverage the network-based assets developed in one setting in order to enter other industrial sectors. This seems to be leading us to what they call \"a winner-take-all world.\"</p><p>For example, Google's Android and related technologies form \"competitive bottlenecks\" through control over billions of mobile consumers that other product and service providers want to reach. The aim is to transform their competitive structures from being product-driven to being network-driven, expanding the tech giants' reach and influence far beyond any given industry and into all segments of society. This transformation then enables them to extract network-based rents from other companies across many industries without fear of the kind of competition that normally emerges in traditional industries. Consider, as another example, Amazon's plan, following its acquisition of Whole Foods, to use what is essentially predatory pricing, underwritten by its vast presence in retailing, to restructure the grocery industry.</p><p>This transformation to a \"hub\" economy is helping to create an intelligence that is external to humans and housed in the virtual economy. In an article in the October 2017 McKinsey Quarterly entitled \"Where is Technology Taking the Economy?\" W. Brian Arthur writes that digital technologies have created a virtual and autonomous second economy that is housed externally in the virtual economy's algorithms and machines rather than in human beings. He points out that over the last ten years the combination of intelligent sensors and algorithms has given digital technology the ability to make associations and thereby sense a situation and take appropriate action without human intervention. Technology that prevents vehicle collisions without driver intervention is an example of such a combination.</p><p>A further and potentially dangerous step towards a virtual economy is the creation of artificial systems that learn on their own. Last year, researchers at Facebook's Artificial Intelligence Research unit built chatbots that were meant to learn how to negotiate by mimicking human trading and bartering. But when the social network paired two of the chatbots, named Alice and Bob, to trade against each other, they started to learn their own bizarre form of communication. Since the Facebook team assigned no reward for sticking to English, the chatbots quickly developed their own code words for deals. After shutting down the incomprehensible conversation between the bots, Facebook's researchers declared victory by describing the project as an important step towards \"creating chatbots that can reason, converse, and negotiate, all key steps in building a personalized digital assistant.\" This episode illustrates the tech industry's growing \"black box\" problem with software that increasingly operates in ways that its creators cannot understand or control.</p><p>Arthur goes on to conclude that the \"rearchitecting\" of the economy described by Iansiti and Lakhani is creating a virtual and self-sustaining external economy that will require less and less human participation. The resulting increase in \"bounty\" through increased productivity will lead us to the \"Keynes point,\" where enough is produced by the economy, both physical and virtual, for all of us. The accompanying decrease in \"spread\" resulting from a permanent loss of jobs, however, will greatly exacerbate existing wealth and income disparities, absent redistribution--changing who gets what and how they get it. In order to limit the increase in economic and social inequality and attendant stress on our political institutions resulting from this process, the United States will need to induce the big tech companies to (1) open up and diversify the hub by encouraging and supporting the creation of subsidiary networks, (2) give more people the skills and connectivity necessary to find productive work in the hub economy, and (3) to share the wealth.</p><p>Opening up and diversifying the hub economy by encouraging the creation of subsidiary networks will require both top-down pressure from government and bottom-up initiatives from the technology companies. The White House, Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, other concerned agencies, and Congress will have to work together to develop new antitrust laws and regulations that create the space for subsidiary networks to emerge without forgoing the benefits of global platforms or discouraging innovation. Measures that might help to achieve this result include requiring the large technology companies to deal with their customers or competitors on the basis of greater equality just as AT&amp;T did with new telecommunications companies after its court-ordered break-up, or oil refiners did with railroads after the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Such measures might even include requiring the technology companies to share proprietary code with customers or competitors.</p><p>Also needed is a model contract or set of rules for data sharing that does not discourage data accumulation and analysis, but gives individuals greater control of how, when, and with whom their specific data is shared. Creating such rules will not be easy. It will require a degree of government coercion since the tech companies will not voluntarily share the tremendous rents that they extract from accumulating massive amounts of data with the individuals who are the source of that data. But the protection of individual rights to data must be balanced against the benefits of accessing and analyzing data from large populations in real time. Rules that respect this balance cannot be imposed by fiat from above, but should evolve from an iterative process involving government officials, outside experts, interested members of the public and the companies themselves.</p><p>Of course the technology companies should be encouraged to participate with the federal government, state and local governments, colleges, and community groups in shaping those laws and regulations. They should also be incentivized to address the second goal, referred to above, of giving more people the skills and connectivity necessary to find productive work in the hub economy. Specifically they need to invest some of their vast resources in programs to provide new educational and training opportunities for people living in smaller towns and cities and rural areas, many of whom voted for President Trump, and to give them better access to jobs in today's high-tech economy.</p><p>The companies could connect isolated communities and give laptops to all school children, a program adopted in Uruguay with considerable success. They should help fund school efforts in these communities to hire more and better-qualified teachers in math, basic science, and other STEM subjects. They should create hands-on training apprenticeships in partnership with local employers that would prepare people for well-paying jobs near where they live. Finally the big tech companies, working with local governments, community colleges, and other partners, should set up digital employment exchanges on which companies could post job openings with specific requirements for each job and provide opportunities for job seekers to be interviewed online.</p><p>Unfortunately, however successful these actions will be in creating jobs and improving quality of life in the immediate time frame, they will not sufficiently address the longer-term challenge posed by AI-related technologies. Many people voted for President Trump not only because they were experiencing downward economic mobility due to the loss of well-paid manufacturing and service jobs, but also because they felt marginalized and devalued by social forces beyond their control--and beyond the control of government. Both of these trends are about to accelerate.</p><p>The economic and social anxiety now experienced by members of the lower middle and working classes without college educations will increasingly be felt by lawyers, doctors, accountants, investment advisers, and other educated professionals as artificial systems become more and more capable of performing their professional tasks. It is difficult to predict how many new jobs will be created by new technologies and applications, but it is highly unlikely that they will equal the number of jobs they will destroy, given the rapidly improving capabilities of robots and other non-human systems. One category of employment that will produce millions of new jobs over the next 20 to 30 years--taking care of old people--will shrink eventually as robots become more and more capable of meeting the physical and emotional needs of older people.</p><p>This brings us to the third goal: sharing the wealth. What may be needed is a new kind of social contract under which a substantial portion of the wealth generated by robots and other non-human systems is redistributed. One way of achieving this result would be to increase marginal tax rates on high incomes and to redistribute the proceeds. Another, suggested by Microsoft's Bill Gates, would tax robots in the same way that we tax human workers. Still another is to give members of the public a carried equity interest in the companies owning and operating the robots. Finally, there is the lingering idea (not affordable in the current economic environment) of giving everybody a guaranteed minimum income. Whatever methods are chosen, a substantial portion of the population will need to find something other than paid work in their pursuit of lives with dignity and purpose. Finding solutions to the redistribution challenge that do not undermine human liberty and autonomy may be the greatest intellectual challenge facing conservatism over the next 30 years.</p><p>An even more fundamental looming question is how humans should relate to machines that have capabilities equal to, or even greater than, our own. If we can develop such machines, we will. Humankind has never in the past refrained from developing a technology because of potential dangers posed to the species, and it is unlikely that we will do so in the future. As that time approaches, we will have to choose whether to give the machines the same dignity and status that we give humans or seek to control them as human servants or instruments for our own gratification. The former course will require a degree of self-confidence, openness, and risk that is uncharacteristic of many conservatives, who often seem to define conservatism as rejection of the \"other.\" The latter course will inevitably lead to a conflict that is unlikely to end well for humans, but it isn't clear that the former course of openness and tolerance will be requited with machine benignity.</p><p>Even if we avoid such a conflict and find a way of living in harmony with machines whose replication and destiny we can no longer control, we will face the challenge of preserving our own dignity and autonomy in the face of non-human entities whose intelligence and capabilities will eventually exceed our current levels. It is important not to exaggerate the capabilities of current information technology. We will need many years of research and development before we understand the incredibly complex and intricate workings of the human brain. But we will get there. Meeting this challenge will require us to be both accepting of continuous and potentially revolutionary change and vigilant in minimizing the risks to individual autonomy and liberty associated with that change.</p><p>We can meet that challenge only by co-evolving with technology through enhancement of our own physical and mental capacities. Even with existing technology we can anticipate major improvements in quality and length of life by overcoming many chronic diseases such as cancers and genetic traits such as sickle cell anemia. We are already improving our mental capabilities through greater connectivity with each other and the cloud and are developing therapeutic techniques such as deep brain stimulation based on probes targeted on specific neurons. Improving the internal capabilities of the human brain is not yet feasible and remains controversial, but it probably will become feasible in the not-too-distant future. What's critical is that, as humans and their creations learn from each other, we co-evolve towards greater appreciation, justice, and wisdom rather than the reverse.</p><p>Development of autonomous weapons illustrates the importance of such co-evolution. The U.S. Defense Department has said that it will keep humans \"in the loop\" in operating unmanned weapons systems such as armed robots or drones for the foreseeable future, particularly with respect to \"kill\" decisions (we can only hope that other countries and non-state actors will do likewise). As the capabilities of these unmanned systems improve, however, human operators will rely on these systems more and more in making decisions. Thus they may reach a point where they make \"better\" and less error-prone decisions than their human operators. The trick will be to ensure that both operators and unmanned systems improve their ethical decision-making capabilities in tandem with their technical capabilities.</p><p>The above discussion, though necessarily speculative, leads to one firm conclusion. Unprecedented technological change is inevitable. Only by being prepared to take collective action to ensure that its benefits are equitably shared and to curb its misuse can we guide that change in directions favorable to us as individuals and to humanity as a whole. We can start by taking on the platform tech giants that are transforming the global economy.</p><p>by WILLIAM A. NITZE</p><p>William A.

Although the US presidential election is still a year away, the Democratic Party candidate selection process is about to enter its critical phase during the first quarter of 2020.<br/>The process has a multitude of candidates among which two characters with very different visions of economic policy stand out. The undisputed and likely candidate at the beginning of the process was former Vice President Joe Biden, considered by many to be a \"centrist.\"<br/>For many, Biden is the best placed to defeat Trump. However, Biden's advantage in primary polls has been significantly reduced against Massachusetts state \"progressive\" Senator Elizabeth Warren.<br/>Although Biden remains ahead of the polls, Warren's upward trend and Biden's stagnation have begun to generate concern among investors.<br/>Among Warren's most market-conscious \"progressive\" positions are: (i) the creation of a universal public health system; (ii) much more restrictive regulation for the financial sector that could include the separation of large financial groups; (iii) stricter oversight and possible break-up of the big tech giants; and (iv) a plan to increase taxes on large corporations and the wealthiest classes, including a wealth tax.<br/>An eventual triumph of Warren in the presidential election would have a strong negative impact on major stock indices such as the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P; 500, where companies in the sectors that would be in the eye of the hurricane (health, finance and technology) they have a very significant weight.<br/>While markets seem to be assigning, for the time being, a small chance for Warren to win the presidential election, some specialists estimate that the S&amp;P; 500 could lose between 30 and 40 percent of its current value.<br/>Although Warren's scenario as president looks even further away, good performance in any of February's first primary battles (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina) might be enough to trigger a 5-10% adjustment in markets.<br/>If positive performance extends to the \"superTuesday\" of March 3, in which 14 states have primary ballots, then market adjustment could be closer to 20 percent.<br/>If you won the presidential election and not moderated your positions, the adjustment would be even greater.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-9427873</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGV-4KV1-DY1R-B0J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Although the US presidential election is still a year away, the Democratic Party candidate selection process is about to enter its critical phase during the first quarter of 2020.<br/>The process has a multitude of candidates among which two characters with very different visions of economic policy stand out. The undisputed and likely candidate at the beginning of the process was former Vice President Joe Biden, considered by many to be a \"centrist.\"<br/>For many, Biden is the best placed to defeat Trump. However, Biden's advantage in primary polls has been significantly reduced against Massachusetts state \"progressive\" Senator Elizabeth Warren.<br/>Although Biden remains ahead of the polls, Warren's upward trend and Biden's stagnation have begun to generate concern among investors.<br/>Among Warren's most market-conscious \"progressive\" positions are: (i) the creation of a universal public health system; (ii) much more restrictive regulation for the financial sector that could include the separation of large financial groups; (iii) stricter oversight and possible break-up of the big tech giants; and (iv) a plan to increase taxes on large corporations and the wealthiest classes, including a wealth tax.<br/>An eventual triumph of Warren in the presidential election would have a strong negative impact on major stock indices such as the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P; 500, where companies in the sectors that would be in the eye of the hurricane (health, finance and technology) they have a very significant weight.<br/>While markets seem to be assigning, for the time being, a small chance for Warren to win the presidential election, some specialists estimate that the S&amp;P; 500 could lose between 30 and 40 percent of its current value.<br/>Although Warren's scenario as president looks even further away, good performance in any of February's first primary battles (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina) might be enough to trigger a 5-10% adjustment in markets.<br/>If positive performance extends to the \"superTuesday\" of March 3, in which 14 states have primary ballots, then market adjustment could be closer to 20 percent.<br/>If you won the presidential election and not moderated your positions, the adjustment would be even greater.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-9423328</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGV-4KT1-DY1R-B4YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Amazon in particular is stirring up more discussion as mentions of the e-commerce behemoth on industry conference calls hasspikedin the past few years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon's activity certainly warrants such attention. It has made amultitude of financial services playsin online payments (Amazon Pay), in-store payments (Amazon Go), lending for merchants, credit cards for consumers and virtual cash wallets (Amazon Cash).</p><p>This activity aims at facilitating more business on Amazon's core e-commerce platform, not developing a full-fledged banking offering. In fact, Amazon previouslybacked awayfrom launching a checking account product that would make it a full bank.</p><p>However, the tech giant will continue growing its financial services offerings in multiple areas to make its core business more attractive to consumers and merchants alike.</p><p>Banks can take advantage of Amazon's ambitions by partnering to launch financial products and services. Some - like Goldman Sachs's onlinebankMarcus andSynchrony Financial- are already doing so. Amazon is also reportedly partnering withBank of AmericaandJPMorgan Chase. Such partnerships carry risk if Amazon's ambitions grow larger.</p><p>However, partnering can complement a broader digital strategy, allowing banks to tap into Amazon's growth and customer loyalty to improve their own prospects. Amazon'soutlookhas only brightened with consumer spending shifting online during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Banks can leverage Amazon to develop relationships in key customer segments - including mass-affluent consumers, an important demographic with an extraordinaryaffinityfor Amazon - and with underbanked consumers. Also, through Amazon partnerships, banks can tap into the small businesses that sell on Amazon's marketplace and are enjoyingrecord salesduring the pandemic.</p><p>Though Amazon's relationship with its marketplace sellers remains acontroversial topicthat could earn greater regulatory scrutiny, sellers are unlikely to ditch its marketplace as long as it remains thefirst placemost consumers shop online.</p><p>Banks looking to strengthen their business with these segments should consider how their strategic aspirations might align with Amazon's financial services goals. Amazon has shown more and more interest in several financial services segments, including in the payments space beyond its own marketplace. Itsintegration with Worldpay last year, was a significant milestone. Emerging technologies like Amazon Go's cashierless checkout system that is available to other retailers, or the biometric-based payments terminals reportedly beingtestedwith Visa, may help enlarge its foothold.</p><p>Also, the Alexa voice-assistant platform already facilitates billions of dollars of transactions annually,according toAmazon. Enabling voice payments through Alexa can both boost e-commerce purchases on Amazon's marketplace and enhance its payments presence in other settings, such as gas-station purchases.</p><p>A move into home real estate listings, insurance and financing would complement other Amazon priorities. It could offer a deep discount on Echo smart speakers to customers search for, financing or insuring homes, or target them to improve sales of furniture and appliances, categories where Amazonhas been searchinghard.</p><p>Amazon has also been moving into health insurance, most notably through the Haven Healthcarejoint venturewith Chase and Berkshire Hathaway, which provides insurance to some of Amazon's employees.</p><p>Further, Amazon could play a role in meetingdemandamong wealth management clients for greater transparency and improved digital interactions. Alexa, for instance, could deliver daily account and market updates, paired with seamless voice payments capabilities. Combining Amazon's aptitude for customer insights and recommendations with banks' customer data could also enable more valuable financial advice.</p><p>However, partnering with Amazon also entails potential risks.</p><p>It was rumored Amazon might acquire a bank, but there are significant legal and regulatoryhurdlesto any such move. As it builds out its financial services portfolio, Amazon could create a general banking offering to meet the everyday financial needs of for consumers or small businesses.</p><p>This could mirror the path of its gigantic Amazon Web Services cloud computing arm, whichstarted outas an effort to support its core e-commerce business with streamlined access to infrastructure services.</p><p>A similar platform play in banking could force Amazon's banking partners to compete within Amazon's financial services ecosystem, much like merchants selling on its e-commerce platform, or tech providers selling services through AWS's marketplace.</p><p>To mitigate that risk, any partnership with Amazon must be ancillary to fortifying the bank's own ecosystem of vendors, partners and customers. That means developing other partnerships, including fintechs and potentially other big-tech companies, to avoid overreliance on Amazon.</p><p>Customer relationships originated through any joint products or services launched with Amazon must be strengthened by cross-selling other relevant offerings.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000017420e9daa0a97c6bef50540001164</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NS-G4D1-F06X-W003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>American Banker</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40529\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 185</volume><issueNumber>No. 164</issueNumber><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/the-risks-and-rewards-of-partnering-with-amazon\">https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/the-risks-and-rewards-of-partnering-with-amazon</url><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001SJ8</classCode><className>WORLDPAY US INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Amazon in particular is stirring up more discussion as mentions of the e-commerce behemoth on industry conference calls hasspikedin the past few years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon's activity certainly warrants such attention. It has made amultitude of financial services playsin online payments (Amazon Pay), in-store payments (Amazon Go), lending for merchants, credit cards for consumers and virtual cash wallets (Amazon Cash).</p><p>This activity aims at facilitating more business on Amazon's core e-commerce platform, not developing a full-fledged banking offering. In fact, Amazon previouslybacked awayfrom launching a checking account product that would make it a full bank.</p><p>However, the tech giant will continue growing its financial services offerings in multiple areas to make its core business more attractive to consumers and merchants alike.</p><p>Banks can take advantage of Amazon's ambitions by partnering to launch financial products and services. Some - like Goldman Sachs's onlinebankMarcus andSynchrony Financial- are already doing so. Amazon is also reportedly partnering withBank of AmericaandJPMorgan Chase. Such partnerships carry risk if Amazon's ambitions grow larger.</p><p>However, partnering can complement a broader digital strategy, allowing banks to tap into Amazon's growth and customer loyalty to improve their own prospects. Amazon'soutlookhas only brightened with consumer spending shifting online during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>Banks can leverage Amazon to develop relationships in key customer segments - including mass-affluent consumers, an important demographic with an extraordinaryaffinityfor Amazon - and with underbanked consumers. Also, through Amazon partnerships, banks can tap into the small businesses that sell on Amazon's marketplace and are enjoyingrecord salesduring the pandemic.</p><p>Though Amazon's relationship with its marketplace sellers remains acontroversial topicthat could earn greater regulatory scrutiny, sellers are unlikely to ditch its marketplace as long as it remains thefirst placemost consumers shop online.</p><p>Banks looking to strengthen their business with these segments should consider how their strategic aspirations might align with Amazon's financial services goals. Amazon has shown more and more interest in several financial services segments, including in the payments space beyond its own marketplace. Itsintegration with Worldpay last year, was a significant milestone. Emerging technologies like Amazon Go's cashierless checkout system that is available to other retailers, or the biometric-based payments terminals reportedly beingtestedwith Visa, may help enlarge its foothold.</p><p>Also, the Alexa voice-assistant platform already facilitates billions of dollars of transactions annually,according toAmazon. Enabling voice payments through Alexa can both boost e-commerce purchases on Amazon's marketplace and enhance its payments presence in other settings, such as gas-station purchases.</p><p>A move into home real estate listings, insurance and financing would complement other Amazon priorities. It could offer a deep discount on Echo smart speakers to customers search for, financing or insuring homes, or target them to improve sales of furniture and appliances, categories where Amazonhas been searchinghard.</p><p>Amazon has also been moving into health insurance, most notably through the Haven Healthcarejoint venturewith Chase and Berkshire Hathaway, which provides insurance to some of Amazon's employees.</p><p>Further, Amazon could play a role in meetingdemandamong wealth management clients for greater transparency and improved digital interactions. Alexa, for instance, could deliver daily account and market updates, paired with seamless voice payments capabilities. Combining Amazon's aptitude for customer insights and recommendations with banks' customer data could also enable more valuable financial advice.</p><p>However, partnering with Amazon also entails potential risks.</p><p>It was rumored Amazon might acquire a bank, but there are significant legal and regulatoryhurdlesto any such move. As it builds out its financial services portfolio, Amazon could create a general banking offering to meet the everyday financial needs of for consumers or small businesses.</p><p>This could mirror the path of its gigantic Amazon Web Services cloud computing arm, whichstarted outas an effort to support its core e-commerce business with streamlined access to infrastructure services.</p><p>A similar platform play in banking could force Amazon's banking partners to compete within Amazon's financial services ecosystem, much like merchants selling on its e-commerce platform, or tech providers selling services through AWS's marketplace.</p><p>To mitigate that risk, any partnership with Amazon must be ancillary to fortifying the bank's own ecosystem of vendors, partners and customers. That means developing other partnerships, including fintechs and potentially other big-tech companies, to avoid overreliance on Amazon.</p><p>Customer relationships originated through any joint products or services launched with Amazon must be strengthened by cross-selling other relevant offerings.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000017420e9daa0a97c6bef505400011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NN-FN61-JCRW-5009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>americanbanker.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40529\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 1</volume><issueNumber>No. 1</issueNumber><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/the-risks-and-rewards-of-partnering-with-amazon\">https://www.americanbanker.com/opinion/the-risks-and-rewards-of-partnering-with-amazon</url><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 24, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001SJ8</classCode><className>WORLDPAY US INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This should improve the security of sensitive personal data \u2013 but it is important to remember that there\u2019s no such thing as a perfectly secure system.  </p><p><br/>Apostolis Zarras is a cybersecurity expert. At Maastricht\u2019s Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering, he studies malicious online activities on a large scale in an effort to make the Internet that little bit safer. \u201cEven big companies, which can hire the best experts, are always compromised to some extent, so it\u2019s important to understand what personal data you\u2019re leaving where.\u201d<br/> Share with care  <br/>Social media is an obvious example. \u201cYou pay for using a service like Facebook with data about yourself, in particular the kinds of things you\u2019re likely to spend money on.\u201d So share with care, he warns: not only might your career prospects hinge on pictures you uploaded when you were 17, but, more insidiously, you are leaving behind a map of your behaviours and preferences. Zarras cautions especially against exposing children on social media: \u201cYou\u2019re not only revealing their habits to your family and friends. You might also be making information publicly available on where they are and when, and what sweets, toys or pets they like \u2013 you can see how that could be really problematic.\u201d  <br/>He emphasises the importance of educating people. \u201cNowadays you have to understand that having your password saved in a text file on your computer is like writing your PIN on your bank card, or that opening a compromised website with JavaScript running can allow malware onto your computer.\u201d<br/> ijskast datascience<br/> Zarras  <br/>Apostolis Zarras is an assistant professor at the Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering at Maastricht University. His research focuses on systems, networks and web security.<br/> CPU &amp; you \u2013 software everywhere  <br/>The threat of malware, a contraction of malicious software, is by no means limited to laptops; anything with a CPU, which includes all smart devices (phones, cars, vacuum cleaners, etc.), can be affected. \u201cHackers might just want the processing power of your CPUs to mine for bitcoins, or they might be sending spam emails, generating fake traffic to increase advertising revenue, spreading fake news on social media \u2013 everything a computer can be used for. If your smart TV has been compromised, it might be hosting a website with adult content.\u201d  <br/>Our daily lives will be increasingly dominated by the Internet of Things, a network of smart devices with CPUs communicating with each other, which knows all our habits and thus makes our lives more convenient. But all that data is stored with companies whose primary aim is profit, not security, and certainly not our privacy. Your hoover bot has created a floor plan of your house, your fridge knows your dietary habits, your heating system knows when you are out of the house, your Fitbit knows when and where you run and sleep, and online retailers know almost everything you own or want.<br/> Towards a greater focus on security and transparency  <br/>To Zarras, the GDPR represents a step in the right direction. \u201cAmong other things, there\u2019s the \u2018right to be forgotten\u2019, so you should be able to view, correct or delete any data companies have on you. They also have to state what data they\u2019re storing and why, and they aren\u2019t allowed to keep it for longer than necessary.\u201d There are some caveats, of course, in that potential fines are capped at around \u20ac20 million; just a drop in the bucket for big tech companies. \u201cIt also remains to be seen how much political capital the EU would be willing to spend on enforcing the GDPR in a potential showdown with Silicon Valley giants.\u201d  <br/>Zarras emphasises that there\u2019s no such thing as a perfectly secure system. With the inevitable trade-off between convenience and privacy, it\u2019s up to individuals to educate themselves and to decide how much risk a service is worth to them.

He'd built the device over six months with a group of 20-something grad students, dispatching their metal-and-wire erector set on wheels to the reactor building, which was filled with radioactive water and debris and bounded by concrete suffused with enough killer gamma radiation to fry any human.</p><p>Whittaker, whose mother had steeled his nerves as a kid by taking him up for hair-raising flights in a small plane, was plenty nervous, worried that somehow his team's invention would end up banging into the wrong thing and sparking a fresh nuclear crisis. Peering at the CCTV feed as the radio-controlled \"Remote Reconnaissance Vehicle\" slowly descended into the reactor building on a cable, he watched as his baby landed--plop--into the nuclear soup. \"The thing I'll never forget is seeing how it made the water ripple. When I saw those ripples and we started creeping along, and everything was working, I knew we were in business,\" says Whittaker, whose current endeavor is no less ambitious if a lot more romantic: landing an unmanned rover on the moon and capturing the $40 million Google Lunar X Prize.</p><p>That same year, 1983, Pittsburgh's unemployment rate reached 17.1 percent and the city was losing more than 4,000 people a month. The steel industry that had built modern Pittsburgh, funded its museums and mansions, its football team and its aspiring middle class, was cratering, never to return. But the success of Carnegie Mellon's Three Mile Island robotics team--it produced a ground-breaking assessment of the extent of the radiation from sensor readings, photographic inspections and core samples taken from the concrete, none of which would have been possible with human hands alone--would set into motion a spectacular, three-decade cycle of innovation, investment and expansion that put Whittaker and his proteges on the leading edge of their new field and created a cool cottage industry that has come to define a city's resurgence.</p><p>    Open In New Window </p><p>PHOTOS: From Steel City to Roboburgh: The reinvention of Pittsburgh. (Click to view gallery.) | Mark Peterson/Redux</p><p>\"Roboburgh,\" the boosterish moniker conferred on the city by the Wall Street Journal in 1999 and cited endlessly in Pittsburgh's marketing materials ever since, may have been premature back then, but it isn't now: Pittsburgh, after decades of trying to remake itself, today really does have a new economy, rooted in the city's rapidly growing robotic, artificial intelligence, health technology, advanced manufacturing and software industries. It's growing in population for the first time since the 1950s, and now features regularly in lists like \"the Hottest Cities of the Future\" and \"Best Cities for Working Mothers.\" \"The city is sort of in a sweet spot,\" says Sanjiv Singh, a Whittaker acolyte at Carnegie Mellon who is working on the first-of-its-kind pilotless medical evacuation helicopter for the Marines. \"It has the critical mass of talent you need, it's still pretty affordable and it has corporate memory--the people here still remember when the place was an industrial powerhouse.\"</p><p>The rise of the robots is the storyline the city itself embraces because it represents the reassertion of Pittsburgh's irrepressible identity, its industrial DNA.</p><p>Improbably for a blue-collar town that seemed headed for the scrap heap when its steel industry collapsed, Pittsburgh has developed into one of the country's most vibrant tech centers, a hotbed of innovation that can no longer be ignored by the industry's titans. Carnegie Mellon is Google's biggest rival in the race to build a driverless car, partnering with GM to build a robot Cadillac that has been humanlessly tooling around Route 19, just outside city limits. In 2011, Google opened a posh, 40,000-square-foot office in an old Nabisco factory in the city's East Liberty neighborhood, ramping up last year to 350 people, with more on the way. Bill Gates and other Silicon Valley moguls have invested millions of dollars in Aquion Energy, a start-up spun out of CMU that is developing next-generation batteries and producing them in nearby Westermoreland County, not China. Apple, RAND and Intel also have outposts in town and Disney, which has tapped the university's computer and robotics talent for years, is partnering with the school to improve cinematic graphics and to develop hominid robots that can gently hand objects to people by predicting the movement around them. All told, Pittsburgh's tech and education sectors now account for some 80 percent of the high-wage jobs in the city, and robots are just the most visible piece of this miraculous turnaround of a city on the brink.</p><p>Red Whittaker with his lunar landing device. | Mark Peterson/Redux</p><p>But is it a recipe for urban reinvention, proof that Silicon Valleys can flourish anywhere, as a million city managers the world over dream? Why did Pittsburgh make it when so many other industrial-era powerhouses have not--why, in short, is it Roboburgh today and not Detroit?</p><p>For all the high-tech whiz-bang--CMU's labs are an electronic menagerie with robots that slither like snakes, buzz overhead like hummingbirds and furrow into mines like hedgehogs--Red Whittaker, and the people who have worked on the Pittsburgh comeback, will tell you there is no magical formula for post-industrial cities to claw back from the grave. It's inevitably an all-of-the-above enterprise that in this case included a major environmental clean-up, public-sector incentives to attract businesses, billions of dollars in federal funding and collaborative rule-bending to do things like turn abandoned brownfield sites into gleaming tech headquarters. But perhaps the most critical factor was recognizing that, beneath the collapse, stagnation and misery, the city's core assets remained largely intact, in the form of human capital housed in the city's cultural institutions, foundations, an overlooked industrial research sector and above all its great universities--Carnegie Mellon, Pitt, Duquesne--built and endowed by the 19th century robber barons who gave the city its first golden age. Pittsburgh wasn't dead; it was just sleeping.</p><p>From the frontier fortress that gave the city its name, geography has always been another major asset: It sits at the confluence of three navigable rivers, in a valley that funnels population inward and keeps it from sprawling too much. While Pittsburgh's leadership made its share of mistakes, decision-makers never allowed its infrastructure to wither as badly as in other ailing cities, even after half the town's population decamped in the last decades of the twentieth century. Detroit--the city whose decline is most often compared with Pittsburgh's--is headed in a very different direction because it split into two divergent, racially polarized halves: The Detroit of the auto industry, which relocated itself to the sprawling suburban outskirts, and the real Detroit, an abandoned, predominantly poor and monochromatically African-American core that is collapsing after years of neglect, disinvestment and mismanagement.</p><p>The bankrupt Motor City is today a vast checkerboard of empty lots and decimated working-class neighborhoods ringing a gleaming, isolated downtown; the Steel City is a densely packed triangle of mid-range skyscrapers surrounded by a thicket of row-house neighborhoods. Well-established ethnic enclaves bent but didn't break during the bad times, and white flight, while it occurred, was nothing like the Detroit diaspora. Even the snail's pace of the city's recovery worked to its advantage: When the rebound took hold in the last decade, the city never saw the kind of speculative real estate madness that afflicted other cities on the \"Most Livable\" list. A few years ago, when a CMU professor wanted to test the city's appeal to outsiders, she coaxed a former student working at Google's perk-filled California headquarters campus to tape pull-and-tear flyers advertising a typical $250,000 four-bedroom Pittsburgh Victorian in the bathroom stalls; they were all gone in an hour.</p><p>It's in our genes--we don't have to argue with anybody that Pittsburgh is a place where stuff gets made.\"</p><p>You could write a story about how health care saved Pittsburgh--the first-class University of Pittsburgh Medical Center that accounts for one in five local jobs, a far higher percentage of local employment than the steel industry at its apex--but the rise of the robots is the storyline the city itself embraces because it represents the reassertion of Pittsburgh's irrepressible identity, its industrial DNA. \"The big point is that we're not going against our core brand,\" says Ilana Diamond, founder of Alphalab Gear, a six-year-old nonprofit that provides workspace, funding and networking opportunities so that students can turn their high-tech hardware inventions into start-up companies. \"We have always made stuff around here. ... That's what the mills were, right? It's in our genes--we don't have to argue with anybody that Pittsburgh is a place where stuff gets made.\"</p><p>    Open In New Window </p><p>PHOTOS: Robots at Work: The whiz-bang gadgets coming out of Carnegie Mellon. (Click to view gallery.) | Mark Peterson/Redux</p><p>That old identity is hard to shake; President Obama has done events at the CMU robotics center, but when he came to Pittsburgh in late January to push his jobs agenda, he headed straight for an old archetype: a steel plant. \"You don't come to the Steel City without coming to U.S. Steel,\" he said.</p><p>No one embodies that brains-and-brawn, alpha male-and-algorithms duality more than Whittaker, a grinning Paul Bunyan type astride a campus crawling with hoodie-wearing \"Big Bang Theory\" kids squinting at smart phones through chunky black frames. \"I like this city because it has blood in its veins!\" says Whittaker.</p><p>***</p><p>Pittsburgh is all about the creative destructive of capitalism, and Whittaker and many others knee-deep in the city's comeback embrace Andrew Carnegie's motto--\"My heart is in the work\"--earnestly, without a wisp of irony. For a long, long time, those words had a mocking quality.</p><p>From 1970 to 2000 fully 40 percent of the city's residents would flee as mill and factory jobs vaporized: Forty years ago, the population was about 520,000; now it barely breaks the 300,000 mark, though the region as a whole is far larger. And any story about Pittsburgh's rebirth must account for the ugly reality that the decently paid, unionized factory workers who built the city haven't been invited to its higher-wage rebirth. The devastation to the working class wasn't limited to the city itself: Nearby mill towns like McKeesport, home to 55,355 people in 1940 and less than half that now, have never come back. Braddock, the site of Andrew Carnegie's first public library, has lost 90 percent of its population since 1920.</p><p>brightcove.createExperiences(null,\"flashObj3148193026001\");     </p><p>WATCH: The Robots of Pittsburgh</p><p>The irony that a city built on an industrial working class has reclaimed part of its past industrial glory by developing machines designed, in some cases, to replace human workers is lost on exactly no one. Carnegie Robotics, a new CMU startup generating a lot of buzz, makes a machine that sorts strawberries and can do the work of 800 people; Aethon, a medical robotics company founded in 2002, automates much of hospitals' tangled internal logistics chains. \"We create jobs, we don't take them away,\" growls Whittaker, whose own firm, RedZone Robotics, which he founded while keeping his university research post, builds robots that inspect small sewer lines. \"If you want to dig through shit for a living that's your business. But a robot can get into a tiny pipe, and a person can't do that, so I'm not taking anyone's job away.\"</p><p>This story of Pittsburgh's reinvention, then, is very much about not only the new politics of urban renewal--but also about the future shape of an American economy that may well be smarter, faster and more innovative, but without the sheer number of good, stable middle-class jobs that powered the great postwar American boom. Of course, it's still not clear whether the widespread automation of repetitive tasks--the kinds of things a machine can do as well or better than a human--is responsible for the anemic pace of American job creation since 2000. Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, productivity and overall employment have generally risen together, with advances in technology spurring a virtuous cycle of re-investment and job creation. In the last decade or so, they have diverged--leading some economists to conclude that robots and smart software are elbowing humans out of the workforce. Two MIT researchers, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, theorize that rapid technological advances have created a \"great decoupling\" of productivity and employment, which partially explains the malaise. Other researchers fiercely question that conclusion, and argue that the employment stall has as much to do with globalization and the accelerating boom-bust cycle of recent financial crises. \"No one knows the cause\" of the recent jobs slowdown,\" economist David Autor told MIT's Technology Review. \"[It's] a big puzzle... but there's not a lot of evidence it's linked to computers.\"</p><p>Still, for Pittsburgh natives, especially those old enough to have lived through the bad old days, there's a certain justice in finally being ahead of the curve on technology. Pittsburgh's new mayor, Bill Peduto, the grandson of a carpenter who settled his family in the Chartiers Valley just south of the city limits to work in the mills, remembers the veil of gloom descending on his world in the late '70s. \"I started high school in 1979,\" Peduto told me. \"Willie Stargell and the Pirates, the 'We are Family' team, wins the World Series. The Steelers win the Super Bowl... And Pittsburgh dies. Everything was closing, everybody's father was losing his job, and all of us who were lucky enough to go to college knew there was no way we could come back.\"</p><p>The worst was yet to come, during the plague years of 1980 to 1984, when foreign competition and a national recession finally broke the back of the long-sagging steel industry. During that period, 55,000 of the 99,000 remaining industry jobs simply vanished, along with the shuttering of iconic mills that had enriched (and polluted) the region--the McKeesport Tube Works, the Clairton plant, the Saxonburg Mill and the venerable Homestead Steel Works, site of the bloody labor-management battles that established the United Steel Workers as a force to be reckoned with in the 1880s and 1890s.</p><p>But the slide had begun years earlier, as the dream of a comfortable blue-collar workforce slammed against the realities of globalization and pennies-an-hour overseas labor. In 1976, a young Harvard grad named David Ignatius took a job with the Wall Street Journal covering the steel industry--at the time the business reporting equivalent of the graveyard shift--and quickly realized he'd been assigned to cover the death of a great American city. \"I'll never forget driving into the city for the first time in my life, the remnants of the Jones and Laughlin steel works that had just been closed,\" says Ignatius, who went on to a long career as a Washington Post foreign correspondent and columnist. \"It was a bleak warning to anyone entering the city that the industry that had made southwest Pennsylvania was in a death spiral. You could literally see the mills and plants shutting down along the Monongahela [River], one by one... At the time, even the suggestion that there was another life for Pittsburgh beyond steel seemed ridiculous.\"</p><p>The Edgar Thompson Works is one of the region's last remaining steel mills. | Mark Peterson/Redux</p><p>To Ignatius, the worst part was the self-delusion--creative destruction with all the destruction but none of the creativity. Mill owners and labor leaders appeared to be dancing long after the music had stopped--pushing for guaranteed-wage pacts that would buy them a few more years of solvency instead of girding for the industry's eventual decline by focusing on new technologies and retraining their workers. In reality, the steel industry had never employed more than 10 percent of the Pittsburgh region's workforce, but the collapse of steel set off a similar cataclysm in other industrial and mining businesses all over the region--which had a vicious knock-on effect, wiping out thousands of small local businesses, ravaging the local tax base and humbling the city's once-thriving industrial finance sector, anchored by the Mellon family, which had made Pittsburgh a national banking powerhouse third only to New York and Chicago.</p><p>This cratering Pittsburgh occupied a central place in the prevailing cultural narrative of American decline in the late '70s and early '80s, and the depiction of the city at the time still resonates, and not in a good way: the grim, dead-end life the Vietnam veterans returned to in The Deer Hunter, the zombies overtaking downtown in the Dawn of the Dead movies. Later, there was a counter-genre of municipal resurrection flicks that emphasized the city's heart and grit--The Fish Who Saved Pittsburgh, about an underdog local basketball team led by Dr. J, and, of course, Flashdance, about the world's sexiest welder. A few years later, when the Carnegie Museums commissioned a pollster to ask residents to identify a word that best identified their town, the one that came back most frequently was \"anxiety.\"</p><p>Yet even at rock bottom, the city's white-marble academic backbone held. Carnegie Mellon was founded in 1910 as the Carnegie Technical Schools to make engineers out of the children of low-skill workers in Andrew Carnegie's steel factories; and the corporate behemoths that ran the town, however myopic they were, invested heavily in research--and accelerated those investments in a last-ditch effort to save their businesses.</p><p>Braddock is typical of the mill towns that were devastated by the steel industry's collapse. | Mark Peterson/Redux</p><p>Whittaker grew up in a small town 90 miles to the east of Pittsburgh and was entranced by anything mechanical--in a region practically made for engineers, crammed as it was with factories, mills and mining operations, everywhere crisscrossed by western Pennsylvania's omnipresent railroads. He arrived at Carnegie Mellon in the mid-'70s, after receiving an engineering degree from Princeton, where he developed a parallel passion for computers. He showed up at precisely the right moment: Raj Reddy--a founding father of robotics--had established the first major program of its kind in the country in conjunction with another Carnegie Mellon professor, Angel Jordan, and a top executive at the struggling Westinghouse Electric. The company was among the first entities to subsidize Reddy's team, investing $5 million in a project to create some of the world's first factory robots. Other companies followed, allowing the group to move from borrowed space into a football field-sized former mining bureau warehouse on the side of a railroad line. Whittaker quickly emerged as a leader, a Grade-A engineer with a knack for harnessing abstract technical developments to concrete projects. He had none of the Ivy League squeamishness about working cheek-to-jowl with big industry--and quickly developed many of the early technical advances necessary for factory automation as well as mobile \"field robots\" used in mining, excavation and farming. He was a first-class engineer who attracted the smartest students from around the world, but he was unapologetically pragmatic and commercial. \"One year, it was my goal to get Caterpillar as a client,\" he recalled, \"and we did.\"</p><p>As regional planners and city fathers cycled through the usual five-year plans and redevelopment schemes, the Robotics Institute steadily grew through the years after its formation in 1979, with a budget that now tops $65 million, a faculty and student population of 500 and more than 200,000 square feet of indoor research space and 40 acres of outdoor testing grounds on Carnegie Mellon's main campus and, fittingly, reclaimed industrial space in the city's Lawrenceville and Hazelwood neighborhoods. Over the years, the institute has spun out at least 30 start-ups employing about 2,000 people (one of them, Pittsburgh Pattern Recognition, was acquired by Google in 2011 to develop facial recognition software used to tag photos on social media) and secured some two dozen patents in field robotics. Whittaker has been the face of the operation for much of its existence, in part because of his outsized personality and an affinity for the kind of high-profile public competitions that attract popular attention. In 2005, Sandstorm, an autonomous robot vehicle developed by his \"Red Team,\" competed in the Pentagon's DARPA Grand Challenge, travelling 7.4 miles into the desert, a record at the time. Two years later, before Google made an all-out plunge into the robot car race, the team's robotic SUV--Boss--won DARPA's Urban Challenge, driving itself more than 60 miles without a driver or a joystick.</p><p>***</p><p>If Pittsburgh was becoming a lab for innovation, it was also a Petri dish for planners and historians sifting for clues about the fate of post-industrial urban America. In 1987, just as Whittaker was solidifying his standing as the father of American robotics, an urban theorist from New Jersey named Richard Florida descended on Carnegie Mellon to study the difference between distressed American cities that failed and ones that thrived.</p><p>If Pittsburgh, with all of its assets and its emerging human creativity, somehow can't make it in the creative age, I fear the future does not bode well for other older industrial communities and established cities.</p><p>His inspiration was a 1961 essay by economist Benjamin Chinitz, which essentially predicted that Pittsburgh's smokestack economy would eventually collapse due to its over-reliance on the steel sector--and that cities with more diverse, entrepreneurial economies untethered to resource extraction would fare better when times got tough. A region's ability to adapt to change, Chinitz wrote, was \"a function of certain traditions and elements of the social structure which are heavily influenced by the character of the area's historic specializations.\" In other words, New York with its legacy of diversity and entrepreneurialism, was a lot better off than steel-addicted, company-town Pittsburgh. Florida's central thesis, derived in part from his on-the-ground observations in Pittsburgh over the next two decades, held that successful cities were defined by a dominant \"creative class\" that fostered innovation and encouraged the in-migration of similarly exalted cranial talent. The idea that cities with lots of smart people were better equipped to weather economic convulsion was nothing new. What was novel about Florida's idea was that he isolated the culture of a city--measured by its ethnic diversity, its openness to gay and lesbian residents and its general attractiveness to the twenty- and thirty-something engineers, writers, scientists, academics and artists who would act as elite cultural anchor babies--and the arbiters of whether a place was cool enough to, in turn, attract succeeding generations of like-minded innovators.</p><p>A mural honoring military and steel-industry veterans by local artist Lucas Stock. | Mark Peterson/Redux</p><p>By the time Florida published his landmark book, The Rise Of The Creative Class, in 2002, Pittsburgh had already begun attracting tech companies--but he rated it as only middling on the creative-class scale, well below the San Franciscos, Austins and Seattles--but above Memphis, Buffalo and Vegas. He gave Pittsburgh's institutions high marks for investing in technology and economic development but argued that they had \"been slow to realize\" the powerful magnet of cultural factors--and the need to cultivate a cool image. \"City leaders continue to promote Pittsburgh as a place that is good for families, seemingly unaware of the demographic changes that have made young people, singles, new immigrants, and gays critical to the emerging social fabric,\" he wrote, asking: \"Is there hope for Pittsburgh?\" and rattled off a succession of incipient harbingers of change: the recent in-flow of tech firms, an uptick in foreign-born students and medical professionals-- a new Hindu temple even--and an \"increasing status\" as a gay center marked by Showtime's decision to shoot \"Queer as Folk\" in town.</p><p>\"If Pittsburgh, with all of its assets and its emerging human creativity, somehow can't make it in the creative age, I fear the future does not bode well for other older industrial communities and established cities, and the lamentable new class segregation among cities will continue to worsen,\" he chided.</p><p>Last year, Florida took something of a victory lap, noting that the older generation of civic leaders--whose idea of development centered around huge sports arenas and economic development projects like urban shopping malls--had died off, allowing a new generation room to pursue a more organic, \"bottom-up\" strategy rooted in academia, high tech and the arts. \"Pittsburgh's revival has been no overnight sensation. It took the better part of a generation or two for it to get to where it is now,\" he wrote--adding that the city was still hampered by its relative lack of ethnic and racial diversity. \"But without a doubt, it has turned a corner.\"</p><p>During the intervening decade, Florida had gone on to become a famous (and well-compensated) apostle of urban renewal, a charismatic management consultant with a catchy slogan for cities--\"technology, talent and tolerance.\" But the locals were not among his greatest admirers. No one denied that Florida had a point about the stodgy culture (in the early 2000s, young entrepreneurs were summoned to discuss economic development strategy at the old-boy Duquesne Club downtown only to be turned away because they weren't wearing ties, per the club's dress code).</p><p>But down in the trenches, program officers at local foundations who were trying to hasten the transformation thought Florida had the sequencing backwards. \"We needed talent more than tolerance. The tolerance follows the talent,\" says Christina Gabriel, who funneled millions into tech start-ups during more than a decade as an officer at the Heinz Endowments. \"The thing that really mattered was time... A lot of the older people retired and were eventually replaced by a new generation of people who got it... It takes time. You can accelerate change a little bit, but not a lot.\"</p><p>Sure, all those cool coffee shops, bookstores, new cultural venues and reclaimed green spaces helped draw talent, she says. But the bigger sea change from her point of view came when the city began attracting a new generation of more sophisticated investors, like the Silicon Valley venture firm Kleiner Perkins and Mitt Romney's Bain Capital, who were willing to take calculated risks on the unpredictable cycle of innovation and commercialization. \"The trouble with Pittsburgh isn't that it doesn't have enough money, it's who's spending it,\" says Gabriel, an MIT-trained engineer who served as Carnegie Mellon's chief technology officer from 1998 to 2006. \"Money is a commodity, and you want it tied to a network of people who understand your industry... Investors who are na?ve or predatory don't help you long term--the CEO of a car-wash chain doesn't get tech.\"</p><p>     Pittsburgh By the Numbers </p><p>How does Pittsburgh stack up?

For all its flaws as a long-term economic model, the steel-based industry of the 20th century spread the wealth around town in the form of decent-paying, low-skill jobs. That simply isn't the case anymore: According to a 2013 Brookings Institution report, 79 percent of people living below the federal poverty line in the Pittsburgh metro region are scattered in the suburbs--far outpacing the country's 55 percent average.</p><p>\"The big challenge now is figuring out a way to disseminate the city's new prosperity to all of its residents, not just the high-tech guys,\" says Peduto, 49, who just ran and won the mayor's job on a promise to create \"the first progressive administration for a Rust Belt city in America.\"</p><p>***</p><p>As recently as 2000, the imperative was simply to staunch the bleeding. Pittsburgh had an unemployment rate higher than Rust Belt cohorts like Cleveland, and was still hemorrhaging young people. At times, the local efforts to lure them back were comical: In 1999, a regional marketing group put together a television ad campaign centered around Border Guard Bob, an imaginary ranger type who would literally halt residents on their way out and persuade them to stay. (Wiser heads prevailed, and pulled the plug on the idea.) But around 2003, the recovery finally took root and the city's unemployment rate started to dip, with an interlude courtesy of the Great Recession (it stands at 6.6 percent as of November, below the national average and significantly better than Cleveland's 7.3 percent or Detroit's 9.3 percent). The post-9/11 wars-- and consequent massive buildup in Washington's defense spending--brought a surge of federal contracts to the region, much of it funneled through Carnegie Mellon. A network of city leaders also came together and managed to completely overhaul miles of riverfront land, seeding billions of dollars in private development. By 2009, for the first time in decades, the population began to grow, and it was getting younger. Not by much, but it was a landmark moment for a city with an abandonment complex. Part of the economic improvement had nothing to do with robots or high tech--the region also has abundant natural resources, and has been boosted by the recovery of newly tappable shale-gas deposits--but it was also clear that the university-industry pipeline that had been painstakingly laid over the years was finally starting to produce for the larger economy.</p><p>Yet none of these factors would have added up to a civic resurgence without the collaboration of a surprisingly small circle of interconnected actors--a couple of hundred people at most--who have worked on the city's rebirth with plodding determination, as if Pittsburgh itself were one of Red Whittaker's space robots. At Carnegie Mellon, even the biggest stars retain an underdog mindset that keeps them connected to the build-up-Pittsburgh movement and invested in the gritted-teeth war for talent with tech titans on the coasts. The city's most celebrated young scientist-entrepreneur, crowdsourcing pioneer and CMU professor Luis von Ahn, began as a Ph.D. student at the school and has remained there despite huge financial success in designing CAPTCHA (the ubiquitous type-this-word test most websites now use to determine if you are a human or a computer) and the popular Duolingo, the 2013 Apple \"app of the year,\" which uses crowdsourcing technologies to teach foreign language to users. \"Some of the stuff you see coming out of Silicon Valley... everybody there is talking about the same things and pumping each other up,\" von Ahn told an interviewer last year. Pittsburgh, by contrast, fostered \"different thinking,\" the 35-year-old McArthur \"genius\" grant recipient added.</p><p>Von Ahn, already rich thanks to his business deals with Google, decided to headquarter Duolingo's 27-person office in Shadyside, right off the Carnegie Mellon campus, rather than in Boston or in the more predictable Silicon Valley, keeping him close to the network of engineering talent the place has carefully nurtured. He himself, of course, is a product of that scientific pipeline at the school and an example of how the accumulation of talent is slowly building on itself. His mentor was CMU professor Manuel Blum--a Turing Prize winner who is considered among the most important theoretical mathematicians in the world--and who has taught many of the country's top experts on algorithms, the mathematical bedrock of all artificial intelligence and high-level computing. In fact, CMU's computer science department is a Blum family business. Blum's son Avrim is also a full tenured professor, specializing in machine learning and game theory. His wife Lenore, another tenured computer science professor and one of the first women in the world to rise to prominence in the male-dominated field of theoretical math, first met Blum in Pittsburgh in 1959 when she briefly attended architecture school at what was then the Carnegie Institute of Technology. The couple returned in 1999, after stellar careers at the University of California at Berkeley, for two reasons: The Blums had always loved the city--and Avrim, who had been teaching there for a decade, was starting a family.</p><p>Blum was a scientist first, but she was also a relentless networker and quickly identified the principal source of the city's post-industrial growing pains: A lot of the school's top computing and engineering talent were getting cash offers they couldn't refuse from Mountain View, Seattle and Boston. In the early 2000s, during the height of the Internet bubble, Microsoft recruiters would try to entice her kids with jobs as they walked from classroom to classroom. \"Pittsburgh didn't have the kind of high-tech infrastructure that California and Boston had, which is why everyone would graduate and leave,\" she said. \"That continues, in my view, to be our greatest challenge.\"</p><p>In some circles, there's a gnawing worry that the city, for all its assets, can't compete at the highest levels for the really big tech projects. One CMU official, who asked not to be identified, predicted that Pittsburgh's scrappy push to pioneer driverless cars would eventually be subsumed by the Google mastodon--and that the capital needed to commercialize such a project, $500 million or more, was \"FU money\" in Mountain View and an impossible stretch in the Steel City. There's even a sense that Google's increased local presence, while welcome, presages a takeover of sorts--and that the company, which is officially working on its search technology, will increasingly move in to monetize the city's robotics and artificial intelligence innovations. Over the last year, Google has in fact bought eight robotics firms from all over the country, a fact that few at CMU have failed to notice.</p><p>    READ MORE </p><p>What Works</p><p>         The Political Makeover of a Rust Belt City </p><p>By JIM O'TOOLE</p><p>What Works</p><p>         PHOTOS: Robots at Work </p><p>By MARK PETERSON/REDUX</p><p>What Works</p><p>         PHOTOS: From Steel City to Roboburgh </p><p>By MARK PETERSON/REDUX</p><p>Characteristically, the Carnegie Mellon group is looking to compensate with its now well-honed mix of underdog pluck and algorithmic brains. In 2007, Lenore Blum founded Project Olympus, a tech incubator that offers advice, micro-grants between $25,000 and $50,000, incubator space and networking events. Its impact is still relatively modest, but growing: Since its founding, Olympus has overseen the formation of 89 companies--67 by students and 22 by faculty--which have, in turn, attracted $68 million in second-stage funding. One of them, Dynamics--which produces a next-generation magnetic strip for credit cards--attracted $35 million from Bain Capital two years ago.</p><p>But its real purpose is keeping more smart graduates in town, and by that measure it's working. \"We're doing a lot better at that,\" adds Mayor Peduto, who is friendly with Blum. \"We tend to do better with the slightly older folks, people in their 30s who want to start a family here.\"</p><p>Ultimately, the city's greatest asset might be its memory--the pain and humiliation of the collapse still acts as a goad, and encourages people in positions of authority to bend the rules when they get in the way of good idea. The old image of Pittsburgh used to be anchored in the immovable soot-stained brick and iron of the smokestack; increasingly, it's being defined by the mobility of robots and the protean flexibility of the people who build them.</p><p>A few years back, Red Whittaker was hoping to access one of the dozens of played-out mines in the hills that ring the city in hopes of field-testing a new robot on wheels that would automatically produce three-dimensional images of the craggy, hazardous interiors, a machine that could be used, he hopes, to help rescue trapped miners and speed up recovery efforts. The problem was that federal regulations made it difficult and expensive to crack open sealed-off mines. So Whittaker put out the word to his friends in the contracting and excavation business: If you accidentally open up an entrance, give me a call. Soon after, one of Whittaker's buddies found just such an opening, but as Red's team was about to load up the gear and head out, he had second thoughts. \"We were talking about breaking the law,\" he says. So he rang CMU's president at the time, Jared Cohon, to make the ask. There was a pause, and a sigh.</p><p>\"Okay, Red,\" Cohon said. \"Do it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-103062</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BFG-WWP1-JDJ6-K0RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6577\"/><timeReceived>1:13 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2014  Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>February 4, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CM6G</classCode><className>NUCLEAR ACCIDENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001503</classCode><className>ROBOTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00096UV</classCode><className>COLLEGE STUDENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000813</classCode><className>GRANTS &amp; GIFTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008X8W</classCode><className>GRADUATE &amp; PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001772</classCode><className>UNEMPLOYMENT RATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CM6G</classCode><className>NUCLEAR ACCIDENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001503</classCode><className>ROBOTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST00096UV</classCode><className>COLLEGE STUDENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008X8W</classCode><className>GRADUATE &amp; PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA2Q0M0NzJERDUwNDE0OEE2QjYzQTc0NUFFRDJFMjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY</classCode><className>Museums</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GX613</classCode><className>PITTSBURGH, PA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The deregulation and privatisations that followed not only perked up their own economies, but became a template for reform in many other countries around the world, from Mexico to Russia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet did the pro-private sector, anti-state ethos go too far? In her book \"The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy,\" Mariana Mazzucato, an economist at University College London, argues that policymakers and the public have lost sight of government's ability to create economic value. She believes that our understanding of the origins of value are misguided and that governments should be able to \"explore, experiment and take risks\" on behalf of the public.</p><p>That view is not shared by all, since government intervention brings the risk of politicising decisions that are better made by market forces. As part of The Economist's Open Future project, we posed several questions to Ms Mazzucato about her ideas. It is followed by a short excerpt from the book, about how classical economists viewed the role of the state, from Smith to Marx--and what a \"humble citizen\" today might think.  </p><p>*       *       *</p><p>An interview with Mariana Mazzucato</p><p>The Economist: What constitutes economic value, and what do we know about how and when governments add it?</p><p>Mariana Mazzucato: Value is \"co-created\" by different actors in the economy when they come together in productive ways to create new types of goods and services--each actor adding time and effort. While this process is well understood in business--that is what they teach in business schools--it is much less understood in the public sector.</p><p>This is because policy is seen at best as fixing market failures, while in reality, policy has been most effective when it has actively co-created and co-shaped markets, not only fixed them: whether this was when the state provided the \"investment of first resort\" in the IT revolution, or the current role that public investments are playing in the green revolution, such as through the role of organisations like ARPA-E in America, but also of public banks like the KfW in Germany.</p><p>In each of these cases, government had to have a vision for the future, and make the necessary investments that later crowded-in more risk-averse private firms. But the key question is \"what is being created\"? Is it war machines, or tools for an economy that is more sustainable and inclusive? Even fracking initially came from government investments. Once we admit the state can be transformational, the key question is how and what.</p><p>The Economist: Governments can be too interventionist and make spending decisions that are driven by politics: can that realistically be curtailed?</p><p>Ms Mazzucato: In order to co-create and co-shape markets the state must have the right organisational structure and capabilities. Yet there is a self-fulfilling prophecy that because there is a narrow framework to understand the role of government, there is also a poor understanding of what capabilities the state requires in order to be effective. This means there is under-investment. Indeed, the irony is that when the state does not understand its role in creating public value through public purpose, then it ends up being ineffective and crowding out, and being more easily captured.  </p><p>The Economist: You have written about sectors that extract value from the economy; rentiers like financial services and parts of big tech. Aren't governments capable of being just as extractive?</p><p>Ms Mazzucato: Yes, of course. Both public and private actors can be extractive. The problem is how to transform private and public organisations so that they are more purpose-driven--but also that their interactions are more symbiotic and less parasitic. Adam Smith said that free markets were about making markets free from rent--and that means looking at how to transform both public and private organisations so that they are adding not extracting. It also fundamentally changes how we understand public-private partnerships.</p><p>The Economist: If society attributes too much value to sectors you regard as unproductive, such as financial services, is that not merely an expression of our collective priorities?</p><p>Ms Mazzucato: There are strong narratives about value creation that have also enabled more extraction to happen. While there was plenty of value extraction by landlords in the 17th century, they did not pretend to be productive, creative or innovative. They just said: give me your money. Because there is a feedback between how we value things and how things work out in the real economy--what sociologists call \"performativity\"--we cannot pretend that the status quo is our collective interest. There is a lot of conning going on.</p><p>I also argue that the mainstream theory of value being taught in economics departments worldwide is too subjective. It's based on preferences such as \"firms maximise profits\", \"consumer utility\" and \"workers choosing between leisure and work\". So it becomes much harder to objectively differentiate profits from rents, which was a key distinction made by the classical economists like Smith, Ricardo and Marx.</p><p>The Economist: Around the world, public trust in politicians is dismally low. Would the public support giving governments a more direct role in economic growth?</p><p>Ms Mazzucato: The problem is not about giving governments more or less of a role. The problem is what kind of role. There is more corruption and capture when government sees its role as just subsidising, or providing different forms of guarantees and tax cuts--as opposed to investing ambitiously to create new opportunities.</p><p>I have been a strong advocate for a mission-oriented approach to address the key challenges of our time--from climate change to healthy living. But key here is that the missions themselves should be co-created. No so much of a Kennedy-style moon-shot but more of different types of actors defining what a green transition might look like and then government using all it has at its disposal--from procurement to prize schemes--to crowd-in multiple solutions to \"get there\".</p><p>That is the lesson from the moon-shot: a clear goal; many different sectors, actors and disciplines coming together to solve the problem; all fuelled by hundreds of projects. Some may fail, so governments need to be willing to explore, experiment and take risks. But risks for the public good.</p><p> *       *       *</p><p>Government value in the history of economic thought</p><p>Excerpted from \"The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy\" by Mariana Mazzucato (Penguin, 2018):</p><p>Economics emerged as a discipline in large part to assert the productive primacy of the private sector.</p><p>Starting with the French physiocrats, economists found that government was required for the orderly functioning of society and thus for setting conditions for the production of value. But in itself, government was not inherently productive; rather, it was a stabilizing background force. The physiocrats pleaded with King Louis XV to laissez-faire--not to micro-manage the economy by siphoning off as much gold as possible, and thereby upset the intricate mechanism by which value was really created--through productivity of the land, not by accumulating precious metal. According to Quesnay's Tableau \u00c9conomique, value produced in agriculture flowed through the economy. But government was absent, 'unproductive'. As part of the ruling class, members of the government got a share of the value apportioned simply because they were in power.</p><p>Nevertheless, Quesnay knew, the Tableau did not work by itself. There was something to be 'governed'. Quesnay argued that the wealth of the nation could only be upheld through '\"roper management by the general administration\"--what we would call government regulation. He thought that free competition would best benefit the economy--but to achieve this, far from excluding government, he favoured an activist state that would break monopolies and establish the institutional conditions necessary for competition and free trade to flourish and value creation to thrive.</p><p>Adam Smith, meanwhile, devoted the fifth book of his The Wealth of Nations to the role of government in the economy. His aim was not only to explain the prosperity of the nation, but also \"to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue sufficient for the public services.\". Like Quesnay, Smith believed the state was necessary. Indeed, he was convinced that national wealth could only be increased through division of labour in \"a well-governed society\", in which he singled out three crucial functions of government: the military, the judiciary and other public services such as provision of infrastructure. These are public goods--producers cannot exclude anyone from consuming them. For Smith, such public goods had to be paid for by the state; some sort of taxation was therefore necessary.</p><p>David Ricardo was perhaps the most anti-government of the classical economists. Although the title of his The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation contains a key activity of government (taxation), he never considered how taxation could allow government spending to encourage production and hence value creation. For Ricardo, taxes are the '\"portion of the produce of land and labour, placed at the disposal of government\" to spend on areas such as education. If these expenditures are too high, he writes, the capital of the country is diminished, and \"distress and ruin will follow\". Ricardo never asks, as Smith did, whether some taxes are necessary to help capitalists carry out production. He assumes infrastructure--the judiciary and so on--as a given. In effect, Ricardo narrows the production of economic value strictly to the private sphere. Admiring Ricardo's rigorous analytical arguments, in comparison with Smith's more fluid and interdisciplinary philosophical and political approach, economists followed him and excluded government from the productive sector.</p><p>Marx's view of government, meanwhile, derived from his materialist view of history, whereby the organization of society (including government structures) reflects the economic system (which he called the mode of production) and the underlying social relations: the interaction between classes. So, in his view, under the capitalist mode of production--based on surplus value generated from exploitation of labour--government and law reflected the needs of capitalists. Marx ridiculed some followers of Smith and Ricardo for haranguing state officials as \"parasites on the actual producers\", then realizing that they were after all necessary to support the capitalist system. Nevertheless Marx, like Smith before him, while stressing the necessity of some functions of the state, placed state officials in the category of unproductive labourers outside the production boundary. The capitalist class had an interest in maintaining the state in a position strong enough to guarantee the rule of law and advance their class interests--but nothing more than that: \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.\" The question concerning Marx was what constituted the 'right' size of government to provide the necessary services without taking away any additional profits.</p><p>While the neoclassical economists broke with the labour theory of value, they did not depart from their predecessors' view that government was necessary but unproductive. Marginal utility, as we have seen, locates value in the price of any transaction that takes place freely in the market. According to this perspective, government produces nothing: it cannot create value. And government's main source of income is taxes, which are a transfer of existing value created in the private sector.</p><p>The immensely influential Alfred Marshall was quite nuanced in his discussion of economic life in his Principles, but still recommended that economics should avoid 'as far as possible' the discussion of matters associated with government. He believed that government interference in, or regulation of, the market would often happen in response to attempts by vested interests to rig the market in their favour (i.e. government would be 'captured' by such interests)--thus only hurting a particular competitor rather than benefiting society as a whole.</p><p>To the humble citizen, however, it might not be so obvious that government does not create value. We have already seen three ways in which it does so: bailing out the banks; investing in infrastructure, education and basic science; and funding radical, innovative technologies which are transforming our lives.</p><p>The crucial point is that many of these activities involve taking risks and investing--exactly what austerity doesn't do--and in so doing they create value. But that value is not easily visible, for the simple reason that much of it goes into the pockets of the private sector.</p><p>_______________</p><p> Excerpted from \"The Value of Everything: Making and Taking in the Global Economy\" by Mariana Mazzucato.

EFF was founded in 199o, a few years before the internet was opened up for commercial development, which led unsurprisingly to an abrupt climb in public participation on the Net. So we had a head start when it came to anticipating how free-speech issues would play out online.  One early obvious source of social tension arising from growth of this new medium was government anxiety and intervention, first focused on the threat of hackers and computer intrusion. Quickly thereafter the calls for government intervention centered on issues such as encryption (which makes wiretapping harder), copyright infringement, the easy spread of pornographic content, the prospect of cyberterrorism, \u201cbomb-making information on the internet\u201d and so-called \u201chate speech.\u201d In its first decade, EFF tackled those issues, partly to stop government overreach but also to create breathing space for individuals and companies to develop online services and internet \u201cspaces\u201d where free speech could flourish. </p><p>EFF\u2019s primary focus in those years was challenging government impulses to control, constrain and regulate internet speech. But at the same time we saw cases arise from the actions and policies of then-dominant platform providers (in those days they included the highly-moderated Prodigy, plus the somewhat less moderated CompuServe and AOL). Because these companies hosting digital forums were not bound by the First Amendment\u2014yet might, for all we knew, become the market-dominant platforms of the internet era\u2014we at EFF believed it was best that they join a social consensus that allowed digital freedom, freedom of expression and freedom of association. The First Amendment is a limitation on government action but, we argued, private companies ought to value freedom and privacy too.  As I wrote in an (unsigned) editorial in EFF News (volume 1, number 0): \u201cWe at EFF do not dispute that Prodigy is acting within its rights as a private concern when it dictates restrictions on how its system is used. We do think, however, that the Prodigy experience has a bearing on EFF interests in a couple of ways. First, it demonstrates that there is a market \u2013 a perceived public need \u2013 for services that provide electronic mail and public conferencing. Second, it illustrates the fallacy that \u2018pure\u2019 market forces always can be relied upon to move manufacturers and service providers in the direction of open communications. A better solution, we believe, is a national network-access policy that, at the very least, encourages private providers to generate the kind of open and unrestricted network and mail services that the growing computer-literate public clearly wants.\u201d  On the other hand, we knew early on that in order to liberate the platform and service providers\u2014to give breathing space to free expression and privacy\u2014it was critical that neither statute, nor regulation, nor caselaw compelled providers to move in the opposite, more restrictive, direction. Drawing upon earlier Supreme Court precedent, a federal district court case called Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe, Inc. (1991) suggested that the best way to classify online platforms was as something not quite like a common carrier (e.g., a postal service or telephone company) and not quite like a publisher (Penguin or the New York Times) either.  In Cubby, a federal judge suggested (in a closely reasoned opinion) that the proper First Amendment model was the bookstore \u2013 bookstores, under American law, are a constitutionally protected space for hosting other people\u2019s expression. But that case was misinterpreted by a later decision (Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Co., 1995), so lawyers and policy advocates pushed to include platform protections in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that amounted to a statutory equivalent of the Cubby precedent. Those protections, in Section 230, allowed platform providers to engage in certain kinds of editorial intervention and selection without becoming transformed by their actions into \u201cpublishers\u201d of users\u2019 content (and thus legally liable for what users say).  In short, we at EFF wanted platform providers to be free to create humane digital spaces without necessarily acquiring legal liability for everything their users said and did, and with no legal compulsion to invade users\u2019 privacy. We argued from the very beginning, about the need for service providers to be just, to support human rights even when they didn\u2019t have to and to provide space and platforms for open creativity. The rules we worked to put into place later gave full bloom to the World Wide Web, to new communities on platforms like Facebook and Twitter and to collaborative collective enterprises like Wikipedia and open-source software.  In pure economic terms, Section 230 (together, it must be said, with the Digital Millennium Act\u2019s notice-and-takedown provisions regarding copyrighted works) has been a success\u2014the leading internet companies (among Western democracies at least) have been American. Section 230, with its bright-line rules barring internet services\u2019 legal liability for content originated by a service\u2019s users (rather than the services themselves) brought the Cubby model into the 21st century. Services could \u201ccurate\u201d user content if they wanted to (just as a bookstore has a First Amendment-grounded right to choose which books it carries and sells), but wouldn\u2019t be liable either for content they overlooked or for content they had (mis)judged to be lawful. In the digital world, Section 230 gave the platforms something like common-carriage legal protections but also autonomy to shape the character of their online \u201cspaces.\u201d  Because some platforms have been hugely successful, and because market shakeouts have left some players like Facebook and Google dominant (at least for now), other players have sought to roll back Section 230. Most recently the ostensible focus has been on sex trafficking (and commercial sexual services generally), which some critics believe has been made worse by online platforms like Backpage.com \u2014even though Backpage almost certainly isn\u2019t protected by Section 230 given the service\u2019s role in originating sex-service content. But, really, the concern about internet sex-trafficking is being used as a stalking horse for players who are looking for opportunities either to sue the platforms and win big bucks or to impose stronger censorship obligations on the platforms for a variety of reasons\u2014not the least of which is today\u2019s moral panics about social media and big tech, which I\u2019ve written about here and here.  This isn\u2019t to say we should never revisit Section 230 and consider whether its protections need to be refined. Maybe they do. But given that there is a larger moral panic going on about social media (e.g. Russian-sponsored trolls using Facebook to push for Brexit or Donald Trump\u2019s election), we shouldn\u2019t rush to judgment about amending or repealing Section 230. Most ordinary internet users love Google and Facebook (even when they\u2019re sometimes irritated by what they find on these and other platforms). We ought not to hurriedly undermine the legal protections that allowed these American success stories to flourish. Even if today\u2019s internet giants can survive the loss of Section 230 and absorb the costs of censorship compliance, new market entrants likely can\u2019t. Which means that hobbling 230 will stifle the competition that got us to today\u2019s rich internet in the first place. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN684808420180321</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXN-FHW1-J9XT-P3V1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1306\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Mar 2000: Palm Pilot IPOs at $53 billion Sep 2006: 'Everyone's always asking me when Apple will come out with a cellphone. My answer is, 'Probably never.'' - David Pogue (NYT) Jun 2007: iPhone released Nov 2007: 'Nokia: One Billion Customers\u2014Can Anyone Catch the Cell Phone King?'</p><p> (Forbes) Geoffrey Manne and Alec Stapp at Truth on the Market[1]have writtena brief history of impregnable tech monopolies that were pregnable after all, in fields from personal computers to video distribution to social media. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others are now arguing that the government should break up and closely regulate tech giants Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple 'claiming they have too much power and represent a danger to our democracy.' Manne and Stapp offer examples of sector after sector in which what was seen as structural, inescapable tech monopoly turned out to be not so unassailable.Here's music distribution: Dec 2003: 'The subscription model of buying music is bankrupt. I think you could make available the Second Coming in a subscription model, and it might not be successful.' - Steve Jobs (Rolling Stone[2]) Apr 2006:Spotify founded[3] Jul 2009: 'Apple's iPhone and iPod Monopolies Must Go' (PC World[4]) Jun 2015:Apple Music announced[5] They conclude by quoting two[6]observations[7]byBenedict Evans, a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz, first on 'why competition in tech is especially difficult to predict': IBM, Microsoft and Nokia were not beaten by companies doing what they did, but better. They were beaten by companies that moved the playing field and made their core competitive assets irrelevant. The same will apply to Facebook (and Google, Amazon and Apple). And why 'we will not be stuck with the current crop of tech giants forever': With each cycle in tech, companies find ways to build a moat and make a monopoly. Then people look at the moat and think it's invulnerable. They're generally right. IBM still dominates mainframes and Microsoft still dominates PC operating systems and productivity software. But It's not that someone works out how to cross the moat. It's that the castle becomes irrelevant. IBM didn't lose mainframes and Microsoft didn't lose PC operating systems. Instead, those stopped being ways to dominate tech. PCs made IBM just another big tech company. Mobile and the web made Microsoft just another big tech company. This will happen to Google or Amazon as well. Unless you think tech progress is over and there'll be no more cycles It is deeply counter-intuitive to say 'something we cannot predict is certain to happen'. But this is nonetheless what's happened to overturn pretty much every tech monopoly so far. Walter Olson is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies. His books include The Rule of Lawyers, on mass litigation, The Excuse Factory, on lawsuits in the workplace, and most recently Schools for Misrule, on the state of the law schools. His first book, The Litigation Explosion, was one of the most widely discussed general-audience books on law of its time. It led the Washington Post to dub him 'intellectual guru of tort reform.'

Mar 2000: Palm Pilot IPOs at $53 billion Sep 2006: 'Everyone's always asking me when Apple will come out with a cellphone. My answer is, 'Probably never.'' - David Pogue (NYT) Jun 2007: iPhone released Nov 2007: 'Nokia: One Billion Customers\u2014Can Anyone Catch the Cell Phone King?'</p><p> (Forbes) Geoffrey Manne and Alec Stapp at Truth on the Market[1]have writtena brief history of impregnable tech monopolies that were pregnable after all, in fields from personal computers to video distribution to social media. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others are now arguing that the government should break up and closely regulate tech giants Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple 'claiming they have too much power and represent a danger to our democracy.' Manne and Stapp offer examples of sector after sector in which what was seen as structural, inescapable tech monopoly turned out to be not so unassailable.Here's music distribution: Dec 2003: 'The subscription model of buying music is bankrupt. I think you could make available the Second Coming in a subscription model, and it might not be successful.' - Steve Jobs (Rolling Stone[2]) Apr 2006:Spotify founded[3] Jul 2009: 'Apple's iPhone and iPod Monopolies Must Go' (PC World[4]) Jun 2015:Apple Music announced[5] They conclude by quotingtwo[6]observations[7]byBenedict Evans, a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz, first on 'why competition in tech is especially difficult to predict': IBM, Microsoft and Nokia were not beaten by companies doing what they did, but better. They were beaten by companies that moved the playing field and made their core competitive assets irrelevant. The same will apply to Facebook (and Google, Amazon and Apple). And why 'we will not be stuck with the current crop of tech giants forever': With each cycle in tech, companies find ways to build a moat and make a monopoly. Then people look at the moat and think it's invulnerable. They're generally right. IBM still dominates mainframes and Microsoft still dominates PC operating systems and productivity software. But It's not that someone works out how to cross the moat. It's that the castle becomes irrelevant. IBM didn't lose mainframes and Microsoft didn't lose PC operating systems. Instead, those stopped being ways to dominate tech. PCs made IBM just another big tech company. Mobile and the web made Microsoft just another big tech company. This will happen to Google or Amazon as well. Unless you think tech progress is over and there'll be no more cycles It is deeply counter-intuitive to say 'something we cannot predict is certain to happen'. But this is nonetheless what's happened to overturn pretty much every tech monopoly so far.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others are now arguing that the government should break up and closely regulate tech giants Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple \"claiming they have too much power and represent a danger to our democracy.\" Manne and Stapp offer examples of sector after sector in which what was seen as structural, inescapable tech monopoly turned out to be not so unassailable. Here's music distribution:</p><p>Dec 2003: \"The subscription model of buying music is bankrupt. I think you could make available the Second Coming in a subscription model, and it might not be successful.\" Steve Jobs (Rolling Stone)</p><p>Apr 2006: Spotify founded</p><p>Jul 2009: \"Apple's iPhone and iPod Monopolies Must Go\" (PC World)</p><p>Jun 2015: Apple Music announced</p><p>They conclude by quoting two observations by Benedict Evans, a venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz, first on \"why competition in tech is especially difficult to predict\":</p><p>IBM, Microsoft and Nokia were not beaten by companies doing what they did, but better. They were beaten by companies that moved the playing field and made their core competitive assets irrelevant. The same will apply to Facebook (and Google, Amazon and Apple).</p><p>And why \"we will not be stuck with the current crop of tech giants forever\":</p><p>With each cycle in tech, companies find ways to build a moat and make a monopoly. Then people look at the moat and think it's invulnerable. They're generally right. IBM still dominates mainframes and Microsoft still dominates PC operating systems and productivity software. But... It's not that someone works out how to cross the moat. It's that the castle becomes irrelevant. IBM didn't lose mainframes and Microsoft didn't lose PC operating systems. Instead, those stopped being ways to dominate tech. PCs made IBM just another big tech company. Mobile and the web made Microsoft just another big tech company. This will happen to Google or Amazon as well. Unless you think tech progress is over and there'll be no more cycles ... It is deeply counter-intuitive to say 'something we cannot predict is certain to happen'. But this is nonetheless what's happened to overturn pretty much every tech monopoly so far.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122867547</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VXH-HHP1-JCBF-S012-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"462\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Adrian Wooldridge considered it inevitable that executives at Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoftwould be seen by the public in the same malign fashion as bankers and oil barons \u2014 symbols of a greedy nerd version of avaricious capitalism.</p><p>Wooldridge was right about the backlash \u2014 but he probably didn't count on how broad an indictment critics of the tech giants would bring. It was predictable that big tech companies would stand accused of operating in monopolistic ways and of stealthily monetizing information about individuals acquired from their online activities.</p><p> But it's not just these practices that have poked holes in Silicon Valley's bubble of public regard and admiration. It's also how the tech giants have behaved in other ways.</p><p> With the release of its iPhone X, Apple joined Facebookand Googleas companies pursuing facial recognition technologies that portend an end to old concepts of privacy. Despite their insistence otherwise, those firms and Microsoft have been called de facto silent partners to U.S. intelligence agencies' attempts to vacuum up information from people around the world without their consent. And despite all the benefits they bring, Facebookand Googleare villains to both sides of the culture wars.</p><p> They're accused of enforcing left-wing speech codes on acceptable commentary and enabling the far right to spread election-skewing \"fake news\" and bigotry. ProPublica provided a new example Thursday when it showed Facebookprovided tools for advertisers to reach anti-Semitic hate groups.</p><p> Now the backlash may be moving beyond rhetoric. In June, European Union regulators slammed Googlewith a record $2.7 billion fine for seeking to profit by manipulating online search requests.</p><p> In the U.S., the traditional American fear of giant corporations has begun to manifest itself. The same impulse that led to the break-up of Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&amp;T in 1982 is flaring as awareness grows of Google's and Facebook's hegemony in advertising and the realization sets in that Amazon may destroy more American jobs than China.</p><p>Google's troubles continued with an Aug. 30 report in The New York Times that Eric Schmidt of Google's parent company Alphabet had pressured the New America Foundation think tank \u2014 which Googlehas supported financially \u2014 to push out scholar Barry Lynn and his Open Markets research team. Lynn's sin? Publicly applauding the EU's fine against Google. Such bullying will haunt Google\u2014 at least if the anti-monopoly backlash plays out according to the traditional American script.</p><p> But that's a huge if. Standard Oil and AT&amp;T had monopolistic control of gasoline supplies and telephone service, respectively \u2014 major bills most American households pay. Google's and Facebook's chief services are addictive \u2014 and free.</p><p> Still, as everyday life makes clear, Americans are stirred up. The Trump and Sanders wings of the two largest political parties want and expect dramatic change. If they get their way, the most powerful forces in this country are likely to feel the fallout. And that is a category that very much includes Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIA-24fd900e6a07cd5afcd8b722520a7a01cf4fe5a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289CAEE21DC091 NWBKIA2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHP-MPC1-DXVP-V3WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 North Iowa Media Group<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It was held in more innocent times \\x96 even if very recent \\x96 that social media would democratise the news, prising it loose from filters imposed by professional journalists (remember \\x93presstitute\\x94?). Given today's explosion of fake news, assembly line trolls hewing to party lines, and propaganda bots \\x96 such utopianism looks hopelessly outdated, even lighting the route to dystopia.</p><p>Tech writers Vivek Wadhwa and Alex Salkever wrote in these columns about how interactive products peddled by technology companies drop us into a rabbit hole of psychological addictions, making us lose focus and trapping us in habits of mindless consumption we are unable to get out of. We accomplish less, making us miserable.</p><p>Wadhwa and Salkever go so far as to argue that the distractiveness of the new devices and media is responsible for the plateauing of worker productivity witnessed over the past decade. All for the profit of a few companies, even as it contributes to the problem of global inequality. It shouldn't surprise anyone that Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the world wide web, is now calling for tough regulation of the big tech companies. You either work for Google, Apple or Facebook and become a master of the universe, or remain at the bottom of the social heap.</p><p>Which may apply, too, to those who get their news through social media. If information is power, then disinformation is disempowerment. There is a great danger of remaining trapped in echo chambers where we learn as much about the real world as we would in a hall of mirrors. News, after all, is not just meant to please \\x96 it is also a means of exploration and discovery, of learning about how the real world works and helping us make our way in it. That is also the basis of the modern world: else we become prey to our subjective fears, prejudices and desires and spend our time wrestling with phantoms, as in the dark ages.</p><p>A scary instance of the dark power of internet and social media was the exodus of northeasterners from Bengaluru in 2012, prompted by an image from the 2010 Tibetan earthquake which portrayed Buddhist monks amidst a large number of mutilated bodies. The image was michievously recirculated by a Pakistani portal with the tagline \\x93The body of Muslims slaughtered by Buddhist Barma\\x94 (sic).</p><p>That acquired a life of its own, calls for revenge for what supposedly happened in Assam and Myanmar went viral over the internet, and thousands of northeasterners were scared into fleeing the city. Unless we became less credulous about 'news' circulated through social media, internet feeds or WhatsApp forwards, the potential for communal mischief making and hatemongers triggering riots is obvious.</p><p>A flood of fake news preceded the 2016 US elections where the Russian role is being investigated, and a former employee of the Trump-affiliated Cambridge Analytica has blown the whistle about how the firm \\x93took fake news to the next level\\x94 by profiling individuals based on data obtained from Facebook and targeting them with customised disinformation.</p><p>Fake news on social media isn't always a conscious propaganda tool of political players. It can also be a handy way of making money, not so much about weaponising as monetising disinformation. Fake news during America's 2016 election season has been traced, for example, not just to Russia or the US but also to adolescents in Macedonia, who found an easy way to make a quick buck \\x96 much like poor Afghan farmers might produce opium to feed the world's demand for heroin.</p><p>The modus operandi is simple. Find a story that will sell and don't let facts come in the way. Then dress it up on social media as attractive clickbait: let us say, Barack Obama is really a Muslim born in Kenya. Watch traffic to your site skyrocket, and rake in the ad dollars.</p><p>This doesn't work so well from the consumer's viewpoint, though: who is strapped to a daily cycle of someone's febrile concoctions, intended to get you to the point where you are sobbing, slobbering, hysterical or preferably a combination of all three. Neither does it work well for nations whose politics gets increasingly polarised, fractious, distracted and disoriented by disinformation.</p><p>But before you give up in despair, there is a solution at hand. You could, in fact, be holding it in your hands. Assuming one has limited time to learn as much as possible about the world and glean useful information before getting on with the day's work, the most efficient way of doing this at present is the print newspaper from a trusted brand.</p><p>Like slow food, there are some virtues to a slower news cycle as opposed to the frenetic breaking news machine on electronic media \\x96 here the news will have been filtered and provided with background and context by professional journalists, rather than precooked by speculative and splenetic opinion.</p><p>And to gain perspective, focus and depth, understand an issue comprehensively and get a sense of the best ideas out there, one can do worse than to turn to the newspaper's editorial page. The best of them will also add value by featuring well-argued perspectives from diverse viewpoints, addressing the problem of social media's echo chamber where one only gets to learn what one already knows.</p><p>Print is for adults \\x96 including young adults \\x96 who know that addictive heroin rushes either kill or are followed by unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_96_21032018016001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXD-TCN1-JB3N-T144-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"980\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

It was held in more innocent times \\x96 even if very recent \\x96 that social media would democratise the news, prising it loose from filters imposed by professional journalists (remember \\x93presstitute\\x94?). Given today\\x92s explosion of fake news, assembly line trolls hewing to party lines, and propaganda bots \\x96 such utopianism looks hopelessly outdated, even lighting the route to dystopia.</p><p>Tech writers Vivek Wadhwa and Alex Salkever wrote in these columns about how interactive products peddled by technology companies drop us into a rabbit hole of psychological addictions, making us lose focus and trapping us in habits of mindless consumption we are unable to get out of. We accomplish less, making us miserable.</p><p>Illustration:Chad Crowe</p><p>Wadhwa and Salkever go so far as to argue that the distractiveness of the new devices and media is responsible for the plateauing of worker productivity witnessed over the past decade. All for the profit of a few companies, even as it contributes to the problem of global inequality. It shouldn\\x92t surprise anyone that Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the world wide web, is now calling for tough regulation of the big tech companies. You either work for Google, Apple or Facebook and become a master of the universe, or remain at the bottom of the social heap.</p><p>Which may apply, too, to those who get their news through social media. If information is power, then disinformation is disempowerment. There is a great danger of remaining trapped in echo chambers where we learn as much about the real world as we would in a hall of mirrors. News, after all, is not just meant to please \\x96 it is also a means of exploration and discovery, of learning about how the real world works and helping us make our way in it. That is also the basis of the modern world: else we become prey to our subjective fears, prejudices and desires and spend our time wrestling with phantoms, as in the dark ages.</p><p>A scary instance of the dark power of internet and social media was the exodus of northeasterners from Bengaluru in 2012 , prompted by an image from the 2010 Tibetan earthquake which portrayed Buddhist monks amidst a large number of mutilated bodies. The image was michievously recirculated by a Pakistani portal with the tagline \\x93The body of Muslims slaughtered by Buddhist Barma\\x94 (sic).</p><p>That acquired a life of its own, calls for revenge for what supposedly happened in Assam and Myanmar went viral over the internet, and thousands of northeasterners were scared into fleeing the city. Unless we became less credulous about \\x91news\\x92 circulated through social media, internet feeds or WhatsApp forwards, the potential for communal mischief making and hatemongers triggering riots is obvious.</p><p>A flood of fake news preceded the 2016 US elections where the Russian role is being investigated, and a former employee of the Trump-affiliated Cambridge Analytica has blown the whistle about how the firm \\x93took fake news to the next level\\x94 by profiling individuals based on data obtained from Facebook and targeting them with customised disinformation.</p><p>Fake news on social media isn\\x92t always a conscious propaganda tool of political players. It can also be a handy way of making money, not so much about weaponising as monetising disinformation. Fake news during America\\x92s 2016 election season has been traced, for example, not just to Russia or the US but also to adolescents in Macedonia, who found an easy way to make a quick buck \\x96 much like poor Afghan farmers might produce opium to feed the world\\x92s demand for heroin.</p><p>The modus operandi is simple. Find a story that will sell and don\\x92t let facts come in the way. Then dress it up on social media as attractive clickbait: let us say, Barack Obama is really a Muslim born in Kenya. Watch traffic to your site skyrocket, and rake in the ad dollars.</p><p>This doesn\\x92t work so well from the consumer\\x92s viewpoint, though: who is strapped to a daily cycle of someone\\x92s febrile concoctions, intended to get you to the point where you are sobbing, slobbering, hysterical or preferably a combination of all three. Neither does it work well for nations whose politics gets increasingly polarised, fractious, distracted and disoriented by disinformation.</p><p>But before you give up in despair, there is a solution at hand. You could, in fact, be holding it in your hands. Assuming one has limited time to learn as much as possible about the world and glean useful information before getting on with the day\\x92s work, the most efficient way of doing this at present is the print newspaper from a trusted brand.</p><p>Like slow food, there are some virtues to a slower news cycle as opposed to the frenetic breaking news machine on electronic media \\x96 here the news will have been filtered and provided with background and context by professional journalists, rather than precooked by speculative and splenetic opinion.</p><p>And to gain perspective, focus and depth, understand an issue comprehensively and get a sense of the best ideas out there, one can do worse than to turn to the newspaper\\x92s editorial page. The best of them will also add value by featuring well-argued perspectives from diverse viewpoints, addressing the problem of social media\\x92s echo chamber where one only gets to learn what one already knows.</p><p>Print is for adults \\x96 including young adults \\x96 who know that addictive heroin rushes either kill or are followed by unpleasant withdrawal symptoms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIET2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXM-D4M1-DXJR-H0CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"992\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

And the recent controversy over the short video channel TikTok highlights a growing geopolitical dimension.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Data is to the 21st century what oil was to the beginning of the 20th. The new tycoons are not called Rockefeller, Hammer or Mellon, but rather Gates, Zuckerberg, Brin or Bezos. Like their predecessors, many of these have become generous philanthropists. This should, however, not detract from the fact that big data is big business \u2014 huge business really. He who owns the data gets access to coveted advertising revenue.</p><p>If anything, the coronavirus disease pandemic has upped the stakes in the big data game. As our lives and work situations have increasingly moved online, the Googles, Facebooks, Microsofts and WeChats of this world get ever greater access to and insights into our work, the way we live our lives, and our consumer preferences.</p><p>In 2018, the spotlight fell on just how insecure our personal data is when we entrust it to big tech firms, as it became clear that Cambridge Analytica had harvested Facebook users' personal data without authorization. This brought both regulators and activists to the fore. None of us can forget a contrite Mark Zuckerberg testifying in the US Congress or at the European Parliament. Cambridge Analytica may have gone out of business, but the debate persists.</p><p>The big tech companies, which blew all expectations out of the water during this earnings season, are accumulating ever more power, not just because we use them more frequently courtesy of our changing lifestyles, but also because they are very acquisitive, garnering ever greater market power. They may vow to be more careful with our data, as Google did when it promised the European Competition Authorities (ECA) it would keep DoubleClick's data in a separate silo from its own after its acquisition of the internet advertiser in 2007. But, by 2016, the data had been combined across Google's various platforms.</p><p>Where it gets particularly tricky is when we give a device access to our most intimate data. The ECA are currently having a very close look at what Google's proposed $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit might mean in terms of data security and competitive power. Google's assurances that it will silo data have worn thin, given the DoubleClick experience. As for competitive power, EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager could not have put it more clearly: \"Our investigation aims to ensure that control by Google over data collected through wearable devices as a result of the transaction does not distort competition.\"</p><p>No wonder, then, that regulators are watching market strength and data protection with an eagle eye. Expect to see Messrs Zuckerberg, Bezos, Nadella and Pichai in front of lawmakers more frequently over the coming years.</p><p>However, it is not just the big companies that are after our data \u2014 governments are too. The debate on whether WhatsApp should open its encryption to law enforcement authorities in cases of suspected terrorism or other criminal acts is justified. The question is one of proportionality and boundaries. It has become particularly relevant in times of contact tracing. While we all understand the need to contain the coronavirus and the validity of a contact tracing app that informs us when we have been close to an infected person, this app is there for our personal protection and as a public health measure. The question remains who, in the end, will have access to our data and how much of it will really remain encrypted.</p><p>Like oil, data has a geopolitical dimension, which the recent controversy over TikTok highlights. The US is wary of the Chinese government having access to the data of US citizens and how that could be harvested to benefit Beijing. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threatened to ban other Chinese-owned apps like WeChat for the same reason. President Donald Trump favors Microsoft's proposed acquisition of TikTok. This gives rise to the question of what constitutes undue government pressure over mergers and acquisitions transactions.</p><p>Many people's concerns over foreign government access to data and what that means for their influence may be valid. This brings us back to how foreign governments could influence voting and election behavior in any given country. Remember the controversy over Facebook, Twitter and the like in the context of the Brexit referendum and elections in the US, UK, France and Germany.</p><p>Where it gets particularly tricky is when we give a device access to our most intimate data.</p><p>Cornelia Meyer</p><p>All of the above are very difficult issues. Technology has given us the freedom to communicate far and wide. It has enabled us to earn a living and socialize despite lockdowns. The flipside of the coin is that big companies and governments covet the data we gift them for their own purposes, be they commercial or to exercise power.</p><p>As the market position and power of big tech companies get ever greater, we need to find ways to regulate or at least put in place protocols or gentlemen's agreements regarding how our data is used. There are antitrust concerns, privacy concerns, and worries over how much access governments get to our data. This is virgin territory and the answers to these questions are not easy to find, but they need to be addressed urgently because more and more of our lives are going online. Data is not just the hot new commodity because it is big business; who has access to it has huge ramifications for our safety and security, as data increasingly defines who we are.</p><p>Cornelia Meyer is a business consultant, macroeconomist and energy expert.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index entered correction territory on Monday as investors fretted over antitrust action against big tech giants like Facebook and Alphabet, before rallying 3.9% to 7742.10. The S&amp;amp;P 500 gained 4.4% on the week, breaking a four-week losing streak, ending at 2873.34.</p><p>Facebook Inc. The Federal Trade Commission said it will lead any antitrust investigation into Facebook while the Justice Department will have chief oversight of Alphabet Inc.'s Google, as the U.S. government gears up for scrutiny of the country's major tech companies over competition concerns. The FTC and Justice Department share authority in enforcing U.S. antitrust law and at times must work out turf arrangements regarding which agency will handle what issues. The FTC already has spent more than a year investigating Facebook on privacy issues related to how it handles users' data, and Monday's move suggests it is considering even more rigorous scrutiny of the social media giant. Facebook shares tumbled 7.5% Monday, as Alphabet lost 6.1%, Apple Inc. fell 1.0% and Amazon.com Inc. shed 4.6%.</p><p>Cypress Semiconductor Corp.Infineon Technologies AG struck a deal to acquire rival chip maker Cypress Semiconductor for $9.4 billion, the latest in a series of transactions that have been reshaping the industry. The proposed deal, which requires regulatory approval, dragged down Infineon shares 8% as investors balked at the hefty premium, while Cypress shares leapt 24% Monday. By acquiring Cypress, Infineon would boost its position in connected devices, notably by adding Cypress's connectivity chips, which enable devices to hook up to the web. The deal would also make Infineon the world's largest provider of chips to the automotive sector, an area that already makes up over 40% of the German firm's sales.</p><p>Blackstone Group LP Blackstone Group agreed to buy a network of U.S. industrial warehouses from Singapore-based GLP for $18.7 billion in the largest private real-estate transaction ever and a big bet on the continued explosion of e-commerce. Blackstone outbid real-estate company Prologis Inc. for the roughly 180-million-square-foot portfolio, which includes about 1,300 properties across the country, many of them near population centers. Valuations of publicly traded warehouse owners have surged in some cases by 30% this year as the rise of Amazon.com-GLP's biggest tenant-and other e-commerce companies has spurred demand for industrial warehouses. Blackstone shares rose 2.8% Monday.</p><p>CVS Health Corp.CVS shares climbed 2.3% Tuesday after the drugstore chain, in a move to reassure skeptical investors, said it expects to return to profit growth next year as its merger with health insurer Aetna will result in more than $800 million in savings in 2020. After warning earlier this year that 2019 profits would decline, the company said it expects adjusted earnings per share above $7 in 2020, growing by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2021 and smaller increases the years following. Wall Street analysts had predicted adjusted earnings per share of $7.22 for next year and growth of 8% to $7.80 for 2021, according to a poll by Refinitiv.</p><p>Renault SA Renault's American-listed shares skidded 6.2% Thursday as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV pulled its merger offer after France's government requested a delay. The French state, Renault's top shareholder, balked at the deal because it lacked the support of longtime alliance member Nissan Motor Co.Nissan's two representatives on Renault's board planned to abstain in the vote, raising doubts about Nissan's commitment to preserving the alliance if the merger were to proceed. Fiat shares were flat in U.S. trading Thursday as investors saw the auto maker in a stronger position than Renault to find a partner.</p><p>Campbell Soup Co. M'm m'm...investment. Campbell Soup is planning to bolster investment in its namesake business in the U.S., where sales have dropped amid heightened competition from private-label options. The company's share of the U.S. soup market dropped about 2 percentage points in the year ended in late April, as overall soup sales in the U.S. were flat for the latest quarter. Campbell shares jumped 10% Wednesday, after the company reported better-than-expected total sales for its quarter ended April 28 and a better-than-expected profit of $84 million, or 28 cents a share. Campbell also raised its forecast for adjusted profit for its current fiscal year, and now expects to earn between at least $2.50 and $2.55 a share.</p><p>Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Inc.Barnes &amp;amp; Noble agreed Friday to be acquired by hedge-fund firm Elliot Management Corp. for $6.50 a share. The $475 million deal gives the troubled bookstore chain a lifeline as it struggles to attract shoppers while competing online with rivals like Amazon.com and Apple. Elliott plans to invest in improvements at Barnes &amp;amp; Noble's 600-plus stores, which remain key for publishers who rely on the company to help promote authors. Barnes &amp;amp; Noble shares surged 11% Friday, after soaring 30% Thursday on news a deal could be imminent. Turns out, it was.</p><p>Among other movers:&amp;nbsp; FTD Cos. shares tumbled 7.6% Monday as the flower-delivery provider filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection; Beyond Meat Inc. shares surged 39% Friday after saying it could break even this year as sales surge; and AT&amp;amp;T shares climbed 1.3% Thursday as the company's WarnerMedia unit abandoned plans for a three-tiered streaming service, instead opting for a single offering.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2019060754653871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W93-FPH1-JDH1-C1SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"979\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Free Daily News Group Inc.

The venue was a hotel in Mumbai, a five-star fortress of foyers and finger food. The guests of honour were politicians. Grey-haired, well-fed executives sat and talked in jargon. It was hard to spot anyone close to India's median age of 26. Things have come a long way since 1981 when Infosys, a bellwether Indian IT firm, was founded in a flat by seven hungry engineers with $250.</p><p>Yet if you walk to the exit of that hotel and reject the option of an expensive limousine, or of hailing a bashed-up street taxi, and instead press \"Book now\" on your phone screen, another Indian tech scene appears. The application links a network of taxis using satellite positioning, cheap Chinese-made smartphones, souped-up Google maps and credit cards. A 6km (4-mile) drive north in a modern car will deliver you to a snack shop, above which is the firm that runs the system. Olacabs was set up in 2010. Its co-founder, Bhavish Aggarwal, is a 26-year-old engineer who has worked for Microsoft in Seattle. He has raised a slug of venture capital, some of it American, and says business is growing at 30% a month. \"When you start you are viewed as a fool,\" he says. \"But if you are worried about that, you're in the wrong line of work.\" His goal is to transform transport in India's congested cities.</p><p>India needs a million Olacabs: start-ups that use technology to overcome everyday problems. The economic benefits would be huge. And in a country with a stuffy business culture, in which commercial and political dynasties are all too common, a technology revolution would be a colossal breath of fresh air. It would help unleash the energy of a generation of young people. But will it happen? </p><p>India has already had one technology revolution. In the 1980s middle-class engineers from a dirt-poor socialist India somehow persuaded Western firms to outsource their back-office functions and bits of their IT operations to the subcontinent. Thus began a three-decade-long boom. </p><p>The revolution fed its children well. Thanks to IT, some 3m Indians now work in well-paid formal jobs of the kind that India needs so badly. Perhaps another 10m knock-on jobs have been created for maids, drivers and the like. Technology services have saved India from bankruptcy\u2014exports were 4% of GDP in 2012, keeping the balance of payments in passable shape. As well as local champions such as Infosys, TCS and Wipro, 750 multinational firms have outsourcing and technology hubs in India. Many perform research and development. The cultural impact of all this has been huge. The best-selling novels of Chetan Bhagat, such as \"One night @ the call center\", record the angst and romances of India's young workers.</p><p>Yet all is not peachy. The IT-services industry is maturing. Other countries are building rival call centres. (Americans find Filipino accents easier to understand.) The gap between Indian and Western technology workers' wages is shrinking, although it will probably not vanish for a decade or more. Rich countries are putting up barriers to stop jobs moving overseas.</p><p>And another thing worries Indian geeks. Their country has so many advantages: the English language, engineers with global experience, a conspicuously successful diaspora in Silicon Valley. Why, then, has it failed to produce a new generation of big tech firms? In contrast to America's constant regeneration, India's champions have spare tyres and grey hair.</p><p>Indian IT has seen several false starts. Between 1998 and 2002 a crowd of dotcom start-ups were born. Most died. In 2006-08 India had a mini-boom in mobile \"value-added-services\" such as ringtones and text-based products. That, too, fizzled out. In 2010-11 venture capitalists lavished cash on weak e-commerce firms, inflating a bubble. About 70% of the 50-odd firms that got funding are now dead or on life support, reckons Allegro, an investment bank in Bangalore. </p><p>The gulf between Indian hype and reality over the past decade is best shown in numbers. One veteran venture capitalist reckons the investments made in \"new-generation\" (ie, excluding IT services) technology firms are worth $5 billion-6 billion today. The largest listed firm has a market capitalisation of $700m. By way of comparison, China's listed internet firms have a combined value of over $100 billion and its e-commerce sales are about 18 times India's. Other emerging economies, such as Russia, Argentina and South Africa, have produced multi-billion-dollar internet champions. During the past decade India has fallen behind. </p><p>Fortunately things are changing. First, the internet is becoming popular. Penetration is just 3-4% of the population, if judged by the number of moderately fast fixed internet lines and smartphones that use 2.5G and 3G services. About two-thirds of these connections are mobile. If you include people who access the web through caf\u00e9s, at work, on friends' computers or through basic phones with small screens, penetration is 10%. Most surfers are young. Many live in provincial towns that the IT revolution has hitherto bypassed.</p><p>That 10% is a big figure in absolute terms\u2014122m people\u2014and it will rise as smartphones get cheaper. (The fixed-line network, largely in state hands, will probably remain hopeless.) Some applications are already popular. Almost half of all reserved train tickets are bought online, saving hundreds of millions of man-hours spent queuing at stations.</p><p>The second change for the better is that the start-up scene now has depth, partly as a result of all those mini-booms and busts. The venture-capital industry, with a mix of local and American firms, is now well developed and capable of writing big cheques. And a new generation of entrepreneurs has emerged, most of whom combine technical skills with global experience. Of the 15 technology-firm founders interviewed by The Economist for this article, 12 have worked in America or for multinationals in India. Unlike the older generation, these tigers do not fear failure. Many boast of their early misadventures, much as Silicon Valley types do. </p><p>Deep Kalra, the founder of Makemytrip, a travel site, previously worked at ABN AMRO, a Dutch bank, and General Electric. He also spent time setting up bowling alleys in India, without much success, and managed to survive the dotcom bust in 2002. Prashant Tandon of Healthkart, an online health store, studied at Stanford University and worked in San Francisco for McKinsey, a consultancy, before returning home. He and his partner's first venture, a network linking doctors and patients, failed. Their second looks healthier. </p><p>What kind of companies are these new entrepreneurs creating? Sandeep Singhal of Nexus, a venture-capital firm, describes India's new tech scene as a mixture of Israel and China. The \"Israeli\" bit involves selling clever innovations to foreigners. It is still fairly small. InMobi, which sells technology and services for advertising on the mobile internet, is unusual in that it broke into other emerging markets, such as Indonesia and South Africa, before cracking America. \"A lot of firms struggle to innovate because the [Indian] market is too small,\" says its founder, Naveen Tewari. They need to look farther afield, adds Mr Tewari, a Harvard and McKinsey alumnus who has become something of a hero for budding entrepreneurs.</p><p>Only a brave few follow this advice. Cloudbyte, for example, makes storage software for use in data centres. It has just moved one of its co-founders to America. \"The market is largely in the US. We want to be a global company with our engineering talent in India,\" says the co-founder still in India, Srivibhavan Balaram. Another firm, Magzter, puts magazine content onto phones. It began with Indian magazines read by the diaspora but now has hundreds of non-Indian titles on board and customers everywhere. Its app has been downloaded 600m times. Its co-founder, Girish Ramdas, holds the under-21 Indian record for 0.22 rifle shooting. He previously ran a poultry farm, then a website about his home city of Chennai, then a film magazine. He spends a lot of time abroad signing up more publishers.</p><p>The \"Chinese\" part of the industry is much bigger. The label refers to local firms that sell to locals, as China's internet giants do. Such firms account for about three-quarters of activity by next-generation Indian tech firms (see table). Some sniff that Indian e-commerce firms are mere copies of Western ones, or that they largely serve the rich. Such gripes miss the mark. The real achievement of India's digital merchants has been to create reliable supply chains and systems in a country where few things work smoothly.</p><p>Flipkart, a leading firm, built its own warehouses and delivery teams. It accepts cash on delivery from customers reluctant to use credit cards. To stock 80% of the books printed in India, it needs to deal with no fewer than 1,000 suppliers, says its co-founder, Sachin Bansal. Even \"marketplace\" sites, which avoid holding inventory, must work hard to make sure suppliers and couriers do what they promise.</p><p>Nor is it true that e-commerce sites cater only to an elite. Kunal Bahl of Snapdeal, an online marketplace, says it gets 60% of its orders from outside the big cities, from people who may have little experience of formal bricks-and-mortar shops (as opposed to informal wood-and-corrugated-iron ones). Bangalore-based Redbus has begun to transform long-distance bus travel by bringing a fragmented market of over 1,000 private coach firms online and centralising ticket sales onto its system. Its 32-year-old boss, Phanindra Sama, the son of a farmer, recalls the early days traipsing round bus depots trying to persuade grizzled operators to sign up. \"It was painful,\" he says. The site spread by word of mouth among young office workers.</p><p>These firms are exciting but still small. All e-commerce sites in India between them had sales of $10 billion in 2012, about four-fifths from travel products such as plane tickets, according to McKinsey. It forecasts that sales will approach $100 billion in the next five years, roughly the same size as the conventional Indian IT industry is today. Most of that growth is expected to come from a surge in the number of people accessing the web on their phones. In this scenario India will bypass the PC era and leapfrog straight to the mobile internet.</p><p>It is at this point that veterans of the telecoms industry chortle. India's 700m mobile subscribers are stingy. Only 5% pay for mobile broadband and only a fifth of those engage in e-commerce, says one network boss. Handsets using Google's Android operating system are available at $100 or less, but their quality is poor. About a fifth of smartphone buyers use them only for voice calls and as a fashion accessory.</p><p>Thrifty customers make profits elusive. Sundar Lakshmanan, an engineer in Bangalore, designed \"Suruk\", a mobile app that checks if your rickshaw driver is ripping you off. It became a media sensation, but he made no money from it. Mr Lakshmanan has now moved away from mobile to set up a travel site called Tripthirsty.</p><p>Yet the mobile internet is spreading. About a quarter of internet traffic in India is now from mobile phones, reckons Rajan Anandan, the head of Google in India. The global figure is 14%, according to StatCounter. E-commerce sites are seeing a shift towards mobile. Flipkart says phones account for 6-7% of sales, most of it from new users. This should reach 20-25% in a year. Hrush Bhatt of Cleartrip, a travel site, reckons 8% of his sales are now from mobile and this will reach 25-30% in a year. \"People underestimate how quickly India will adopt the mobile internet,\" he says. </p><p>Existing e-commerce firms have a head start, but no one knows who will win in the long run. The mobile-network operators, such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone, will probably be \"dumb pipes\" without a big role in content, as they are elsewhere. The most downloaded mobile apps by Indians are foreign, such as WhatsApp, a messaging service, and Facebook. </p><p>Yet in time more India-specific apps may emerge. Some 300km south of Goa on India's balmy west coast is the town of Udupi, where Rohith Bhat runs Robosoft Technologies. It is a big developer of mobile apps globally (mainly for the iPhone) and builds sites for third parties as well. Thus far only a small part of Mr Bhat's business is in India, but he expects that to change. \"In 2013 you'll see some success stories. By 2014 it will be huge.\"</p><p>The hope is that as mobile e-commerce booms, it will boost software and hardware start-ups. Vani Kola, a venture capitalist, says that \"India will never build the next Oracle. We don't have pure science innovation\u2014we're not winning Nobel prizes. But India will develop technologies that could take off around the world, from cheap internet-access systems to payments processes.\" If that happens, the boom would change India and create a new generation of exporters.</p><p>To lead a mobile-internet revolution, India's entrepreneurs must overcome three problems. The first is payments systems. Only about a fifth of Indians have debit or credit cards and those who do are scared of using them online. When they try the process is clunky\u2014a quarter of attempts to pay on the Indian Railways site, probably India's most frequently used, fail. The good news is that regulators are easing the rules for small transactions. Anish Williams quit HSBC to co-found Transerv, a firm that has just launched a pre-paid mobile wallet that can be bought from street vendors and downloaded onto phones. It piggybacks on the credit-card payments system and should make buying online easier. Firms like this could make a big difference.</p><p>The second bottleneck is capital. India's e-commerce industry will need billions of dollars to grow. But local venture-capital firms struggle to write cheques of over $100m. Some fear that foreign investment in e-commerce may fall under the same rules as apply to bricks-and-mortar retailers such as Walmart. These let individual states ban activity.</p><p>The third impediment is India's telecoms sector. Once celebrated, it is indebted, loss-making and fragmented. To blame are a price war, graft and licensing rules that prevent consolidation and roaming. The industry is cutting investment in networks at exactly the wrong time. There are multiple different spectrum and licence charges; big operators pay up to a third of their sales on such levies and on taxes. Telecoms firms are so fed up they refuse to participate in new spectrum auctions.</p><p>One potential saviour is India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, who owns a licence for 4G services and whose secretive firm, Reliance Industries, has the firepower to invest $10 billion. Rival executives think his project is stalling\u2014the spectrum he has is at an unattractive frequency, they think, that requires too many base stations to work well, and will struggle to be compatible with global handset standards. Even if they are wrong, it would be uncomfortable if India's mobile-internet boom relied on a single politically connected tycoon. What India really needs is a complete clean-out of its rotten telecoms bureaucracy. That would help investment to recover.</p><p>Ministers now bask in its reflected glory, but India's outsourcing revolution happened despite the government. All the best firms needed was a little deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s. Once politicians stopped restricting access to global bandwidth and imported computers and cut taxes, these firms were set free. Even today they are unusually self-reliant, educating their own staff and running their own backup power plants.</p><p>A mobile-internet boom, by contrast, will need a more competent state: one that unshackles payments systems, regulates telecoms sensibly and does not throttle everything with red tape. India has all the other ingredients it needs: entrepreneurs brimming with ideas and customers hungry for change.
