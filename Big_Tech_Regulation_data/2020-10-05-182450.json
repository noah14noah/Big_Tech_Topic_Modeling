A deal - which could be the biggest lease in city history - has not been signed. Salesforce - which also leases about two-thirds of the Salesforce Tower - declined to comment.</p><p>Amy Jalili, an Oceanwide spokeswoman, said it is \"committed to completing the project,\" and targeting an opening in 2022.

Ratings agency ICRA said high frequency lead indicators for August suggest a fragmented recovery of the Indian economy is under way. The output of Coal India, motorcycles and rail freight traffic posted a turnaround to show expansion in August after contracting in the previous month, while the pace of contraction in the production of scooters and passenger vehicles, domestic airlines' passenger traffic, port cargo traffic, GST collections, e-way bills issuances and the consumption of ATF and petrol narrowed at a varying rate in August.6 million white-collar jobs loss in Aug... Nearly six million white-collar professionals such as engineers, physicians and teachers lost their jobs in the four months to August as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold, wiping out gains in such employment since 2016, according to CMIE. Over the May-August period, five million industrial workers also found themselves out of work, it said.Japan's Aug CPI fall at fastest pace in 4 years... Japan's core consumer prices fell at their fastest pace in almost four years in August, dragged mostly by government-sponsored discounts for domestic travel aimed at supporting the battered tourism sector. The core CPI, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, fell 0.4 per cent in August from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday.BoE eyes negative interest rates... The Bank of England on Thursday gave its strongest hint yet that negative interest rates could be on the way as the UK economy battles against coronavirus and Brexit headwinds. Following a regular policy meeting, the BoE led by governor Andrew Bailey left its key interest rate at a record low of 0.1 percent amid low inflation and rising unemployment caused by Covid-19 fallout. The central bank also maintained its cash stimulus at \ufffd745 billion, the minutes of its latest meeting showed.Govt stake sale credit negative for PSBs... The proposed divestment of majority government stake in six state-owned banks -- IOB, UCO Bank, BoM, PSB, BoI and Central Bank of India --- that were left out of the merger scheme will be credit negative for them, according to ICRA. The absence of majority sovereign ownership could leave their standalone credit profiles low within the investment grade, ICRA saidIndia laps up record US treasuries... India's holding of US treasuries surged by a record $25.3 billion in just two months as the central bank sought safe-haven assets amid a surge in forex reserves, preventing the rupee from climbing to uncompetitive levels. While the holdings may be safe, the low returns from those investments could crop the RBI's earnings, potentially reducing its payout to the government amid record low interest rates.Govt panel may suggest compound interest relief... The committee headed by former comptroller and auditor general (CAG) Rajiv Mehrishi may suggest some relief on compound interest payments during the six-month loan moratorium that ended August 31, ET reported quoting sources. It's also likely to point out that the burden of any relief cannot be put on bank balance sheets or depositors, as they are also victims of the pandemic, the report said.Sebi orders uniform NAV rule... Sebi has asked mutual funds to uniformly apply NAV across schemes upon realisation of funds. The markets regulator also tightened rules on the processes that fund managers follow to buy shares. The new rules will become effective from January 1. Currently, mutual fund investors with cheque values of less than Rs 2 lakh per application get the NAV of the product on the same day of deposit, but those who invest more than Rs 2 lakh get the NAV of the day the fund house realised the cheque.

The index closed below the 10,900 level and now has support at its 200-day moving average at 10,858. Analysts said a failure to hold above this level could drag Nifty50 towards the 10,700 mark. Defending it would be key for Nifty to move back to the 11,000-11,080 range, they said.Asian shares gain up to 1%Japan's Nikkei 225 index was up 0.98 percent or 218.00 points at 22,413.38 in early trade, while the broader Topix index advanced 1.18 percent of 17.94 points to 1,540.58.

India's manufacturing activity contracted at a faster pace in July after showing some recovery in June, as localised lockdowns by state governments took their toll on business activity. The IHS Markit India Manufacturing PMI dropped to 46 in July from 47.2 in June, pointing to a \"marked deterioration in business conditions across the Indian manufacturing sector\", to which firms responded by cutting both staff numbers and purchasing activity, IHS Markit said in its report. A reading below 50 is an indicator of contraction, while one above that shows expansion.India Inc continues to borrow overseas... Indian companies continued to borrow overseas after the Covid-19 outbreak, taking advantage of cheaper finance, while lending by local banks shrank, prompting some economists to call for interest rates to be lowered further to help revive local demand. Companies raised $3.5 billion (Rs 26,320 crore) in external commercial borrowings in April-June, as per RBI data. This amount was equivalent to almost 30% of ECBs taken in the year-ago period.SBI study shows strong case for lifting moratorium... A study by SBI shows healthy companies are availing of the moratorium facility to conserve cash amid the current uncertainty and thus there is a strong case for ending the EMI holiday on loans. An analysis on over 300 companies having a total debt of Rs 4 lakh crore shows at least 40 per cent of the loans under moratorium are in sectors having a comfortable debt-equity ratio. The companies in the sample span sectors pharma, FMCG, chemicals, healthcare, consumer durables and automotive.Gold traders stop selling on credit... Traders at Mumbai's Zaveri Bazaar, reeling under sales depleted by the Covid-19 pandemic and rising gold prices, have stopped selling jewellery against credit to the retail jewellers. They are insisting that retailers pay upfront for their jewellery taken during the pre-Covid period or return them if they fail to pay. Retailers have already returned a lot of gold jewellery to the manufacturers, who are melting these into bars and selling in the market. They are using this money to reduce the interest cost on bank borrowing. In the process, import of gold is also coming down.Mauritius regulatory vigil haunts NRIs... Several Mauritius-based funds managed by NRIs are a worried lot as heightened scrutiny of such investment vehicles by the island nation's securities regulator has raised concerns whether they would be able to comply with the new overseas investors norms in India before the year-end deadline. Lawyers and consultants handling the compliance matters of these investors said the market regulator of Mauritius has been slow in giving permissions to several NRI-controlled funds that are investing in India through the African country.Banks may drag Sintex, some NBFCs to IBC... Lenders are set to initiate insolvency proceedings against Sintex Industries. They will also initiate the proceedings against NBFCs Religare Finvest, Reliance Home Finance and Reliance Commercial, and will seek permission from RBI for the same. The move to initiate insolvency proceedings follows the expiry of the six-month deadline for resolving the default in respect of these companies.Global manufacturers seek single-window clearance... Global manufacturers such as Foxconn, Samsung, Wistron and Yazaki have raised concerns over the process of getting permission for industrial projects in India, involving multiple clearances and long response times, underscoring the need for an effective single-window system to attract big investments.

Technology companies also took heavy losses, with Apple shedding 1 percent on the day that the iPhone seller kicked off its annual software showcase. Amazon, meanwhile, fell 4.6 percent as it led a slide in consumer discretionary stocks. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Investors were reacting to media reports suggesting that government regulators are setting the stage for potential antitrust probes into each of the four technology giants.</p><p>  The sell-off knocked the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index into a correction, Wall Street speak for a drop of 10 percent or more from a peak. The Nasdaq hit its most recent all-time high early last month, before the trade dispute between the United States and China escalated, setting off a monthlong slide.</p><p>  ''We do have this trade uncertainty, and we now have some uncertainty with tech companies and government regulations,'' said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior markets strategist at Voya Investment Management. ''These are the go-to big names, and if they're vulnerable, that just makes investors a little bit nervous.''</p><p>  The S&amp;P 500 index fell 7.61 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,744.45. The Dow Jones industrial average added 4.74 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 24,819.78.</p><p>  The Nasdaq composite lost 120.13 points, or 1.6 percent, to 7,333.02.

Microsoft dropped 3.1 percent and Twitter slid 5.5 percent. The losses outweighed gains in household goods makers, banks and elsewhere in the market.</p><p>  Companies in the S&amp;P 500 performed better than expected in the first quarter, posting less than a half-percentage point contraction in profit, according to Factset. But, the trade war continues hanging over the current quarter, with analysts expecting a 2 percent contraction in profit.</p><p>  Bond prices climbed again Monday, pulling the yield on the 10-year Treasury note down to 2.07 percent from 2.14 percent late Friday.</p><p>  News of deals, confirmed and denied, drove movement for several stocks.</p><p>Centene slid 10.3 percent after Humana declined to make a buyout proposal. Both insurance companies focus heavily on government-sponsored plans, including Medicare and Medicaid. Humana made clear that it is not seeking Centene in a rare filing aimed at quashing investor speculation. Humana shares rose 2.2 percent.</p><p>  Energy futures closed broadly lower Monday. Benchmark United States crude slid 0.5 percent to settle at $53.25 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, closed 1.1 percent lower, at $61.28 per barrel.</p><p>  Wholesale gasoline fell 1.7 percent to $1.74 per gallon. Heating oil dropped 1.8 percent to $1.81 per gallon. Natural gas gave up 2.1 percent to $2.40 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p><p>  Gold gained 1.3 percent to $1,327.90 per ounce, silver added 1.2 percent to $14.74 per ounce and copper fell 0.4 percent to $2.65 per pound.</p><p>  The dollar fell to 108.02 Japanese yen from 108.41 yen on Friday.

But journalists have conveniently dropped the nagging when it cameto reporting on left-wing funded racial protests[1]. But CNN's not even denying their double standards, anymore.After getting owned[2] by Trump's campaign manager Tim Murtaugh last night on Erin Burnett OutFront, CNN journalists tried to save face Thursday morning by justifying their hypocritical coverage of Trump rallies vs. Black Lives Matter protests.CNN Newsroom, co-host Poppy Harlow and Jim Sciutto asked CNN medical analyst, and former Planned Parenthood president Leana Wen to explain \"her take\" of why BLM protests are actually safer from coronavirus than Trump rallies. (The science knows!)Wen argued most people wore masks at protests because they believed in the science, unlike Trump rallygoers, who \"go in defiance.\" </p><p>(So people protesting aren't going \"in defiance\" of COVID lockdowns, curfews and social distancing regulations?) It does not care why it is that people are gathering but it does care about the conditions under which they're gathering, so outdoors much safer than indoors and wearing masks obviously much safer than not wearing masks and I would also in this case would distinguish between the behavior of the participants while at protests versus rallies. At protests many people are aware of the risks and doing everything they can to reduce that risk versus at many of the rallies we are seeing people going in defiance. It's their behavior during those events. I also worry about what they do after the events. They may not be self-quarantining and testing as then getting tested as they should be. Sciutto then played dumb to ask Wen, have outdoor protests led to outbreaks like Trump rallies have? Wen happily confirmed the leading question, citing just one study from June.'[T]here have not been surges of infections that have been tied. There was a study looking at over 300 cities where protests have heard and they did not find surges of infections tied to the protests,' she noted. Brianna Keilar touted this study on June 25th's CNN Newsroom and it's on CNN's website[3] but Sciutto pretendedlike it wasnew and updated information.Still, Sciutto thanked his guest for 'breaking through the fog of confusion and disinformation to lead us back to the facts' to end the sanctimonious segment.Even Wen's points are contradicted by CNN's own reporting. CNN has bashed outdoor church gatherings[4] several times. Trump was holding outdoor rallies this Summer and yet CNN still smeared them super spreader events. They didn't talk this way about the BLM protests.In fact, just last week on September 11's New Day, CNN political analyst David Gregory defended BLM protests in a pandemic because, he claimed, most people 'wore masks' and understood how 'important' it was.What CNN correspondent Boris Sanchez said on August 28, reporting from the March on Washington was even worse. Despite tens of thousands of protesters packed tightly to listen to speakers, somewithout masks, Sanchez told Anderson Cooper that protesting was worth being exposed to the virus.'The concern is with so many people in such an enclosed space, it may be impossible to avoid this virus. What I've heard, speaking to demonstrators, is essentially the message of social justice outweighs any of the risks from this pandemic. It's that important to them,' he boasted. Many would argue going to church, getting married or burying a loved one is very important to them too, but CNN only shows contempt for those people.Not once did CNN mention that Wen was the former president of the largest abortion mill in the country, which was spending 45 million dollars to support Democrats this year[5]. Instead, CNN deliberately ignored that role to highlight her less notable titles. They have a bad reputation for hiding this important context[6] from their viewers which certainly undermines Wen's supposed neutrality as a medical expert.Vicks[7] and Humira[8] paid for this pro-BLM and pro-Biden propaganda segment.

I read it last night and I want to ask you about it because we have had a number of partisans and even Jared Kushner from the White House talking to Wolf about this on Tuesday, the Trump campaign communication director Tim Murtaugh talking about the impact of the indoor rallies versus the outdoor protests for the Black Lives Matter movement. Listen to this from Mr. Murtaugh:MURTAUGH: If people can protest in the streets by the tens of thousands, if people can riot if people can gamble in the casinos then certainly they can gather peacefully under the First Amendment to hear from the President of the United States.HARLOW: I hear the casino point, but to the protests outside versus indoor rallies, what is your take?LEANA WEN: I think it's important for us as public health experts to lead with the science. And the science tells us that this is a virus that does not discriminate. It does not care why it is that people are gathering but it does care about the conditions under which they're gathering, so outdoors much safer than indoors and wearing masks obviously much safer than not wearing masks and I would also in this case would distinguish between the behavior of the participants while at protests versus rallies. At protests many people are aware of the risks and doing everything they can to reduce that risk versus at many of the rallies we are seeing people going in defiance. It's their behavior during those events. I also worry about what they do after the events. They may not be self-quarantining and testing as then getting tested as they should be.SCIUTTO: Dr. Wen, just very quickly, We have seen some data that shows that indoor events have led to the outbreak, whether it's a Trump rally or a wedding. We're going to be talking about that later, a wedding in Maine? What has the data shown us about outdoor events? Have there been any super spreader events tied to protests?WEN: Of course there are infections and outdoor protests with a lot of people still have risk of transmission and ideally should not happen in the middle of the pandemic either. But the -- but there have not been surges of infections that have been tied. There was a study looking at over 300 cities where protests have heard and they did not find surges of infections tied to the protests.SCIUTTO: Understood. Dr. Leana Wen, thanks for breaking through the fog of confusion and disinformation to lead us back to the facts.

These data were used to create misleading targeted advertisements in the 2016 presidential election; authorities followed a paper trail leading back to Russia. Consequently, Facebook found itself at the center of an intense national debate over user privacy and the sanctity of American elections. Washington has been scrutinizing tech companies with laser focus. The Federal Trade Commission subjected Facebook to a $5 billion fine, states across the country have opened antitrust investigations into its business dealings and lawmakers around the world are demanding that CEO Mark Zuckerberg testify about the scandal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Congressional effort to regulate firms like Facebook is necessary to safeguard citizen privacy and democratic elections. Though these tech giants claim that they can police their own platforms, we cannot rely on them to do so. Facebook's business model itself depends on the abuse of user data. The federal government needs to act decisively to create a framework to govern tech companies' collection,\u00a0 distribution and monetization of personal information.</p><p>Internet behemoths like Google and Facebook have always had a complicated relationship with the confidentiality of user data. Faced with controversies over privacy, these corporations have tried to save face with vows to self-regulate. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey promised \"independently vetted ... metrics to measure the help of public conversation on Twitter.\" What he actually means by this is unclear, and that is likely intentional.</p><p>For proof, take a look at the business strategies that tech companies are employing. They collect detailed data on the billions of people who use their platforms, in the form of search histories, purchases, media preferences and more. These data are essentially treasure-troves for political campaigns, retailers and other entities that rely on marketing. They contact a company like Twitter, define a target audience - Lululemon, for instance, would probably be on the lookout for wealthy, health-conscious athletes - and the internet does the rest. This business model accounts for 87 percent of Google's total revenue and 89 percent of Facebook's.</p><p>Citizens don't seem poised to push for change, either. Seventy-four percent of Facebook users don't even realize that the site collects their data in the first place. This means that Congress must be proactive in protecting Americans from such data harvesting. Just as we cannot expect cigarette companies to impose an excise tax on themselves, we should not count on tech giants to adequately safeguard user privacy.</p><p>Big tech has also failed in protecting democracy itself. This is especially worrisome in a world where social networks facilitate the vast majority of political discourse. Throughout the 2016 election cycle, internet giants took advantage of a laggard regulatory environment to profit off of the motives of foreign actors. For example, Facebook sold about $100,000 dollars of ad space to firms servicing the Russian government. Russia-linked advertising was seen by an estimated 126 million Americans.</p><p>The Federal Election Commission has been slow to draw clear boundaries on what is and isn't required of small digital political ads - for instance, whether tech companies must publicly disclose who purchased ad space - leaving social media companies with little to no oversight. That would explain why Twitter and Facebook didn't think twice before accepting huge sums of money from Russian-backed organizations, which spread advertisements that consistently used false and misleading information to sway our election.</p><p>And once again, Facebook's leadership succumbed to its profit motive. It should have been a red flag for Facebook when a series of overseas corporations purchased ad space in rubles (Russia's currency). But to Facebook, cash was cash - dollars or not. In the absence of government oversight, it had no reason to put the sanctity of our elections before cold, hard profit.</p><p>The government cannot and should not halt the development of technology itself. But just as it has regulated other media - from phones to TV - it must take a stand in this new technological frontier. Our privacy and democracy hang in the balance.</p><p>Arjun Shanmugam '23 can be reached at\u00a0<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:arjun_shanmugam@brown.edu\">arjun_shanmugam@brown.edu</email> Please send responses to this opinion to\u00a0<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:letters@browndailyherald.com\">letters@browndailyherald.com</email>\u00a0and op-eds to\u00a0<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:opinions@browndailyherald.com\">opinions@browndailyherald.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4300679</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBK-J141-DY7P-T3BC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Brown Daily Herald: Brown University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 24, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009SRF</classCode><className>LULULEMON ATHLETICA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The White Paper on Artificial Intelligence[2] (AI) and the European data strategy[3] presented today (19 February) show that Europe can set global standards on technological development while putting people first.  Europe as the global leader of the digital transformation  Digital technologies considerably improve our lives, from better access to knowledge and content to how we do business, communicate or buy goods and services. </p><p>The EU must ensure that the digital transformation works for the benefit of all people, not just a few. Citizens should have the opportunity to flourish, choose freely, engage in society and at the same time feel safe online. Businesses should benefit from a framework that allows them to start up, scale up, pool data, innovate and compete with large companies on fair terms. Society should benefit from social and environmental sustainability, and a secure digital environment that respects privacy, dignity, integrity and other rights in full transparency. What does the strategy say? Over the next five years, the Commission will focus on three key objectives to promote technological solutions that will help Europe pursue its own way towards a digital transformation that works for the benefit of people and respects our fundamental values: Technology that works for people; a fair and competitive economy, and; an open, democratic and sustainable society. The EU's digital strategy indicates the path that Europe needs to take to pursue its own way: a digital Europe that reflects the best of Europe. And it defines an ambitious approach towards digital technological development, as well as how technology will be used to meet our climate-neutrality objectives. The White Paper on Artificial Intelligence and the European data strategy are the first pillars of the new digital strategy of the Commission. They are fully aligned with the need to put people first in developing technology, as well as with the need to defend and promote European values and rights in how we design, make and deploy technology in the real economy and how we improve the services of the public sector towards the citizens. How will the EU fund the proposals on AI and data? The required investments will be channelled from the Digital Europe programme[4] (DEP), the Connecting Europe Facility 2[5] and Horizon Europe[6]. For Horizon Europe, the Commission proposed to invest \u20ac15 billion in the 'Digital, Industry and Space' cluster, with AI as a key activity to be supported. As part of DEP, the European Commission proposed to invest almost \u20ac2.5bn in deploying data platforms and AI applications. Out of these, \u20ac2bn could be invested into a European High Impact project on European data spaces, including trustworthy and energy efficient data sharing and cloud infrastructures.The DEP will also support national authorities in making high value data sets available for re-use in different common data spaces. How can technology support the European Green Deal?  Digital technologies are a critical enabler for the Green Deal, the EU's new growth strategy to become the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050. For example, they can increase energy efficiency by tracking when and where electricity is most needed. Smart heating could help us save the equivalent of 6 million tonnes of oil, and farmers will be able to use fewer pesticides and fertilisers thanks to data and AI. However, for digitalisation to deliver its benefits, the ICT sector needs to undergo its own green transformation. Data centres and telecommunications need to become more energy efficient, use more renewable sources and should become climate neutral by 2030. How does Europe work for an open global digital economy and society? The Commission can leverage regulatory power, stronger economic and technological capabilities, diplomatic strengths and external financial instruments to advance the European approach and shape the global frameworks. This is the case for work done under association agreements and trade agreements. Europe must now lead the standardisation process of the new generation of technology, i.e. on blockchain, high-performance and quantum computing, AI and tools for data sharing and usage. The European Union is and will remain the most open region for trade and investment in the world, but this is not unconditional. Everyone can access the European market as long as they accept and respect our rules. The Commission will continue to address unjustified restrictions for European companies in third countries, such as data localisation requirements, and pursue ambitious goals in terms of markets access, research and development and standardization programmes. Europe as a leader in human-centric Artificial Intelligence Why does the Commission present a White Paper on Artificial Intelligence? The White Paper on Artificial Intelligence sets out the Commission's proposals to promote the development of AI in Europe whilst ensuring respect of fundamental rights. AI is developing fast, which is why Europe needs to maintain and increase its level of investment. At the same time, AI entails a number of potential risks that need to be addressed. The White Paper[7] sets out options to maximise the benefits and address the challenges of AI, and invites comments on these options by stakeholders. What is the Commission's approach on Artificial Intelligence? In the White Paper, the Commission is taking a balanced approach, based on excellence and trust. To achieve an ecosystem of excellence, the Commission proposes to streamline research, foster collaboration between Member States and increase investment into AI development and deployment. These actions build on the Coordinated Plan on AI[8] with member states of December 2018. To achieve an ecosystem of trust, the Commission presents options on creating a legal framework that addresses the risks for fundamental rights and safety. This builds on the work of the High-Level Expert Group on artificial intelligence[9], in particular the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI[10], which were tested by companies in late 2019. A legal framework should be principles-based and focus on high-risk AI systems in order to avoid unnecessary burden for companies to innovate. How will the EU ensure compliance with fundamental rights? A human-centric approach means ensuring that AI systems are developed and used in a way that respects EU law and fundamental rights. For example, biases in algorithms or training data used for recruitment AI systems could lead to unjust and discriminatory outcomes, which would be illegal under EU non-discrimination laws. It is important to prevent breaches of fundamental rights and if they occur, to ensure that those breaches can be addressed by national authorities. High-risk AI systems need to be certified, tested and controlled, as cars, cosmetics, and toys are. For other AI systems, the Commission proposes voluntary labelling in case defined standards are respected. All AI systems and algorithms are welcome in the European market as long as they comply with EU rules. What is facial recognition?  Facial recognition can takedifferent forms. It can be used for user authentication i.e. to unlock a smartphone or for verification/ authentication at border crossings to check a person's identity against his/her travel documents (one-to-one matching). Facial recognition could also be used for remote biometric identification, where an image of a person is checked against a database (one-to-many matching). This is the most intrusive form of facial recognition and in principle prohibited in the EU. Will the EU regulate facial recognition for remote identification? The gathering and use of biometric data for remote identification purposes carries specific risks for fundamental rights. EU data protection rules already prohibit in principle the processing of biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, except under specific conditions. Specifically, remote biometric identification can only take place for reasons of substantial public interest. It must be based on EU or national law, the use has to be duly justified, proportionate and subject to adequate safeguards. Hence, allowing facial recognition is currently the exception. With the AI White Paper, the Commission wants to launch a broad debate on which circumstances might justify exceptions in the future, if any. What about victims or damage caused by AI? There is no need to completely re-write liability rules at EU or national level. The Commission is inviting opinions on how best to ensure that safety remains at a high standard and that potential victims do not face more difficulties to get compensation compared to victims of traditional products and services. A secure and dynamic single market for data Why does the EU need a data strategy?  Data is the basis of different waves of innovation. The way that we organize data access and reuse will determine our future innovation capacity. While currently a small number of big tech firms hold a large part of the world's data, huge opportunities lie ahead for Europe. Rapidly increasing amounts of data will be generated in the next years and storage shifts from the cloud to the edge. The EU can build on a strong legal framework in data protection, fundamental rights, safety and cyber-security; its internal market; and a large degree of interconnection in public services. Citizens, businesses and organizations should be empowered to make better decisions based on insights gleaned from non-personal data. That data should be available to all, whether public or private, start-up or giant. The European data strategy[11] presented today aims to enhance the use of data, which will bring enormous benefits to citizens and businesses. It will enable the development of new products and services and will lead to productivity gains and resource efficiency for businesses and better services provided by the public sector. It can for example help develop personalised medicine for patients, improve mobility for commuters or contribute to Europe becoming the first climate neutral continent by 2050. What is the aim of the data strategy? The aim of the strategy is to create a genuine single market for data, where personal and non-personal data, including confidential and sensitive data, are secure and where businesses and the public sector have easy access to huge amounts of high quality data to create and innovate. It will be a space where all data-driven products and services fully respect EU rules and values. This will ensure Europe's technological sovereignty in a globalised world and unlock the enormous potential of new technologies like AI. How does the data strategy relate to the General Data Protection Regulation? Every day, people generate ever-increasing amounts of data through their daily activities. Its collection and reuse need to respect the rights and interests of the people first, in line with European values and rules. With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU has laid down a solid basis for a human-centric data economy by ensuring that individuals remain in full control of their data. This has made the EU a source of inspiration for the protection of privacy in many countries worldwide. At the same time, individuals could benefit from technical tools and standards that make the exercise of their rights, in particular their right to data portability, simple and easy. This would also enable novel data flows, protect consumers and foster competition. The data strategy presented today will empower people to have a stronger say on who can access the data they generate, including personal IoT data, and how it is used through personal data spaces. This could, for example, be supported by having stricter requirements on interfaces for real-time data access or by guaranteeing the neutrality of personal data spaces. How can even more data be made available for reuse? The legislative framework proposed in the data strategy would reinforce essential data governance structures and mechanisms in Member States and at the EU level to make more data available for reuse, with full respect of the data protection legislation. This would help to prioritise standards and a more harmonised datasets to foster data interoperability within and across sectors; facilitate the access to and reuse of sensitive data such as health or social data for scientific research purposes (including for AI), in compliance with data protection legislation; help people make their data available for the common good for researchers to innovate for the benefit of society. How will data be used in a way that benefits EU citizens? Data can give insights that help combat emergencies, such as floods and wildfires, make our cities greener and cleaner, help people live longer and healthier lives. The existing Open Data Directive[12] already makes vast amounts of data available for reuse for the benefit of society. Business-to-government data sharing can be a game-changer for providing general welfare in the EU. The strategy on data intends to make more privately and publicly held data available by opening up public sector datasets of high commercial and societal value, such as environmental data and earth observation data; facilitating the use of publicly held sensitive data for scientific research and for the common good; exploring the creation of EU-wide legislation on the use of private sector data by the public sector for the common good. How will the European data strategy help businesses? Access to data is crucial to ensure competition and to create new business opportunities for smaller and larger firms. Companies need common standards and clear rules on how data transfers should take place. This also requires investments in new technologies and infrastructures so that data is the basis of future innovative products, services and improved efficiency. Businesses should also be free to decide to whom and under what conditions access can be granted to their non-personal data. The Commission already started to address this problem with non-binding guidelines on businesses-to-business data sharing, which aimed to create fair and open markets for IoT-generated data. Finally, the Commission envisages to propose a 'Data Act' to look at different types of data sharing scenarios and ways to empower individuals so that they become more involved in the data economy. How can data contribute to the common good? Data can give insights that help combat emergencies, such as floods and wildfires, make our cities greener and cleaner, and help people live longer and healthier in a secure environment. The existing Open Data Directive[13] already make vast amounts of data available for reuse for the benefit of society. There are, however, some valuable but highly sensitive datasets gathered by some public institutions, falling outside the scope of that Directive, which could be reused for the common good under some strict conditions. For example, the reuse of publicly held health records or social data could help develop personalised medicine or advance research to find cures for specific diseases. Companies also collect huge amounts of data useful to society. If the public sector could access and reuse certain private sector data, it would be able to improve public services and policies. What are the next steps? The Commission will present later this year further measures, such as a Digital Services Act to establish clear rules for all businesses to access the Single Market, to strengthen the responsibility of online platforms and to protect fundamental rights. It will also propose a review of the eIDAS regulation, allowing for a secure electronic identity that puts people in control of the data they share online. Furthermore, the EU will put a strong emphasis on cybersecurity by promoting cooperation through a Joint Cyber Unit that protects critical European infrastructure and strengthens the cybersecurity single market. Finally, Europe will continue to build alliances with global partners, leveraging its regulatory power, capacity building, diplomacy and finance to promote the European digitalisation model internationally. The White Paper on Artificial Intelligence is open for public consultation[14] until 19 May 2020. The Commission is also gathering feedback on the data strategy[15]. Based on the input received, the Commission is planning to take further action to support the development of trustworthy AI and a data-agile economy.

In terms of live folios, UTI AMC accounts for 12.2% of the 89.7mn industry folios as of March 31, 2020.Over the past five years (FY15-20), equity AUM for the Indian MF industry has increased 2.7x from 3.24 lakh cr to 9 lakh cr.   Outlook &amp; Valuation:  At the upper end of the IPO price band, it is offered at 25.4x its FY20 earnings and 5.25% of Q1FY21 QAAUM, demanding 7,024cr market cap, which we believe is reasonable; listed peers like HDFC AMC trades at 35x FY20 earnings and Nippon AMC trades at 37x FY20 earnings. Additionally, HDFC and Nippon AMC trade at 12.56% and 8.55% of Q1FY21 QAAUM, respectively. Considering attractive valuation, huge growth potential of MF industry, asset-light business and higher dividend payout ratio, we are positive on this IPO and rate it as SUBSCRIBE.\"   2. 24 PM: Market update   The 30-share BSE benchmark Sensex traded 550 points higher at 37,938, while Nifty gained 165 points to trade at 11,215.   2. 19 PM: Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders IPO   Angel Broking, on its report on Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders IPO  said,\"Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd (MDSL) is India's leading defence public sector undertaking shipyard under the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Mazagon Dock is primarily engaged in constructing and repairing warships and submarines for MoD and other types of vessels i.e. cargo ships, multipurpose support vessels, barges and border outposts, tugs, dredgers, water tankers, etc. for commercial clients. Outlook &amp; Valuation: In terms of valuations, the pre-issue P/E works out to 6.1x FY20 earnings (at the upper end of the issue price band), which is lower vs. peers like Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Cochin Shipyard (trading at 12.2x and 6.6x of its FY20 earnings, respectively). Further, MDSL has a healthy ROE of ~16% coupled with highest dividend yield (7.4%) and higher cash on balance sheet among its peers. Hence, considering the above positive factors, we recommend SUBSCRIBE to the issue with a long-term horizon.\"   2.02 PM : NTPC shares gains over 4%   NTPC share price was trading 4% higher on Monday's opening session after brokerage CLSA maintained a buy call on the stock with a target of Rs 140 per share.

That streak may be coming to an end. On Monday, Alphabet said revenue in its most recent quarter increased 17% from the same period last year, to $36.3 billion. </p><p>That was about $1 billion short of Wall Street's expectations. The Silicon Valley company's revenue had grown more than 20% every quarter since 2016. The law of large numbers is simple: As a company gets bigger, it becomes difficult to find new ways to make money and maintain rapid growth. The issue has dogged other big tech companies like Apple in recent years. Alphabet explained the revenue shortfall with a very big-company answer. It said the strong United States dollar dented revenue by $1.2 billion. Google executives rattled off a long list of currencies weakening against the dollar, including the euro, the British pound, Brazilian real and Indian rupee. The company said it expected foreign currency to be an issue again in the current quarter. Shares of Alphabet fell about 7% in after-hours trading. In a conference call with Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, and Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, analysts tried to find another explanation for the revenue shortfall with little success. AdvertisingThey asked about seasonal patterns in search advertisements. They asked about a slowdown in growth on clicks on ads placed on Google and YouTube. They asked about 'go-to-market strategies.' 'I guess I'll beat the dead horse on the revenue deceleration,' said Ross Sandler, an analyst at Barclays who follows the company. He asked whether there was an issue in Asia, where revenue grew 1% from the previous quarter. But Porat and Pichai did not offer much detail. Alphabet does not employ a quarter-by-quarter strategy, they said, and it invests for the long term. Alphabet said clicks on advertisements on sites like Google and YouTube grew 39% \u2014 a notch below increases of 50% to 60% in recent quarters. Porat said the rate at which consumers are clicking on YouTube ads is not increasing as fast as before. Concern about 17% growth \u2014 Wall Street had estimated a 19% increase \u2014 was a shift from usual scrutiny of how well Alphabet keeps its spending under control. But not all analysts were wringing their hands. 'So long as they're growing, I don't have a problem with the rate being 17% versus 19%,' Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in an email. 'We're all just guessing at growth rates, and to be honest, currency explains it all.' AdvertisingNet profit fell 29% during the quarter to $6.7 billion, from $9.4 billion a year earlier. In March, the European Union levied a 1.5 billion-euro fine against Google. The fine, worth about $1.7 billion, hit Alphabet's bottom line. Google has not paid it yet, but it sets aside the money from its earnings as a one-time expense. The company also noted that it had a large, one-time tax gain in the first quarter of 2018, inflating the figures from last year. It was the third penalty handed down by European authorities since 2017, totaling 8.2 billion euros in fines. Europe has also demanded that Google adjust some of its business practices to fall in line with European law.Alphabet is not the only company feeling the sting of regulators. Last week, Facebook announced that it was setting aside up to $5 billion for potential fines from the Federal Trade Commission for consumer privacy violations. Neither fine is financially significant to companies of Alphabet and Facebook's magnitude. Facebook's share price surged after the announcement because investors had worried the fine could be bigger.

The US reported more than 47,000 new coronavirus cases, the smallest daily increase in almost four weeks, after posting a record number of new infections in the month of July.</p><p>New data showed U.S. manufacturing activity grew in July, a sign that the sector is recovering after the COVID-19 pandemic forced much of the US economy to an abrupt halt. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index rose to 54.2 last month, from 52.6 in June. Economists had expected the reading to come in at 53.8. Anything above 50 represents an expansion in activity.</p><p>Overseas stocks rose after similar data pointed to a manufacturing recovery. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 2.1 per cent, its biggest gain in more than a month, bolstered by survey data showing signs of recovery in euro area factories.

Shanghai's main index was 0.57 percent lower at midday while Shenzhen's was down 0.87 percent. </p><p>The tech board was announced in November by President Xi Jinping as a battle with the United States for technological supremacy heated up.</p><p>Xi has called on China's tech leaders to become global champions, while the US has fought back in part by taking steps to clip the wings of Chinese telecom giant Huawei.</p><p>When big tech companies list overseas, the government in Beijing loses influence over their fundraising and Chinese investors cannot share in those companies' success due to restrictions on purchasing overseas-listed shares.</p><p>China realised it needed to loosen up.</p><p>\"If China didn't launch this new tech board now, it would miss the chance to transform its economic development into this 'new economy' mode,\" said Yang Delong, chief economist at First Seafront Fund.</p><p>But there are concerns that the new board could siphon liquidity from China's main markets, already pressured by slowing economic growth and the US trade war.</p><p>As a result, analysts believe regulators will take a measured pace in growing the tech board.</p><p>\"The (main) markets are in a downturn now and if giant companies list on the tech board initially, market capital will be diverted. The market cannot bear that,\" said Yang.</p><p>\"The new board won't drain too much from the main boards.\"</p><p>llc-dma/dan</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFP-Shares blast off as 'China's Nasdaq' debuts </dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMP-DXW1-JBV1-X1S9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><timeReceived>5:29 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Agence France Presse All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20278\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 22, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Shanghai's main index was 0.57% lower at midday while Shenzhen's was down 0.87%.</p><p>The tech board was announced in November by President Xi Jinping as a battle with the US for technological supremacy heated up.</p><p>Xi has called on China's tech leaders to become global champions, while the US has fought back in part by taking steps to clip the wings of Chinese telecom giant Huawei.</p><p>When big tech companies list overseas, the government in Beijing loses influence over their fundraising and Chinese investors cannot share in those companies' success due to restrictions on purchasing overseas-listed shares.</p><p>China realised it needed to loosen up.</p><p>\"If China didn't launch this new tech board now, it would miss the chance to transform its economic development into this 'new economy' mode,\" said Yang Delong, chief economist at First Seafront Fund.</p><p>But there are concerns that the new board could siphon liquidity from China's main markets, already pressured by slowing economic growth and the US trade war.</p><p>As a result, analysts believe regulators will take a measured pace in growing the tech board.</p><p>\"The (main) markets are in a downturn now and if giant companies list on the tech board initially, market capital will be diverted.

Shanghai's main index was 0.57% lower at midday while Shenzhen's was down 0.87%.</p><p>The tech board was announced in November by President Xi Jinping as a battle with the US for technological supremacy heated up.</p><p>Xi has called on China's tech leaders to become global champions, while the US has fought back in part by taking steps to clip the wings of Chinese telecom giant Huawei.</p><p>When big tech companies list overseas, the government in Beijing loses influence over their fundraising and Chinese investors cannot share in those companies' success due to restrictions on purchasing overseas-listed shares.</p><p>China realised it needed to loosen up.</p><p>\"If China didn't launch this new tech board now, it would miss the chance to transform its economic development into this 'new economy' mode,\" said Yang Delong, chief economist at First Seafront Fund.</p><p>But there are concerns that the new board could siphon liquidity from China's main markets, already pressured by slowing economic growth and the US trade war.</p><p>As a result, analysts believe regulators will take a measured pace in growing the tech board.</p><p>\"The (main) markets are in a downturn now and if giant companies list on the tech board initially, market capital will be diverted. The market cannot bear that,\" said Yang.</p><p>\"The new board won't drain too much from the main boards.\"</p><p>By Lianchao Lan </p><p>source: Agence France-Presse</p><p>Copyright 2019 Alliance News Limited.

The health crisis is still bubbling away in the background. South Africa and Mexico have seen a jump in the number of coronavirus cases.There is talk that Germany will introduce new measures for fear of a second wave. The Australian state of Victoria has declared a state of emergency, and there are fears that other parts of the world will re-introduce tough restrictions too. US-China relations are under strain again as there is talk that President Trump will take a tough stance on some tech companies that are backed by the Chinese government.EU Equities Overview: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/08/03/factories-lead-recovery-orders-return-growth/\">https://t.co/uSuwAuHfkb</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/08/03/factories-lead-recovery-orders-return-growth/\">$DAX</url> 12646.98 (+2.71%)<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/08/03/factories-lead-recovery-orders-return-growth/\">$FTSE</url> 6032.85 (+2.29%)<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/08/03/factories-lead-recovery-orders-return-growth/\">$CAC</url> 4875.93 (+1.93%)$N100 971.31 (+1.79%)<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/08/03/factories-lead-recovery-orders-return-growth/\">$TECDAX</url> 3056.43 (+1.71%)$BEL20 3322.99 (+1.52%)<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/08/03/factories-lead-recovery-orders-return-growth/\">#indices</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/08/03/factories-lead-recovery-orders-return-growth/\">#equities</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/08/03/factories-lead-recovery-orders-return-growth/\">#stocks</url>- Techniquant (@techniquant) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/08/03/factories-lead-recovery-orders-return-growth/\">August 3, 2020</url>03 Aug 2020-02:39PM BSTUS stocks gain at the open Wall Street has started the week in the green with tech stocks leading the rally. 03 Aug 2020-01:46PM BSTNon-Standard Finance scraps cash-raising planDoorstep lender Non-Standard Finance has halted plans to raise cash from investors after the City regulator found problems in its guarantor loans division. My colleague Michael O'Dwyer reports:NSF could face a hefty compensation bill if it is found to have treated customers unfairly. The findings are a blow to the troubled lender, whose boss was forced in June to deny that his company was on the brink of collapse when it revealed that the pandemic had triggered material uncertainty about whether it could continue as a going concern.It was forced to halt lending during the pandemic and the economic crisis is likely to increase customer defaults. NSF may have to agree a financial restructuring with its own lenders in order to survive, analysts at Goodbody said. NSF said on Monday that Alchemy, an investor in distressed companies and NSF's largest shareholder, was still supportive of providing fresh capital to the lender. 03 Aug 2020-01:30PM BSTFull report: Factories lead recoveryMy colleague Tim Wallace has a full report on this morning's manufacturing PMI readings.

This drove the company to a \u00a3136.5m pre-tax loss, largely caused by a \u00a3110m goodwill impairment and \u00a320m in restructuring costs.Senior also abandoned paying a dividend, causing its share price to take a sharp hit today.03 Aug 2020-12:51PM BSTUK PMI reaction: Pent-up demand may waneThe UK manufacturing sector's rapid recovery in July may not mean that problems are over for Britain's factories, says Pantheon Macroeconomics' Samuel Tombs, who writes: \"we remain concerned that the current strength of output partly reflects the release of pent-up demand after the lockdown, which ultimately will fade away by the autumn\".He added:[The] slight decline in the PMI between the flash and final readings, referring to July 13-22 and July 13-28, respectively, suggests that demand weakened a little as the month progressed.Meanwhile, the 43.3 level of the employment index in July - the sixth consecutive sub-50 reading -suggests that manufacturers are continuing to plan for demand to eventually stabilise at a level well below pre-Covid levels. All told, then, the manufacturing sector appears to be reviving faster than most others from the Covid-19 slump, though it remains likely that its recovery still will fall short of being V-shaped.Mr Tombs noted that the output index was its highest margin above the orders index since January 2016, indicating manufacturers have been clearing backlogs of work:03 Aug 2020-12:38PM BSTMarket movesAfter a shaky start, European indices have pushed a little higher today, clawing back some of last week's losses. 03 Aug 2020-11:57AM BSTHiscox expects bigger hit from virusInsurer Hiscox said it expects to take a bigger hit than previously forecast due to Covid-19 as it fell to a $139m (\u00a3107m) loss in the first half of 2020. My colleague Michael O'Dwyer reports:The FTSE 250 firm pencilled in $232m of net payouts, including the $150m of likely claims it previously flagged for sectors such as event cancellation and travel. The additional provision includes expected payouts under business interruption policies in Europe and travel bonds that refund holidaymakers whose trips have been cancelled if their travel agents have gone bust. Bronek Masojada, Hiscox's chief executive, said it had been a tumultuous few months for the company which has found itself at the centre of the storm over insurers' resistance to pay out on interruption cover for small businesses that have suffered losses during the pandemic. Mr Masojada said the problem required an industry-wide solution and that his firm had been in the spotlight because \"some very effective campaigners\" have specifically targeted it. Lawyers at City firm Mishcon de Reya have threatened the firm with a class action-style legal claim on behalf of small businesses. Asked if the saga had hurt Hiscox's reputation, Mr Masojada said: \"At the end of the day reputation as one one claim at a time, and that's where the operational resilience comes through. We've done a good job in other areas.\"03 Aug 2020-11:31AM BSTMeal subsidy scheme gets underwayWith August upon us, the Government's 'Eat Out to Help Out' launches today.

Cybersecurity firms such as Zscaler and Carbon Black have enjoyed strong IPOs this year, but don't expect emerging venture and private equity-backed start-ups to follow that example. The most likely exit opportunity for cyber security start-ups will be M&amp;A, not an IPO, the report found. The likely acquirers will be big tech firms, such as Symantec, Cisco, Microsoft, and Raytheon, which have been acquiring cyber start-ups. The sector is also an attractive opportunity for private equity investors to roll-up best-of-breed solutions.

Despite increased awareness of cybersecurity threats, 61% of security professionals surveyed reported malware, malicious data breaches, hacker activity or other cybersecurity threats over the past 12 months. This number likely understates the ubiquity of breaches because it can't account for undiscovered breaches, and respondents are often unwilling to disclose breaches, even anonymously. The survey, which received 372 responses from cybersecurity industry professionals, also found that more than 90% of those polled are planning to increase their spend on cybersecurity software and cybersecurity insurance products. Only 5% said they plan to spend less over the next year.

At the same time, cyber spending could outpace IT spending, creating a $165 billion market in 2023 from $95 billion today.\u201d  Among key findings of the report:      More M&amp;A Ahead. Cybersecurity firms such as Zscaler and Carbon Black have enjoyed strong IPOs this year, but don\u2019t expect emerging venture and private equity-backed start-ups to follow that example. The most likely exit opportunity for cyber security start-ups will be M&amp;A, not an IPO, the report found. The likely acquirers will be big tech firms, such as Symantec, Cisco, Microsoft, and Raytheon, which have been acquiring cyber start-ups. The sector is also an attractive opportunity for private equity investors to roll-up best-of-breed solutions.

Despite increased awareness of cybersecurity threats, 61% of security professionals surveyed reported malware, malicious data breaches, hacker activity or other cybersecurity threats over the past 12 months. This number likely understates the ubiquity of breaches because it can\u2019t account for undiscovered breaches, and respondents are often unwilling to disclose breaches, even anonymously. The survey, which received 372 responses from cybersecurity industry professionals, also found that more than 90% of those polled are planning to increase their spend on cybersecurity software and cybersecurity insurance products. Only 5% said they plan to spend less over the next year.

They ve issued oodles of stock options as a low-cost way to convince smart people to come work for them at salaries far below what they could make at Fortune 500 companies. But with the path to an IPO stretching out indefinitely for many startups, these options have less and less value on any time scale that s relevant to young employees. If the trend continues, options could lose most of their meaning as a form of compensation and startups might have to resort to more expensive enticements.</p><p><br/> Greg Brogger, the founder and CEO of SharesPost[1], thinks he has a new way to ensure the attractiveness of stock options as an incentive. It s a loan program that helps tech-startup employees exercise their options before an IPO thereby lowering their tax bills when they finally do sell their shares and, in theory, realizing more of the value they ve built up.<br/> The program also opens up a potentially lucrative new line of business for SharesPost, and offers the investors backing the loans a way to obtain shares in sought-after companies before they hit the public markets. But it s unclear so far whether employees themselves will bite.<br/> You ve probably heard of San Bruno, CA-based SharesPost. Alongside SecondMarket[2], it was one of the companies that facilitated a frenzy of private trading in Facebook shares in the year or two preceding the social networking company s public offering. It helped investors obtain pre-IPO shares in the social networking juggernaut by arranging for Facebook employees and early investors to sell their shares on the so-called secondary market. Brogger (pictured above) says SharesPost handled 2,000 such transactions in the 12 months before Facebook went public in May 2012.<br/> The big goal at SharesPost, Brogger says, was always to build an efficient trading platform for shares in private, venture-backed companies valued at $100 million or more. There are at least 2,000 of these companies in the U.S. and perhaps as many as 6,000. But for the first couple of years after SharesPost s founding in 2009, he says, the company had its hands full dealing with just two of them namely, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB[3]) and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD[4]). That meant SharesPost didn t have time to develop other lines of business.<br/>  It allowed us to become profitable as a company and to build a bit of a war chest, but it was also a bit of a detour,  Brogger says.  There was a price to be paid, and it was a focus internally and externally on a small part of what needed to be built rather than on the larger vision. <br/> Over the coming year, SharePost plans to introduce three or four new services to round out its business. The option loan program, announced in October, is the first. It s designed to help employees exercise vested stock options before an IPO or other exit event, even if they can t afford the out-of-pocket costs.<br/> This isn t standard procedure for most startup employees, precisely because of the high cost but there s a potentially large tax advantage down the road. Employees who wait until after an IPO to exercise their options and sell their shares wind up paying regular income tax on the proceeds. Those who hold their shares for a least a year before selling, on the other hand, get taxed at the much lower capital gains rate.<br/>  The primary use case for these loans is a situation where an employee received an option grant three or four years ago, and the company is doing well and anticipates a sale or IPO or some kind of liquidity event,  Brogger explains.  Typically that employee will have an  Aha  moment where they say,  There is a liquidity event on the horizon, maybe I should exercise my options today so that when I sell the shares I get taxed at the long-term capital gains rate.  The CFO says  Great, but you have to write us a check for the exercise price.  <br/> Say the employee has 50,000 option shares with an exercise price of $1 per share he has to come up with $50,000. And there s another piece of bad news. Because his company s value has likely appreciated since the option grant, he ll owe income tax on the difference between the exercise price and the current fair market value of the shares. If the difference is large, the taxes can run into the tens of thousands of dollars.<br/> The typical startup employee doesn t have a nest egg large enough to cover all those costs, so that s usually the end of the story. He or she just holds on to the options and takes the income-tax hit after the liquidity event.<br/> What Brogger has invented is a program that matches an option-holding employee with outside investors who are willing to loan him enough to cover the cost of exercising the options, plus the tax on the appreciation. It s a cashless transaction for the borrower he simply ends up owning the shares. After the liquidity event, he pays off the loan plus the interest using the proceeds from the stock sale. He also owes capital gains tax but in theory, his net proceeds are higher than if he d paid regular income tax.<br/>SharesPost and the outside investors make money on the interest, and the transaction also involves a stock fee of between 4 and 8 percent of the exercised shares. The shares themselves are the collateral on the loan. If, in the worst-case scenario, the stock ends up being worth less than the borrower paid for it, no repayment is due, and the lenders end up holding the bag.<br/> Brogger argues that this approach is less risky for employees than holding on to the options, or even self-funding the purchase.  Think how invested you already are in the company,  he says.  Do you also want to put in another $150,000 of your own cash? <br/> These kinds of loans aren t actually new many large companies offer them to senior team members as a perk to help them cash in on a startup s growth. But it s a benefit that has never been available to rank and file employees, mostly because companies can t afford to lay out that much capital. Banks, too, shy away from option loans, because regulations prevent them from counting shares as collateral.<br/>  We re not a bank,  Brogger notes. To fund the initial loans, SharesPost is working with a new firm called The ESO Fund, which is made up of a group of venture industry veterans and has allocated between $15 million and $20 million for the program.<br/> At the time of my interview with Brogger in late October, two option loans had been completed and another 15 were in the pipeline. That s not exactly what you d call a rush, but Brogger says the program is still in its beta phase.  There is not the same intensity to it that there was around Facebook. We are going to perfect it and build a marketplace gradually,  he says.<br/> Without programs like this to unlock the value trapped in employee stock options, it will ultimately become much more expensive for Silicon Valley companies to recruit and retain employees, Brogger predicts.<br/>  Private companies are staying private longer,  he observes. While a few big tech companies like LinkedIn, Facebook, Zynga, and Groupon have managed to go public in the last year, there isn t a clamor to follow them through the door. In fact, the market has brutally punished some of these companies over unstable earnings and other problems.  There are lots of advantages to staying private, and in fact the JOBS Act makes it easier to stay private even longer,  Brogger says.<br/> And that s putting a big strain on traditional incentive stock option programs, which are intended not merely as a form of deferred compensation, but as a way to build loyalty.<br/>  It s a treasured part of the Silicon Valley model you align incentives, you generate a sense of ownership, and you create the carrot of a wealth-creating event,  Brogger says.  But now you have people who have been in the company for five, six, or seven years, who have vested options, and they want to go start their own businesses, they want to buy a house, they want to diversify. <br/>  Engineers who sign on when they are 25, they can wait until they are 29,  Brogger continues.  What they can t do is wait until they are 37. Only the largest endowments and institutions have that kind of investment horizon.  If there isn t a realistic prospect that their options will pay off within four or five years, Brogger says, employees would be better off working only until they re vested, then moving on.  If your sweat equity is your capital, that is the only way to diversify. <br/> Brogger sees SharesPost s option loan program as a natural extension of the secondary markets, which emerged a few years ago as a response to shareholders  unmet need for pre-IPO liquidity. He thinks other options will eventually come along as well, including programs serving employees at smaller startups.  People with these valuable assets in these illiquid shares and options need a way to turn them into a usable part of their financial lives,  he says.  If it doesn t emerge, the system will stay broken, and people will start saying  Thanks for the options, but I ll take cash.  <br/> Comments[5] | Reprints[6] | Share: <url

A World Marked by Fast-Changing Centralised Technologies, Fragile Fragmented Global Society, Debt, Sharing Economy, IoT and BlockchainWhen we look at the present global world we realise that nowadays, what promises to change and become one core structure of the economy and systems of management\u00a0of the future will be\u00a0two decentralised mega-technologies: IoT (Internet of (Every)Thing)), providing us with connected global services and solutions, and the Blockchain distributed ledger, powered by smart contracts tech.

In his new book\u00a0Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money[1]\u00a0he envisions a world new economy and society powered by blockchain. This digital transformation is happening in a world fragmented\u00a0social and economic models. We have pure capitalism economies, mixed with emerging global sharing economy trends in society, mostly managed and powered by centralised and decentralised technological platforms and systems. In this advanced fragile economy, businesses that have seemed transformational in many senses have thus far made money in an old very traditional way, almost tribal way, community, small village marketplace - specifically through being middlemen in digital market-places, and through the production of devices, e-commerce transactions, software or advertising that make possible these operations. These businesses, mostly tech and software driven, conduct both B2C or B2B models, and bring together buyers and sellers and charge commissions, licensing for billions of people. Paradoxically, the foundations, structuring these business model has been around for millennia, as mankind always manage their transactions through community marketplaces, so it is not as innovative as it might have\u00a0seen at first. The difference is that these new communities even if using P2P models are centralised and mostly belonging to a few people that gather most of the value and profit operated by billions of people. The paradox is that this complex and fast-changing tech powered economy happens partly through the lens of the so-called sharing economy or circular economy, which is managed and powered on big tech community digitally\u00a0driven platforms. Businesses that have seemed transformational in many senses have thus far, made money in a very traditional way - specifically through being middlemen and gather data and information about most of mankind as never before. They bring together buyers and seller and charge a commission but control everything within the community that most of the times is based in close software and deeply centralised business models.<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-05-at-18.05.10.png\">http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-05-at-18.05.10.png</url> Trusted Centralised human systems to trustless decentralised networks? infographic Dinis Guarda based in collage from other web models Plus, these new platforms are partly controlled by big corporations that have grown to become powerful disruptive global monopolies. These innovative technologies offer fantastic new opportunities, but also bring massive challenges, risks and privacy considerations never seen before in the history of mankind. We live in a world now powered by fragile alliances between politics and economics. In the current\u00a0state of evolution of (wo)mankind, our world is run more than ever by paradoxical peaks of hope and fear, powered increasingly by digital social waves, besides bull and bear economic algorithm, driving market macro-economic cycles. We are now witnessing the foundations of a global society and economy based in technology / software managed platforms. With Blockchain and IOT we are seeing an emerging technology fast forward (r)evolution or wave that will\u00a0replace, in a\u00a0short\u00a0time,\u00a0the\u00a0global technical, social, financial and identity middlemen legal and tech infrastructures. This will happen over a background\u00a0of a\u00a0global economy stricken by deep contradictions where the size of the world economy and the size of the debt are out of proportion.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-10-04-at-23.31.45.png\">http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-10-04-at-23.31.45.png</url> Since the Great Recession, global debt has increased by $57 trillion, outpacing world GDP growth Some numbers to consider: In 2014, according to the CIA's World Factbook, the GWP totalled approximately US$107.5 trillion in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), and around US$78.28 trillion\u00a0in nominal terms. The per capita PPP GWP in 2014 was approximately US$16,100 according to the World Factbook.\u00a0Gross world product - Wikipedia The global debt reckoning - Total global debt at $230 trillion. Total world debt over 300 percent annual GDP.Total global debt crossed a troubling event horizon by going past the $200 trillion mark last year. Given the latest figures we are likely well above a total global debt of $230 trillion based on a comprehensive study done by ING last year. The\u00a0banking sector rummages\u00a0for every possible way of accessing debt. Global central banks from the Fed to the ECB to the Bank of Japan are now fully engaged in a digital printing end game. It isn't so much the startling debt figures that are presented but the GDP that is actually backing up this insurmountable level of debt. The latest data shows that total world debt is running above 313 percent of annual GDP.\u00a0ING study\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://v.iew.im/Rceq76\">http://v.iew.im/Rceq76</url> And this is already a fact not just a simple analyst prediction. The IoT technology market size alone, in terms of value, is expected to grow from USD 130.33 Billion in 2015 to USD 883.55 Billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 32.4% between 2016 and 2022 according to the report 'Internet of Things Technology'\u00a0published by MarketsandMarkets. When it comes to blockchain the revolution is probably even more impactable as 17% of the world banks are previeweing to migrate to blockchain infrastructure in 2017. Bearing this in mind we can see a\u00a0lot needs to be rewired and rethinked throughoutly.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-05-at-17.59.21.png\">http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-05-at-17.59.21.png</url> Blockchain in IoT and Other Considerations by Dinis Guarda2. Blockchain and IOT are in its inception such as the electricity when it started!Blockchain and IOT are quite recent technologies, so it is interesting to make a paralel with the electricity when it started. Electric energy is transferred by an electric circuit\u00a0and the SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second. The Electric power, like mechanical power, is the rate of doing work, measured in watts, and represented by the letter\u00a0P. The term\u00a0wattage\u00a0is used colloquially to mean 'electric power in watts.' Electrical phenomena and then electricity have been studied since antiquity, and as the technology progressed, electricity\u00a0was increasingly adopted as one of the core technologies shaping and transforming the world\u00a0in unforeseen\u00a0ways. We are now going through a similar process with Blockchain and IOT, a similar macro adoption progress. But if with\u00a0electricity, it took the world 2 to 3 centuries to fully understand it and adopt it to its full potential, the challenge and opportunity\u00a0with Blockchain and IOT is the accelerated pace at which it is being\u00a0adopted on a global scale: less than a decade or two. So as electricity changed all the infrastructure of society, IOT and blockchain are operating the same revolution. Why? Mostly because it is enabling a full disruption of the concept of middlemen that powers most of the world economy business models and infrastructures. Moreover brings the Peer to Peer commons models of society to a new level and last but not least it will create a powerful digital identity for all the 7 billion humans in the world and the things around them. This is profoundly challenging and brings a lot of new ethical questions, besides the laying down of a whole new infrastructure.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-05-at-18.01.23.png\">http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-05-at-18.01.23.png</url> IOT Blockchain and the Electricity revolution paralels3. How blockchain works in the new IoT world? As the World Economic Forum put recently in a research paper Blockchain is critical for the shifting world economy. On this note the Bank of England thinks that Blockchain related digital currencies could increase GDP by 3%, by introducing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). In a Working Paper[2] that aims to explore what would happen if the Bank of England would introduced a digital currency the conclusion was powerful. The paper concludes that this type of currency has never existed before, so the Bank used a theoretical model to see what would happen if 30% of the UK's GDP existed as a digital currency. These were some of the remarks: 'Our simulations suggest that this policy has a number of beneficial effects,' says the report, citing two major reasons:1. An increase in GDP of almost 3%, as a result of the reduced interest rates, reduced tax rates and lower transaction costs that implementing a digital currency would bring. For example, a digital currency does not need intermediaries to settle the transaction, rather, money passes directly from one party to another. 2. The digital currency could also contribute to the stabilization of the economy because it would give central banks another means by which to control their currency. This would be particularly effective in times of economic shock, such as Brexit.Other benefits of a digital currency include transparency.Dinesh Venugopal, a tech personality and the head of strategic and digital customers of Mphasis[3]\u00a0explains additionally how IoT works in a great way when associated with Blockchain. The company where he leads strategy, specializes in IT services, and has been exploring blockchain usage and applications in the IoT. Venugopal illustrates how a blockchain-enabled transaction work across IoT networks 'An IoT enabled blockchain is where an overlay of services is designed in a particular kind of framework that will enable free communication between devices in a network,' he said. 'Each device generates its unique public key to send and receive information with another device and any participating device can seamlessly retrieve information associated with a given key. For instance, multiple industrial IoT blockchain initiatives are being undertaken to automate irrigation by controlling water supply based on feeds from another blockchain that keeps track of crop condition.'\u00a0source\u00a0Blockchain and the IoT: So Many Uses, So Little Trust[4] There are numerous advantages to employing blockchain to manage IoT networks or transactions, Venugopal says. These include the following: Real-time tracking of equipment condition: 'Blockchain technology can be used in tracking billions of connected devices to record feeds on working condition,' Venugopal points out. Immediate failure rectification:\u00a0'Regular feeds from devices posted on blockchain can immediately identify failure instances and immediate corrective action can be taken,' he illustrates. 'For instance, temperature fluctuation in a cold fleet carrying food items identified by sensors gets posted on a fleet provider blockchain and a trigger is sent to the driver of the fleet, food supply company, and fleet provider company notifying about the temperature fluctuation. The driver can then immediately take action to fix the issue.' Trend analysis:\u00a0A trend study 'can be carried out on devices for diagnostic study and preventive maintenance,' says Venugopal. Accelerated turnaround times:\u00a0'Real-time feeds on blockchain and triggering feeds to relevant nodes automatically can accelerate consequent actions,' he points out. 'For instance, whenever an insurance provider issues a home insurance policy, a mortgage company gets a feed that the insurance policy has been issued for a particular borrower and can be viewed using a passkey on the insurer's blockchain. The mortgage company can then view the policy in real time and immediately disburse the loan. The process that would have taken a week's time is completed in less than a day.' Other advantages are the following: In one solution that the blockchain company Mphasis developed, 'IoT blockchain keeps track of the working condition of all home devices using sensor technology and triggers feeds to relevant stakeholders like the homeowner, service center, mortgage provider, and insurer in the event of device break down.' This means that each stakeholder will in turn take relevant action and update relevant parties.\u00a0For example, the borrower will follow up with the service agency for repairs; the repair center will send a technician to fix the issue and then update its own blockchain with events such as whether the device was fixed and the bill amount. Finally, the mortgage provider will revise the value of the device in question based on feeds from other stakeholders and update its own blockchain. This needs a big dose of scalability. Part of the challenge of any technology is the growth of a reliable and usable ecosystem. This also happened with the electricity revolution. It took various stages of development until it transformed all aspects of human life, organisations and cities, countries.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-09-21-at-18.34.13.png\">http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-09-21-at-18.34.13.png</url> evolution of digital powered technologies and software 2000 to 2010 with the emergence of the web4. Seven challenges one needs to consider when looking at Blockchain and IOT.As I mentioned previously, just like\u00a0the rapid expansion and adoption of electrical technology, transformed industry and society, the same is happening with IOT and Blockchain. Electricity's extraordinary versatility meant it could be put to use to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation and that is exactly what is happening with both Blockchain and in association Internet of Everything. The implications for these new innovative technologies are much bigger as they comprehend a nature of decentralised systems and processes that disrupt\u00a0our way of managing a middlemen centric economy and tech infra-structure. Plus Blockchain and IOT bring another very\u00a0advanced level of penetration in the way we interact with advanced privacy, cyber security and going forward, even our health and our very human DNA (connected with sensors, machines devices and data processing).To begin with, I would like to highlight seven challenges one needs to consider when looking at Blockchain and IOT: 1. Redefinition of infrastructures, legacy systems the total relation between IoT with Blockchain.2. IoT - mobile ledgers - blockchain economic identity and systems.3. The emergence of centralised and decentralised sensitive products and services.2. System Legacies in parallel with advanced tech new solutions that imply new development and requirements.3. Distribution Strategy in a new digitalised world: who owns what?4. Super-computer cloud base IoT, blockchain solutions / infrastructure.5. The emergence of AI IOE in relation with blockchain all connected.6. User Experience, UI, UE, Big data and the IOE blockchain touching. The global economy and society are based on global local and global set of power and grids and layers.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-05-at-18.09.23.png\">http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-05-at-18.09.23.png</url> 7 Challenges for IoT / Blockchain Industry? infographic by Dinis Guarda / Intelligenthq.com 5. Only 30% of Organizations feel ready to handle IoT's security risks. What does this means for the world economy?According to the results of a\u00a0recent Tripwire survey\u00a0of more than 220 information security professionals, just 30 percent of respondents said their organizations are prepared for the security risks associated with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and just 34 percent believe their organizations accurately track the number of IoT devices on their networks.Still, 47 percent of respondents expect the number of IoT devices on their networks to increase by at least 30 percent in 2017. 'The Internet of Things presents a clear weak spot for an increasing number of information security organizations,' Tripwire director of IT security and risk strategy Tim Erlin said in a\u00a0statement. 'As an industry, we need to address the security basics with the growing number of IoT devices in corporate networks.' 'By ensuring these devices are securely configured, patched for vulnerabilities and being monitored consistently, we will go a long way in limiting the risks introduced,' Erlin added. While only 11 percent of respondents consider DDoS attacks to be one of the two security threats their organizations face, 47 percent are concerned about the weaponization of IoT devices for DDoS attacks. 'It seems that security professionals see IoT devices as a sort of 'zombie appliance army' that's worthy of great concern,' Tripwire CTO and vice president of research and development Dwayne Melancon said in a statement. 'That makes sense, since many of the current crop of IoT devices were created with low cost as a priority over secrity, making them easy targets. The large number of easily compromised devies will require a new approach if we are to secure our critical networks.' A separate\u00a0CompTIA survey\u00a0of 350 channel IT professionals and 512 business and IT executives found that 49 percent of channel firms believe that security will be a major focus as companies move forward with IT adoption. Sixty-five percent of respondents view hackers as a leading threat to IT security and privacy, followed by vulnerabilities left open by devices manufacturers (52 percent) and unencrypted data traveling across networks (51 percent). While 37 percent of companies said the benefits of connected devices outweigh security concerns, 14 percent said security and privacy are serious hurdles, and 49 percent said security and privacy are primary factors to consider during adoption. Segmented by job function, 49 percent of executives said the benefits of connected devices outweigh security concerns, compared to 34 percent of respondents in an IT function and just 26 percent of respondents in a line of the\u00a0business function. A\u00a0recent\u00a0eSecurity Planet\u00a0article\u00a0offered advice on improving IoT security. The internet of things still in its inception presents a clear weak spot for an increasing number of information security organizations and personal identity issues. As an industry, we need to address the security basics with the growing number of IoT devices in corporate networks and all the ethics around usage of data and special when it comes with healthcare increasing AI driven by IOT devices. By ensuring these devices are securely configured, patched for vulnerabilities and being monitored consistently, we will go a long way in limiting the risks introduced. A lot needs to be done also on the legal and compliance side. Blockchain smart contracts can help on that but a solid infrastructure of global ecosystem needs to be drawn for that. It wasn't so long ago that home computer 'zombie armies' were the weapon of choice for cyber attacks and denial of service attacks. It seems that security professionals see IoT devices as a sort of 'zombie appliance army' that's worthy of great concern. That makes sense, since many of the current crop of IoT devices were created with low cost as a priority over security, making them easy targets. The large number of easily compromised devices will require a new approach if we are to secure our critical networks. Organizations must respond with low-cost, automated and highly resilient methods to successfully manage the security risk of these devices at scale. //      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/f7OO1zkM8Opvlu\">www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/f7OO1zkM8Opvlu</url>[5] Blockchain in IoT and Other Considerations by Dinis Guarda[6] from Dinis Guarda[7]6. Blockchain IoT: An AirBnB for machinery driven by AI and decntralised without VC funding and control?There are loads of idles assets sitting around in warehouses waiting for the occasional use, and the good news is that the world is more aware than ever of the importance of sustainability. The question is can a\u00a0Blockchain IoT: An AirBnB for machinery driven by AI and decntralised without VC funding and control. There are already a lot of startups building companies trying to reproduce these models without centralised systems. Governments and organizations are finally receptive to the potential offered by Blockchain and IOT and idle assets particularly in terms of economics and as a way to foster sustainability. The challenge thus is to understand this complex and fast moving technology and systems while moving the common daily operations. Moreover being able to leverage old infrastructure and manage all the issues and new challenges that come with it. Blockchain-powered industrial IoT systems and networks will allow us to connect industrial assets \u2014 everything from shipping containers to MRI machines to construction equipment \u2014 into real-time digital marketplaces, healthcare services, energy grids in one hand. Blockchain driven technology and platforms would on the other hand offer the interaction engines and legal smart contract ledger for these marketplaces, supporting financing, rental, insurance \u2014 all kinds of related services. The maintenance or upgrade requirements associated with billions of devices - or the products they are contained within - may be monitored over blockchain networks. In the process, questions over who owns a device, who owns the data, and who is responsible for upkeep may be resolved and embedded into the network - with no need for wrangling with separate contracts. With millions of devices at stake, the shift in speed to market will be noticeable. And will create a new economic world model but a lot of new challenges as anyone can figure out.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-05-at-18.21.08.png\">http://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-05-at-18.21.08.png</url> how to distills the technological complexities of the IoT ...ockchain into a single complementary ecosystem, by Dinis Guarda / Intelligenthq.com7. Challenges: Security and ScalabilityAs the IOT driven AI economy scales one of the big risks we are facing is security and scalability. Through the devices we use and all the sensors we are showing all our fragility and nature, this comes with a price and blockchain will augment that and can in part answer to that if it is a decentralised version based in good commons ethical principles.Venugopal cautions there are security issues that need to be addressed when it comes to IoT. These may include managing unknown or untrusted parties, since blockchain IoT 'would largely be dominated by a P2P network of communicating devices that function independently without dependence on a centralized trust center, and where the parties are unknown or untrusted and may sometimes be of malicious nature.' Another issue that needs to be addressed head-on is the complex security mechanisms required for blockchain IoT. 'Multiple security layers to be developed for multiple devices that need to be integrated in a blockchain-based IoT network. A single loophole can compromise the security of the\u00a0whole network.' Scalability is another challenge on the horizon. 'According to an estimate, 50 billion devices are yet to come online,' Venugopal says. 'Scaling up networks to support billions of devices and keeping the network up and running as data keeps multiplying every day - that's a challenge.' Since blockchain is a 360-degree shift from decentralized systems to a permission-based public network, 'the whole ecosystem may take considerable time to understand the technology and place trust in it,' Venugopal says. 8.\u00a0Other\u00a0Challenges for BlockchainAs blockchain scales and the general business and financial world migrate the critical question and concern is how to manage its risks and challenges. Regulatory solutions on how to implement these disruptive technologies is one of the core issues. A good example of a country exploring the potential of blockchain, is Estonia, who is experimenting\u00a0with this technology, to improve authentication processes and streamline proxy voting. The experiment builds on Estonia's e-Residency program \u2014 a transnational digital identity available to everyone globally. In the medium term, probably within five to 10 years, both the general usage of blockchain and IOT technologies and solutions, will standardize reference data \u2014 used to describe counterparty and security identifiers. Reference data is a hugely expensive process for major global organisations and corporations. However, this data is so sensitive and crucial to financial markets, that the industry will need to trial and see solid successful case studies before embracing blockchain as the central repository for something so vital.9. The sharing economy of Blockchain. Can decentralised organisations and non-for profits be the main drive of this new wave?What has the sharing economy to do with blockchain? One of the most important properties of blockchain technology - the elimination of the need for central authority and middlemen - could become a backbone for the real sharing economy, or sharing economy 2.0. In the current model, every 'sharing economy' service has a central authority, whereas similar services built and operating on blockchain technology, would directly connect supply and demand in the most efficient manner. According to\u00a0IBM,\u00a0'Eliminating the need for an intermediary could impact some of the biggest technology companies. Rather than use Uber, Airbnb or eBay to connect with other people, blockchain services allow individuals to connect, share, and transact directly, ushering in the real sharing economy. Blockchain is the platform that enables real peer-to-peer transactions and a true 'sharing economy'.' 'But more importantly, blockchain will create new markets. These markets will be ones in which individuals can trade non-traditional assets like reputation, data, and attention. Blockchain makes any activity, however small, easy to monetize. &lt;&gt; Each time the data is used, the user receives a token in a licensing-type model.' The Circular economy or Sharing economy 2.0 is more than a concept is about storytelling between technology and society and interactions of trust and business models or sustainable community principles of rewarding and value creation. In the increasing growing and competitive ride-sharing industry, for example, Uber and Lyft are two innovative and aggressive dominant players leading the centralised sharing economy pack. Both are brands that consumers and drivers trust to match supply and demand, but unfortunately, the values and principles behind these companies don't have much to do with sharing, but more to make a revenue out of extracting the last drops of profit out of the surplus value of work done by networks of peers. Soon enough, blockchain can with the right scale fundamentally transform the model with the next generation of companies taking over the niche. But think about it, If you can authenticate a driver or rider without Uber, which is what very early-stage new companies operating in this field, such as Arcade City\u00a0and\u00a0La 'Zooz (both using blockchain tech) are hoping to offer, doesn't Uber become unnecessary? Evidently, drivers can even make more money with this new type of platforms, and make these Silicon Valley VC run models obsolete. Of course nothing can be done without the right amount of funding, scalability and brains. Explaining the sharing economy model and rider sharing problem, Arcade City's Founder\u00a0Christopher David\u00a0bluntly elaborated on the issue in an extensive interview with Bitcoin.com: 'A bunch of eggheads in San Francisco are right now centrally controlling rates for hundreds of thousands of drivers around the world. Yes, we think we can improve on that system. Drivers and riders can agree to whatever method of payment they like. We won't know about it, won't get a cut of it, won't care.' The challenge is now whether non for profit and decentralised organisations are innovative enough and attentive to the world tech innovation, to take over this earlier than corporations taking the lead again in a world so increasingly unequal? Can UN organisations, Greenpeace, P2P Foundation follow on this and create a new cooperative sort of more human sharing economy that rewards the peer to peer communities in a sustained environmental and equalitarian way ? As citizens are increasingly more frustrated by their governs, big corporations and big organisations there is an opportunity now, with the help of technologies, to make new projects happen. The solution is a tech savvy new direction of sustainable innovation driven sharing economy that can drive the world economy and society in this new IOT Blockchain new electricity wave direction while creating a sustainable society.

Its new handset -- tipped as the Sharp Aquos S3 -- has surfaced on the web. The smartphone has been certified by Taiwanese telecommunications regulator and Tenaa as well, revealing some of the major specifications. An alleged image showing the smartphone's launch invite has also surfaced online.</p><p><br/> Shared by dealntech website, Sharp's press invite says the Acquos S3 will launch in an event on January 16. The launch seems to be only for China.<br/> According to the Tenaa listing and images shared by Slashleaks, the handset design seems to mimic that of the iPhone X. It has the same notch at the top. At the back one can see the vertically aligned dual rear cameras. There is also a fingerprint sensor at the back.<br/>    As for the specifications, the Acquos S3 is said to feature a 5.9-inch full HD+ display with 18:9 aspect ratio. There may be two variants of the handset. One may feature Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor along with 4GB RAM and 64GB inbuilt storage. The other model could sport Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor with 6GB RAM and 128GB inbuilt storage. Also mentioned is the inclusion of 12MP+13MP sensors at the back in addition to a 16MP sensor. Backing the device is a 3100mAh battery.<br/>  Tenaa has also listed what seems to be a smaller version of the Sharp Aquos S3. The smartphone is being tipped as the Sharp Aquos S3 Mini. It is said to feature a smaller 5.2-inch display and a single 16MP rear camera. There will also be a 20MP front-facing camera onboard. It is likely to launch on the same January 16 event in China. Both the smartphones may only be available in Black colour.<br/>  Sharp launched its Aquos S2 back in August last year.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10341612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RF2-C6J1-DYDW-73NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"294\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 17, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

The statistics are nothing short of astounding in terms of the ventures that will develop in the coming decades in these emerging economies.</p><p>A panel of experts discussed the realities of doing business in these countries for U.S. media companies -- it wasn't entirely a rosy picture. But it wasn't until veteran independent TV producer Todd Levitt stood up in the audience to point out some less-talked-about hazards awaiting independents and majors that some of the real challenges came to light.</p><p>\"The old days are long gone, and doing business now internationally is all different,\" he said. \"You have cartels and monopolistic TV environments to deal with in some of these countries.\"</p><p>There was little disagreement from the panel, and we even heard one nightmare scenario out of Brazil about a locally based executive for a big tech company who has been kidnapped -- several times.</p><p>If you are doing business in Brazil, you most likely will deal with Globo TV, Latin America's biggest producer and broadcaster with no fewer than 121 broadcast stations. Although it produces the bulk of its own content, there's great potential there for U.S. players.</p><p>For instance, the white paper points to the fact that there are emerging opportunities in the pay TV sector, where such U.S. series as \"Lost,\" \"House\" and \"Brothers &amp; Sisters\" have found a home and are raising ratings for their carriers.</p><p>There's also the challenge of taking revenue out of many of these countries and repatriating it, said Camila Araujo, a partner in the law firm Araujo e Policastro. Russia and China are particularly challenging in that regard and even have given rise to the term \"captive capital.\"</p><p>China presents Western TV pioneers with a miasma of rules and regulations, not the least of which is its insistence on control of content, making it a constant guessing game as to what will pass muster.</p><p>Even some of Disney's most popular TV series can't be shown in China, though that might have less to do with protecting citizens as it has with bold-faced opportunism. Notes the white paper: \"An example of (the State Administration of Radio Film and Television's) protectionist role is its decision to ban foreign cartoons\" from 5-9 p.m. \"The net result has been an increase in domestic animation production.\"</p><p>India seems to emerge as the only BRIC country that poses fewer of the hazards and frustrations. David Tenzer, a veteran TV agent and now a leading entertainment industry attorney, said that among the advantages of doing business in India is a legal system similar to our own, a business-friendly atmosphere and the fact that English is widely spoken.</p><p>But it's still a cultural leap for Americans. \"Don't go to India and try to teach them how it works, or they will teach you a lesson,\" he said.</p><p>The potential problems for U.S. business looking to expand into the BRIC countries are myriad. But the reality is that the opportunities are just too vast to walk away from.</p><p>Steve Brennan can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:steve.brennan@THR.com\">steve.brennan@THR.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THR-1003819071</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THR2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4SV7-0HH0-TX2Y-F06F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">12015</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 VNU Business Media, Inc.

Politicians who master it - from Donald Trump to Justin Trudeau - are the stars of the current era.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet the companies that dominate social media - Facebook, Twitter and Google - have been slow to acknowledge their power or accept responsibility for how their platforms are used. And governments have been just as slow to react to the dangers posed when social media is used to manipulate public opinion and influence elections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's starting to change. Both Facebook and Twitter have just announced measures in Canada to make public more information about political advertising on their sites. Facebook Canada also launched what it calls its \"Canadian Election Integrity Initiative\" - essentially educating political players on how not to be hacked, and citizens on how to consume digital media without being led astray by purveyors of so-called \"fake news.\"</p><p>The social media giants clearly understand that if they don't get their houses in order, then someone else will do it for them. They're too powerful to be left alone.</p><p>Still, the steps they have taken so far fall far short of what is needed, given their enormous influence and the potential risks to our democracy.</p><p>That's true in the United States, where congressional investigators have discovered that groups linked to Russia placed thousands of ads on Facebook designed to influence the 2016 presidential election. And it's true in Canada, where a Senate committee this summer warned of holes in our election laws that could allow for foreign interference, especially through social media. At the same time, Canada's Communications Security Establishment warned of increasing cyber threats to the electoral system.</p><p>In the U.S., some legislators aren't prepared to let the big tech companies simply regulate themselves any longer. Two Democratic senators, joined by Republican John McCain, have introduced legislation that would bring the same level of accountability and regulation to online political advertising as now exists for political ads on television and radio.</p><p>Their bill, called the \"Honest Ads Act,\" would require social media and internet companies to make public detailed information about political advertisers who spend more than $500 on their platforms. That would allow voters and politicians to see who's behind the ads, what their target audience is and how often they are viewed. The bill would also update U.S. laws to give online political ads the same level of protection against foreign interference as old-style ads.</p><p>These are sensible measures that would bring U.S. election regulations more in line with the reality of today's political campaigning, which is waged online as much as at traditional rallies or on TV.</p><p>Canadian legislators should watch and learn. Facebook and Twitter deserve credit for taking steps in this country to bring more openness to political advertising on their platforms. But it shouldn't be entirely up to ordinary voters, or even political operatives, to figure out whether they're being manipulated online by groups masking their true identity.</p><p>There's a role for government in regulating online advertising, at least to the same standards of accountability as exist for ads in print or traditional broadcast media.</p><p>At a minimum, Ottawa should give Elections Canada expanded powers to oversee digital political campaigns. The agency should be able to force internet companies to disclose more information about political ads, including who paid for them, where they were placed and who saw them.</p><p>All this would just shed more light on what's going on in the murky world of political \"dark advertising.\" It would not - and should not - police the actual content of ads, aside from banning outright hate speech.</p><p>That's a much trickier task. Facebook and Google have both introduced third-party fact-checking systems to weed out so-called \"fake news,\" with largely disappointing results. In the end, it's still up to citizens to figure out what, and who, to believe. But they should know far more than they do now about where the information comes from.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2017102944025356</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PV0-6MY1-DY91-K0P8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"686\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 29, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The hedge fund Jana Partners also reduced its stake in the iPhone maker last quarter.</p><p>  Even Berkshire Hathaway, which has spent the past three years gobbling up shares of Apple, cut back its holdings in the company.</p><p>  And Apple was not the only tech titan that big investors were selling last quarter.</p><p>Jana, along with Third Point, sold all its shares in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. Third Point exited its position in Netflix. Leon Cooperman's firm, Omega Advisors, sold its stake in Facebook and reduced its holdings in Alphabet. And Tiger Global Management decreased its holdings in Amazon.</p><p>  The filings are the latest evidence of how quickly investors soured on Big Tech late last year as the industry's woes mounted. A stream of revelations about privacy lapses and security issues had raised the specter of increased regulation on both sides of the Atlantic. But of more immediate concern for investors late last year was whether these companies could continue to grow amid a slowing global economy and an escalating trade war between China and the United States.</p><p>  Over the final three months of last year, tech shares dropped 13 percent to 30 percent, erasing more than $1 trillion in market value. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 fell 14 percent.</p><p>  The selling signaled a swift shift in sentiment among big hedge funds. Many of these fund managers had struggled to beat the broader market in recent years. So as tech stocks soared and drove much of the broader market's gains, hedge funds crammed their portfolios with their shares.</p><p>  The selling caught the hedge fund industry off guard, and their losses mounted during the fourth-quarter tumult in the stock market.</p><p>  So far this year, shares of the tech companies have recovered, but most have not fared as well as the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>  Earnings for the final three months of 2018 were better than investors feared, but they did not inspire confidence that Big Tech would weather a global economic slowdown well, particularly in China.</p><p>  Whether investors will pile back into tech stocks will probably depend on the outcome of trade talks between China and the United States. Until then, many investors may stay on the sidelines.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Big investment firms unloaded their shares of Apple during the fourth quarter, according to S.E.C. filings.

Elizabeth Warren told a crowd of roughly 1,200 people that whatever issues brought them to her Monday night town hall, she had a plan to fix it - through \"big structural change.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If you see a government that works great for those with money, and isn't working for anyone else, that is corruption - plain and simple and we need to call it out,\" Warren said. \"When we fight back, it's not going to be a couple of regulations over here, a statute there - it's going to be big structural change.\"</p><p> Her plan? Part one is an anti-corruption bill she championed as the \"biggest since Watergate.\"</p><p> \"We need to attack the corruption head-on,\" Warren said. \"The good news: I have the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate. The bad news is we need the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate.\"</p><p> Warren's anti-corruption bill seeks to end lobbying in Washington D.C., end the pipeline between Wall Street and Washington D.C. and force any candidate who runs for a federal office to publicly post their tax returns.</p><p> Warren said she thinks the flow of money in politics has stalled progress on a number of other issues, including gun violence, climate change and the rising cost of health care.</p><p> The Massachusetts senator's rally cry to \"break up big ag, break up big tech and break up big pharma,\" drew one of loudest applauses of the night.</p><p> Part two, an ambitious wealth tax proposal, would implement a 2 percent wealth tax on individuals who's net worth exceeds $50 million.</p><p> \"When I'm talking about these fortunes, $50 million and above, that is the top one-tenth of the 1 percent,\" Warren said. \"If you built this great fortune, I guarantee you built it at least in part because all of us had to pay for it.\"</p><p> Her wealth tax would help pay for an ambitious education plan the seeks to quadruple public education funding with a focus on allocation resources to lower-income students, pre-K to college affordability and teacher pay raises.</p><p> Jill Hood, of Ankeny, said she came to the event with her granddaughter in hopes of hearing the candidate's position on the rising costs of heathcare and education. She said she hopes to \"meet all of the candidates, hear their platforms and trying to figure out what they will do to really bring back order to America.\"</p><p> \"The cost of education is bankrupting families. Education costs too much.

Our competition regulator has proposed a new approach to dealing with the awesome market power of two of the US based technology giants, Google and Facebook. Of course, Google and Facebook are pushing back, and they're pushing back hard. No-one should be surprised at companies defending their interests or their resistance to sharing some of their billions in profits. But make no mistake: they'll want to make an example of Australia. Google and Facebook, like their fellow tech titans Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and Uber, are no different in this respect from any other corporation that resists regulation and avoids paying tax\u2014robbing sovereign nations of the tax base that provides its people with health, education, aged care and public infrastructure. They are harnessing their assets, and their lobbyists are in touch with MPs from all parties in this place and the other place. These are some of the largest and richest corporations on the planet, with a reach across countries and industries and governments that is unrivalled in history. And, while we cannot expect these corporations to do anything other than defend their interests, governments and parliaments must stand up to defend the interests of their people.</p><p>Just over a year ago, in my first speech in this place, I argued for the digital services tax to be levied on the revenue generated by the platforms in Australia. The US government, in response to the digital services tax and discussions from the OECD, have made it clear that they will not allow any delay in arrangements for a global tax regime, so it will be up to us to defend our sovereign tax base. As we debate how this media bargaining code will work in practice, I want to echo the words spoken yesterday by former Competition and Consumer Commission chair, Allan Fels. He said there is always the option for this government, and this parliament, to bring in the huge stick of a digital services tax on these tech giants. I couldn't agree more. Critically, a digital services tax would be levied on the revenue generated in Australia, not the profits. And it should be levied on the revenue generated. This makes it harder to avoid. Profit based taxes, as we know well, can be small, or zero, because companies siphon off royalties to head offices, and profits are booked in tax havens.</p><p>I have some advice for every parliamentarian in this place: when you meet up with these big tech lobbyists, whether they are lobbying you about this proposed media code, about disinformation online, about unfair competition or about data privacy, you should first ask these corporate lobbyists when they are going to pay their fair share of taxes to this country. And when will they stop shipping off their profits to tax havens and low-tax jurisdictions?</p><p>I welcome this debate on the proposed Australian Competition and Consumer Commission media bargaining code. There will be devil in the detail of how it operates to give Australian media companies this power to bargain, including bargaining collectively for payment from Google and Facebook for the journalism content they produce. I, for one, think that there could be a real risk if we shut our public broadcasters out of the code. I am concerned that there is no requirement that the money transferred under the code be used for public interest journalism, and there are also real barriers to small and regional news outlets having the ability and capacity to bargain for their compensation. Nor is there a requirement that this funding be used to pay for wages\u2014for reporters, producers, photographers, videographers and others who create the content. But, as the ACCC considers the various submissions on this proposed code, I call on every member of parliament to consider the bigger picture here. The big picture I am talking about is the smart conversation we need to be having, not just in this parliament but at kitchen tables and pubs and workplaces across the nation. Once and for all, let's get them to pay their fair share of tax.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3743423</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TM-Y001-JDG9-Y1GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 11, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

She hasn\u2019t stood still since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a 700-page book, the Harvard scholar skewered tech giants like Facebook and Google with a damning phrase: \u201csurveillance capitalism.\u201d The unflattering term evokes how these companies vacuum up the details of our lives, make billions from that data and use what they\u2019ve learned to glue our attention more firmly to their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A bestseller in Canada and Britain, \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism\u201d was published in the U.S. in January, is being translated into 17 languages and has inspired two small theater productions. Zuboff, meanwhile, has been counseling politicians, criss-crossing the Atlantic for public forums from Los Angeles to Rome and hitting the podcast circuit.</p><p>She offered input on several pending U.S. privacy bills and wrote a 34-page policy paper for the House Judiciary Committee, whose antitrust panel, chaired by Rep. David N. Cicilline, D-R.I., is studying Big Tech\u2019s potential abuse of its market dominance.</p><p>Zuboff has \u201cput the language of economics around the experience that we all know we\u2019re having,\u201d says Beeban Kidron, a film director and U.K. House of Lords member who spearheaded child-protection rules limiting how apps gather data and tempt kids to linger online. \u201cShe\u2019s a rock star.\u201d</p><p>Early on, Zuboff realized researchers had missed the importance of the ambient data that digital services collect \\x97 where we use them, for how long, what we like, what we linger on and with whom we associate.</p><p>They were calling it \u201cdigital exhaust.\u201d</p><p>But Zuboff saw that this data wasn\u2019t just a byproduct, says Chris Hoofnagle, a University of California-Berkeley privacy expert. \u201cIt is the product.\u201d</p><p>Tech industry allies denounce Zuboff\u2019s thesis as conspiracy-minded hyperbole. Consumers willingly trade their personal data for access to valuable services that don\u2019t cost them a cent, they argue. Google and Facebook declined to discuss Zuboff or her book.</p><p>But after more than a year of tech-related privacy scandals, malign election-interference and online platform-fueled extremism, investigations opened by state attorneys general and the U.S. government\u2019s first tentative steps toward reining in its technology titans, it\u2019s become clear that Zuboff helped crystallize previously vague apprehensions about the tech industry.</p><p>Zuboff\u2019s indictment of the industry is straightforward: Tech companies suck up our data trails then use those insights to steer us toward commercial interactions, develop their next addictive apps and predict our future behavior \\x97 effectively molding individual behavior.</p><p>Worse, she says, these invasive business practices are spreading. \u201cBy now this is a virus that has infected every economic sector,\u201d Zuboff told a meeting of international parliamentarians in May.</p><p>Zuboff traces the origin of surveillance capitalism to 2001 as Google, then little more than a search engine, considered going public. Faced with the need to generate revenue, its founders decided to mine the data Google amasses when people make searches.</p><p>That helped Google improve search results but also informed it about users\u2019 family lives, religious beliefs, ethnicity, political or sexual orientation and more. Google fed those clues into a personalized advertising machine and became a global juggernaut.</p><p>Following Google\u2019s example, Facebook and other tech companies offered an irresistible bargain. People could connect to long-lost friends, search the world\u2019s information and watch endless streams of video at no cost. Before long, smartphones launched an explosion of \u201cfree\u201d apps with a hearty appetite for your data.</p><p>Nowadays, your movements, conversations, facial expressions and more are snatched by smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, doorbell cameras and connected cars. Dossiers are compiled on each of us.</p><p>Among the first women to earn tenure at Harvard Business School, Zuboff won plaudits for her early grasp of how digital technology would transform the business world with her 1988 book \u201cIn the Age of the Smart Machine.\u201d Her next book, \u201cThe Support Economy\u201d \\x97 co-written with her husband James Maxmin, since deceased \\x97 predicted that out-of-touch corporations would give way to rivals responsive to the feedback of technology-empowered consumers.</p><p>To Zuboff, surveillance capitalism poses an existential threat whose hidden costs are intentionally obscured by its practitioners. It is an \u201cantidemocratic and antiegalitarian juggernaut,\u201d she writes.</p><p>In the name of personalization, she says, \u201cit defiles, ignores, overrides and displaces everything about you and me that is personal.\u201d</p><p>Not everyone agrees, to put it mildly.</p><p>Vice President Carl Szabo of the e-commerce trade group NetChoice, whose members include Facebook and Google, said her book \u201cpaints a typical dystopian picture of technology, dismissing the remarkable benefits of online platforms and data analysis.\u201d</p><p>In response, Zuboff cites consumer surveys that indicate increasing unease with the prevailing, invasive business model.</p><p>She has no illusions about how difficult it will be to turn things around. Breaking up technology giants, says Zuboff, would do little to prevent their smaller progeny from continuing their work.</p><p>She does think the EU\u2019s year-old data protection rule and California\u2019s new data privacy law, which takes effect in January, are a good start.</p><p>And she\u2019s heartened by a recent flurry of regulatory energy in Washington, D.C.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s the very early stages of a sea change.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A year ago, Shoshana Zuboff dropped an intellectual bomb on the technology industry.

No wonder government hasn't been 'nearly aggressive enough' on anti-trust issues with them.In fact, U.S. legislators have practically made it so that tech companies can do whatever they want now. This includes forcing the installation of harmful and invasive technology throughout our communities and in front of our homes due to federally promoted campaigns the 'Race for 5G[5]', 'Smart Cities[6]', and 'Internet of Things[7]' (IoT) and more. Legislators have also made it so that utility companies can force the installation of harmful invasive technology on our homes with their expensive[8] and harmful 'Smart' Meters.[9] The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is supposed to be regulating telecom companies and protecting the public[10]. Instead, they are also forcing[11] all this harmful[12] invasive technology on us. Referring to them a 'Captured Agency[13]' seems accurate and appropriate.

The email came within days of a blistering speech Mr. Soros delivered that month at the World Economic Forum, attacking Facebook and Google as a \u201cmenace\u201d to society and calling for the companies to be regulated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ms. Sandberg \u2014 who was at the forum, but was not present for Mr. Soros\u2019s speech, according to a person who attended it \u2014 requested an examination into why Mr. Soros had criticized the tech companies and whether he stood to gain financially from the attacks. At the time, Facebook was under growing scrutiny for the role its platform had played in disseminating Russian propaganda and fomenting campaigns of hatred in Myanmar and other countries.</p><p>Facebook later commissioned a campaign-style opposition research effort by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/technology/definers-public-affairs-tim-miller.html\">Definers Public Affairs</url>, a Republican-linked firm, which gathered and circulated to reporters public information about Mr. Soros\u2019s funding of American advocacy groups critical of Facebook.</p><p>Those efforts, revealed this month in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html\">a New York Times investigation</url>, set off a public relations debacle for Ms. Sandberg and for Facebook, which was accused of trafficking in anti-Semitic attacks against the billionaire. Facebook quickly       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/technology/facebook-definers-soros.html\">fired Definers</url>.</p><p>The people with knowledge of Ms. Sandberg\u2019s email asked for anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the message and feared retribution.</p><p>In a statement, Facebook said that the company had already begun researching Mr. Soros when Ms. Sandberg made her request.</p><p>\u201cMr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,\u201d the company said. \u201cThat research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook\u2019s stock.\u201d The company said that while Ms. Sandberg \u201ctakes full responsibility for any activity that happened on her watch,\u201d she did not personally direct any research on Freedom from Facebook, an anti-Facebook coalition whose members were among the subjects of Definers\u2019 later work.</p><p>Eddie Vale, a spokesman for Freedom from Facebook, said he was skeptical of the company\u2019s account.</p><p>\u201cIn light of Sandberg\u2019s continuously changing story on the Soros research, there\u2019s no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value,\u201d Mr. Vale said. \u201cFacebook must immediately release any emails and any research about targeting the Freedom from Facebook coalition or any member organizations.\u201d</p><p>The revelation complicates Ms. Sandberg\u2019s shifting explanations of her role in Facebook\u2019s decisions to hire Definers and go on the offensive against the social network\u2019s growing legion of critics. Ms. Sandberg at first denied knowing that Facebook had hired Definers, before <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/business/on-thanksgiving-eve-facebook-acknowledges-details-of-times-investigation.html\">acknowledging in a post last week</url> that some of the company\u2019s work for Facebook had crossed her desk.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/11/elliot-schrage-on-definers/\">In that post</url>, Ms. Sandberg did not explicitly deny that she had asked for research into Mr. Soros. Instead, a deputy who oversaw the communications team but is now leaving the company, Elliot J. Schrage, took responsibility for hiring Definers and initiating Definers\u2019 investigation into Mr. Soros. It is unclear what, if any, involvement Ms. Sandberg had in that ultimate response to Mr. Soros.</p><p>\u201cWe had not heard such criticism from him before and wanted to determine if he had any financial motivation,\u201d Mr. Schrage said of Mr. Soros. \u201cDefiners researched this using public information.\u201d</p><p>Facebook has defended its inquiries into Mr. Soros as a prudent and necessary step for any public company under attack by a high-profile figure \u2014 particularly one like Mr. Soros, a onetime currency trader who made a fortune in the 1990s betting against the British pound.</p><p>But the revelations are likely to escalate pressure on Ms. Sandberg, an embattled Silicon Valley star and feminist author.</p><p>The Times investigation found that Ms. Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, had ignored warnings about abuse on the platform and sought to conceal from public view evidence that Russia had used it to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign and help elect President Trump. The Times also found that when Facebook was confronted last spring with revelations that the privacy of tens of millions of users had been compromised by Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-linked data firm, Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Zuckerberg sought to downplay the problem and deflect blame.</p><p>But it is Ms. Sandberg who oversees Facebook\u2019s policy and communications arms, which starting last year embarked on a hard-edged lobbying campaign to discredit the company\u2019s critics and push back on the growing chorus of voices calling for Facebook and other big tech companies to be broken up or more tightly regulated.</p><p>Some have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/16/jeffrey-sonnenfeld-facebook-should-probably-replacesheryl-sandberg.html\">called on</url> Ms. Sandberg to be fired. Last week\u2019s admission by Mr. Schrage \u2014 a Sandberg confidante who announced in June that he was leaving the company \u2014 was widely viewed inside and outside the company as an effort to insulate her from damage.</p><p>Facebook hired Definers last year to monitor media coverage and then expanded its role to include campaign-style research and other public relations work.</p><p>In a private meeting on Thursday, Ms. Sandberg again distanced herself from Definers and its research into Mr. Soros, according to Rashad Robinson, head of the racial-justice group Color of Change, which was named in a Definers memo about Mr. Soros.</p><p>Mr. Robinson said that while meeting with Ms. Sandberg, she denied hiring Definers or directing the firm\u2019s research.</p><p>\u201cShe very much placed it on the now departed communications chief\u201d \u2014 Mr. Schrage \u2014 \u201cand also worked to assure us that Joel Kaplan had nothing to do with it either,\u201d Mr. Robinson said. Mr. Kaplan is the company\u2019s vice president of global public policy.</p><p>Mr. Robinson said he was pleased Ms. Sandberg had agreed to release a progress report on a previously announced internal audit into how Facebook\u2019s policies affected minority users and employees. But when he pushed for more on Facebook\u2019s involvement with Definers, Mr. Robinson said, Ms. Sandberg kept stressing that Facebook had fired the firm.</p><p>\u201cWe were not satisfied with that answer,\u201d he said.</p><p>Follow Nicholas Confessore and Matthew Rosenberg on Twitter: @nickconfessore @AllMattNYT Reporting was contributed by Sheera Frenkel, Jack Nicas, Cecilia Kang and Mike Isaac. </p><p>PHOTO: Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, wanted to know whether George Soros stood to gain from criticizing the company, according to people with knowledge of an email she sent.

The email came within days of a blistering speech Soros delivered that month at the World Economic Forum, attacking Facebook and Google as a \"menace\" to society and calling for the companies to be regulated.</p><p>Sandberg, who was at the forum - but was not present for Soros' speech, according to a person who attended it - asked for an examination into why Soros had criticized the tech companies and whether he stood to gain financially from the attacks. At the time, Facebook was under growing scrutiny for the role its platform had played in disseminating Russian propaganda and fomenting campaigns of hatred in Myanmar and other countries.</p><p>Facebook morale, hurt by dropping shares, suffers another hit after yet another corporate scandal( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/personal-tech/facebook-morale-hurt-by-share-drop-suffers-another-hit\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/personal-tech/facebook-morale-hurt-by-share-drop-suffers-another-hit</url> )</p><p>Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's reputation has been stained by one crisis after another( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/personal-tech/facebooks-sheryl-sandberg-is-tainted-by-crisis-after-crisis\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/personal-tech/facebooks-sheryl-sandberg-is-tainted-by-crisis-after-crisis</url> )</p><p>Facebook chooses Canada for launch of its new dating service, but privacy concerns abound( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/personal-tech/facebook-chooses-canada-for-dating-feature-launch-but-privacy-concerns-abound\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/personal-tech/facebook-chooses-canada-for-dating-feature-launch-but-privacy-concerns-abound</url> )</p><p>Facebook later commissioned a campaign-style opposition research effort by Definers Public Affairs, a Republican-linked firm, which gathered and circulated to reporters public information about Soros' funding of several U.S. advocacy groups critical of Facebook.</p><p>Those efforts, revealed this month in a New York Times investigation, set off a public relations debacle for Sandberg and for Facebook, which was accused of trafficking in anti-Semitic attacks against the billionaire. Facebook quickly fired Definers.</p><p>The people with knowledge of Sandberg's email asked for anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the message and feared retribution.</p><p>In a statement, Facebook said the company had already begun researching Soros when Sandberg made her request.</p><p>\"Mr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,\" the company said. \"That research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook's stock.\" The company said that while Sandberg \"takes full responsibility for any activity that happened on her watch,\" she did not personally direct any research on Freedom from Facebook, an anti-Facebook coalition whose members were among the subjects of Definers' later work.</p><p>Eddie Vale, a spokesman for Freedom from Facebook, said he was skeptical of the company's account.</p><p>\"In light of Sandberg's continuously changing story on the Soros research, there's no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value,\" Vale said. \"Facebook must immediately release any emails and any research about targeting the Freedom from Facebook coalition or any member organizations.\"</p><p>The revelation complicates Sandberg's shifting explanations of her role in Facebook's decisions to hire Definers and go on the offensive against the social network's growing legion of critics. Sandberg at first denied knowing that Facebook had hired Definers, before acknowledging in a post last week that some of the company's work for Facebook had crossed her desk.</p><p>In that post, Sandberg did not explicitly deny that she had asked for research into Soros. Instead, a deputy who oversaw the communications team but is now leaving the company, Elliot J. Schrage, took responsibility for hiring Definers and initiating Definers' investigation into Soros. It is unclear what, if any, involvement Sandberg had in that ultimate response to Soros.</p><p>\"We had not heard such criticism from him before and wanted to determine if he had any financial motivation,\" Schrage said of Soros. \"Definers researched this using public information.\"</p><p>Facebook has defended its inquiries into Soros as a prudent and necessary step for any public company under attack by a high-profile figure - particularly one such as Soros.</p><p>But the revelations are likely to escalate pressure on Sandberg, an embattled Silicon Valley star and feminist author.</p><p>The Times investigation found that Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, had ignored warnings about abuse on the platform and sought to conceal from public view evidence that Russia had used it to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign and help elect Donald Trump. The Times also found that when Facebook was confronted last spring with revelations that the privacy of tens of millions of users had been compromised by Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-linked data firm, Sandberg and Zuckerberg sought to downplay the problem and deflect blame.</p><p>But it is Sandberg who oversees Facebook's policy and communications arms, which, starting last year, embarked on a hard-edged lobbying campaign to discredit the company's critics and push back on the growing chorus of voices calling for Facebook and other big tech companies to be broken up or more tightly regulated.</p><p>Some have called on Sandberg to be fired. Last week's admission by Schrage - a Sandberg confidante who announced in June that he was leaving the company - was widely viewed inside and outside the company as an effort to insulate her from damage.</p><p>Facebook hired Definers last year to monitor media coverage and then expanded its role to include campaign-style research and other public relations work.</p><p>In a private meeting Thursday, Sandberg again distanced herself from Definers and its research into Soros, according to Rashad Robinson, head of the racial-justice group Color of Change, which was named in a Definers memo about Soros.</p><p>Robinson said that while meeting with Sandberg, she denied hiring Definers or directing the firm's research.</p><p>\"She very much placed it on the now departed communications chief\" - Schrage - \"and also worked to assure us that Joel Kaplan had nothing to do with it either,\" Robinson said. Kaplan is the company's vice-president of global public policy.</p><p>Robinson said he was pleased Sandberg had agreed to release a progress report on a previously announced internal audit into how Facebook's policies affected minority users and employees. But when he pushed for more on Facebook's involvement with Definers, Robinson said, Sandberg kept stressing that Facebook had fired the firm.</p><p>\"We were not satisfied with that answer,\" he said. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Sandberg at first denied knowing that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had hired Definers, before acknowledging in a post last week that some of the company's work for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had crossed her desk.</p><p>In that post, Sandberg did not explicitly deny that she had asked for research into Soros. Instead, a deputy who oversaw the communications team but is now leaving the company, Elliot J. Schrage, took responsibility for hiring Definers and initiating Definers' investigation into Soros. It is unclear what, if any, involvement Sandberg had in that ultimate response to Soros.</p><p>\"We had not heard such criticism from him before and wanted to determine if he had any financial motivation,\" Schrage said of Soros. \"Definers researched this using public information.\"</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has defended its inquiries into Soros as a prudent and necessary step for any public company under attack by a high-profile figure - particularly one such as Soros.</p><p>But the revelations are likely to escalate pressure on Sandberg, an embattled Silicon Valley star and feminist author.</p><p>The Times investigation found that Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg, <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>chief executive, had ignored warnings about abuse on the platform and sought to conceal from public view evidence that Russia had used it to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign and help elect Donald Trump. The Times also found that when <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was confronted last spring with revelations that the privacy of tens of millions of users had been compromised by Cambridge Analytica, a Trump-linked data firm, Sandberg and Zuckerberg sought to downplay the problem and deflect blame.</p><p>But it is Sandberg who oversees <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>policy and communications arms, which, starting last year, embarked on a hard-edged lobbying campaign to discredit the company's critics and push back on the growing chorus of voices calling for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other big tech companies to be broken up or more tightly regulated.</p><p>Some have called on Sandberg to be fired. Last week's admission by Schrage - a Sandberg confidante who announced in June that he was leaving the company - was widely viewed inside and outside the company as an effort to insulate her from damage.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>hired Definers last year to monitor media coverage and then expanded its role to include campaign-style research and other public relations work.</p><p>In a private meeting Thursday, Sandberg again distanced herself from Definers and its research into Soros, according to Rashad Robinson, head of the racial-justice group Color of Change, which was named in a Definers memo about Soros.</p><p>Robinson said that while meeting with Sandberg, she denied hiring Definers or directing the firm's research.</p><p>\"She very much placed it on the now departed communications chief\" - Schrage - \"and also worked to assure us that Joel Kaplan had nothing to do with it either,\" Robinson said. Kaplan is the company's vice-president of global public policy.</p><p>Robinson said he was pleased Sandberg had agreed to release a progress report on a previously announced internal audit into how <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>policies affected minority users and employees. But when he pushed for more on <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>involvement with Definers, Robinson said, Sandberg kept stressing that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>had fired the firm.</p><p>\"We were not satisfied with that answer,\" he said. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Sandberg was speaking at the annual DLD Conference in Munich, Germany. While onstage, Sandberg announced the company would donate $7.5 million for the creation[1]of The Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence. </p><p>And she unveiled a partnership with the German government around election security. But in terms of her larger mission, did she change any minds? Watch the 20-minute talk here and see if you are persuaded by this latest act of contrition: [embedded content] Here is a little summary and some highlights of Sandberg's remarks: 'We need both optimism and courage,' she said. 'Because not everyone shares the values we stand for. The very idea of an open and connected world, where people can use technology to empower themselves, is in some ways under attack from people who want to spread misinformation, from hackers who want personal gain, from countries who want to interfere with elections, or want to quite voices or control their own people.' Also: 'At Facebook, these last few years have been really difficult,' Sandberg said. 'We know we need to do better at making sure we can contain the risks that come from connecting so many people. We need to stop abuse more quickly and we need to do more to protect people's data. Trust is fundamental to the work we do, and we need to earn back people's trust.' She listed five areas were Facebook is focused on improving:Safety: The company now has 30,000 people working in this area, 3 times more than in 2017. And it's building new technology, including using AI, to more quickly identify issues. 'If you want to know what a company cares about, look at where it's spending its money,' Sandberg said 'We are spending billions of dollars a year on security.' Election interference: She acknowledged that Facebook failed in 2016 to understand how the threat had shifted from governments trying to access information to governments trying to use the platform to sow dissent and spread misinformation. She pointed to the new German partnership on elections, and said the company continues to scrutinize groups and pages for bad actors. Fake accounts: 'We're blocking more than one million fake accounts every day, sometimes just when they are created,' she said. Data protection: 'We did not do a good job managing our platform,' she said 'People trust us with their data and we have to protect it.' Transparency: 'It allows other people to hold us accountable,' she said. The company has rolled out new tools that people see who is running ads, she noted.Somewhat awkwardly, Sandberg also touched on the issue of regulation, saying the company understands that it's likely headed toward an era where fear of big tech companies is going to lead to new restrictions. She said Facebook would support the 'right' regulations and that governments have a role to play in protecting citizens. Though it seems doubtful many governments were seeking Facebook's permission to regulate it, or to validate the existence of elected representatives.

The company ramped up its engagement with governments around the world to prevent election interference and launched a verification program with third-party fact-checkers to reduce the spread of hoaxes.</p><p>During a 45-minute conversation, Ms. Sandberg addressed topics including data privacy, growing calls for regulation of big tech companies and Facebook's current approach to mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg's appearance comes amid increasing scrutiny of big tech companies by government regulators.</p><p>Facebook is being scrutinized by investigators at the U.S.</p><p> Federal Trade Commission, and the Justice Department is preparing an antitrust investigation of Alphabet Inc.'s Google.</p><p>Ms. Sandberg said that Facebook is calling for some regulation of the companyechoing an op-ed by Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg published in the Washington Post earlier this yearadding that Europe's General Data Protection Regulation policy is a \"good blueprint\" for U.</p><p>S. lawmaking.</p><p>\"We are very much trying to usher in the next era,\" Ms. Sandberg said.</p><p> \"We are very much working with governments to write the right rules.\"During the question-and-answer session, Ms.</p><p> Sandberg also addressed calls by critics for antitrust action against Facebook. Antitrust action is meant to preserve choices for consumers, Ms.</p><p> Sandberg said, and Facebook users already have a variety of alternatives for social networking.\"Absolutely you could share [a photo] on Instagram, but you could also share it on other services,\" Ms.</p><p> Sandberg said.Toward the end of the conversation, Ms.</p><p> Sandberg said that Facebook doesn't have any big acquisitions in the pipeline currently but noted that Facebook has made small acquisitions in the past. Instagram only had 13 employees when it was acquired, Ms.</p><p> Sandberg said, an example of a small company that grew quickly after it was acquired by Facebook.Although Ms.</p><p> Sandberg experienced challenges during her tenure as chief operating officer of Facebook, she said that she stayed at the company through the recent tumult because she felt a responsibility to fix the social network's problems.\"Through all of it I really believe so deeply in what happens on Facebook,\" she said.</p><p>Source: The Wall Street Journal</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">XINFIN-XINFINAGY21062019020310</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">XINFIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCX-3XJ1-JCH9-G4NK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433732</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Xinhua Finance Agency (AP) Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Xinhua Financial News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 21, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>LIONS CLUBS INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

She and her friends from California State University, Channel Islands packed into the Borderline Bar and Grill in Thousand Oaks. They went there to unwind several times a week, especially on Wednesdays for the bar\u2019s popular college night.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The evening at the wood-paneled bar began with a live D.J., lots of plaid, line-dancing and clinking drinks. It ended with Ms. Wong hiding as a gunman dressed in all black unleashed a wave of bullets, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/shooting-california-thousand-oaks.html\">killing at least 12 people</url> and sending her friends scattering in the mayhem. Ms. Wong spent her birthday hiding instead of dancing, fearing for her life instead of celebrating it.</p><p>\u201cI was in there the whole time,\u201d she said, stunned for words.</p><p>Several survivors described the beginning of the shooting as a blur of chaos, panic and bullets. Sarah DeSon, 19, who was with Ms. Wong, said the club suddenly filled with smoke. They saw the gunman draw his gun at the front, and they ducked for cover as a rapid clip of bullets spread through the bar. As Ms. DeSon ran outside, she said, several bodies were sprawled out on the floor.</p><p>Hours after the shooting, Ms. Wong and four girlfriends were reunited at a nearby gas station where they filled one another in on what each had experienced that night: where they hid during the shooting, how they got out, the dry heaving one experienced afterward and the friends they hadn\u2019t heard from yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry your birthday got ruined,\u201d Ms. DeSon told Ms. Wong, still in a daze.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive, though. She\u2019s alive for her 21st birthday,\u201d added Teylor Whittler, 19, who said she was dragged out of the bar by a stranger.</p><p>Ms. DeSon said she believed she survived the shooting because of the quick reaction of a friend, Cody Coffman.</p><p>\u201cHe was protecting everyone,\u201d Ms. DeSon said. \u201cHe got up and he just yelled, \u2018Everyone, run!\u2019\u201d</p><p>Later on Thursday, they learned their friend Mr. Coffman was among <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/08/us/thousand-oaks-shooting-victims.html\">those who were killed</url>.</p><p>Were you or someone you know at Borderline Bar and Grill when the shooting occurred?

Authored by Sarah Cowgill via LibertyNation.com,[3] The seedier side of the internet gained notoriety with the juggernaut of illicit online products and services, Silk Road, which promised to protect users' privacy. Sextrafficking[4], human smuggling, murder for hire, body parts for sale - all had a welcome place. As the dark web flourished, the feds began to frown on selling arms and legs on the open market. </p><p>So Silk Road was officially put out of business in 2014 \u2014 but not before averaging $15 million in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency transactions annually.    General rule of thumb: Stay off the dark web.  But any enterprising person can use Facebook and Twitter to purchase firearms, falsified identification documents, and illicit drugs of choice under the radar. You can even fund-raise for a terror attack. That's all thanks to the 1996 Communications Decency Act Section 230 (CDA230), which says: 'No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.'  In other words, theseonline intermediaries[5]- Twitter, Instagram, Codias, Facebook - cannot be held responsible for what their users say or do. Intermediaries are defined as Internet Service Providers (ISPs), interactive computer service providers, and any outfit that publishes third-party content. It is essentially a protection of free speech.  Trading Freedom For Law Enforcement?  The Alliance to Counter Crime Online (ACCO) is on the front lines of combing through the terror lurking on the everyday user's laptop, phone, and pad. According to its research data, 'more than one third of the world is on social media' and '25% of user profiles are Avatars,' allowing for additional shielding from prying law enforcement eyes.  ACCO isn't shy in assessing Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, as Gretchen Peters, ACCO's executive director, states:  'We believe Internet firms should become liable, much like financial institutions, for removing crime and terror activity from their systems, and that they should be sharing data about illicit activity proactively with law enforcement, and not deleting the scene of the crime.'  ACCO reports Hezbollah openly ran an 'equip a jihadi' fundraiser on Twitter, boasting of using the funds to attack Israel. Mexican cartels use Facebook as a platform to launder money, move drugs, and hire hits on enemies. And at this point in the online community, the social platforms can't keep up with the illegal traffic - although their efforts are valiant. Facebook has removed 1.5 million drug sales posts in the six months since amending its standards of enforcement policy, which is more than the Silk Road hosted during its entire unsavory run.  But imagine the transactions that they aren't catching: That should send goosebumps skittering down the spine.  In 1996, when CDA230 was enacted, there were only 100,000 websites, just 20 million American adults had access to the internet - which was dial-up - and Google had yet to exist. Could today and the future have even been contemplated?  Although CDA230 grants sweeping immunities to a single industry, there are limits and amendments. Instead of terrorist fundraising, however, restrictions are geared more toward copyright infringement. Section 230 was changed last year to damper the burgeoning human acquisitions and sales industry and in 2018 to add compliance to the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, which required social platforms to remove any material in violation of sex-trafficking laws.    Why Mess With Success?  TheFirst Amendment[6]was written at a time when today's mediums of communication and ensured anonymity behind a keyboard could not have been imagined. And some critics are seeking an overhaul in the onlylegalself-regulating industry.  As ACCO requests Congress to saddle the big-tech giants with responsibility, are we abandoning the tenets of free speech or protecting the vulnerable from unforeseen dangers on the internet?  Frankly, messing with freedom of speech is a slippery slope best left untraveled; once breached, there will be no end to alterations and reversals of basic rights. Perhaps asking the fox - in this case social media platforms - to guard the chicken coop is a foolish entreaty sure to fail. Demanding they simply remove content that isillegal in real lifeshould be an easy enough rule to implement without restricting the flow of information or prohibiting freedom of thought, opinion, and beliefs.

While the baton was passed briefly on Monday, it most likely won't be long until Microsoft is firmly entrenched again as No. 1 in the world. </p><p>This won't be surprising to regular readers, but it will be to people whose opinion about Microsoft was frozen in the days of the Zune and annoying Clippy. So how did Microsoft's stock market value climb to the top of the mountain?The near-term reason is Microsoft has been less damaged by US stock investors' recent reversal of optimism about tech companies, which had been rewarded for fast growth above all else. And longer term, Microsoft has continued to roll as the go-to shepherd for corporate clients anxiously navigating technology changes in their industries. Microsoft is the tortoise in a technology world obsessed with hares. We know how that race turned out.Microsoft this year has steadily passed Google parent company Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and now Apple by stock market value. Since a stock market rout in October battered big tech stocks around the world, Microsoft shares have sidestepped much of the carnage. Its shares dipped 8.5 percent since the end of September compared with 22 percent for Amazon and 25 percent for Apple. It won't be a surprise to tech enthusiasts that in the nearly five years under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has focused on its strengths and taken advantage of corporations' desire for help navigating technology changes. Microsoft has refashioned its products and how it sells them to capitalize on businesses' desire to buy technology that helps future-proof their workforces and operations. And that goes not only for Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing service -- which competes with Amazon in helping businesses move digital file storage or website operations out of owned, hard-to-update farms of corporate computers -- but also Microsoft's longstanding Office bundle of software, its database technology and its software for corporate sales departments. Even personal computers are having a mini-renaissance of late, which has helped Microsoft. What Nadella has done isn't a revolution, like Ford trying to become a 'mobility' company instead of simply selling cars. Microsoft has increased revenue, profits and relevance by becoming even more Microsoft-y -- doubling down on its products for businesses and slimming or ditching its efforts in the up-and-down areas of consumer technology like smartphones. It's a tough contest, but if I'm picking the most effective big technology company CEO of the last five years, I'd take Nadella over Jeff Bezos of Amazon. No large technology company has operated as effectively both technologically and financially over that period. It's also true that Microsoft's recent rise up the stock market rankings has a lot to do with what the company is not. It's not Facebook and Google -- two giants caught up in vortexes about their advertising and data-harvesting business models and dealing with regulatory pressures around the world. It's not Amazon, a company valued largely on growth that hasn't been so hot lately. And it doesn't generate most of its sales from a flatlining market, as Apple does in smartphones. Nor is Microsoft tied up much in the US-China trade tussle. As tech shares have been battered in the recent US stock market downturn, other companies that mostly sell products to businesses rather than consumers, pay fairly large dividends and generate rich profits, such as Cisco and Oracle, also haven't been hurt as much as Amazon and Google.I've written before, however, that investor enthusiasm about Microsoft may have gotten carried away. The company's stock now trades at about 22 times the company's estimated earnings over the next four quarters, according to Bloomberg data. The last time Microsoft shares were this expensive for a long period of time, 'The Passion of the Christ' was drawing lines at movie multiplexes.As Monday's ascent up the stock market rankings shows, investors long ago caught onto Microsoft's strengths, even if there's still a whiff of Zune hangover in the public imagination. It's time to kill the disrespect for Microsoft for good.

Zillow used census data to figure out where workers at corporate headquarters live and found that, on average, employees of Google, Facebook, and Apple live in homes with a median value of well over $1 million[2]. The gap between tech workers' home values and others' has been widening as of late. &lt;nl/&gt; Of course, as the Journal notes, zoning laws and regulatory red tape are key to price rises as well. They pointed to markets like Seattle and Austin that have plenty of tech workers but less dramatic price increases. And while the average employee of a major tech company's home is worth hundreds of thousands dollars more than other Bay Area homes, it's even more startling to compare those homes to the rest of the country. The average Apple worker now lives in a home that is worth more than five times a much as the average home in the United States. &lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;\u00b7 Apple Paychecks--One Reason for High Home Prices[3] [Wall Street Journal]&lt;nl/&gt;\u00b7 There Goes the Neighborhood[4] [Zillow]&lt;nl/&gt;

President Donald Trump has (TWTR), putting tech giants in legal and regulatory crosshairs that are likely to outlast the current election cycle.Democrats and Republicans alike voice increasing antipathy over sweeping liability protections that 230 affords to all online platforms \u2014 including (FB), , YouTube (GOOG) (GOOGL). All told, experts say it\u2019s becoming clear that change is coming.\u201cIf Trump is reelected, frankly even if he isn\u2019t reelected, you might see variations on this proposal coming into some type of effect next year, with a shocking level of bipartisan support,\u201d Florida\u2019s former consumer protection czar, Richard Lawson, told Yahoo Finance recently. It\u2019s happened before. Back in 2018, bipartisan action on Section 230 created a carve out that removed immunity for user content promoting or facilitating sex trafficking of minors.   \u201cThe fact that they would come together is huge,\u201d Lawson said, speaking of the 2018 change.  In the wake of ongoing efforts by lawmakers and the Trump administration to claw back the protections, some say that\u2019s reason enough for all companies with an online presence to seriously assess the cost of the law\u2019s potential makeover.\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of liability at risk,\u201d according to Rob McDowell, a former Federal Communications Commissioner (FCC) under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and partner at Cooley LLP.  \u2018Something\u2019s probably going to happen\u2019Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) speaks during an oversight hearing to examine the Federal Communications Commission on June 24, 2020 in Washington,DC. - The hearing was held by the Senate Committee for Commerce, Science, and Transportation. (Photo by Alex Wong / POOL / AFP) (Photo by ALEX WONG/POOL/AFP via )The Trump administration has twice targeted Section 230 in the space of a month. The first was a controversial executive order that, in theory, would hand power to the FCC to reinterpret the statute; the second was via legislative \u201creform proposals\u201d published by the Department of Justice (DOJ).Yet independent of what the president may or may not accomplish, Congress is also growing restive, with Democrats and Republicans teaming up on bills to address the law\u2019s perceived shortcomings. In June, Senators Brian Schatz (D-HI) and John Thune (R-SD) introduced the \u201cPACT Act,\u201d which would expose platforms to federal civil claims, and allow users to appeal a platform\u2019s moderation actions.Separately, the Senate\u2019s \u201cEARN IT Act\u201d \u2014 introduced by South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham (R-SC), with backing from Connecticut\u2019s Richard Blumenthal and other Democrats \u2014 is headed to the full Senate for debate.The measure seeks to remove the liability shield for platforms that fail to meet standards for preventing sexual exploitation of children by the government or platforms. However, security and privacy experts argue the bill\u2019s stated purpose is a backdoor way to rob platforms and their users of encrypted communication.  House Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) has said he\u2019s working on legislation that would impose additional responsibility on companies earning more than $1 billion in annual revenue. In February, Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) introduced legislation that would remove liability protections for Big Tech companies that knowingly publish false political advertisements.All of which suggests that the writing appears to be on the wall, according to Cooley\u2019s McDowell \u2014 especially as a mix of political bedfellows join forces.  \u201cIf you have Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Mark Warner, Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), Sen. Mike Lee, all coming together...something\u2019s probably going to happen,\u201d he said.  Change that could be costly Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott TPX IMAGES OF THE DAYNew changes are unlikely before next year. Yet platforms across industries can count on a host of rising compliance costs if user content must be policed more aggressively \u2014 and to defend against ensuing lawsuits.\u201cThe cost of [platforms] actually having to meet the level of granularity that\u2019s expected by some of these regulators -- that\u2019s where the tension lies,\u201d Peter Hyun, a Section 230 expert and partner at Wiley LLP who once served as chief counsel to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA).  Legal experts say it\u2019s unclear how big of a war chest companies will need, as it would depend on the nature of a platform\u2019s business, and how significantly any changes shift liability.  While it\u2019s hard to put numbers on it, big platforms \u201ccould potentially be facing millions of dollars in damages costs, depending on what the actual changes to the law are, and they could be spending millions of dollars on increased moderation costs,\u201d according to James Rosenfeld, an attorney who handles defense of 230 claims for major media and tech companies, and previously for Yahoo Finance.  He explained that from a defense perspective, one advantage of 230 is it wipes out the bulk of user-generated, content-based claims in the early stages of litigation.  \u201cSo it cuts your bills a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a single case goes forward, it could be several hundred thousand dollars to millions of dollars to defend.\u201dAdditional responsibility would require platforms to scale up on content moderation. , for example, pays around that make between $16 and $18 per hour. Collectively, they wade through around 3 million posts per day.Meanwhile, back in 2017, Google announced plans to build out its moderation team with at least 10,000 by 2018. And according to Reuters, \u2019s content moderation arm is comprised of about 1,500 workers.\u2018A monumental shift\u2019Jade Giltrap, head of the media coverage team for cyber insurance provider CFC, explained that even under the current wide-ranging shield, platforms do purchase coverage for claims arising from user-generated content. That includes coverage for defamation, duty of care, intellectual property, and privacy.  \u201cIt\u2019s a defense, not a right,\u201d Giltrap said of the practical application of 230. Accordingly, \u201cthe law\u2019s protection doesn\u2019t kick in from a monetary perspective until a company needs to invoke it as a defense.\u201d  Premiums to defend such claims vary widely, and depend on a platform\u2019s revenue, level of reliance on user-generated content, and lawsuit history. Big Tech platforms that do rely heavily on user generated content, Giltrap said, would tend to face higher premiums. However, they also tend to curb coverage costs through self-insurance and robust in-house legal teams that handle smaller claims, she said.  She added that an errors and omissions policy with a $10 million cap can run well into six figures for a larger online platform, and around $7,500 to $10,000 for small firms. But all that would change under a less comprehensive 230 liability shield.  \u201cWhere these platforms stop becoming only a conduit, and become responsible for most or all of the content on on their platforms, that is a monumental shift, because it doesn't allow for them to adequately control that risk,\u201d Giltrap said. \u201cThey can't control all of their content that moves through their sites.\u201d moderation responsibility is exactly what most proposals to amend 230 have in mind.  Under the DOJ\u2019s proposals, platforms would face civil liability if they purposefully facilitate third party content that violates federal criminal law.  According to Wiley\u2019s Hyun, one problem with that standard is that it tasks platforms with identifying potentially criminal content, as well as guessing what users intended when they posted it. That\u2019s because criminal violations depend on the state of mind of the alleged violator, he said.  A cyberstalking threat posted to social media, for example, could be an obvious threat to the perpetrator who posted it, yet undetectable as such by platform moderators.  Even for experienced prosecutors and investigators, Hyun said that \u201cpainstaking\u201d effort goes into uncovering enough evidence to allege the level of intent required for a single criminal lawsuit to go forward, based on a user\u2019s online speech.  \u201cThat makes it incredibly difficult when you then try to assign that role to a company,\u2019\u201d Hyun said.   The DOJ also wants to permit civil suits against platforms for content-based claims that address a broad array of cyber crimes, and permit government-initiated civil enforcement actions to \u201cprotect citizens from harmful and illicit content.\u201cThe department also aims to remove the phrase \u201cotherwise objectionable\u201d \u2014 something that\u2019s long given platforms liability-free wiggle room to perform \u201cgood faith\u201d content moderation. A redefinition of \u201cgood faith\u201d would mean only moderation that adheres to a platform\u2019s own terms of service.Trump\u2019s Executive OrderThis illustration photo shows a woman in Los Angeles looking at the official account of US President Donald Trump on June 23, 2020, with a tweet by the president which considered \"abusive\" and hid it. - on Tuesday hid a tweet from President Donald Trump in which he threatened to use \"serious force\" against protestors in the US capital, saying it broke rules over abusive content. The move appeared to be the first by against the president for an \"abusive\" tweet. In a growing dispute, the platform has recently labeled other Trump tweets as misleading and violating its standards on promoting violence. (Photo by - / AFP) (Photo by -/AFP via )Trump\u2019s executive order takes a different approach. It looks to hand power to the FCC to reinterpret and issue rules for Section 230, and to the FTC to police content moderation under its authority to enforce unfair and deceptive trade practices.Because 230 extends no authority to either agency, McDowell said efforts to carry out the executive order would probably face legal challenges. On the other hand, the agencies, both independent of the executive branch, could choose to ignore the order altogether.  \u201cYou don\u2019t want the FCC to legislate,\u201d McDowell said. Absent action by the FCC, the FTC could still pursue enforcement action that could prove costly for platforms to defend, even though the agency lacks effective tools for penalizing alleged bad actors, according to McDowell.  Although some proposals to weaken 230 protections may lack teeth, the attorney cautions that the mere contemplation of altering the law dredges up intangible costs.  \u201cThere\u2019s a big unknown here. There are opportunity costs with the inhibition to innovate, or the chilling of taking positive, constructive risks with a new business idea, or with a post,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s harder to measure. What technologies or services don\u2019t happen if this law is changed?\u201d  Lawson echoed the point, saying the current crop of platforms are essentially a creation of Congress passing CDA 230. \u201cThis massive growth really probably could not have happened if all of this time all of these websites were having to have armies of lawyers and other people, vetting the content.\u201d  Newer platforms, and not Big Tech, tend to be the entities that test the waters on 230\u2019s reach, Giltrap said. That is because they are more likely to introduce leading-edge technologies that push its boundaries.  Rosenfeld said any changes should be looked at broadly \u2014 not just in terms of what they can do to Big Tech and companies with an in-line presence, but at how those changes will impact people's experiences on the internet.  So far, most alterations to 230 have taken shape through interpretations of the law, by courts, without intervention from lawmakers and administration officials. Still, they do they do shift risk for online platforms. A recent Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case, for example, held that a software company could not use the law as a shield to block content moderation that amounted to anticompetitive behavior.  \u201cThat\u2019s sort of the first gap in the armor,\u201d McDowell said.Alexis Keenan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But you must watch it, share it, email it. And come to my talk on August 15th in NYC, [1]it's time to war council.[embedded content]Professor Robert Epstein told Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) that Google is manipulating voters 'on a massive scale,' using tools that it has at its disposal exclusively, and that 'no one can counteract them.' Epstein warned the Senator of big tech election meddling that he called 'invisible,' 'subliminal,' and more powerful than anything he's seen in 40 years of behavioral sciences. </p><p>Epstein \u2014 who said that he personally supported and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 \u2014 testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, where he told Sen. Cruz that Google election meddling gave Hillary Clinton at least 2.6 million additional votes in the 2016 election and said that figure is even way too low. 'The 2.6 million is a rock bottom minimum,' said Epstein, 'The range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes, depending on how aggressively they use the techniques that I've been studying now for six and a half years \u2014 such as the search engine manipulation effect, the search suggestion effect, the answer bot effect, and a number of others.' 'They control these and no one can counteract them,' added the professor, 'These are not competitive, these are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively.' 'I believe in democracy, I believe in a free and fair election more than I have any kind of allegiance to a candidate or a party,' affirmed Epstein on Tuesday. 'In 2020 \u2014 if all these companies are supporting the same candidate \u2014 there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge, and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace.' Epstein elaborated on his assertion by describing an example involving Facebook. If [in 2016] Mark Zuckerberg, for example, had chosen to send out a 'Go Vote' reminder, say, just to Democrats \u2014 and no one would have known if he had done this \u2014 that would have given that day an additional \u2014 at least 450,000 votes to Democrats, and we know this without doubt, because of Facebook's own published data \u2014 they did an experiment that they can tell anyone about during the 2010 election \u2014 they published it in 2012, it had 60 million Facebook users involved. They sent out a 'Go Vote' reminder, and they got something like 360,000 more people to get off their sofas and go vote, who otherwise would have stayed home. The point is, I don't think that Mr. Zuckerberg sent out that reminder in 2016, I think he was overconfident, I think Google was overconfident, all these companies were. I don't think he sent that out \u2014 without monitoring systems in place, we'll never know what these companies are doing \u2014 but the point is, in 2018, I'm sure they were more aggressive, we have lots of data to support that. 'And in 2020, you can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out,' continued Epstein, 'And the methods that they're using are invisible, they'resubliminal, they're more powerful than most \u2014 any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences, and I've been in thebehavioral sciences for almost 40 years.' 'What you are testifying to is that a handful ofSilicon Valley billionaires and giant corporations are able to spend millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars collectively, massively influencing the results of elections?' asked Cruz. 'Senator, with respect, I must correct you,' replied Epstein, 'If Mark Zuckerberg chooses to send out a 'Go Vote' reminder just to democrats on Election Day, that doesn't cost him a dime.' (Breitbart)[2] Donald Trump's claim that Google has been manipulating search results has been debated hotly in the media. Trump has recently reignited hissuspicions about Google. Big Tech's biggest threat to democracy isn't censorship or privacy: it's election manipulation. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, 'Google and Censorship through Search Engines,' Dr. Robert Epstei[3]n, who researches the impact of Google, informed the hearing that 'upwards of 15 million votes' were in jeopardy in the 2020 election. During his testimony, Epstein told Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) that in 2016, Google gave at least 2.6 million votes to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, 'through bias and search results.' He stressed that was the lowest number.When questioned further by Cruz, Epstein gave a more concise answer: 'The range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes depending on how aggressive they were in using the techniques that I've been studying, such as the search engine manipulation effect, the search suggestion effect, the answer bot effect, and a number of others. They control these and no one can counteract them. These are not competitive. These are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively.' Cruz was shocked by this, responding, 'If any headline comes out of this hearing, that should be it.' Epstein further warned, 'In 2020, you can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out, and the methods they are using are invisible, they're subliminal, they are more powerful than most any effects I've ever seen in behavioral sciences and I've been in behavioral sciences for almost 40 years.' Cruz reminded those at the hearing that Google's parent company, Alphabet, was Clinton's biggest corporate supporter in 2016. The company donated $1.6 million to the former Secretary of State, according to OpenSecrets.org[4].; The senator asked Epstein after his testimony if it was true that a 'handful of Silicon Valley billionaires and giant corporations are able to spend millions of dollars, if not billions, collectively massively influencing the results of the elections.' Epstein gave the troubling answer, 'Senator, with respect I must correct you. If Mark Zuckerberg chooses to send out a go vote reminder to just Democrats on election day, that doesn't cost him a dime.' Cruz voiced the fears of the GOP when it came to Big Tech, saying 'we have no way of knowing if Google or Facebook or Twitter sends things to Democrats or Republicans or how they bias it because its a black box with no transparency or accountability whatsoever.' Epstein suggested that Congress move to make Google's search index public, which would simply reshape the company slightly and make its decisions to rank and order information more transparent.World Bulletin Interview: The reality is that people trust the 'unbiased' internet search giant Google so much it can actually influence up to 10 million undecided voters to choose Hillary Clinton for president, prominent US psychologist and author Robert Epstein told RT following years of research. This exclusive report in RT highlights how - despite being a supporter of the Democratic presidential nominee - Dr. Epstein believes Google's unchecked algorithm of placing one candidate over the other in search results constitutes a'threat to democracy.'RT:Robert, how did you discover that Google is possibly in cahoots with the Clinton campaign? RE:Well I didn't find out that they were necessarily supporting Hillary Clinton, that's not what I found at first. First, through several years of research, I found that they had the power to control elections, the power to shift the votes. So, that was more than four years of experimental research with more than 10,000 people in 39 countries. So, we established through some very careful experiments that by favoring one candidate in search rankings Google can shift a lot of votes. More than 20 percent of undecided voters overall, and in some demographic groups up to 80 percent of undecided voters. People trust search rankings so much that if one candidate is favored in search rankings that shifts peoples' votes. Now, more recently, many people have established that Google has a very close relationship with Hillary Clinton. That didn't come from my research, that came from all kinds of investigative research by many people. RT:Are you going to take a look at Facebook and Twitter as well? It looks like social media play an even bigger role in the elections than televised debates. RE:Well, we know now that Facebook has the power to shift about 600,000 votes to Hillary Clinton on Election Day with no one knowing this is occurring. All they have to do is send out'Go out and vote'reminders to Hillary Clinton's supporters, but not to Trump's supporters. That would cause a lot of people to vote who would otherwise stay home. So yes, we've looked at Facebook, we've looked at Twitter. But again, Facebook can shift 600,000 votes, Google can shift somewhere between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes.RT:Have you been able to find abnormal search results by Google in some other countries intended to influence the outcome of elections?RE:We haven't look carefully at too many countries. We've looked at the UK election in 2015, we looked at the national election in India, at the Lok Sabha election in 2014. What we do know is that it is the nature of Google's algorithm to put one candidate ahead of another. That happens automatically. That happens, as Google would say, organically. So, this means that Google's algorithm has probably been determining the outcomes of close elections around the world for many years, probably actually controlling the winner in as many as 25 percent of the national elections of the world. RT:What do you think about this threat of big data? Do you think Google and other search engines analyses all search results by an individual for a good purpose? RE:Well, big data at the moment is a threat. It's a threat to democracy, at least as we have it in the United States, it's a threat to human freedom, it's a threat to civil liberties. This is mainly because the technologies are very new, and new means of control, of surveillance, of manipulation are being developed which at the moment are not regulated - they're not covered by any laws or regulations. So, the problem is that these technologies have developed quickly, and we have not developed systems for monitoring these technologies, we've not developed systems for regulating these technologies. Obviously, we must do so. RT:You've said that unlike Europe, Russia and China were able to overcome the Google monopoly, but a lot of people are still using this search engine. Do you think that the US company can manipulate public opinion in Russia as well? RE:Well, it's hard for them to manipulate opinion if they don't dominate that country. Google dominates most of the countries in the world. The only countries it doesn't dominate are Russia and China. So, Russia and China are protected a little bit from Google, but Russia and China have their own problems. Russia has Yandex, China has Baidu, and these companies can use techniques just as the ones that Google is using and perhaps they're already using these techniques. These techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides a search engine. These techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides search suggestions. My newest research shows, for example, that Google seems to be favoring Hillary Clinton in its search suggestions, the suggestions it gives you when you first start to type an item, and from new research I've done, we know that if you suppress negative search suggestions from one candidate, that shifts votes and opinions towards that candidate. So, Google is not the only problem. Any of these big tech companies can use these techniques for surveillance, for manipulation, for control, and I think we have to be concerned about the big tech industries in general around the world, not just Google. RT:How do you oppose such great power being wielded by one corporation like Google? RE:Well, the problem with a lot of power being in the hands of one company is that the private company is not answerable to the public. The private company does not have people who we voted on. The private company might be run almost like a monarchy, with the CEO having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do, even not having access to their internal records. So we would have no idea of exactly what they're doing or how they're doing it and how they're making decisions. This is potentially very dangerous. The situation right now is unprecedented in human history. There has never been so much power placed in the hands of so few people who are beyond the reach of any laws, beyond the reach of any regulations, and who don't necessarily have the public interest in mind.I made a prediction on Twitter recently, you can check this: I not only have predicted that he will set up his own television network but that he will launch his network with a guaranteed hit show. It will be a reality TV show about Donald Trump running for president, and that will be a hit show, so I think that's his only interest here. Hillary Clinton will become our next president, it's guaranteed and in my opinion Donald Trump has no interest, never had any interest in becoming president. RT:Do you believe that Hillary Clinton will become US president through the manipulation of public opinion? RE:Oh, Hillary Clinton is guaranteed to win this election, and I have said previously based on polls that seem to show a kind of a close vote, that those polls did not take into account the power that Google and other companies have to shift votes. That's missing from these polls. So, once you realize the power that these companies have, Hillary Clinton is absolutely guaranteed to win, and she will win in the margin of somewhere between 2.6 million and 10 million votes. If we take the mean, the average of those two numbers, I guess you could say it's pretty clear that she will win by approximately 6.5 million votes.RT:Given that the United States has such an expensive and powerful media industry, would you say that voters in the US have a real picture of the presidential campaign?RE:Well, voters in the United States I think do get a pretty good picture because we have so many different kinds of media and people are just bombarded with information from newspapers, magazines and the internet, more than 400 different television channels. So I think we do get a pretty complex and deep picture of things, but you have to remember that all of these forms of media are competitive. So, we're getting one perspective from one magazine, another perspective from another magazine. But when you come to something like Google, there's no competition. There's no competitor. It's a completely different kind of influence, it's non-competitive. In other words, if you're still trying to make up your mind and you go to Google and ask a question about the candidates or about some sort of issue related to the election, Google will show you whatever it wants to show you and that can easily, easily tip your opinion one way or the other and there's no competitor, there's no way for anyone to compensate what Google just told you. So, this is a completely new and very dangerous kind of influence. It has no competition, there's no corrective for it, and people trust Google - we know this from surveys - people trust Google more than they trust any newspaper, any magazine or any television station. People trust information that they get from a computer much more than information they're getting from television or a newspaper because they know that television and newspapers are biased, because they know that people are actually giving them the information. But when they get information out of a computer they mistakenly believe that that information is impartial, that information is objective and of course, that's not really true, but that's what people believe. source: RT[5] The Truth Must be Told Your contribution supports independent journalism Please take a moment to consider this.

And welcome to EARLY START. I'm Ashleigh Banfield.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZORAIDA SAMBOLIN, CNN ANCHOR: And I'm Zoraida Sambolin. We're very happy you're with us. We're bringing you the news from A to Z. It is 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we begin with your top stories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fifty-four delegates at stake tomorrow in the Illinois primary. <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>coming off a rout of <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>in Puerto Rico. But Santorum is insisting the nomination is his, if he pulls off an Illinois upset.</p><p>BANFIELD: Spring nearly sprung. So, what the heck is this? No joke. More than a foot of snow on the ground in Flagstaff, Arizona. More on the way, too. Bizarre. A major late winter storm shutting down the Interstate 40 for nearly 200 miles.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: In Nebraska and Oklahoma, the trouble is tornadoes. Take a look at this. Storm chasers captured this twister on the ground in the town of Willow, Oklahoma. CNN's Reynolds Wolf is tracking all of the severe weather.</p><p>BANFIELD: Dozens of Occupy Wall Street demonstrators arrested in ugly pictures in lower Manhattan. They're trying to reoccupy Zuccotti Park. The accusations are flying this morning that New York City police abused peaceful protesters.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And how sweet it is. The sweet 16 is set after 11th seeded North Carolina State upset third-seeded Georgetown. Up next for N.C. State, Kansas on Friday.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.</p><p>BANFIELD: And we begin with breaking news from France.</p><p>At least three people, including two children, have reportedly been killed in a shooting outside of a Jewish school in Toulouse, France. That's in the southwest part of the country. And several other people were reportedly also injured by this gunman. Security has been ordered tightened at Jewish schools. It's not clear if these shootings could be connected to some other shootings that involved soldiers earlier on.</p><p>CNN's Jim Bittermann is joining us on the phone from Paris.</p><p>So, give us the details on the injured and those who were killed. And exactly who this shooter could be, Jim.</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Well, that's certainly what police are looking at this morning. Basically, Ashleigh, about 10 minutes after 8:00 this morning, local time, as students were gathering at a school called the Ozar Hatorah School in the Jewish area of Toulouse. In fact, a gunman came by on a motor bike and shot into the crowd of about four or five people. Reports are that two students were killed and adults killed and several injured in addition to who were killed.</p><p>Now, what police are looking into what connection there might be to two earlier shooting instances involving soldiers in the Toulouse area. Basically, the M.O., the method of operation looks very similar. A motor bike involved. The gunman comes by and shoots. In one case, shot at one soldier and killed him. In another case, a gunman shot at three soldiers. Two of those soldiers were killed and another severely injured.</p><p>So, police have at least the potential serial killer on the loose in Toulouse. The interior minister of France said that he is going to be headed that direction down to Toulouse this morning to see what reinforcements he can give to the local police, Ashleigh.</p><p>BANFIELD: All right. Jim Bittermann reporting from Paris, about an incident in Toulouse. And the Israeli foreign minister making a comment, being horrified by what transpired in France today. We'll have more on that as it develops.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: It is three minutes past the hour here.</p><p><person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>hoping to take a big step towards clinching the GOP nomination with a victory in Illinois tomorrow. That's after routing <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>in the Puerto Rico victory. He got roughly 83 percent of the vote in Puerto Rico yesterday. Santorum, in the single digits. With 20 delegates for Romney. He is hoping to parlay the win into Latino votes moving forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Those people who don't think that Latinos won't vote for a Republican need to take a look in Puerto Rico and see there that conservative principles and Latino voters go together and that Hispanic voters are going to vote for Republicans if we stand for something, conservative principles that bring growth and good jobs and rising home values. That's how we're going to win. We're going to get Latino voters to help us out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So, let's look at the delegates scoreboard here. Romney with 518. Santorum, 239. Gingrich, 139. Ron Paul there with 69.</p><p>Fifty-four delegates at stake tomorrow in Illinois where polls show Romney with a slight lead.</p><p>CNN political editor Paul Steinhauser live in Washington, D.C. for us.</p><p>Quite a trouncing. Let's start in Puerto Rico and we'll move forward to Illinois.</p><p>PAUL STEINHAUSER, CNN POLITICAL EDITOR: You got it. Here's the (INAUDIBLE) between the Romney and the Santorum campaigns. Remember, <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>was also down in Puerto Rico for two days, Zoraida, on Wednesday and Thursday, and got in little trouble over the Spanish language and the controversy there of whether they should make English the official language if they were to become a state.</p><p>Take a look at this statement from Hogan Gidley, spokesman for the Santorum campaign, last night after the loss in Puerto Rico. It says, \"<person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>has a consistent core. And he showed that when he went to Puerto Rico and took a locally unpopular but principled stance about English being the language of America.</p><p><person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>on the other hand switched another one of his positions to gain favor in Puerto Rico, by saying that Puerto Ricans shouldn't have to lean English if they want to become a state. We all know <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>will do and say anything to get votes. And this is just another example of that.\"</p><p>You can imagine, the Romney campaign definitely doesn't agree with this. And they said that Romney has not flip-flopped at all on this issue. And they disagree very much with the Santorum campaign.</p><p>But just another slice here of the nastiness you can see between the two campaigns, Zoraida.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. So, let's move forward to Illinois now. Santorum says if he wins that, he's got the nomination. Romney says he's ahead.</p><p>What's happening in Illinois?</p><p>STEINHAUSER: Yes. Remember a couple of weeks ago, we said Michigan was a must-win for Romney?</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Right.</p><p>STEINHAUSER: So, well, then the next week, we said it was Ohio. I think this week, you can say, yes, it's Illinois, more of a moderate state, much a different feel than what we saw in Alabama and Mississippi, a state that <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>really needs to win.</p><p>You saw him change his strategy. He was not supposed to be campaigning in Illinois until today. He went there on Friday morning, went back all day yesterday. Usually, Sundays are a slow day for <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>in the campaign trail, spent the whole day there. You can see, Illinois is a crucial state for <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>to win.</p><p>Remember, Louisiana coming up on Saturday. That is a more conservative state that Santorum will win. Keep your eyes on Illinois tomorrow, Zoraida.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Still a lot more ahead.</p><p>STEINHAUSER: Oh, yes.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Paul Steinhauser, live in Washington, thank you very much.</p><p>BANFIELD: Six minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast. Happening this moment, a major late winter storm causing some major headaches in -- yes, Arizona. I'm not kidding. Arizona.</p><p>Look at your screen. In Flagstaff, more than a foot of snow is already on the ground. We could get another foot later on today. The storm is forcing closure of Interstate 40 for nearly 200 miles. That's from Kingman, Arizona, all the way to east Winslow, if you're keeping score.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Some good skiing there. You would love it.</p><p>BANFIELD: Great skiing in Arizona. Yes, and great condos now in New York. Get yourself a winter condo in Connecticut.</p><p>Other parts of the country are seeing some pretty unseasonably warm temperatures, as well.</p><p>And Reynolds Wolf is in the weather center.</p><p>OK, what's the deal?</p><p>REYNOLDS WOLF, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Well, I mean, we really do have a crazy mix, which makes weather awfully interesting. But the snow in parts of Arizona, interesting, but not unusual at all. Many of us have the perception that in Arizona, you basically have Phoenix, you have Tucson. You don't think about the northern half of the state, but that's where you do quite a bit of snow. And that's certainly was the case this weekend.</p><p>In Arizona, the snow volume, you had 26 inches of snow. Well over a foot in Ft. Valley, Flagstaff and even in Bellemont. Big Bear City in California got about 20 inches of snowfall. In some places, even a little more, and certainly great for all of the skiers up in Big Bear.</p><p>What we're going to be seeing today is a little bit of a difference in parts of the Central and Southern Plains. Look for a chance of severe storms. Already severe storms watches in parts of Oklahoma and back in the northern Texas. Across parts of, well, Great Lakes and down into parts of, say, the Appalachians, we're seeing some rain in Pittsburgh.</p><p>But the big chance of severe weather is going to take place right here in the Southern Plains as that frontal boundary sweeps its way to the east, interacts to that Gulf moisture, strong storm possible in parts of Texas and into Louisiana, as we fast forward from today into Tuesday.</p><p>Now, one big issue there we're going to have is also the heavy rainfall we might see in parts of Texas. In fact, some places at six inches of rain falling at a very rapid rate. It means we certainly have a good chance of seeing some flooding in a few spots. Some places could see up to a foot just over the next 24 hours or so. So, certainly, a huge concern for a lot of people.</p><p>The other thing you were talking about is the big change of temperatures. Out in the west, it has been the cold. But in the east, a huge ridge of high pressure, means 85 degrees your high in Memphis, up by Beale Street. In Chicago, they're still recovering over St. Patrick's Day, 79 degrees. Even in New York, where we sent it back to you guys, 72, the expected high.</p><p>BANFIELD: Seventy-two. What month is this, Reynolds? What month are we in?</p><p>WOLF: Hard to believe, but we're in March. I know.</p><p>BANFIELD: All right. Thank you for that, Reynolds Wolf.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: We're loving it, right?</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes. Well, I hate to say no complaints. I actually do have complaints. I think it's supposed to be cold when it's supposed to be cold. When it's supposed to be hot --</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Send her the e-mails.</p><p>BANFIELD: It is nine minutes now past 5:00. And this just in -- are you ready?</p><p>We bring you this live, folks. The national price for gas rising for a tenth day in the row now, standing at $3.84 a gallon. That's according to AAA.</p><p>Gas is already selling at least 4 bucks a gallon on average in seven states. And if you're one of them, I'm sorry. Alaska, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, New York and Washington -- feel your pain. That's the level analysts say that people start changing some of their spending habits, as well.</p><p>And the steep rise in gas prices has become a weapon for Republicans to use against the president. But are there promises? Or just politics? Coming up at 6:15 Eastern, we're going to talk to Jim Burkhart, managing director of the Global Oil Group, and get answers there.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: I hope so.</p><p>Our Christine Romans is watching the markets for us this morning.</p><p>They closed mixed on Friday. The Dow and the NASDAQ both closing lower, but not by much. And the S&amp;P 500, which is nearing a four-year high, closed up by 0.01 percent. That's good news for your money. The S&amp;P 500 is the best indicator for what is in your 401(k).</p><p>The stock futures are down ahead of the opening bell this morning. BANFIELD: Normally, I'm listening to all those details and processing them. But I can't think of anything other than Apple.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Apple. I know. 9:00, the company is having a conference call. And everybody wants to know what Apple is going to do with its huge cash horde. Did you know that Apple has $98 billion in cash sitting in the bank? Just the last --</p><p>BANFIELD: Say that again.</p><p>ROMANS: Ninety-eight billion dollars. It is literally more money than God.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS: Apple Computer designed something in Cupertino, California, builds it through subcontractors in China, ships it all over the world. And they're making things that we never knew we needed but now we can't live without. And Apple revenue is up, you know, 40 percent, 50 percent every year.</p><p>Look at the stocks. You can see the shares of Apple Computer, just this year --</p><p>BANFIELD: Lord.</p><p>ROMANS: -- are up almost 45 percent. We crossed $500 a share about a month ago, and then, crossed $600 a share four weeks later.</p><p>Sitting on all this cash, in just the first fiscal quarter of the annual year, it made $16 billion, in cash. That's money that goes right into the bank. A lot of analysts are saying they think this company is going to give a dividend, meaning that shareholders of the company will get a little money back, maybe 2 percent, maybe 2.5 percent.</p><p>A lot of big tech companies give money back to their investors, to their shareholders. And that's what folks are hoping will happen here. And they think it's going to make Apple even more valuable because then you have all of these big mutual funds and all these big value investors and investors who want to get a little bit of a return back for holding their Apple shares, instead of the stock going up and up.</p><p>So --</p><p>SAMBOLIN: I wonder where the top is, though, right?</p><p>ROMANS: That's such a good question. There's two kind of adages on Wall Street. One is the trend is your friend. And the trend in Apple is up. I mean, anybody who's been, you know, selling Apple all the way up is just pulling their hair out, right?</p><p>The other adage is, trees don't grow to the sky, meaning they can't go up forever. So, Apple has -- is Apple worth it? Does it continue to be worth $300, $400, $500 a share? It is if it can continue to invent things we didn't know we needed, if they can penetrate the entire world with their products. If their costumers -- their competitors don't find a way to start to eat into some of their momentum. The momentum is there for Apple right now.</p><p>But the news today: will there be a dividend? We'll find out at 9:00.</p><p>BANFIELD: That's fascinating. Christine Romans, thank you so much.</p><p>ROMANS: You're welcome.</p><p>BANFIELD: Twelve minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast. And we are giving you an early read on some stories you should watch for later on today.</p><p>Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians, he's expected to meet face-to-face for the first time with his attorney today in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. It's going to be the first time he gets a chance to talk with this prominent Seattle lawyer, John Henry Browne, who's made all sorts of media appearances, but hasn't talked to the client in person.</p><p>Formal charges against Sergeant Bales could be filed this week.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: The owners of the New York Mets head to court today. A jury will decide if they looked the other way while reaping millions from Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The stakes are enormous for Madoff victims and the team, with over $300 million on the line.</p><p>BANFIELD: And Catherine, and the duchess of Cambridge -- that was ridiculous. I don't know why I said with that thrill in my voice. She's delivering her first public speech later this morning. It's going to happen in just over two hours during her event at a new children's hospital facility. Catherine will tour the building, meet the staff and the patients, and also plant a tree to commemorate the opening. Just don't her call Kate.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Do you remember Diana was the people's princess, right? I wonder if they dubbed her anything yet.</p><p>BANFIELD: I don't know. Yes, I'm not sure, because she really has the same aura.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: To connect.</p><p>BANFIELD: One thing I notice all the time, and maybe it's just me, she's very skinny, and gets skinnier and skinnier in each public appearance.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Well, if you had that kind of pressure on you. You have to do the same, right?</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes. I mean, I hope she is planning to have kids and get some beef on.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Fourteen minutes past the hour here. Coming up on EARLY START: Ontario town is turned upside down. Hundreds are on the street, rioting on St. Patrick's Day. Look at that. Those are actually students.</p><p>BANFIELD: Are those Canadians?</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Students.</p><p>BANFIELD: What's wrong with the Canadians?</p><p>SAMBOLIN: A lot. We're going to tell you about that when we come back.</p><p>BANFIELD: These are my rivals right now when I was in college.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Oh, really?</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes. So, go ahead. Show the pictures, as long as you want.</p><p>Also coming up, the Supreme Court is set to debate health care reforms, real soon. And you know something? A single vote could make or break what we've come to know as Obamacare.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And a shocking, new book. Did <person><nameText>Fidel Castro </nameText></person>know in advance that <person><nameText>JFK </nameText></person>would be assassinated? We're going to delve into that.</p><p>You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Good morning to you, Chicago.</p><p>BANFIELD: Beautiful.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Sixty-three degrees right now. You know I'm bummed about this. It's going to be 79 degrees later.</p><p>You've been having fabulous weather while I'm not there. You know? I don't know. But I'm happy. I am happy for you.</p><p>BANFIELD: Look at that lovely picture. That's so pretty. I hope people are awake to see that.</p><p>Well, if you are awake, you might be watching us obviously. Eighteen minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast.</p><p>Time to check our stories making news this morning with Christine Romans.</p><p>Hey there.</p><p>ROMANS: Good morning, you guys.</p><p>I want to get you up to speed on the developing story out of Toulouse, France, this morning, where a gunman has reportedly killed two children and one adult outside of a Jewish school. Witnesses say the gunman sped off on a motor scooter after the shooting.</p><p>This is video just in from the scene. French officials have ordered tighter security at all Jewish schools in the country. This is the same area where a soldier was killed by a gunman on a scooter recently. It's not clear if the incidents might be connected.</p><p>Tomorrow's Illinois primary shaping up to be a critical battle in the race for the GOP nomination, 54 delegates up for grabs. <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>coming off a big win in the Puerto Rico primary. It could take a step towards the nomination with a win in Illinois. <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>insisting he'll be the nominee if he pulls off that upset tomorrow.</p><p>A town in Ontario looking like a warzone on St. Patrick's Day. 1,000 rowdy revelers break out in riots. And they're sitting cars on fire, throwing glass bottles at police. Several people were arrested. One woman was reportedly taken to the hospital with burn injuries.</p><p>\"21 Jump Street\" debuts at the top of the weekend box office, earning an estimated $35 million. The film starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was made for about $45 million. So, that's equal right away.</p><p>Dr. Seuss' \"The Lorax\" fell to second. \"John Carter\" was third.</p><p>And trivia question, ladies. Who -- which big, huge star got his start in the TV show, \"21 Jump Street\"? Remember?</p><p>BANFIELD: Johnny Depp.</p><p>ROMANS: I know. It says exactly how old we are by knowing that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANFIELD: Oh, I never get that stuff.</p><p>ROMANS: I loved that show.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: You jumped on that one so quickly, I figured you were 100 percent right.</p><p>BANFIELD: If I didn't get it right, my entire former country where I emigrated from would be livid, because I think that was a Canadian production.</p><p>ROMANS: Oh, was it? I didn't know that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS: There you go.</p><p>BANFIELD: Christine --</p><p>ROMANS: Useless trivia of the morning.</p><p>BANFIELD: Twenty minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast.</p><p>U.S. Supreme Court set to argue the president's health care reform law starting next week and the decision could come down to a single vote. The court is split between four liberal justices and five conservatives. And the White House is weighing its options on how to get that crucial fifth vote of approval.</p><p>Jeffrey Toobin is CNN's senior legal analyst. He's also the dude who knows everything about the Nine. You wrote the book called \"The Nine.\"</p><p>Hi, Jeff.</p><p>JEFF TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>BANFIELD: Good to see you.</p><p>Hey, listen. So, look, we've got a couple of minutes and I don't know how man years you studied constitutional law. So, this is going to be a bit of a sticky wicket to get through this. But essentially, what I'm gathering on this is that the Supreme Court has to decide over the challenges to Obamacare. And it has to do with some clauses that are critical in the Constitution.</p><p>TOOBIN: Just one clause. Just one clause is all that matters.</p><p>BANFIELD: OK. Which one is it, the Commerce Clause?</p><p>TOOBIN: The Commerce Clause.</p><p>BANFIELD: Or that other really strange --</p><p>TOOBIN: Don't worry about the other. It's the Commerce Clause.</p><p>BANFIELD: There's called a Necessary and Proper Clause.</p><p>TOOBIN: Necessary and Proper is not really the main part of this case. It's really about the Commerce Clause.</p><p>BANFIELD: So, what's it about?</p><p>TOOBIN: OK. Congress has to act under its authority in the Constitution. Something in the Constitution has to say Congress has the right to pass any law that it passes. And the authority that it uses in most of the laws that it passes relating to the economy is the Commerce Clause. In Article I, the Constitution says, Congress has the right to regulate commerce among the several states.</p><p>What does that mean? What is -- what is the commerce power? Traditionally, that has been a very broad brand of power, particularly when it comes to health care in the economy. Think about -- we have Medicare. We have Medicaid.</p><p>The United States government has been deeply involved in regulating health care for decades. The question in this case is the individual mandate, which is the part of Obamacare which says everyone has to have insurance.</p><p>BANFIELD: No matter what. TOOBIN: No matter what.</p><p>BANFIELD: You have to buy it.</p><p>TOOBIN: Correct. And the question is that constitutional under Congress' power in the Commerce Clause.</p><p>I think, I wrote an article in \"New Yorker\" this week, that the answer is clearly yes, because the national market for health insurance is unusual because everybody is part of that economy -- that market, no matter what, because if you buy health insurance, that's how you pay for health care. But if you don't buy health insurance, you're still going to be treated by a hospital if you fall in the street and get hurt. Everybody is going to pay for your health care even if you don't get health insurance.</p><p>BANFIELD: So, this is the inactive versus active argument?</p><p>TOOBIN: Correct.</p><p>BANFIELD: OK, well, can I ask you this?</p><p>TOOBIN: Sure.</p><p>BANFIELD: Because when it comes to acting on the Supreme Court, we have nine justices.</p><p>TOOBIN: Correct.</p><p>BANFIELD: Four of them are liberal, considered to be, you know, falling in line on the liberal side. And you can see them on the left, appropriately so on the left-hand side of your screen. On the right-hand side of your screen, five of them, considered to be mostly in the right-hand corner when voting on issues.</p><p>But the one who's critical here is Antonin Scalia, as I understand. That's why I brought up that Necessary and Proper Clause because there's some people watching this, Jeff, who say that the briefs and the direction that Obama and the Justice Department are taking, seem to indicate they're pushing this argument to fall into that clause because that man had voted accordingly before and that might be how they can get their conservative vote. Is that crazy?</p><p>TOOBIN: Well, it's not crazy, because -- I mean, this case, the scope of federal power has been something that the Supreme Court has dealt with for decades. I mean, this came up a lot during the New Deal. And then after the New Deal, even conservative justices, as you point out, like Justice Scalia, certainly Justice Kennedy who is usually the swing vote in these cases, have voted to approve broad federal powers.</p><p>So, the possibility here, and I think it's a legitimate possibility, is that these conservatives might join the liberals in upholding Obamacare because there are different roots to get there in terms of finding constitutional justification. You could find the Commerce Clause. You can find the Necessary and Proper Clause, federal taxing power is also broad. And so, I think the odds do favor this law being upheld. But there are different ways you can do it.</p><p>BANFIELD: Well, this is pretty thick and chewy stuff and you did a great job. You ever thought of teaching for a living?</p><p>TOOBIN: No.</p><p>BANFIELD: You should. I would take your class. I would give this up, all this glamour and getting up 1:00 in the morning to take your class.</p><p>TOOBIN: Absolutely. I appreciate it.</p><p>BANFIELD: Jeff Toobin, lovely to see you. Thank you.</p><p>TOOBIN: See you.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: It's always nice to break it down into English. You are absolutely right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Twenty-four minutes past the hour.</p><p>Ahead on EARLY START, more kooky weather. California, a town there is digging out. A massive, massive mudslide in that area. I think they're predicting more rain, although they are praying for no rain this morning.</p><p>And did you hear about <person><nameText>Rick Santorum's </nameText></person>really bold prediction? He says that he will be the nominee if he wins Illinois tomorrow.</p><p>You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Her killing captivated an entire nation. And to this day, JonBenet Ramsey's murder remains unsolved.</p><p>BANFIELD: And now, her father is talking about the case and his decision to let his daughter participate in beauty pageants.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN RAMSEY, JONBENET RAMSEY'S FATHER: The point is, you need to protect your children, and not to put them on public display like that. It would be my choice if I had to do it all over again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BANFIELD: More of my interview with John Ramsey, what he has to say about today's toddler and child pageants. And also, the one thing he's been carrying around with him for 15 years. You're going to see it.</p><p>You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>BANFIELD: It is 29 minutes past 5:00 on the East Coast. Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Ashleigh Banfield.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And I'm Zoraida Sambolin. It is time to check the stories making news this morning.</p><p>BANFIELD: Two children were among three reportedly killed in a shooting outside a Jewish school in Toulouse, France. Witnesses say a man on a scooter opened fire a child drop off zone and then took off. CNN is working to confirm the details. Several other people reportedly injured, as well, by the gunman. Security has been ordered tightened at Jewish schools throughout France.</p><p>This incident occurs just days after three soldiers were shot to death by a man on a scooter in the same part of France, but it is not clear at this point if those shootings are connected.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMBOLIN (voice-over): And tomorrow's Illinois primary shaping up to be a make-or-break battle between <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Rick Santorum. </nameText></person>Romney coming off a big win in Puerto Rico could take a big step toward clinching the nomination with a strong showing in Illinois. While <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>says the nomination will be his if he pulls off an upset tomorrow.</p><p>BANFIELD (voice-over): Forget spring break. Today's a snow day. And that's for kids in Flagstaff, Arizona. That city has received more than a foot of snow to the late winter storm, and it shut down I-40 for almost 200 miles.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And look at this messy, muddy weekend in New Castle, California. Look at there is a minute. About 30 miles northeast to the Sacramento. They are still digging out after a massive mudslide. It had one main road blocked for hours, and some folks in the neighborhood are little jittery this morning, because one heavy rain could threaten several home there.</p><p>BANFIELD: North Carolina state pulling off the upset and busting up Brackets, too. The number 11 seed Wolfpack defeated third seed Georgetown, 66-63. It happened on Sunday to advance the NCAA tournament's sweet 16. N.C. State will now play the Kansas Jayhawks on Friday.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMBOLIN (on-camera): Thirty-one minutes past the hour.</p><p>The primary in Illinois tomorrow could turn out to be a defining moment in the race for the Republican nomination. <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>routed <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>in Puerto Rico in the primary yesterday. He got over 80 percent of the vote, and he gets the full 20 delegates. Santorum, however, sounding surprisingly confident, in spite of that. Hoping for an upset in Illinois, where 54 delegates are at stake, making a bold prediction also, if he pulls it off.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>RICK SANTORUM, </nameText></person>(R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we're able to come out of Illinois with a huge or surprise win, I guarantee you, I guarantee you, we will win this nomination.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So, Santorum has a long way to go. The delegate count right now. Romney is at 518. Santorum is at 239. So, let's talk to our political panel about this. Live from Washington, D.C., we have Joe Williams, White House reporter for Politico. Nice smile this morning. Here in New York, we have Democratic strategist, John Hlinko, who is being seated. There you are. Good morning to you.</p><p>Running a little late this morning. And then, in Chicago, we have Lenny McAllister. Good morning to you. Thanks for being with us, gentlemen. All right. Joe, I'm going to start with you. Santorum isn't even eligible for ten of those Illinois delegates, right? He didn't qualify for the ballots in four out of the 18 districts in Illinois. So, how can he pull off the surprise win that he's talking about?</p><p>JOE WILLIAMS, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, POLITICO: Well, I mean, he's managed to surprise and confound people before. This one looks like a bit more of a long shot. I ran into a Democratic operative a couple of days ago who said, basically, if Santorum had even a smaller -- small organization -- if he had a better organization even to as minor degree, he'd probably be the frontrunner by now, because he's managed to excite the base.</p><p>And he's done a lot of that by hand-to-hand, shaking the hands, plus pressing the flesh, retail politics that <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>is not so good at. So, it's possible, but his disorganization makes it probably unlikely that he would triumph and collect enough delegates to overcome or at least take a huge bite out of <person><nameText>Mitt Romney's </nameText></person>lead in Illinois.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And his lack of organization is what got him into this, right?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Pretty much, yes. That's what got him into the fix, because it's not like nobody knew when these primaries were going to happen or that the schedule hadn't been set up at least a year and a half, two years in advance, to make sure that everybody had enough time and knew what they needed to do to get every last delegate that they qualify for.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Lenny, I'm going to switch gears over to you. So, Romney was talking about the math, right? And this was last week that he was talking about that. He's talking about delegate math again on Fox News. Let's listen, and then, we're going to chat about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY, </nameText></person>(R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know a lot of people will talk about delegates and strategies and math, and that's all very interesting to the insiders. But I think the American people want to see someone who has the leadership, skill, and experience to defeat the president. I can't tell you exactly how the process is going to work, but I bet (ph) I'm going to become the nominee. I sure hope I'm going to become the nominee.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So, Lenny, he knows that he has to get the delegates in order to win. And the polling is showing that it's a very tight race. What's that play in Illinois?</p><p>LENNY MCALLISTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: What's it play is, once again, being able to excite voters. And, he's actually pivoting away from talking about that delegate math, because if you remember what it looked like coming out of southern Tuesday last week, he was talking about how it was inevitable that the delegate math would not allow anybody else other than him to win the nomination.</p><p>Well, that didn't play very well. Voters don't want to be excited about delegate math. They want to be excited about leadership. So, what he's trying to do right now is pivot away from that. He should still win, obviously, the majority of delegates here should he win Illinois tomorrow, but he also needs to excite people.</p><p>He needs to finally coalesced a base, get them behind him so that as he moves into Yankee primary when coming into April and some of these other states going to the District of Columbia in April, et cetera, he can have momentum. He still does not have the momentum of the people to drive him.</p><p>He's going to need the Tea Party momentum, which is really big here in Illinois and other segments of the conservative base behind them so that by the time he gets to Tampa, he's not trying to forge alliances. He's trying to invigorate those alliances that he's forming now in the spring to go after President Obama in the fall.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: You know what, I want to ask you one more question, and it's about Santorum, that big loss that he sustained in Puerto Rico because of the English language requirement there. Is that something that could actually help him in Illinois, do you think?</p><p>MCALLISTER: I think it will help him down state. Now, <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>stayed consistent with this. He tried his best to ride the line, be consistent with his message, but be respectful to the cultural uniqueness of Puerto Rico.</p><p>At the same time, you look at this other side, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>who has a reputation of flip-flopping, said he wanted English to be the official language of the United States at one point in time, goes down to Puerto Rico and completely backs away from that position. That situation right there will play well for <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>in regards to consistency and painting <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>as a flip-flopper.</p><p>Will it be enough in Illinois? Maybe, maybe not. Will it be something that will come up later on in his campaign trail? Absolutely.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. I'll be curious to see how he does in Southern Illinois, so we'll watch that. John, I'm going to switch to you, and we're going to talk about gas prices. Again, we just showed a little while ago that they're actually swinging upwards again. Economists say that the president can't do much to affect prices, right?</p><p>But tell that to 54 percent of the people who believe in president can do a lot to control gas prices. Charles Krauthammer is saying this as well.</p><p>\"Yes, of course, presidents have no direct control over gas prices, but the American people know something about this president and his disdain for oil. To the American worker who doesn't commute by government motorcade and is getting fleeced every week at the pump, oil seems very much a fuel of the present and of the foreseeable future.\"</p><p>So, this affects people's wallets, obviously. What can President Obama do in order to ease this pain at the pump?</p><p>JOHN HLINKO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, the reality is, there's not a heck of a lot he can do, at least, in the short-term. I mean, people would like to believe that the president has a magic wand that he can wave, and you know? I mean --</p><p>BANFIELD: But the perception is there, right? What can you do to fight that perception? Fifty-four percent of Americans believe that it is the president's fault.</p><p>HLINKO: Well, there is some talk about releasing some oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, which could help fight the perception. In other words, show kind of action. Whether or not it makes sense is another question, but that is one thing that could help. It could, at least, let people know that he's trying to do something.</p><p>I think the reality is, we buy a lot of oil from some pretty dangerous places, and there's going to be shutoffs and there's going to be tensions in the Middle East that's going to drive up prices. All of the talk of war in Iran, that drives up prices. Frankly, the mishandled war in Iraq is still hurting us, because Iraq could have been producing more oil and that could have driven down the price.</p><p>But, you know, trying to explain that in a 30-second, you know, sound byte, it's not easy. I suspect the president will open up the strategic petroleum reserve or at least some oil and that should help the perception, at least.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. We're going to talk a lot about that later. Thank you so much, gentlemen. Joe, Lenny, John, thanks for being with us. We'll see you again on the six o'clock hour.</p><p>MCALLISTER: Thanks, Zoraida.</p><p>HLINKO: Thank you.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And CNN's coverage of the Illinois primary begins tomorrow night at 7:00 eastern with Erin Burnett, then it's followed by live coverage of the primary results at 8:00 with Wolf Blitzer, Anderson Cooper, and the CNN political team.</p><p>BANFIELD: Thirty-eight minutes now past 5:00 on the east coast. Coming up, my one-on-one interview with John Ramsey, JonBenet's father. Can you believe if she were alive today, she would be 21 years old. What is it like when John Ramsey comes into contact with some of her friend who are 21? I'll ask him that question. You'll find out.</p><p>Also, did <person><nameText>Fidel Castro </nameText></person>know that <person><nameText>JFK </nameText></person>would be assassinated before it happened? We'll have that story as well. You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>BANFIELD: It was 16 years ago that this image of a six-year-old beauty queen was splashed across every supermarket tabloid in this country. Her murder, a mystery that no one seems to be able to solve. JonBenet Ramsey's parents would be under an umbrella of suspicion for a decade and a half.</p><p>It's hard to believe, but today, JonBenet would be 21 years old. And although, her family has been cleared of suspicion, the killer may still be out there. I had a chance to sit down with JonBenet's dad, Jon Ramsey. We talked about his brand-new book, \"The Other Side of Suffering,\" about his remarkable journey back from the brink and his new outlook on life.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN RAMSEY, JONBENET RAMSEY'S FATHER: I've learned a lot about suffering, about recovery. I've learned about how your faith is challenged when you suffer tragedy. And my eyes have also been opened to the fact that everybody carries a burden. And so, I want to share that.</p><p>BANFIELD: When I met you, I didn't expect to meet a happy person, but I really kind of feel like I met a happy person. Is that true?</p><p>RAMSEY: Yes. I can say that I have joy in my life, which I think is a deeper appreciation of what life's all about, what your purpose is, where you're going to life, what the future holds. There was a period of time when I was so angry that if I'd knew who he was, we wouldn't need a trial, and I would have no remorse. But that anger has passed to a point now where I want to know why? Why did this happen to my child?</p><p>BANFIELD: How did you get there?</p><p>RAMSEY: Well, it took a long time, and I spent a lot of time thinking about and reading about the whole topic of forgiveness. And then, I realize that forgiveness, really, is a gift that I give myself. It's a letting go. It's moving on. It has nothing to do with, of course, you're forgiving -- maybe not want to be forgiven, not even know you forgiven, but it's a release.</p><p>BANFIELD: What would you want people to know about JonBenet?</p><p>RAMSEY: She was so much more than a beauty queen that she's been tagged, and it really hurts when she's tagged that way because that was just a small element of her life. She was energetic. She was incredibly smart. Just an amazing, young child.</p><p>BANFIELD: You used to call her Johnny B.</p><p>RAMSEY: Yes, Johnny B. She lit the room up and not everybody -- I remember one day, I came home from work, and I was kind of crying about something. She said, dad, I don't like that face. So, I put on a smile. She said, that's better. That is just who she was.</p><p>BANFIELD: Attitude adjustment.</p><p>RAMSEY: Yes, total.</p><p>BANFIELD: Speaking of those, you see these programs on cable, \"Toddlers &amp; Tiaras.\"</p><p>RAMSEY: Yes. it called a little bit of that.</p><p>BANFIELD: When you see those programs, what do you think?</p><p>RAMSEY: I don't care for them at all. And that was certainly not the world in a JonBenet and Patsy participated in back then. That was 15 years ago. When Patsy and JonBenet did it, there was always a talent component to the program. And the only people there were grandparents and moms and dads.</p><p>BANFIELD: Not coaches.</p><p>RAMSEY: No coaches.</p><p>BANFIELD: Costume designers.</p><p>RAMSEY: No. No. And, but now that they put it -- made a television show out of it, it's pretty questionable. That's a good idea. I don't think it is.</p><p>BANFIELD: Do you regret that JonBenet was even in a small part of that world?</p><p>RAMSEY: Well, in a sense. You know, we questioned it for a while. Was that the reason we were targeted? Was there someone in that audience that looked at her in a different way than they should have?</p><p>BANFIELD: Do you think that's --</p><p>RAMSEY: I don't think so. No, I don't. But we certainly wondered that. But I think the point is that you need to protect your children to not put them on public display like that. It would be my choice if I had to do over again.</p><p>BANFIELD: You carry a medal in your wallet?</p><p>RAMSEY: Yes.</p><p>BANFIELD: To this day?</p><p>RAMSEY: Yes.</p><p>BANFIELD: What's it for?</p><p>RAMSEY: Well, it was a medal that JonBenet won five days before she was killed for a talent contest. I always to tell her when she'd do these little pageant that, you know, just focus on your talent the best you can. They didn't matter. The rest doesn't matter. It was kind of a thing between us.</p><p>I went to the events. I was late, and she already had the contest. She won this all talent award. She came running up to me and said, Daddy, I won this for you and put it around my neck. It was just a little silver dollar medal. And after she died, in my mind, I want that medal, because we never went back in the house.</p><p>BANFIELD: Never?</p><p>RAMSEY: Never. But I wanted to get that medal at some time. And I just had that thought in my mind and tell me -- my sister, Pam, went back to the house to get clothes for us and came back after a few hours and came up to me where we were staying and said, John, I just felt this overwhelming need to bring this to you.</p><p>And it was the medal. And to me, there's a touch of heaven. It was reassurance, to me, that JonBenet was OK. She knew her father needed some help. I cried, but I cried with tears of joy when I got this.</p><p>BANFIELD: You should be a much more bitter person.</p><p>RAMSEY: Well, I heard a sermon once that said you can be, after tragedy, bitter, broken, barren or better. And, the opportunity is to be better.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BANFIELD: John happened just mentioned to me that recently, he bumped into an old friend of JonBenet's from back in the day when she was six years old, and that friend is 21 and getting married. So, I asked him, do you imagine JonBenet at 21? And he said, absolutely not. She's frozen in time at the age of six years old.</p><p>So difficult to go through these details, Zoraida. He seems like such a good man and such positive man despite --</p><p>SAMBOLIN: I was going to say that. It comes across, right? And you always wonder, how do parents survive something like that? And for him to say that he found his joy again, remarkable. And I think an inspiration to a lot of people.</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes. No, without --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANFIELD: And the book is great. So, I highly recommend. Take a look.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Thank you. Thank you for that.</p><p>And still ahead on EARLY START, it's an ugly scene in Greece. Soccer fans riot. They actually set the stadium on fire. Nine police officers were wounded there. We're going to have all the details. You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Fifty-one minutes past the hour. It's time to check the stories making news this morning. Here's Christine Romans. Good morning again.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, ladies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS (voice-over): Let's go to France first where three people, including two children were killed by a gunman on a motor scooter outside of a Jewish school in Toulouse.

Kennedy </nameText></person>was going to be assassinated. Brian Latell, the CIA's former national intelligence former for Latin America, says the Cuban dictator ordered a senior aide to stop his usual surveillance of CIA radio signals, and instead, listen for any details out of Texas. This was three hours before <person><nameText>JFK </nameText></person>was killed.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ROMANS (on-camera): So, the controversy continues.</p><p>BANFIELD: Oh, the conspiracy theorists. I can hear them banging down the door, Christine.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANFIELD: I can hear them buying books.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes, there you go. Thank you, Christine Romans.</p><p>It is 52 minutes now past 5:00. And still to come, Republicans seizing on this gas issue, but are the promises of cheaper gas as empty as your car's tank?</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Plus, severe weather rips through parts of Oklahoma.

I don't think it's working. He (INAUDIBLE) today. He took the silver spoon out of his mouth and added bronze.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LENO: Yes, tone it down a little bit.</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, \"JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE\": Romney tweeted a link to a playlist, which is a list of his favorite songs on the music website's spotafly (ph). The playlist includes the sound from Toby Keith, the Beach Boys, Carrie Underwood, two songs from the Killers, and the song, \"Born Free\" by Kid Rock. Can you imagine any scenario in which <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>puts ear buds in and fires up the Kid Rock?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KIMMEL: I can't even imagine him putting ear buds in, to be honest with you. <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>doesn't listen to Kid Rock.

And welcome to EARLY START. I'm Ashleigh Banfield.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZORAIDA SAMBOLIN, CNN ANCHOR: And I'm Zoraida Sambolin. We're very happy you're with us. We're bringing you the news from A to Z. It is 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we begin with your top stories.</p><p/><p>Fifty-four delegates at stake tomorrow in the Illinois primary. <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>coming off a rout of <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>in Puerto Rico. But Santorum is insisting the nomination is his, if he pulls off an Illinois upset.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Spring nearly sprung. So, what the heck is this? No joke. More than a foot of snow on the ground in Flagstaff, Arizona. More on the way, too. Bizarre. A major late winter storm shutting down the Interstate 40 for nearly 200 miles.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: In Nebraska and Oklahoma, the trouble is tornadoes. Take a look at this. Storm chasers captured this twister on the ground in the town of Willow, Oklahoma. CNN's Reynolds Wolf is tracking all of the severe weather.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Dozens of Occupy Wall Street demonstrators arrested in ugly pictures in lower Manhattan. They're trying to reoccupy Zuccotti Park. The accusations are flying this morning that New York City police abused peaceful protesters.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: And how sweet it is. The sweet 16 is set after 11th seeded North Carolina State upset third-seeded Georgetown. Up next for N.C. State, Kansas on Friday.</p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: And we begin with breaking news from France.</p><p/><p>At least three people, including two children, have reportedly been killed in a shooting outside of a Jewish school in Toulouse, France. That's in the southwest part of the country. And several other people were reportedly also injured by this gunman. Security has been ordered tightened at Jewish schools. It's not clear if these shootings could be connected to some other shootings that involved soldiers earlier on.</p><p/><p>CNN's Jim Bittermann is joining us on the phone from Paris.</p><p/><p>So, give us the details on the injured and those who were killed. And exactly who this shooter could be, Jim.</p><p/><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Well, that's certainly what police are looking at this morning. Basically, Ashleigh, about 10 minutes after 8:00 this morning, local time, as students were gathering at a school called the Ozar Hatorah School in the Jewish area of Toulouse. In fact, a gunman came by on a motor bike and shot into the crowd of about four or five people. Reports are that two students were killed and adults killed and several injured in addition to who were killed.</p><p/><p>Now, what police are looking into what connection there might be to two earlier shooting instances involving soldiers in the Toulouse area. Basically, the M.O., the method of operation looks very similar. A motor bike involved. The gunman comes by and shoots. In one case, shot at one soldier and killed him. In another case, a gunman shot at three soldiers. Two of those soldiers were killed and another severely injured.</p><p/><p>So, police have at least the potential serial killer on the loose in Toulouse. The interior minister of France said that he is going to be headed that direction down to Toulouse this morning to see what reinforcements he can give to the local police, Ashleigh.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: All right. Jim Bittermann reporting from Paris, about an incident in Toulouse. And the Israeli foreign minister making a comment, being horrified by what transpired in France today. We'll have more on that as it develops.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: It is three minutes past the hour here.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>hoping to take a big step towards clinching the GOP nomination with a victory in Illinois tomorrow. That's after routing <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>in the Puerto Rico victory. He got roughly 83 percent of the vote in Puerto Rico yesterday. Santorum, in the single digits. With 20 delegates for Romney. He is hoping to parlay the win into Latino votes moving forward.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Those people who don't think that Latinos won't vote for a Republican need to take a look in Puerto Rico and see there that conservative principles and Latino voters go together and that Hispanic voters are going to vote for Republicans if we stand for something, conservative principles that bring growth and good jobs and rising home values. That's how we're going to win. We're going to get Latino voters to help us out.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: So, let's look at the delegates scoreboard here. Romney with 518. Santorum, 239. Gingrich, 139. Ron Paul there with 69.</p><p/><p>Fifty-four delegates at stake tomorrow in Illinois where polls show Romney with a slight lead.</p><p/><p>CNN political editor Paul Steinhauser live in Washington, D.C. for us.</p><p/><p>Quite a trouncing. Let's start in Puerto Rico and we'll move forward to Illinois.</p><p/><p>PAUL STEINHAUSER, CNN POLITICAL EDITOR: You got it. Here's the (INAUDIBLE) between the Romney and the Santorum campaigns. Remember, <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>was also down in Puerto Rico for two days, Zoraida, on Wednesday and Thursday, and got in little trouble over the Spanish language and the controversy there of whether they should make English the official language if they were to become a state.</p><p/><p>Take a look at this statement from Hogan Gidley, spokesman for the Santorum campaign, last night after the loss in Puerto Rico. It says, \"<person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>has a consistent core. And he showed that when he went to Puerto Rico and took a locally unpopular but principled stance about English being the language of America.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>on the other hand switched another one of his positions to gain favor in Puerto Rico, by saying that Puerto Ricans shouldn't have to lean English if they want to become a state. We all know <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>will do and say anything to get votes. And this is just another example of that.\"</p><p/><p>You can imagine, the Romney campaign definitely doesn't agree with this. And they said that Romney has not flip-flopped at all on this issue. And they disagree very much with the Santorum campaign.</p><p/><p>But just another slice here of the nastiness you can see between the two campaigns, Zoraida.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. So, let's move forward to Illinois now. Santorum says if he wins that, he's got the nomination. Romney says he's ahead.</p><p/><p>What's happening in Illinois?</p><p/><p>STEINHAUSER: Yes. Remember a couple of weeks ago, we said Michigan was a must-win for Romney?</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Right.</p><p/><p>STEINHAUSER: So, well, then the next week, we said it was Ohio. I think this week, you can say, yes, it's Illinois, more of a moderate state, much a different feel than what we saw in Alabama and Mississippi, a state that <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>really needs to win.</p><p/><p>You saw him change his strategy. He was not supposed to be campaigning in Illinois until today. He went there on Friday morning, went back all day yesterday. Usually, Sundays are a slow day for <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>in the campaign trail, spent the whole day there. You can see, Illinois is a crucial state for <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>to win.</p><p/><p>Remember, Louisiana coming up on Saturday. That is a more conservative state that Santorum will win. Keep your eyes on Illinois tomorrow, Zoraida.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Still a lot more ahead.</p><p/><p>STEINHAUSER: Oh, yes.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Paul Steinhauser, live in Washington, thank you very much.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Six minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast. Happening this moment, a major late winter storm causing some major headaches in -- yes, Arizona. I'm not kidding. Arizona.</p><p/><p>Look at your screen. In Flagstaff, more than a foot of snow is already on the ground. We could get another foot later on today. The storm is forcing closure of Interstate 40 for nearly 200 miles. That's from Kingman, Arizona, all the way to east Winslow, if you're keeping score.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Some good skiing there. You would love it.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Great skiing in Arizona. Yes, and great condos now in New York. Get yourself a winter condo in Connecticut.</p><p/><p>Other parts of the country are seeing some pretty unseasonably warm temperatures, as well.</p><p/><p>And Reynolds Wolf is in the weather center.</p><p/><p>OK, what's the deal?</p><p/><p>REYNOLDS WOLF, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Well, I mean, we really do have a crazy mix, which makes weather awfully interesting. But the snow in parts of Arizona, interesting, but not unusual at all. Many of us have the perception that in Arizona, you basically have Phoenix, you have Tucson. You don't think about the northern half of the state, but that's where you do quite a bit of snow. And that's certainly was the case this weekend.</p><p/><p>In Arizona, the snow volume, you had 26 inches of snow. Well over a foot in Ft. Valley, Flagstaff and even in Bellemont. Big Bear City in California got about 20 inches of snowfall. In some places, even a little more, and certainly great for all of the skiers up in Big Bear.</p><p/><p>What we're going to be seeing today is a little bit of a difference in parts of the Central and Southern Plains. Look for a chance of severe storms. Already severe storms watches in parts of Oklahoma and back in the northern Texas. Across parts of, well, Great Lakes and down into parts of, say, the Appalachians, we're seeing some rain in Pittsburgh.</p><p/><p>But the big chance of severe weather is going to take place right here in the Southern Plains as that frontal boundary sweeps its way to the east, interacts to that Gulf moisture, strong storm possible in parts of Texas and into Louisiana, as we fast forward from today into Tuesday.</p><p/><p>Now, one big issue there we're going to have is also the heavy rainfall we might see in parts of Texas. In fact, some places at six inches of rain falling at a very rapid rate. It means we certainly have a good chance of seeing some flooding in a few spots. Some places could see up to a foot just over the next 24 hours or so. So, certainly, a huge concern for a lot of people.</p><p/><p>The other thing you were talking about is the big change of temperatures. Out in the west, it has been the cold. But in the east, a huge ridge of high pressure, means 85 degrees your high in Memphis, up by Beale Street. In Chicago, they're still recovering over St. Patrick's Day, 79 degrees. Even in New York, where we sent it back to you guys, 72, the expected high.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Seventy-two. What month is this, Reynolds? What month are we in?</p><p/><p>WOLF: Hard to believe, but we're in March. I know.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: All right. Thank you for that, Reynolds Wolf.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: We're loving it, right?</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Yes. Well, I hate to say no complaints. I actually do have complaints. I think it's supposed to be cold when it's supposed to be cold. When it's supposed to be hot --</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Send her the e-mails.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: It is nine minutes now past 5:00. And this just in -- are you ready?</p><p/><p>We bring you this live, folks. The national price for gas rising for a tenth day in the row now, standing at $3.84 a gallon. That's according to AAA.</p><p/><p>Gas is already selling at least 4 bucks a gallon on average in seven states. And if you're one of them, I'm sorry. Alaska, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, New York and Washington -- feel your pain. That's the level analysts say that people start changing some of their spending habits, as well.</p><p/><p>And the steep rise in gas prices has become a weapon for Republicans to use against the president. But are there promises? Or just politics? Coming up at 6:15 Eastern, we're going to talk to Jim Burkhart, managing director of the Global Oil Group, and get answers there.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: I hope so.</p><p/><p>Our Christine Romans is watching the markets for us this morning.</p><p/><p>They closed mixed on Friday. The Dow and the NASDAQ both closing lower, but not by much. And the S&amp;P 500, which is nearing a four-year high, closed up by 0.01 percent. That's good news for your money. The S&amp;P 500 is the best indicator for what is in your 401(k).</p><p/><p>The stock futures are down ahead of the opening bell this morning.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Normally, I'm listening to all those details and processing them. But I can't think of anything other than Apple.</p><p/><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Apple. I know. 9:00, the company is having a conference call. And everybody wants to know what Apple is going to do with its huge cash horde. Did you know that Apple has $98 billion in cash sitting in the bank? Just the last --</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Say that again.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Ninety-eight billion dollars. It is literally more money than God.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Apple Computer designed something in Cupertino, California, builds it through subcontractors in China, ships it all over the world. And they're making things that we never knew we needed but now we can't live without. And Apple revenue is up, you know, 40 percent, 50 percent every year.</p><p/><p>Look at the stocks. You can see the shares of Apple Computer, just this year --</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Lord.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: -- are up almost 45 percent. We crossed $500 a share about a month ago, and then, crossed $600 a share four weeks later.</p><p/><p>Sitting on all this cash, in just the first fiscal quarter of the annual year, it made $16 billion, in cash. That's money that goes right into the bank. A lot of analysts are saying they think this company is going to give a dividend, meaning that shareholders of the company will get a little money back, maybe 2 percent, maybe 2.5 percent.</p><p/><p>A lot of big tech companies give money back to their investors, to their shareholders. And that's what folks are hoping will happen here. And they think it's going to make Apple even more valuable because then you have all of these big mutual funds and all these big value investors and investors who want to get a little bit of a return back for holding their Apple shares, instead of the stock going up and up.</p><p/><p>So --</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: I wonder where the top is, though, right?</p><p/><p>ROMANS: That's such a good question. There's two kind of adages on Wall Street. One is the trend is your friend. And the trend in Apple is up. I mean, anybody who's been, you know, selling Apple all the way up is just pulling their hair out, right?</p><p/><p>The other adage is, trees don't grow to the sky, meaning they can't go up forever. So, Apple has -- is Apple worth it? Does it continue to be worth $300, $400, $500 a share?</p><p/><p>It is if it can continue to invent things we didn't know we needed, if they can penetrate the entire world with their products. If their costumers -- their competitors don't find a way to start to eat into some of their momentum. The momentum is there for Apple right now.</p><p/><p>But the news today: will there be a dividend? We'll find out at 9:00.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: That's fascinating. Christine Romans, thank you so much.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: You're welcome.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Twelve minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast. And we are giving you an early read on some stories you should watch for later on today.</p><p/><p>Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians, he's expected to meet face-to-face for the first time with his attorney today in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. It's going to be the first time he gets a chance to talk with this prominent Seattle lawyer, John Henry Browne, who's made all sorts of media appearances, but hasn't talked to the client in person.</p><p/><p>Formal charges against Sergeant Bales could be filed this week.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: The owners of the New York Mets head to court today. A jury will decide if they looked the other way while reaping millions from Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The stakes are enormous for Madoff victims and the team, with over $300 million on the line.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: And Catherine, and the duchess of Cambridge -- that was ridiculous. I don't know why I said with that thrill in my voice. She's delivering her first public speech later this morning. It's going to happen in just over two hours during her event at a new children's hospital facility. Catherine will tour the building, meet the staff and the patients, and also plant a tree to commemorate the opening. Just don't her call Kate.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Do you remember Diana was the people's princess, right? I wonder if they dubbed her anything yet.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: I don't know. Yes, I'm not sure, because she really has the same aura.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: To connect.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: One thing I notice all the time, and maybe it's just me, she's very skinny, and gets skinnier and skinnier in each public appearance.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Well, if you had that kind of pressure on you. You have to do the same, right?</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Yes. I mean, I hope she is planning to have kids and get some beef on.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Fourteen minutes past the hour here.</p><p/><p>Coming up on EARLY START: Ontario town is turned upside down. Hundreds are on the street, rioting on St. Patrick's Day. Look at that. Those are actually students.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Are those Canadians?</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Students.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: What's wrong with the Canadians?</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: A lot. We're going to tell you about that when we come back.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: These are my rivals right now when I was in college.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Oh, really?</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Yes. So, go ahead. Show the pictures, as long as you want.</p><p/><p>Also coming up, the Supreme Court is set to debate health care reforms, real soon. And you know something? A single vote could make or break what we've come to know as Obamacare.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: And a shocking, new book. Did Fidel Castro know in advance that JFK would be assassinated? We're going to delve into that.</p><p/><p>You're watching EARLY START.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Good morning to you, Chicago.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Beautiful.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Sixty-three degrees right now. You know I'm bummed about this. It's going to be 79 degrees later.</p><p/><p>You've been having fabulous weather while I'm not there. You know? I don't know. But I'm happy. I am happy for you.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Look at that lovely picture. That's so pretty. I hope people are awake to see that.</p><p/><p>Well, if you are awake, you might be watching us obviously. Eighteen minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast.</p><p/><p>Time to check our stories making news this morning with Christine Romans.</p><p/><p>Hey there.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Good morning, you guys.</p><p/><p>I want to get you up to speed on the developing story out of Toulouse, France, this morning, where a gunman has reportedly killed two children and one adult outside of a Jewish school. Witnesses say the gunman sped off on a motor scooter after the shooting.</p><p/><p>This is video just in from the scene. French officials have ordered tighter security at all Jewish schools in the country. This is the same area where a soldier was killed by a gunman on a scooter recently. It's not clear if the incidents might be connected.</p><p/><p>Tomorrow's Illinois primary shaping up to be a critical battle in the race for the GOP nomination, 54 delegates up for grabs. <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>coming off a big win in the Puerto Rico primary. It could take a step towards the nomination with a win in Illinois. <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>insisting he'll be the nominee if he pulls off that upset tomorrow.</p><p/><p>A town in Ontario looking like a warzone on St. Patrick's Day. 1,000 rowdy revelers break out in riots. And they're sitting cars on fire, throwing glass bottles at police. Several people were arrested. One woman was reportedly taken to the hospital with burn injuries.</p><p/><p>\"21 Jump Street\" debuts at the top of the weekend box office, earning an estimated $35 million. The film starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was made for about $45 million. So, that's equal right away.</p><p/><p>Dr. Seuss' \"The Lorax\" fell to second. \"John Carter\" was third.</p><p/><p>And trivia question, ladies. Who -- which big, huge star got his start in the TV show, \"21 Jump Street\"? Remember?</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Johnny Depp.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: I know. It says exactly how old we are by knowing that.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Oh, I never get that stuff.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: I loved that show.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: You jumped on that one so quickly, I figured you were 100 percent right.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: If I didn't get it right, my entire former country where I emigrated from would be livid, because I think that was a Canadian production.</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Oh, was it? I didn't know that.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>ROMANS: There you go.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Christine --</p><p/><p>ROMANS: Useless trivia of the morning.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Twenty minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast.</p><p/><p>U.S. Supreme Court set to argue the president's health care reform law starting next week and the decision could come down to a single vote. The court is split between four liberal justices and five conservatives. And the White House is weighing its options on how to get that crucial fifth vote of approval.</p><p/><p>Jeffrey Toobin is CNN's senior legal analyst. He's also the dude who knows everything about the Nine. You wrote the book called \"The Nine.\"</p><p/><p>Hi, Jeff.</p><p/><p>JEFF TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Good to see you.</p><p/><p>Hey, listen. So, look, we've got a couple of minutes and I don't know how man years you studied constitutional law. So, this is going to be a bit of a sticky wicket to get through this. But essentially, what I'm gathering on this is that the Supreme Court has to decide over the challenges to Obamacare. And it has to do with some clauses that are critical in the Constitution.</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: Just one clause. Just one clause is all that matters.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: OK. Which one is it, the Commerce Clause?</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: The Commerce Clause.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Or that other really strange --</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: Don't worry about the other. It's the Commerce Clause.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: There's called a Necessary and Proper Clause.</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: Necessary and Proper is not really the main part of this case. It's really about the Commerce Clause.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: So, what's it about?</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: OK. Congress has to act under its authority in the Constitution. Something in the Constitution has to say Congress has the right to pass any law that it passes. And the authority that it uses in most of the laws that it passes relating to the economy is the Commerce Clause. In Article I, the Constitution says, Congress has the right to regulate commerce among the several states.</p><p/><p>What does that mean? What is -- what is the commerce power? Traditionally, that has been a very broad brand of power, particularly when it comes to health care in the economy. Think about -- we have Medicare. We have Medicaid.</p><p/><p>The United States government has been deeply involved in regulating health care for decades. The question in this case is the individual mandate, which is the part of Obamacare which says everyone has to have insurance.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: No matter what.</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: No matter what.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: You have to buy it.</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: Correct. And the question is that constitutional under Congress' power in the Commerce Clause.</p><p/><p>I think, I wrote an article in \"New Yorker\" this week, that the answer is clearly yes, because the national market for health insurance is unusual because everybody is part of that economy -- that market, no matter what, because if you buy health insurance, that's how you pay for health care. But if you don't buy health insurance, you're still going to be treated by a hospital if you fall in the street and get hurt. Everybody is going to pay for your health care even if you don't get health insurance.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: So, this is the inactive versus active argument?</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: Correct.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: OK, well, can I ask you this?</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: Sure.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Because when it comes to acting on the Supreme Court, we have nine justices.</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: Correct.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Four of them are liberal, considered to be, you know, falling in line on the liberal side. And you can see them on the left, appropriately so on the left-hand side of your screen. On the right-hand side of your screen, five of them, considered to be mostly in the right-hand corner when voting on issues.</p><p/><p>But the one who's critical here is Antonin Scalia, as I understand. That's why I brought up that Necessary and Proper Clause because there's some people watching this, Jeff, who say that the briefs and the direction that Obama and the Justice Department are taking, seem to indicate they're pushing this argument to fall into that clause because that man had voted accordingly before and that might be how they can get their conservative vote. Is that crazy?</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: Well, it's not crazy, because -- I mean, this case, the scope of federal power has been something that the Supreme Court has dealt with for decades. I mean, this came up a lot during the New Deal. And then after the New Deal, even conservative justices, as you point out, like Justice Scalia, certainly Justice Kennedy who is usually the swing vote in these cases, have voted to approve broad federal powers.</p><p/><p>So, the possibility here, and I think it's a legitimate possibility, is that these conservatives might join the liberals in upholding Obamacare because there are different roots to get there in terms of finding constitutional justification. You could find the Commerce Clause. You can find the Necessary and Proper Clause, federal taxing power is also broad.</p><p/><p>And so, I think the odds do favor this law being upheld. But there are different ways you can do it.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Well, this is pretty thick and chewy stuff and you did a great job. You ever thought of teaching for a living?</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: No.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: You should. I would take your class. I would give this up, all this glamour and getting up 1:00 in the morning to take your class.</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: Absolutely. I appreciate it.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Jeff Toobin, lovely to see you. Thank you.</p><p/><p>TOOBIN: See you.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: It's always nice to break it down into English. You are absolutely right.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Twenty-four minutes past the hour.</p><p/><p>Ahead on EARLY START, more kooky weather. California, a town there is digging out. A massive, massive mudslide in that area. I think they're predicting more rain, although they are praying for no rain this morning.</p><p/><p>And did you hear about <person><nameText>Rick Santorum's </nameText></person>really bold prediction? He says that he will be the nominee if he wins Illinois tomorrow.</p><p/><p>You're watching EARLY START.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Her killing captivated an entire nation. And to this day, JonBenet Ramsey's murder remains unsolved.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: And now, her father is talking about the case and his decision to let his daughter participate in beauty pageants.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>JOHN RAMSEY, JONBENET RAMSEY'S FATHER: The point is, you need to protect your children, and not to put them on public display like that. It would be my choice if I had to do it all over again.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: More of my interview with John Ramsey, what he has to say about today's toddler and child pageants. And also, the one thing he's been carrying around with him for 15 years. You're going to see it.</p><p/><p>You're watching EARLY START.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: It is 29 minutes past 5:00 on the East Coast. Welcome back to EARLY START. I'm Ashleigh Banfield.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: And I'm Zoraida Sambolin. It is time to check the stories making news this morning.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Two children were among three reportedly killed in a shooting outside a Jewish school in Toulouse, France. Witnesses say a man on a scooter opened fire a child drop off zone and then took off. CNN is working to confirm the details. Several other people reportedly injured, as well, by the gunman. Security has been ordered tightened at Jewish schools throughout France.</p><p/><p>This incident occurs just days after three soldiers were shot to death by a man on a scooter in the same part of France, but it is not clear at this point if those shootings are connected.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN (voice-over): And tomorrow's Illinois primary shaping up to be a make-or-break battle between <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Rick Santorum. </nameText></person>Romney coming off a big win in Puerto Rico could take a big step toward clinching the nomination with a strong showing in Illinois. While <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>says the nomination will be his if he pulls off an upset tomorrow.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD (voice-over): Forget spring break. Today's a snow day. And that's for kids in Flagstaff, Arizona. That city has received more than a foot of snow to the late winter storm, and it shut down I- 40 for almost 200 miles.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: And look at this messy, muddy weekend in New Castle, California. Look at there is a minute. About 30 miles northeast to the Sacramento. They are still digging out after a massive mudslide. It had one main road blocked for hours, and some folks in the neighborhood are little jittery this morning, because one heavy rain could threaten several home there. BANFIELD: North Carolina state pulling off the upset and busting up Brackets, too. The number 11 seed Wolfpack defeated third seed Georgetown, 66-63. It happened on Sunday to advance the NCAA tournament's sweet 16. N.C. State will now play the Kansas Jayhawks on Friday.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN (on-camera): Thirty-one minutes past the hour.</p><p/><p>The primary in Illinois tomorrow could turn out to be a defining moment in the race for the Republican nomination. <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>routed <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>in Puerto Rico in the primary yesterday. He got over 80 percent of the vote, and he gets the full 20 delegates.</p><p/><p>Santorum, however, sounding surprisingly confident, in spite of that. Hoping for an upset in Illinois, where 54 delegates are at stake, making a bold prediction also, if he pulls it off.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p><person><nameText>RICK SANTORUM, </nameText></person>(R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we're able to come out of Illinois with a huge or surprise win, I guarantee you, I guarantee you, we will win this nomination.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: So, Santorum has a long way to go. The delegate count right now. Romney is at 518. Santorum is at 239. So, let's talk to our political panel about this. Live from Washington, D.C., we have Joe Williams, White House reporter for Politico. Nice smile this morning. Here in New York, we have Democratic strategist, John Hlinko, who is being seated. There you are. Good morning to you.</p><p/><p>Running a little late this morning. And then, in Chicago, we have Lenny McAllister. Good morning to you. Thanks for being with us, gentlemen. All right. Joe, I'm going to start with you. Santorum isn't even eligible for ten of those Illinois delegates, right? He didn't qualify for the ballots in four out of the 18 districts in Illinois. So, how can he pull off the surprise win that he's talking about?</p><p/><p>JOE WILLIAMS, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, POLITICO: Well, I mean, he's managed to surprise and confound people before. This one looks like a bit more of a long shot. I ran into a Democratic operative a couple of days ago who said, basically, if Santorum had even a smaller -- small organization -- if he had a better organization even to as minor degree, he'd probably be the frontrunner by now, because he's managed to excite the base.</p><p/><p>And he's done a lot of that by hand-to-hand, shaking the hands, plus pressing the flesh, retail politics that <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>is not so good at. So, it's possible, but his disorganization makes it probably unlikely that he would triumph and collect enough delegates to overcome or at least take a huge bite out of <person><nameText>Mitt Romney's </nameText></person>lead in Illinois. SAMBOLIN: And his lack of organization is what got him into this, right?</p><p/><p>WILLIAMS: Pretty much, yes. That's what got him into the fix, because it's not like nobody knew when these primaries were going to happen or that the schedule hadn't been set up at least a year and a half, two years in advance, to make sure that everybody had enough time and knew what they needed to do to get every last delegate that they qualify for.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Lenny, I'm going to switch gears over to you. So, Romney was talking about the math, right? And this was last week that he was talking about that. He's talking about delegate math again on Fox News. Let's listen, and then, we're going to chat about it.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY, </nameText></person>(R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know a lot of people will talk about delegates and strategies and math, and that's all very interesting to the insiders. But I think the American people want to see someone who has the leadership, skill, and experience to defeat the president. I can't tell you exactly how the process is going to work, but I bet (ph) I'm going to become the nominee. I sure hope I'm going to become the nominee.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: So, Lenny, he knows that he has to get the delegates in order to win. And the polling is showing that it's a very tight race. What's that play in Illinois?</p><p/><p>LENNY MCALLISTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: What's it play is, once again, being able to excite voters. And, he's actually pivoting away from talking about that delegate math, because if you remember what it looked like coming out of southern Tuesday last week, he was talking about how it was inevitable that the delegate math would not allow anybody else other than him to win the nomination.</p><p/><p>Well, that didn't play very well. Voters don't want to be excited about delegate math. They want to be excited about leadership. So, what he's trying to do right now is pivot away from that. He should still win, obviously, the majority of delegates here should he win Illinois tomorrow, but he also needs to excite people.</p><p/><p>He needs to finally coalesced a base, get them behind him so that as he moves into Yankee primary when coming into April and some of these other states going to the District of Columbia in April, et cetera, he can have momentum. He still does not have the momentum of the people to drive him.</p><p/><p>He's going to need the Tea Party momentum, which is really big here in Illinois and other segments of the conservative base behind them so that by the time he gets to Tampa, he's not trying to forge alliances. He's trying to invigorate those alliances that he's forming now in the spring to go after President Obama in the fall. SAMBOLIN: You know what, I want to ask you one more question, and it's about Santorum, that big loss that he sustained in Puerto Rico because of the English language requirement there. Is that something that could actually help him in Illinois, do you think?</p><p/><p>MCALLISTER: I think it will help him down state. Now, <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>stayed consistent with this. He tried his best to ride the line, be consistent with his message, but be respectful to the cultural uniqueness of Puerto Rico.</p><p/><p>At the same time, you look at this other side, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>who has a reputation of flip-flopping, said he wanted English to be the official language of the United States at one point in time, goes down to Puerto Rico and completely backs away from that position. That situation right there will play well for <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>in regards to consistency and painting <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>as a flip-flopper.</p><p/><p>Will it be enough in Illinois? Maybe, maybe not. Will it be something that will come up later on in his campaign trail? Absolutely.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. I'll be curious to see how he does in Southern Illinois, so we'll watch that. John, I'm going to switch to you, and we're going to talk about gas prices. Again, we just showed a little while ago that they're actually swinging upwards again. Economists say that the president can't do much to affect prices, right?</p><p/><p>But tell that to 54 percent of the people who believe in president can do a lot to control gas prices. Charles Krauthammer is saying this as well.</p><p/><p>\"Yes, of course, presidents have no direct control over gas prices, but the American people know something about this president and his disdain for oil. To the American worker who doesn't commute by government motorcade and is getting fleeced every week at the pump, oil seems very much a fuel of the present and of the foreseeable future.\"</p><p/><p>So, this affects people's wallets, obviously. What can President Obama do in order to ease this pain at the pump?</p><p/><p>JOHN HLINKO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, the reality is, there's not a heck of a lot he can do, at least, in the short-term. I mean, people would like to believe that the president has a magic wand that he can wave, and you know? I mean --</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: But the perception is there, right? What can you do to fight that perception? Fifty-four percent of Americans believe that it is the president's fault.</p><p/><p>HLINKO: Well, there is some talk about releasing some oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, which could help fight the perception. In other words, show kind of action. Whether or not it makes sense is another question, but that is one thing that could help. It could, at least, let people know that he's trying to do something.</p><p/><p>I think the reality is, we buy a lot of oil from some pretty dangerous places, and there's going to be shutoffs and there's going to be tensions in the Middle East that's going to drive up prices. All of the talk of war in Iran, that drives up prices. Frankly, the mishandled war in Iraq is still hurting us, because Iraq could have been producing more oil and that could have driven down the price.</p><p/><p>But, you know, trying to explain that in a 30-second, you know, sound byte, it's not easy. I suspect the president will open up the strategic petroleum reserve or at least some oil and that should help the perception, at least.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. We're going to talk a lot about that later. Thank you so much, gentlemen. Joe, Lenny, John, thanks for being with us. We'll see you again on the six o'clock hour.</p><p/><p>MCALLISTER: Thanks, Zoraida.</p><p/><p>HLINKO: Thank you.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: And CNN's coverage of the Illinois primary begins tomorrow night at 7:00 eastern with Erin Burnett, then it's followed by live coverage of the primary results at 8:00 with Wolf Blitzer, Anderson Cooper, and the CNN political team.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Thirty-eight minutes now past 5:00 on the east coast. Coming up, my one-on-one interview with John Ramsey, JonBenet's father. Can you believe if she were alive today, she would be 21 years old. What is it like when John Ramsey comes into contact with some of her friend who are 21? I'll ask him that question. You'll find out.</p><p/><p>Also, did Fidel Castro know that JFK would be assassinated before it happened? We'll have that story as well. You're watching EARLY START.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: It was 16 years ago that this image of a six-year-old beauty queen was splashed across every supermarket tabloid in this country. Her murder, a mystery that no one seems to be able to solve. JonBenet Ramsey's parents would be under an umbrella of suspicion for a decade and a half.</p><p/><p>It's hard to believe, but today, JonBenet would be 21 years old. And although, her family has been cleared of suspicion, the killer may still be out there. I had a chance to sit down with JonBenet's dad, Jon Ramsey. We talked about his brand-new book, \"The Other Side of Suffering,\" about his remarkable journey back from the brink and his new outlook on life.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>JOHN RAMSEY, JONBENET RAMSEY'S FATHER: I've learned a lot about suffering, about recovery. I've learned about how your faith is challenged when you suffer tragedy. And my eyes have also been opened to the fact that everybody carries a burden. And so, I want to share that.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: When I met you, I didn't expect to meet a happy person, but I really kind of feel like I met a happy person. Is that true?</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: Yes. I can say that I have joy in my life, which I think is a deeper appreciation of what life's all about, what your purpose is, where you're going to life, what the future holds. There was a period of time when I was so angry that if I'd knew who he was, we wouldn't need a trial, and I would have no remorse. But that anger has passed to a point now where I want to know why? Why did this happen to my child?</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: How did you get there?</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: Well, it took a long time, and I spent a lot of time thinking about and reading about the whole topic of forgiveness. And then, I realize that forgiveness, really, is a gift that I give myself. It's a letting go. It's moving on. It has nothing to do with, of course, you're forgiving -- maybe not want to be forgiven, not even know you forgiven, but it's a release.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: What would you want people to know about JonBenet?</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: She was so much more than a beauty queen that she's been tagged, and it really hurts when she's tagged that way because that was just a small element of her life. She was energetic. She was incredibly smart. Just an amazing, young child.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: You used to call her Johnny B.</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: Yes, Johnny B. She lit the room up and not everybody -- I remember one day, I came home from work, and I was kind of crying about something. She said, dad, I don't like that face. So, I put on a smile. She said, that's better. That is just who she was.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Attitude adjustment.</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: Yes, total.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Speaking of those, you see these programs on cable, \"Toddlers &amp; Tiaras.\"</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: Yes. it called a little bit of that.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: When you see those programs, what do you think?</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: I don't care for them at all. And that was certainly not the world in a JonBenet and Patsy participated in back then. That was 15 years ago. When Patsy and JonBenet did it, there was always a talent component to the program. And the only people there were grandparents and moms and dads.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Not coaches. RAMSEY: No coaches.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Costume designers.</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: No. No. And, but now that they put it -- made a television show out of it, it's pretty questionable. That's a good idea. I don't think it is.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Do you regret that JonBenet was even in a small part of that world?</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: Well, in a sense. You know, we questioned it for a while. Was that the reason we were targeted? Was there someone in that audience that looked at her in a different way than they should have?</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Do you think that's --</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: I don't think so. No, I don't. But we certainly wondered that. But I think the point is that you need to protect your children to not put them on public display like that. It would be my choice if I had to do over again.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: You carry a medal in your wallet?</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: Yes.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: To this day?</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: Yes.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: What's it for?</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: Well, it was a medal that JonBenet won five days before she was killed for a talent contest.

It was kind of a thing between us.</p><p/><p>I went to the events. I was late, and she already had the contest. She won this all talent award. She came running up to me and said, Daddy, I won this for you and put it around my neck. It was just a little silver dollar medal. And after she died, in my mind, I want that medal, because we never went back in the house.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Never?</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: Never. But I wanted to get that medal at some time. And I just had that thought in my mind and tell me -- my sister, Pam, went back to the house to get clothes for us and came back after a few hours and came up to me where we were staying and said, John, I just felt this overwhelming need to bring this to you.</p><p/><p>And it was the medal. And to me, there's a touch of heaven. It was reassurance, to me, that JonBenet was OK. She knew her father needed some help. I cried, but I cried with tears of joy when I got this.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: You should be a much more bitter person.</p><p/><p>RAMSEY: Well, I heard a sermon once that said you can be, after tragedy, bitter, broken, barren or better. And, the opportunity is to be better.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: John happened just mentioned to me that recently, he bumped into an old friend of JonBenet's from back in the day when she was six years old, and that friend is 21 and getting married. So, I asked him, do you imagine JonBenet at 21? And he said, absolutely not. She's frozen in time at the age of six years old.</p><p/><p>So difficult to go through these details, Zoraida. He seems like such a good man and such positive man despite --</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: I was going to say that. It comes across, right? And you always wonder, how do parents survive something like that? And for him to say that he found his joy again, remarkable. And I think an inspiration to a lot of people.</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: Yes. No, without --</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BANFIELD: And the book is great. So, I highly recommend. Take a look.</p><p/><p>SAMBOLIN: Thank you.

And welcome to EARLY START.  I'm Ashleigh Banfield.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       ZORAIDA SAMBOLIN, CNN ANCHOR:  And I'm Zoraida Sambolin.  We're very happy you're with us.  We're bringing you the news from A to Z. It is 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       And we begin with your top stories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">       Fifty-four delegates at stake tomorrow in the Illinois primary. Mitt Romney coming off a rout of Rick Santorum in Puerto Rico.  But Santorum is insisting the nomination is his, if he pulls off an Illinois upset.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Spring nearly sprung.  So, what the heck is this?  No joke.  More than a foot of snow on the ground in Flagstaff, Arizona. More on the way, too.  Bizarre.  A major late winter storm shutting down the Interstate 40 for nearly 200 miles.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  In Nebraska and Oklahoma, the trouble is tornadoes. Take a look at this.  Storm chasers captured this twister on the ground in the town of Willow, Oklahoma.  CNN's Reynolds Wolf is tracking all of the severe weather.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Dozens of Occupy Wall Street demonstrators arrested in ugly pictures in lower Manhattan.  They're trying to reoccupy Zuccotti Park.  The accusations are flying this morning that New York City police abused peaceful protesters.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  And how sweet it is.  The sweet 16 is set after 11th seeded North Carolina State upset third-seeded Georgetown.  Up next for N.C. State, Kansas on Friday.</p><p>       ANNOUNCER:  This is CNN breaking news.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  And we begin with breaking news from France. </p><p>       At least three people, including two children, have reportedly been killed in a shooting outside of a Jewish school in Toulouse, France.  That's in the southwest part of the country.  And several other people were reportedly also injured by this gunman.  Security has been ordered tightened at Jewish schools.  It's not clear if these shootings could be connected to some other shootings that involved soldiers earlier on.</p><p>CNN's Jim Bittermann is joining us on the phone from Paris.</p><p>       So, give us the details on the injured and those who were killed.  And exactly who this shooter could be, Jim.</p><p>       JIM BITTERMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Well, that's certainly what police are looking at this morning. Basically, Ashleigh, about 10 minutes after 8:00 this morning, local time, as students were gathering at a school called the Ozar Hatorah School in the Jewish area of Toulouse.  In fact, a gunman came by on a motor bike and shot into the crowd of about four or five people. Reports are that two students were killed and adults killed and several injured in addition to who were killed.</p><p>       Now, what police are looking into what connection there might be to two earlier shooting instances involving soldiers in the Toulouse area.  Basically, the M.O., the method of operation looks very similar.  A motor bike involved.  The gunman comes by and shoots.  In one case, shot at one soldier and killed him.  In another case, a gunman shot at three soldiers.  Two of those soldiers were killed and another severely injured.</p><p>       So, police have at least the potential serial killer on the loose in Toulouse.  The interior minister of France said that he is going to be headed that direction down to Toulouse this morning to see what reinforcements he can give to the local police, Ashleigh.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  All right.  Jim Bittermann reporting from Paris, about an incident in Toulouse.  And the Israeli foreign minister making a comment, being horrified by what transpired in France today. We'll have more on that as it develops. </p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  It is three minutes past the hour here.</p><p>       Mitt Romney, hoping to take a big step towards clinching the GOP nomination with a victory in Illinois tomorrow.  That's after routing Rick Santorum in the Puerto Rico victory.  He got roughly 83 percent of the vote in Puerto Rico yesterday.  Santorum, in the single digits. With 20 delegates for Romney.  He is hoping to parlay the win into Latino votes moving forward.</p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>       MITT ROMNEY (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Those people who don't think that Latinos won't vote for a Republican need to take a look in Puerto Rico and see there that conservative principles and Latino voters go together and that Hispanic voters are going to vote for Republicans if we stand for something, conservative principles that bring growth and good jobs and rising home values.  That's how we're going to win.  We're going to get Latino voters to help us out.</p><p>       (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  So, let's look at the delegates scoreboard here. Romney with 518.  Santorum, 239.  Gingrich, 139.  Ron Paul there with 69.</p><p>       Fifty-four delegates at stake tomorrow in Illinois where polls show Romney with a slight lead.</p><p>CNN political editor Paul Steinhauser live in Washington, D.C. for us.</p><p>       Quite a trouncing.  Let's start in Puerto Rico and we'll move forward to Illinois.</p><p>       PAUL STEINHAUSER, CNN POLITICAL EDITOR:  You got it.  Here's the (INAUDIBLE) between the Romney and the Santorum campaigns.  Remember, Rick Santorum was also down in Puerto Rico for two days, Zoraida, on Wednesday and Thursday, and got in little trouble over the Spanish language and the controversy there of whether they should make English the official language if they were to become a state.</p><p>       Take a look at this statement from Hogan Gidley, spokesman for the Santorum campaign, last night after the loss in Puerto Rico.  It says, \"Rick Santorum has a consistent core.  And he showed that when he went to Puerto Rico and took a locally unpopular but principled stance about English being the language of America.</p><p>       Mitt Romney on the other hand switched another one of his positions to gain favor in Puerto Rico, by saying that Puerto Ricans shouldn't have to lean English if they want to become a state.  We all know Mitt Romney will do and say anything to get votes.  And this is just another example of that.\"</p><p>       You can imagine, the Romney campaign definitely doesn't agree with this.  And they said that Romney has not flip-flopped at all on this issue.  And they disagree very much with the Santorum campaign.</p><p>       But just another slice here of the nastiness you can see between the two campaigns, Zoraida.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  All right.  So, let's move forward to Illinois now. Santorum says if he wins that, he's got the nomination.  Romney says he's ahead.</p><p>       What's happening in Illinois?</p><p>       STEINHAUSER:  Yes.  Remember a couple of weeks ago, we said Michigan was a must-win for Romney?</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Right.</p><p>       STEINHAUSER:  So, well, then the next week, we said it was Ohio. I think this week, you can say, yes, it's Illinois, more of a moderate state, much a different feel than what we saw in Alabama and Mississippi, a state that Mitt Romney really needs to win.</p><p>       You saw him change his strategy.  He was not supposed to be campaigning in Illinois until today.  He went there on Friday morning, went back all day yesterday.  Usually, Sundays are a slow day for Mitt Romney in the campaign trail, spent the whole day there.  You can see, Illinois is a crucial state for Mitt Romney to win.</p><p>       Remember, Louisiana coming up on Saturday.  That is a more conservative state that Santorum will win.  Keep your eyes on Illinois tomorrow, Zoraida.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Still a lot more ahead.</p><p>       STEINHAUSER:  Oh, yes.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Paul Steinhauser, live in Washington, thank you very much.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Six minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast. Happening this moment, a major late winter storm causing some major headaches in -- yes, Arizona.  I'm not kidding.  Arizona.</p><p>       Look at your screen.  In Flagstaff, more than a foot of snow is already on the ground.  We could get another foot later on today.  The storm is forcing closure of Interstate 40 for nearly 200 miles. That's from Kingman, Arizona, all the way to east Winslow, if you're keeping score.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Some good skiing there.  You would love it.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Great skiing in Arizona.  Yes, and great condos now in New York.  Get yourself a winter condo in Connecticut.</p><p>       Other parts of the country are seeing some pretty unseasonably warm temperatures, as well.</p><p>       And Reynolds Wolf is in the weather center. </p><p>       OK, what's the deal?</p><p>       REYNOLDS WOLF, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  Well, I mean, we really do have a crazy mix, which makes weather awfully interesting.  But the snow in parts of Arizona, interesting, but not unusual at all.  Many of us have the perception that in Arizona, you basically have Phoenix, you have Tucson.  You don't think about the northern half of the state, but that's where you do quite a bit of snow.  And that's certainly was the case this weekend. </p><p>       In Arizona, the snow volume, you had 26 inches of snow.  Well over a foot in Ft. Valley, Flagstaff and even in Bellemont.  Big Bear City in California got about 20 inches of snowfall.  In some places, even a little more, and certainly great for all of the skiers up in Big Bear. </p><p>       What we're going to be seeing today is a little bit of a difference in parts of the Central and Southern Plains.  Look for a chance of severe storms.  Already severe storms watches in parts of Oklahoma and back in the northern Texas.  Across parts of, well, Great Lakes and down into parts of, say, the Appalachians, we're seeing some rain in Pittsburgh.</p><p>       But the big chance of severe weather is going to take place right here in the Southern Plains as that frontal boundary sweeps its way to the east, interacts to that Gulf moisture, strong storm possible in parts of Texas and into Louisiana, as we fast forward from today into Tuesday.</p><p>       Now, one big issue there we're going to have is also the heavy rainfall we might see in parts of Texas.  In fact, some places at six inches of rain falling at a very rapid rate.  It means we certainly have a good chance of seeing some flooding in a few spots.  Some places could see up to a foot just over the next 24 hours or so.  So, certainly, a huge concern for a lot of people.</p><p>       The other thing you were talking about is the big change of temperatures.  Out in the west, it has been the cold.  But in the east, a huge ridge of high pressure, means 85 degrees your high in Memphis, up by Beale Street.  In Chicago, they're still recovering over St. Patrick's Day, 79 degrees.  Even in New York, where we sent it back to you guys, 72, the expected high.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Seventy-two.  What month is this, Reynolds?  What month are we in?</p><p>       WOLF:  Hard to believe, but we're in March.  I know.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  All right.  Thank you for that, Reynolds Wolf.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  We're loving it, right?</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Yes.  Well, I hate to say no complaints.  I actually do have complaints.  I think it's supposed to be cold when it's supposed to be cold.  When it's supposed to be hot --  </p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Send her the e-mails.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  It is nine minutes now past 5:00.  And this just in -- are you ready?</p><p>       We bring you this live, folks.  The national price for gas rising for a tenth day in the row now, standing at $3.84 a gallon. That's according to AAA.</p><p>       Gas is already selling at least 4 bucks a gallon on average in seven states.  And if you're one of them, I'm sorry.  Alaska, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, New York and Washington -- feel your pain.  That's the level analysts say that people start changing some of their spending habits, as well.</p><p>       And the steep rise in gas prices has become a weapon for Republicans to use against the president.  But are there promises?  Or just politics?  Coming up at 6:15 Eastern, we're going to talk to Jim Burkhart, managing director of the Global Oil Group, and get answers there.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  I hope so.</p><p>       Our Christine Romans is watching the markets for us this morning.</p><p>       They closed mixed on Friday.  The Dow and the NASDAQ both closing lower, but not by much.  And the S&amp;P 500, which is nearing a four-year high, closed up by 0.01 percent.  That's good news for your money.  The S&amp;P 500 is the best indicator for what is in your 401(k).</p><p>       The stock futures are down ahead of the opening bell this morning.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Normally, I'm listening to all those details and processing them.  But I can't think of anything other than Apple.</p><p>       CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Apple.  I know. 9:00, the company is having a conference call.  And everybody wants to know what Apple is going to do with its huge cash horde.  Did you know that Apple has $98 billion in cash sitting in the bank?  Just the last --  </p><p>       BANFIELD:  Say that again.</p><p>       ROMANS:  Ninety-eight billion dollars.  It is literally more money than God.</p><p>       (CROSSTALK)</p><p>       ROMANS:  Apple Computer designed something in Cupertino, California, builds it through subcontractors in China, ships it all over the world.  And they're making things that we never knew we needed but now we can't live without.  And Apple revenue is up, you know, 40 percent, 50 percent every year.</p><p>       Look at the stocks.  You can see the shares of Apple Computer, just this year --  </p><p>       BANFIELD:  Lord.</p><p>       ROMANS:  -- are up almost 45 percent.  We crossed $500 a share about a month ago, and then, crossed $600 a share four weeks later.</p><p>       Sitting on all this cash, in just the first fiscal quarter of the annual year, it made $16 billion, in cash.  That's money that goes right into the bank.  A lot of analysts are saying they think this company is going to give a dividend, meaning that shareholders of the company will get a little money back, maybe 2 percent, maybe 2.5 percent.</p><p>       A lot of big tech companies give money back to their investors, to their shareholders.  And that's what folks are hoping will happen here.  And they think it's going to make Apple even more valuable because then you have all of these big mutual funds and all these big value investors and investors who want to get a little bit of a return back for holding their Apple shares, instead of the stock going up and up.</p><p>       So --  </p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  I wonder where the top is, though, right?</p><p>       ROMANS:  That's such a good question.  There's two kind of adages on Wall Street.  One is the trend is your friend.  And the trend in Apple is up.  I mean, anybody who's been, you know, selling Apple all the way up is just pulling their hair out, right?</p><p>       The other adage is, trees don't grow to the sky, meaning they can't go up forever.  So, Apple has -- is Apple worth it?  Does it continue to be worth $300, $400, $500 a share? </p><p>       It is if it can continue to invent things we didn't know we needed, if they can penetrate the entire world with their products. If their costumers -- their competitors don't find a way to start to eat into some of their momentum.  The momentum is there for Apple right now.</p><p>       But the news today: will there be a dividend?  We'll find out at 9:00.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  That's fascinating.  Christine Romans, thank you so much.</p><p>       ROMANS:  You're welcome.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Twelve minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast.  And we are giving you an early read on some stories you should watch for later on today.</p><p>       Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians, he's expected to meet face-to-face for the first time with his attorney today in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.  It's going to be the first time he gets a chance to talk with this prominent Seattle lawyer, John Henry Browne, who's made all sorts of media appearances, but hasn't talked to the client in person.</p><p>       Formal charges against Sergeant Bales could be filed this week.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  The owners of the New York Mets head to court today. A jury will decide if they looked the other way while reaping millions from Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme.  The stakes are enormous for Madoff victims and the team, with over $300 million on the line.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  And Catherine, and the duchess of Cambridge -- that was ridiculous.  I don't know why I said with that thrill in my voice. She's delivering her first public speech later this morning.  It's going to happen in just over two hours during her event at a new children's hospital facility.  Catherine will tour the building, meet the staff and the patients, and also plant a tree to commemorate the opening.  Just don't her call Kate.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Do you remember Diana was the people's princess, right?  I wonder if they dubbed her anything yet.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  I don't know.  Yes, I'm not sure, because she really has the same aura.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  To connect. </p><p>       BANFIELD:  One thing I notice all the time, and maybe it's just me, she's very skinny, and gets skinnier and skinnier in each public appearance. </p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Well, if you had that kind of pressure on you.  You have to do the same, right?</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Yes.  I mean, I hope she is planning to have kids and get some beef on.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  All right.  Fourteen minutes past the hour here.</p><p>       Coming up on EARLY START: Ontario town is turned upside down. Hundreds are on the street, rioting on St. Patrick's Day.  Look at that.  Those are actually students.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Are those Canadians?</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Students.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  What's wrong with the Canadians?</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  A lot.  We're going to tell you about that when we come back.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  These are my rivals right now when I was in college.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Oh, really?</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Yes.  So, go ahead.  Show the pictures, as long as you want.</p><p>       Also coming up, the Supreme Court is set to debate health care reforms, real soon.  And you know something?  A single vote could make or break what we've come to know as Obamacare.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  And a shocking, new book.  Did Fidel Castro know in advance that JFK would be assassinated?  We're going to delve into that.</p><p>       You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>       (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Good morning to you, Chicago.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Beautiful.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Sixty-three degrees right now.  You know I'm bummed about this.  It's going to be 79 degrees later.</p><p>       You've been having fabulous weather while I'm not there.  You know?  I don't know.  But I'm happy.  I am happy for you.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Look at that lovely picture.  That's so pretty.  I hope people are awake to see that. </p><p>       Well, if you are awake, you might be watching us obviously. Eighteen minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast.</p><p>       Time to check our stories making news this morning with Christine Romans.</p><p>       Hey there.</p><p>       ROMANS:  Good morning, you guys.</p><p>       I want to get you up to speed on the developing story out of Toulouse, France, this morning, where a gunman has reportedly killed two children and one adult outside of a Jewish school.  Witnesses say the gunman sped off on a motor scooter after the shooting.</p><p>       This is video just in from the scene.  French officials have ordered tighter security at all Jewish schools in the country.  This is the same area where a soldier was killed by a gunman on a scooter recently.  It's not clear if the incidents might be connected.</p><p>       Tomorrow's Illinois primary shaping up to be a critical battle in the race for the GOP nomination, 54 delegates up for grabs.  Mitt Romney coming off a big win in the Puerto Rico primary.  It could take a step towards the nomination with a win in Illinois.  Rick Santorum insisting he'll be the nominee if he pulls off that upset tomorrow.</p><p>       A town in Ontario looking like a warzone on St. Patrick's Day. 1,000 rowdy revelers break out in riots.  And they're sitting cars on fire, throwing glass bottles at police.  Several people were arrested. One woman was reportedly taken to the hospital with burn injuries.</p><p>       \"21 Jump Street\" debuts at the top of the weekend box office, earning an estimated $35 million.  The film starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was made for about $45 million.  So, that's equal right away.</p><p>       Dr. Seuss' \"The Lorax\" fell to second.  \"John Carter\" was third.</p><p>       And trivia question, ladies.  Who -- which big, huge star got his start in the TV show, \"21 Jump Street\"?  Remember?</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Johnny Depp.</p><p>       ROMANS:  I know.  It says exactly how old we are by knowing that.</p><p>       (CROSSTALK)</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Oh, I never get that stuff.</p><p>       ROMANS:  I loved that show.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  You jumped on that one so quickly, I figured you were 100 percent right.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  If I didn't get it right, my entire former country where I emigrated from would be livid, because I think that was a Canadian production.</p><p>       ROMANS:  Oh, was it?  I didn't know that.</p><p>       (CROSSTALK)</p><p>       ROMANS:  There you go.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Christine --  </p><p>       ROMANS:  Useless trivia of the morning.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Twenty minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast.</p><p>       U.S. Supreme Court set to argue the president's health care reform law starting next week and the decision could come down to a single vote.  The court is split between four liberal justices and five conservatives.  And the White House is weighing its options on how to get that crucial fifth vote of approval.</p><p>       Jeffrey Toobin is CNN's senior legal analyst.  He's also the dude who knows everything about the Nine.  You wrote the book called \"The Nine.\"</p><p>       Hi, Jeff.</p><p>       JEFF TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Good to see you.</p><p>       Hey, listen.  So, look, we've got a couple of minutes and I don't know how man years you studied constitutional law.  So, this is going to be a bit of a sticky wicket to get through this.  But essentially, what I'm gathering on this is that the Supreme Court has to decide over the challenges to Obamacare.  And it has to do with some clauses that are critical in the Constitution.</p><p>       TOOBIN:  Just one clause.  Just one clause is all that matters. </p><p>       BANFIELD:  OK. Which one is it, the Commerce Clause?</p><p>       TOOBIN:  The Commerce Clause.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Or that other really strange --  </p><p>       TOOBIN:  Don't worry about the other.  It's the Commerce Clause.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  There's called a Necessary and Proper Clause.</p><p>       TOOBIN:  Necessary and Proper is not really the main part of this case.  It's really about the Commerce Clause.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  So, what's it about?</p><p>       TOOBIN:  OK.  Congress has to act under its authority in the Constitution.  Something in the Constitution has to say Congress has the right to pass any law that it passes.  And the authority that it uses in most of the laws that it passes relating to the economy is the Commerce Clause.  In Article I, the Constitution says, Congress has the right to regulate commerce among the several states.</p><p>       What does that mean?  What is -- what is the commerce power? Traditionally, that has been a very broad brand of power, particularly when it comes to health care in the economy.  Think about -- we have Medicare.  We have Medicaid.</p><p>       The United States government has been deeply involved in regulating health care for decades.  The question in this case is the individual mandate, which is the part of Obamacare which says everyone has to have insurance.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  No matter what.</p><p>       TOOBIN:  No matter what.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  You have to buy it.</p><p>       TOOBIN:  Correct.  And the question is that constitutional under Congress' power in the Commerce Clause.</p><p>       I think, I wrote an article in \"New Yorker\" this week, that the answer is clearly yes, because the national market for health insurance is unusual because everybody is part of that economy -- that market, no matter what, because if you buy health insurance, that's how you pay for health care.  But if you don't buy health insurance, you're still going to be treated by a hospital if you fall in the street and get hurt.  Everybody is going to pay for your health care even if you don't get health insurance.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  So, this is the inactive versus active argument?</p><p>       TOOBIN:  Correct.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  OK, well, can I ask you this?</p><p>       TOOBIN:  Sure.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Because when it comes to acting on the Supreme Court, we have nine justices.</p><p>       TOOBIN:  Correct.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Four of them are liberal, considered to be, you know, falling in line on the liberal side.  And you can see them on the left, appropriately so on the left-hand side of your screen.  On the right-hand side of your screen, five of them, considered to be mostly in the right-hand corner when voting on issues.</p><p>       But the one who's critical here is Antonin Scalia, as I understand.  That's why I brought up that Necessary and Proper Clause because there's some people watching this, Jeff, who say that the briefs and the direction that Obama and the Justice Department are taking, seem to indicate they're pushing this argument to fall into that clause because that man had voted accordingly before and that might be how they can get their conservative vote.  Is that crazy?</p><p>       TOOBIN:  Well, it's not crazy, because -- I mean, this case, the scope of federal power has been something that the Supreme Court has dealt with for decades.  I mean, this came up a lot during the New Deal.  And then after the New Deal, even conservative justices, as you point out, like Justice Scalia, certainly Justice Kennedy who is usually the swing vote in these cases, have voted to approve broad federal powers.</p><p>       So, the possibility here, and I think it's a legitimate possibility, is that these conservatives might join the liberals in upholding Obamacare because there are different roots to get there in terms of finding constitutional justification.  You could find the Commerce Clause.  You can find the Necessary and Proper Clause, federal taxing power is also broad.</p><p>       And so, I think the odds do favor this law being upheld.  But there are different ways you can do it.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Well, this is pretty thick and chewy stuff and you did a great job.  You ever thought of teaching for a living?</p><p>       TOOBIN:  No.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  You should.  I would take your class.  I would give this up, all this glamour and getting up 1:00 in the morning to take your class.</p><p>       TOOBIN:  Absolutely.  I appreciate it.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Jeff Toobin, lovely to see you.  Thank you.</p><p>       TOOBIN:  See you.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  It's always nice to break it down into English.  You are absolutely right.</p><p>       (CROSSTALK)</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Twenty-four minutes past the hour.</p><p>       Ahead on EARLY START, more kooky weather.  California, a town there is digging out.  A massive, massive mudslide in that area.  I think they're predicting more rain, although they are praying for no rain this morning. </p><p>       And did you hear about Rick Santorum's really bold prediction? He says that he will be the nominee if he wins Illinois tomorrow.</p><p>       You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>       (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  Her killing captivated an entire nation.  And to this day, JonBenet Ramsey's murder remains unsolved.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  And now, her father is talking about the case and his decision to let his daughter participate in beauty pageants. </p><p>       (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>       JOHN RAMSEY, JONBENET RAMSEY'S FATHER:  The point is, you need to protect your children, and not to put them on public display like that.  It would be my choice if I had to do it all over again.</p><p>       (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>       BANFIELD:  More of my interview with John Ramsey, what he has to say about today's toddler and child pageants.  And also, the one thing he's been carrying around with him for 15 years.  You're going to see it.</p><p>       You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>       (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>       BANFIELD:  It is 29 minutes past 5:00 on the East Coast. Welcome back to EARLY START.  I'm Ashleigh Banfield.</p><p>       SAMBOLIN:  And I'm Zoraida Sambolin.  It is time to check the stories making news this morning.</p><p>       BANFIELD:  Two children were among three reportedly killed in a shooting outside a Jewish school in Toulouse, France.  Witnesses say a man on a scooter opened fire a child drop off zone and then took off. CNN is working to confirm the details.  Several other people reportedly injured, as well, by the gunman.  Security has been ordered tightened at Jewish schools throughout France.</p><p>      This incident occurs just days after three soldiers were shot to death by a man on a scooter in the same part of France, but it is not clear at this point if those shootings are connected.</p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>      SAMBOLIN (voice-over):  And tomorrow's Illinois primary shaping up to be a make-or-break battle between Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum. Romney coming off a big win in Puerto Rico could take a big step toward clinching the nomination with a strong showing in Illinois. While Rick Santorum says the nomination will be his if he pulls off an upset tomorrow.</p><p>      BANFIELD (voice-over):  Forget spring break.  Today's a snow day. And that's for kids in Flagstaff, Arizona.  That city has received more than a foot of snow to the late winter storm, and it shut down I- 40 for almost 200 miles.</p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  And look at this messy, muddy weekend in New Castle, California.  Look at there is a minute.  About 30 miles northeast to the Sacramento.  They are still digging out after a massive mudslide. It had one main road blocked for hours, and some folks in the neighborhood are little jittery this morning, because one heavy rain could threaten several home there.      BANFIELD:  North Carolina state pulling off the upset and busting up Brackets, too.  The number 11 seed Wolfpack defeated third seed Georgetown, 66-63.  It happened on Sunday to advance the NCAA tournament's sweet 16.  N.C. State will now play the Kansas Jayhawks on Friday.</p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>      SAMBOLIN (on-camera):  Thirty-one minutes past the hour.</p><p>      The primary in Illinois tomorrow could turn out to be a defining moment in the race for the Republican nomination.  Mitt Romney routed Rick Santorum in Puerto Rico in the primary yesterday.  He got over 80 percent of the vote, and he gets the full 20 delegates.</p><p>      Santorum, however, sounding surprisingly confident, in spite of that.  Hoping for an upset in Illinois, where 54 delegates are at stake, making a bold prediction also, if he pulls it off.</p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      RICK SANTORUM, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  If we're able to come out of Illinois with a huge or surprise win, I guarantee you, I guarantee you, we will win this nomination.</p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  So, Santorum has a long way to go.  The delegate count right now.  Romney is at 518.  Santorum is at 239.  So, let's talk to our political panel about this.  Live from Washington, D.C., we have Joe Williams, White House reporter for Politico.  Nice smile this morning.  Here in New York, we have Democratic strategist, John Hlinko, who is being seated.  There you are.  Good morning to you.</p><p>      Running a little late this morning.  And then, in Chicago, we have Lenny McAllister.  Good morning to you.  Thanks for being with us, gentlemen.  All right.  Joe, I'm going to start with you. Santorum isn't even eligible for ten of those Illinois delegates, right?  He didn't qualify for the ballots in four out of the 18 districts in Illinois.  So, how can he pull off the surprise win that he's talking about?</p><p>      JOE WILLIAMS, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, POLITICO:  Well, I mean, he's managed to surprise and confound people before.  This one looks like a bit more of a long shot.  I ran into a Democratic operative a couple of days ago who said, basically, if Santorum had even a smaller -- small organization -- if he had a better organization even to as minor degree, he'd probably be the frontrunner by now, because he's managed to excite the base.</p><p>      And he's done a lot of that by hand-to-hand, shaking the hands, plus pressing the flesh, retail politics that Mitt Romney is not so good at.  So, it's possible, but his disorganization makes it probably unlikely that he would triumph and collect enough delegates to overcome or at least take a huge bite out of Mitt Romney's lead in Illinois.      SAMBOLIN:  And his lack of organization is what got him into this, right?</p><p>      WILLIAMS:  Pretty much, yes.  That's what got him into the fix, because it's not like nobody knew when these primaries were going to happen or that the schedule hadn't been set up at least a year and a half, two years in advance, to make sure that everybody had enough time and knew what they needed to do to get every last delegate that they qualify for.</p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  All right.  Lenny, I'm going to switch gears over to you.  So, Romney was talking about the math, right?  And this was last week that he was talking about that.  He's talking about delegate math again on Fox News.  Let's listen, and then, we're going to chat about it.</p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      MITT ROMNEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I know a lot of people will talk about delegates and strategies and math, and that's all very interesting to the insiders.  But I think the American people want to see someone who has the leadership, skill, and experience to defeat the president.  I can't tell you exactly how the process is going to work, but I bet (ph) I'm going to become the nominee.  I sure hope I'm going to become the nominee.</p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  So, Lenny, he knows that he has to get the delegates in order to win.  And the polling is showing that it's a very tight race.  What's that play in Illinois?</p><p>      LENNY MCALLISTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR:  What's it play is, once again, being able to excite voters.  And, he's actually pivoting away from talking about that delegate math, because if you remember what it looked like coming out of southern Tuesday last week, he was talking about how it was inevitable that the delegate math would not allow anybody else other than him to win the nomination.</p><p>      Well, that didn't play very well.  Voters don't want to be excited about delegate math.  They want to be excited about leadership.  So, what he's trying to do right now is pivot away from that.  He should still win, obviously, the majority of delegates here should he win Illinois tomorrow, but he also needs to excite people.</p><p>      He needs to finally coalesced a base, get them behind him so that as he moves into Yankee primary when coming into April and some of these other states going to the District of Columbia in April, et cetera, he can have momentum.  He still does not have the momentum of the people to drive him.</p><p>      He's going to need the Tea Party momentum, which is really big here in Illinois and other segments of the conservative base behind them so that by the time he gets to Tampa, he's not trying to forge alliances.  He's trying to invigorate those alliances that he's forming now in the spring to go after President Obama in the fall.      SAMBOLIN:  You know what, I want to ask you one more question, and it's about Santorum, that big loss that he sustained in Puerto Rico because of the English language requirement there.  Is that something that could actually help him in Illinois, do you think? </p><p>      MCALLISTER:  I think it will help him down state.  Now, Rick Santorum stayed consistent with this.  He tried his best to ride the line, be consistent with his message, but be respectful to the cultural uniqueness of Puerto Rico.</p><p>      At the same time, you look at this other side, Mitt Romney, who has a reputation of flip-flopping, said he wanted English to be the official language of the United States at one point in time, goes down to Puerto Rico and completely backs away from that position.  That situation right there will play well for Rick Santorum in regards to consistency and painting Mitt Romney as a flip-flopper.</p><p>      Will it be enough in Illinois?  Maybe, maybe not.  Will it be something that will come up later on in his campaign trail? Absolutely.  </p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  All right.  I'll be curious to see how he does in Southern Illinois, so we'll watch that.  John, I'm going to switch to you, and we're going to talk about gas prices.  Again, we just showed a little while ago that they're actually swinging upwards again. Economists say that the president can't do much to affect prices, right?</p><p>      But tell that to 54 percent of the people who believe in president can do a lot to control gas prices.  Charles Krauthammer is saying this as well.</p><p>       \"Yes, of course, presidents have no direct control over gas prices, but the American people know something about this president and his disdain for oil.  To the American worker who doesn't commute by government motorcade and is getting fleeced every week at the pump, oil seems very much a fuel of the present and of the foreseeable future.\"</p><p>      So, this affects people's wallets, obviously.  What can President Obama do in order to ease this pain at the pump?</p><p>      JOHN HLINKO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, the reality is, there's not a heck of a lot he can do, at least, in the short-term.  I mean, people would like to believe that the president has a magic wand that he can wave, and you know?  I mean -- </p><p>      BANFIELD:  But the perception is there, right?  What can you do to fight that perception?  Fifty-four percent of Americans believe that it is the president's fault.</p><p>      HLINKO:  Well, there is some talk about releasing some oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, which could help fight the perception.  In other words, show kind of action.  Whether or not it makes sense is another question, but that is one thing that could help.  It could, at least, let people know that he's trying to do something.</p><p>      I think the reality is, we buy a lot of oil from some pretty dangerous places, and there's going to be shutoffs and there's going to be tensions in the Middle East that's going to drive up prices. All of the talk of war in Iran, that drives up prices.  Frankly, the mishandled war in Iraq is still hurting us, because Iraq could have been producing more oil and that could have driven down the price.</p><p>      But, you know, trying to explain that in a 30-second, you know, sound byte, it's not easy.  I suspect the president will open up the strategic petroleum reserve or at least some oil and that should help the perception, at least.</p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  All right.  We're going to talk a lot about that later.  Thank you so much, gentlemen.  Joe, Lenny, John, thanks for being with us.  We'll see you again on the six o'clock hour.</p><p>      MCALLISTER:  Thanks, Zoraida.</p><p>      HLINKO:  Thank you.</p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  And CNN's coverage of the Illinois primary begins tomorrow night at 7:00 eastern with Erin Burnett, then it's followed by live coverage of the primary results at 8:00 with Wolf Blitzer, Anderson Cooper, and the CNN political team.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Thirty-eight minutes now past 5:00 on the east coast. Coming up, my one-on-one interview with John Ramsey, JonBenet's father.  Can you believe if she were alive today, she would be 21 years old.  What is it like when John Ramsey comes into contact with some of her friend who are 21?  I'll ask him that question.  You'll find out.</p><p>      Also, did Fidel Castro know that JFK would be assassinated before it happened?  We'll have that story as well.  You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>      BANFIELD:  It was 16 years ago that this image of a six-year-old beauty queen was splashed across every supermarket tabloid in this country.  Her murder, a mystery that no one seems to be able to solve. JonBenet Ramsey's parents would be under an umbrella of suspicion for a decade and a half.</p><p>      It's hard to believe, but today, JonBenet would be 21 years old. And although, her family has been cleared of suspicion, the killer may still be out there.  I had a chance to sit down with JonBenet's dad, Jon Ramsey.  We talked about his brand-new book, \"The Other Side of Suffering,\" about his remarkable journey back from the brink and his new outlook on life.</p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>      JOHN RAMSEY, JONBENET RAMSEY'S FATHER:  I've learned a lot about suffering, about recovery.  I've learned about how your faith is challenged when you suffer tragedy.  And my eyes have also been opened to the fact that everybody carries a burden.  And so, I want to share that.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  When I met you, I didn't expect to meet a happy person, but I really kind of feel like I met a happy person.  Is that true?</p><p>      RAMSEY:  Yes.  I can say that I have joy in my life, which I think is a deeper appreciation of what life's all about, what your purpose is, where you're going to life, what the future holds.  There was a period of time when I was so angry that if I'd knew who he was, we wouldn't need a trial, and I would have no remorse.  But that anger has passed to a point now where I want to know why?  Why did this happen to my child?</p><p>      BANFIELD:  How did you get there? </p><p>      RAMSEY:  Well, it took a long time, and I spent a lot of time thinking about and reading about the whole topic of forgiveness.  And then, I realize that forgiveness, really, is a gift that I give myself.  It's a letting go.  It's moving on.  It has nothing to do with, of course, you're forgiving -- maybe not want to be forgiven, not even know you forgiven, but it's a release.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  What would you want people to know about JonBenet?</p><p>      RAMSEY:  She was so much more than a beauty queen that she's been tagged, and it really hurts when she's tagged that way because that was just a small element of her life.  She was energetic.  She was incredibly smart.  Just an amazing, young child.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  You used to call her Johnny B.</p><p>      RAMSEY:  Yes, Johnny B.  She lit the room up and not everybody -- I remember one day, I came home from work, and I was kind of crying about something.  She said, dad, I don't like that face.  So, I put on a smile.  She said, that's better.  That is just who she was.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Attitude adjustment.</p><p>      RAMSEY:  Yes, total.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Speaking of those, you see these programs on cable, \"Toddlers &amp; Tiaras.\"</p><p>      RAMSEY:  Yes.  it called a little bit of that.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  When you see those programs, what do you think?</p><p>      RAMSEY:  I don't care for them at all.  And that was certainly not the world in a JonBenet and Patsy participated in back then.  That was 15 years ago.  When Patsy and JonBenet did it, there was always a talent component to the program.  And the only people there were grandparents and moms and dads.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Not coaches.      RAMSEY:  No coaches.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Costume designers.</p><p>      RAMSEY:  No.  No.  And, but now that they put it -- made a television show out of it, it's pretty questionable.  That's a good idea.  I don't think it is.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Do you regret that JonBenet was even in a small part of that world?</p><p>      RAMSEY:  Well, in a sense.  You know, we questioned it for a while.  Was that the reason we were targeted?  Was there someone in that audience that looked at her in a different way than they should have?</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Do you think that's -- </p><p>      RAMSEY:  I don't think so.  No, I don't.  But we certainly wondered that.  But I think the point is that you need to protect your children to not put them on public display like that.  It would be my choice if I had to do over again.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  You carry a medal in your wallet?</p><p>      RAMSEY:  Yes.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  To this day?</p><p>      RAMSEY:  Yes.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  What's it for?</p><p>      RAMSEY:  Well, it was a medal that JonBenet won five days before she was killed for a talent contest.  I always to tell her when she'd do these little pageant that, you know, just focus on your talent the best you can.  They didn't matter.  The rest doesn't matter.  It was kind of a thing between us.</p><p>      I went to the events.  I was late, and she already had the contest.  She won this all talent award.  She came running up to me and said, Daddy, I won this for you and put it around my neck.  It was just a little silver dollar medal.  And after she died, in my mind, I want that medal, because we never went back in the house.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Never?</p><p>      RAMSEY:  Never.  But I wanted to get that medal at some time. And I just had that thought in my mind and tell me -- my sister, Pam, went back to the house to get clothes for us and came back after a few hours and came up to me where we were staying and said, John, I just felt this overwhelming need to bring this to you.</p><p>      And it was the medal.  And to me, there's a touch of heaven.  It was reassurance, to me, that JonBenet was OK.  She knew her father needed some help.  I cried, but I cried with tears of joy when I got this.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  You should be a much more bitter person.</p><p>      RAMSEY:  Well, I heard a sermon once that said you can be, after tragedy, bitter, broken, barren or better.  And, the opportunity is to be better.</p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>      BANFIELD:  John happened just mentioned to me that recently, he bumped into an old friend of JonBenet's from back in the day when she was six years old, and that friend is 21 and getting married.  So, I asked him, do you imagine JonBenet at 21?  And he said, absolutely not.  She's frozen in time at the age of six years old.</p><p>      So difficult to go through these details, Zoraida.  He seems like such a good man and such positive man despite -- </p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  I was going to say that.  It comes across, right?  And you always wonder, how do parents survive something like that?  And for him to say that he found his joy again, remarkable.  And I think an inspiration to a lot of people.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Yes.  No, without -- </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      BANFIELD:  And the book is great.  So, I highly recommend.  Take a look.</p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  Thank you.  Thank you for that.</p><p>      And still ahead on EARLY START, it's an ugly scene in Greece. Soccer fans riot.  They actually set the stadium on fire.  Nine police officers were wounded there.  We're going to have all the details. You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  Fifty-one minutes past the hour.  It's time to check the stories making news this morning.

French officials have ordered tightened security at Jewish schools throughout the country.</p><p>      There are 54 key delegates up for grab in tomorrow's Illinois primary.  Mitt Romney coming off of a big win in Puerto Rick nearly halfway to the 1,144 delegates needed, but Rick Santorum insists he'll be the party's nominee if he pulls off the upset tomorrow.</p><p>      Soccer fans set the Olympic stadium in Athens on fire when a riot breaks out at a game.  Fifty people arrested, 20 police officers hurt. The game was obviously canceled early.</p><p>      A new book written by a retired CIA officer claims Fidel Castro may have known ahead of time that John F. Kennedy was going to be assassinated.  Brian Latell, the CIA's former national intelligence former for Latin America, says the Cuban dictator ordered a senior aide to stop his usual surveillance of CIA radio signals, and instead, listen for any details out of Texas.  This was three hours before JFK was killed.</p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>      ROMANS (on-camera):  So, the controversy continues.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Oh, the conspiracy theorists.  I can hear them banging down the door, Christine.</p><p>      (CROSSTALK)</p><p>      BANFIELD:  I can hear them buying books.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Yes, there you go.  Thank you, Christine Romans.</p><p>      It is 52 minutes now past 5:00.

There are reports of at least one tornado.  You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  Welcome back to EARLY START.  Mitt Romney rules in Puerto Rico, and he's hoping for more of the same tomorrow in Illinois.</p><p>      BANFIELD:  And while he's got to fend off attacks from his GOP rivals, he's still a popular target in late-night, too.</p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>      JAY LENO, HOST, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO\":  Mitt Romney is still trying to change his image as an out of touch rich guy.  I don't think it's working.  He (INAUDIBLE) today.  He took the silver spoon out of his mouth and added bronze.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      LENO:  Yes, tone it down a little bit.      JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, \"JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE\":  Romney tweeted a link to a playlist, which is a list of his favorite songs on the music website's spotafly (ph).  The playlist includes the sound from Toby Keith, the Beach Boys, Carrie Underwood, two songs from the Killers, and the song, \"Born Free\" by Kid Rock.  Can you imagine any scenario in which Mitt Romney puts ear buds in and fires up the Kid Rock?</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      KIMMEL:  I can't even imagine him putting ear buds in, to be honest with you.  Mitt Romney doesn't listen to Kid Rock.  In fact, I think we all know what Mitt Romney's favorite song is.</p><p>      UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Who let the dogs out?  Who?  Who?</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      KIMMEL:  I will never get tired of that.</p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Who let the dogs out?</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  All right -- </p><p>      BANFIELD:  Can't catch a break.  </p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  Fifty-six minutes past the hour here.  Still to come on EARLY START, Illinois primary up for grabs here.  Fifty-four delegates are at stake.  Santorum claims the nomination could be his after tomorrow, but what will it take for him to achieve that?</p><p>      BANFIELD:  And you got to see your screen.  If you're brushing your teeth, look at this.  200 miles of an interstate shut down in Arizona.  I did say Arizona.</p><p>      SAMBOLIN:  It's a winter wonderland, but that's in Flagstaff. They're used to that weather, but not this time of year, right?</p><p>      BANFIELD:  Look at this.  More than a foot of snow and even more could be on the way, and we're March?  Arizona?

And welcome to EARLY START. I'm Ashleigh Banfield.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ZORAIDA SAMBOLIN, CNN ANCHOR: And I'm Zoraida Sambolin. We're very happy you're with us. We're bringing you the news from A to Z. It is 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we begin with your top stories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fifty-four delegates at stake tomorrow in the Illinois primary. <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>coming off a rout of <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>in Puerto Rico. But Santorum is insisting the nomination is his, if he pulls off an Illinois upset.</p><p>BANFIELD: Spring nearly sprung. So, what the heck is this? No joke. More than a foot of snow on the ground in Flagstaff, Arizona. More on the way, too. Bizarre. A major late winter storm shutting down the Interstate 40 for nearly 200 miles.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: In Nebraska and Oklahoma, the trouble is tornadoes. Take a look at this. Storm chasers captured this twister on the ground in the town of Willow, Oklahoma. CNN's Reynolds Wolf is tracking all of the severe weather.</p><p>BANFIELD: Dozens of Occupy Wall Street demonstrators arrested in ugly pictures in lower Manhattan. They're trying to reoccupy Zuccotti Park. The accusations are flying this morning that New York City police abused peaceful protesters.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And how sweet it is. The sweet 16 is set after 11th seeded North Carolina State upset third-seeded Georgetown. Up next for N.C. State, Kansas on Friday.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.</p><p>BANFIELD: And we begin with breaking news from France.</p><p>At least three people, including two children, have reportedly been killed in a shooting outside of a Jewish school in Toulouse, France. That's in the southwest part of the country. And several other people were reportedly also injured by this gunman. Security has been ordered tightened at Jewish schools. It's not clear if these shootings could be connected to some other shootings that involved soldiers earlier on.</p><p>CNN's Jim Bittermann is joining us on the phone from Paris.</p><p>So, give us the details on the injured and those who were killed. And exactly who this shooter could be, Jim.</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Well, that's certainly what police are looking at this morning. Basically, Ashleigh, about 10 minutes after 8:00 this morning, local time, as students were gathering at a school called the Ozar Hatorah School in the Jewish area of Toulouse. In fact, a gunman came by on a motor bike and shot into the crowd of about four or five people. Reports are that two students were killed and adults killed and several injured in addition to who were killed.</p><p>Now, what police are looking into what connection there might be to two earlier shooting instances involving soldiers in the Toulouse area. Basically, the M.O., the method of operation looks very similar. A motor bike involved. The gunman comes by and shoots. In one case, shot at one soldier and killed him. In another case, a gunman shot at three soldiers. Two of those soldiers were killed and another severely injured.</p><p>So, police have at least the potential serial killer on the loose in Toulouse. The interior minister of France said that he is going to be headed that direction down to Toulouse this morning to see what reinforcements he can give to the local police, Ashleigh.</p><p>BANFIELD: All right. Jim Bittermann reporting from Paris, about an incident in Toulouse. And the Israeli foreign minister making a comment, being horrified by what transpired in France today. We'll have more on that as it develops.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: It is three minutes past the hour here.</p><p><person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>hoping to take a big step towards clinching the GOP nomination with a victory in Illinois tomorrow. That's after routing <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>in the Puerto Rico victory. He got roughly 83 percent of the vote in Puerto Rico yesterday. Santorum, in the single digits. With 20 delegates for Romney. He is hoping to parlay the win into Latino votes moving forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Those people who don't think that Latinos won't vote for a Republican need to take a look in Puerto Rico and see there that conservative principles and Latino voters go together and that Hispanic voters are going to vote for Republicans if we stand for something, conservative principles that bring growth and good jobs and rising home values. That's how we're going to win. We're going to get Latino voters to help us out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So, let's look at the delegates scoreboard here. Romney with 518. Santorum, 239. Gingrich, 139. Ron Paul there with 69.</p><p>Fifty-four delegates at stake tomorrow in Illinois where polls show Romney with a slight lead.</p><p>CNN political editor Paul Steinhauser live in Washington, D.C. for us.</p><p>Quite a trouncing. Let's start in Puerto Rico and we'll move forward to Illinois.</p><p>PAUL STEINHAUSER, CNN POLITICAL EDITOR: You got it. Here's the (INAUDIBLE) between the Romney and the Santorum campaigns. Remember, <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>was also down in Puerto Rico for two days, Zoraida, on Wednesday and Thursday, and got in little trouble over the Spanish language and the controversy there of whether they should make English the official language if they were to become a state.</p><p>Take a look at this statement from Hogan Gidley, spokesman for the Santorum campaign, last night after the loss in Puerto Rico. It says, \"<person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>has a consistent core. And he showed that when he went to Puerto Rico and took a locally unpopular but principled stance about English being the language of America.</p><p><person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>on the other hand switched another one of his positions to gain favor in Puerto Rico, by saying that Puerto Ricans shouldn't have to lean English if they want to become a state. We all know <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>will do and say anything to get votes. And this is just another example of that.\"</p><p>You can imagine, the Romney campaign definitely doesn't agree with this. And they said that Romney has not flip-flopped at all on this issue. And they disagree very much with the Santorum campaign.</p><p>But just another slice here of the nastiness you can see between the two campaigns, Zoraida.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. So, let's move forward to Illinois now. Santorum says if he wins that, he's got the nomination. Romney says he's ahead.</p><p>What's happening in Illinois?</p><p>STEINHAUSER: Yes. Remember a couple of weeks ago, we said Michigan was a must-win for Romney?</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Right.</p><p>STEINHAUSER: So, well, then the next week, we said it was Ohio. I think this week, you can say, yes, it's Illinois, more of a moderate state, much a different feel than what we saw in Alabama and Mississippi, a state that <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>really needs to win.</p><p>You saw him change his strategy. He was not supposed to be campaigning in Illinois until today. He went there on Friday morning, went back all day yesterday. Usually, Sundays are a slow day for <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>in the campaign trail, spent the whole day there. You can see, Illinois is a crucial state for <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>to win.</p><p>Remember, Louisiana coming up on Saturday. That is a more conservative state that Santorum will win. Keep your eyes on Illinois tomorrow, Zoraida.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Still a lot more ahead.</p><p>STEINHAUSER: Oh, yes.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Paul Steinhauser, live in Washington, thank you very much.</p><p>BANFIELD: Six minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast. Happening this moment, a major late winter storm causing some major headaches in -- yes, Arizona. I'm not kidding. Arizona.</p><p>Look at your screen. In Flagstaff, more than a foot of snow is already on the ground. We could get another foot later on today. The storm is forcing closure of Interstate 40 for nearly 200 miles. That's from Kingman, Arizona, all the way to east Winslow, if you're keeping score.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Some good skiing there. You would love it.</p><p>BANFIELD: Great skiing in Arizona. Yes, and great condos now in New York. Get yourself a winter condo in Connecticut.</p><p>Other parts of the country are seeing some pretty unseasonably warm temperatures, as well.</p><p>And Reynolds Wolf is in the weather center.</p><p>OK, what's the deal?</p><p>REYNOLDS WOLF, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Well, I mean, we really do have a crazy mix, which makes weather awfully interesting. But the snow in parts of Arizona, interesting, but not unusual at all. Many of us have the perception that in Arizona, you basically have Phoenix, you have Tucson. You don't think about the northern half of the state, but that's where you do quite a bit of snow. And that's certainly was the case this weekend.</p><p>In Arizona, the snow volume, you had 26 inches of snow. Well over a foot in Ft. Valley, Flagstaff and even in Bellemont. Big Bear City in California got about 20 inches of snowfall. In some places, even a little more, and certainly great for all of the skiers up in Big Bear.</p><p>What we're going to be seeing today is a little bit of a difference in parts of the Central and Southern Plains. Look for a chance of severe storms. Already severe storms watches in parts of Oklahoma and back in the northern Texas. Across parts of, well, Great Lakes and down into parts of, say, the Appalachians, we're seeing some rain in Pittsburgh.</p><p>But the big chance of severe weather is going to take place right here in the Southern Plains as that frontal boundary sweeps its way to the east, interacts to that Gulf moisture, strong storm possible in parts of Texas and into Louisiana, as we fast forward from today into Tuesday.</p><p>Now, one big issue there we're going to have is also the heavy rainfall we might see in parts of Texas. In fact, some places at six inches of rain falling at a very rapid rate. It means we certainly have a good chance of seeing some flooding in a few spots. Some places could see up to a foot just over the next 24 hours or so. So, certainly, a huge concern for a lot of people.</p><p>The other thing you were talking about is the big change of temperatures. Out in the west, it has been the cold. But in the east, a huge ridge of high pressure, means 85 degrees your high in Memphis, up by Beale Street. In Chicago, they're still recovering over St. Patrick's Day, 79 degrees. Even in New York, where we sent it back to you guys, 72, the expected high.</p><p>BANFIELD: Seventy-two. What month is this, Reynolds? What month are we in?</p><p>WOLF: Hard to believe, but we're in March. I know.</p><p>BANFIELD: All right. Thank you for that, Reynolds Wolf.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: We're loving it, right?</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes. Well, I hate to say no complaints. I actually do have complaints. I think it's supposed to be cold when it's supposed to be cold. When it's supposed to be hot --</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Send her the e-mails.</p><p>BANFIELD: It is nine minutes now past 5:00. And this just in -- are you ready?</p><p>We bring you this live, folks. The national price for gas rising for a tenth day in the row now, standing at $3.84 a gallon. That's according to AAA.</p><p>Gas is already selling at least 4 bucks a gallon on average in seven states. And if you're one of them, I'm sorry. Alaska, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, New York and Washington -- feel your pain. That's the level analysts say that people start changing some of their spending habits, as well.</p><p>And the steep rise in gas prices has become a weapon for Republicans to use against the president. But are there promises? Or just politics? Coming up at 6:15 Eastern, we're going to talk to Jim Burkhart, managing director of the Global Oil Group, and get answers there.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: I hope so.</p><p>Our Christine Romans is watching the markets for us this morning.</p><p>They closed mixed on Friday. The Dow and the NASDAQ both closing lower, but not by much. And the S&amp;P 500, which is nearing a four-year high, closed up by 0.01 percent. That's good news for your money. The S&amp;P 500 is the best indicator for what is in your 401(k).</p><p>The stock futures are down ahead of the opening bell this morning.</p><p>BANFIELD: Normally, I'm listening to all those details and processing them. But I can't think of anything other than Apple.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Apple. I know. 9:00, the company is having a conference call. And everybody wants to know what Apple is going to do with its huge cash horde. Did you know that Apple has $98 billion in cash sitting in the bank? Just the last --</p><p>BANFIELD: Say that again.</p><p>ROMANS: Ninety-eight billion dollars. It is literally more money than God.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROMANS: Apple Computer designed something in Cupertino, California, builds it through subcontractors in China, ships it all over the world. And they're making things that we never knew we needed but now we can't live without. And Apple revenue is up, you know, 40 percent, 50 percent every year.</p><p>Look at the stocks. You can see the shares of Apple Computer, just this year --</p><p>BANFIELD: Lord.</p><p>ROMANS: -- are up almost 45 percent. We crossed $500 a share about a month ago, and then, crossed $600 a share four weeks later.</p><p>Sitting on all this cash, in just the first fiscal quarter of the annual year, it made $16 billion, in cash. That's money that goes right into the bank. A lot of analysts are saying they think this company is going to give a dividend, meaning that shareholders of the company will get a little money back, maybe 2 percent, maybe 2.5 percent.</p><p>A lot of big tech companies give money back to their investors, to their shareholders. And that's what folks are hoping will happen here. And they think it's going to make Apple even more valuable because then you have all of these big mutual funds and all these big value investors and investors who want to get a little bit of a return back for holding their Apple shares, instead of the stock going up and up.</p><p>So --</p><p>SAMBOLIN: I wonder where the top is, though, right?</p><p>ROMANS: That's such a good question. There's two kind of adages on Wall Street. One is the trend is your friend. And the trend in Apple is up. I mean, anybody who's been, you know, selling Apple all the way up is just pulling their hair out, right?</p><p>The other adage is, trees don't grow to the sky, meaning they can't go up forever. So, Apple has -- is Apple worth it? Does it continue to be worth $300, $400, $500 a share?</p><p>It is if it can continue to invent things we didn't know we needed, if they can penetrate the entire world with their products. If their costumers -- their competitors don't find a way to start to eat into some of their momentum. The momentum is there for Apple right now.</p><p>But the news today: will there be a dividend? We'll find out at 9:00.</p><p>BANFIELD: That's fascinating. Christine Romans, thank you so much.</p><p>ROMANS: You're welcome.</p><p>BANFIELD: Twelve minutes now past 5:00 on the East Coast. And we are giving you an early read on some stories you should watch for later on today.</p><p>Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians, he's expected to meet face-to-face for the first time with his attorney today in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. It's going to be the first time he gets a chance to talk with this prominent Seattle lawyer, John Henry Browne, who's made all sorts of media appearances, but hasn't talked to the client in person.</p><p>Formal charges against Sergeant Bales could be filed this week.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: The owners of the New York Mets head to court today. A jury will decide if they looked the other way while reaping millions from Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The stakes are enormous for Madoff victims and the team, with over $300 million on the line.</p><p>BANFIELD: And Catherine, and the duchess of Cambridge -- that was ridiculous. I don't know why I said with that thrill in my voice. She's delivering her first public speech later this morning. It's going to happen in just over two hours during her event at a new children's hospital facility.

The court is split between four liberal justices and five conservatives. And the White House is weighing its options on how to get that crucial fifth vote of approval.</p><p>Jeffrey Toobin is CNN's senior legal analyst. He's also the dude who knows everything about the Nine. You wrote the book called \"The Nine.\"</p><p>Hi, Jeff.</p><p>JEFF TOOBIN, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>BANFIELD: Good to see you.</p><p>Hey, listen. So, look, we've got a couple of minutes and I don't know how man years you studied constitutional law. So, this is going to be a bit of a sticky wicket to get through this. But essentially, what I'm gathering on this is that the Supreme Court has to decide over the challenges to Obamacare. And it has to do with some clauses that are critical in the Constitution.</p><p>TOOBIN: Just one clause. Just one clause is all that matters.</p><p>BANFIELD: OK. Which one is it, the Commerce Clause?</p><p>TOOBIN: The Commerce Clause.</p><p>BANFIELD: Or that other really strange --</p><p>TOOBIN: Don't worry about the other. It's the Commerce Clause.</p><p>BANFIELD: There's called a Necessary and Proper Clause.</p><p>TOOBIN: Necessary and Proper is not really the main part of this case. It's really about the Commerce Clause.</p><p>BANFIELD: So, what's it about?</p><p>TOOBIN: OK. Congress has to act under its authority in the Constitution. Something in the Constitution has to say Congress has the right to pass any law that it passes. And the authority that it uses in most of the laws that it passes relating to the economy is the Commerce Clause. In Article I, the Constitution says, Congress has the right to regulate commerce among the several states.</p><p>What does that mean? What is -- what is the commerce power? Traditionally, that has been a very broad brand of power, particularly when it comes to health care in the economy. Think about -- we have Medicare. We have Medicaid.</p><p>The United States government has been deeply involved in regulating health care for decades. The question in this case is the individual mandate, which is the part of Obamacare which says everyone has to have insurance.</p><p>BANFIELD: No matter what.</p><p>TOOBIN: No matter what.</p><p>BANFIELD: You have to buy it.</p><p>TOOBIN: Correct. And the question is that constitutional under Congress' power in the Commerce Clause.</p><p>I think, I wrote an article in \"New Yorker\" this week, that the answer is clearly yes, because the national market for health insurance is unusual because everybody is part of that economy -- that market, no matter what, because if you buy health insurance, that's how you pay for health care. But if you don't buy health insurance, you're still going to be treated by a hospital if you fall in the street and get hurt. Everybody is going to pay for your health care even if you don't get health insurance.</p><p>BANFIELD: So, this is the inactive versus active argument?</p><p>TOOBIN: Correct.</p><p>BANFIELD: OK, well, can I ask you this?</p><p>TOOBIN: Sure.</p><p>BANFIELD: Because when it comes to acting on the Supreme Court, we have nine justices.</p><p>TOOBIN: Correct.</p><p>BANFIELD: Four of them are liberal, considered to be, you know, falling in line on the liberal side. And you can see them on the left, appropriately so on the left-hand side of your screen. On the right-hand side of your screen, five of them, considered to be mostly in the right-hand corner when voting on issues.</p><p>But the one who's critical here is Antonin Scalia, as I understand. That's why I brought up that Necessary and Proper Clause because there's some people watching this, Jeff, who say that the briefs and the direction that Obama and the Justice Department are taking, seem to indicate they're pushing this argument to fall into that clause because that man had voted accordingly before and that might be how they can get their conservative vote. Is that crazy?</p><p>TOOBIN: Well, it's not crazy, because -- I mean, this case, the scope of federal power has been something that the Supreme Court has dealt with for decades. I mean, this came up a lot during the New Deal. And then after the New Deal, even conservative justices, as you point out, like Justice Scalia, certainly Justice Kennedy who is usually the swing vote in these cases, have voted to approve broad federal powers.</p><p>So, the possibility here, and I think it's a legitimate possibility, is that these conservatives might join the liberals in upholding Obamacare because there are different roots to get there in terms of finding constitutional justification. You could find the Commerce Clause. You can find the Necessary and Proper Clause, federal taxing power is also broad.</p><p>And so, I think the odds do favor this law being upheld. But there are different ways you can do it.</p><p>BANFIELD: Well, this is pretty thick and chewy stuff and you did a great job. You ever thought of teaching for a living?</p><p>TOOBIN: No.</p><p>BANFIELD: You should. I would take your class. I would give this up, all this glamour and getting up 1:00 in the morning to take your class.</p><p>TOOBIN: Absolutely. I appreciate it.</p><p>BANFIELD: Jeff Toobin, lovely to see you. Thank you.</p><p>TOOBIN: See you.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: It's always nice to break it down into English. You are absolutely right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Twenty-four minutes past the hour.</p><p>Ahead on EARLY START, more kooky weather. California, a town there is digging out.

Security has been ordered tightened at Jewish schools throughout France.</p><p>This incident occurs just days after three soldiers were shot to death by a man on a scooter in the same part of France, but it is not clear at this point if those shootings are connected.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMBOLIN (voice-over): And tomorrow's Illinois primary shaping up to be a make-or-break battle between <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Rick Santorum. </nameText></person>Romney coming off a big win in Puerto Rico could take a big step toward clinching the nomination with a strong showing in Illinois. While <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>says the nomination will be his if he pulls off an upset tomorrow.</p><p>BANFIELD (voice-over): Forget spring break. Today's a snow day. And that's for kids in Flagstaff, Arizona. That city has received more than a foot of snow to the late winter storm, and it shut down I- 40 for almost 200 miles.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And look at this messy, muddy weekend in New Castle, California. Look at there is a minute. About 30 miles northeast to the Sacramento. They are still digging out after a massive mudslide. It had one main road blocked for hours, and some folks in the neighborhood are little jittery this morning, because one heavy rain could threaten several home there.

He got over 80 percent of the vote, and he gets the full 20 delegates.</p><p>Santorum, however, sounding surprisingly confident, in spite of that. Hoping for an upset in Illinois, where 54 delegates are at stake, making a bold prediction also, if he pulls it off.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>RICK SANTORUM, </nameText></person>(R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If we're able to come out of Illinois with a huge or surprise win, I guarantee you, I guarantee you, we will win this nomination.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So, Santorum has a long way to go. The delegate count right now. Romney is at 518. Santorum is at 239. So, let's talk to our political panel about this. Live from Washington, D.C., we have Joe Williams, White House reporter for Politico. Nice smile this morning. Here in New York, we have Democratic strategist, John Hlinko, who is being seated. There you are. Good morning to you.</p><p>Running a little late this morning. And then, in Chicago, we have Lenny McAllister. Good morning to you. Thanks for being with us, gentlemen. All right. Joe, I'm going to start with you. Santorum isn't even eligible for ten of those Illinois delegates, right? He didn't qualify for the ballots in four out of the 18 districts in Illinois. So, how can he pull off the surprise win that he's talking about?</p><p>JOE WILLIAMS, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, POLITICO: Well, I mean, he's managed to surprise and confound people before. This one looks like a bit more of a long shot. I ran into a Democratic operative a couple of days ago who said, basically, if Santorum had even a smaller -- small organization -- if he had a better organization even to as minor degree, he'd probably be the frontrunner by now, because he's managed to excite the base.</p><p>And he's done a lot of that by hand-to-hand, shaking the hands, plus pressing the flesh, retail politics that <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>is not so good at. So, it's possible, but his disorganization makes it probably unlikely that he would triumph and collect enough delegates to overcome or at least take a huge bite out of <person><nameText>Mitt Romney's </nameText></person>lead in Illinois. SAMBOLIN: And his lack of organization is what got him into this, right?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Pretty much, yes. That's what got him into the fix, because it's not like nobody knew when these primaries were going to happen or that the schedule hadn't been set up at least a year and a half, two years in advance, to make sure that everybody had enough time and knew what they needed to do to get every last delegate that they qualify for.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. Lenny, I'm going to switch gears over to you. So, Romney was talking about the math, right? And this was last week that he was talking about that. He's talking about delegate math again on Fox News. Let's listen, and then, we're going to chat about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MITT ROMNEY, </nameText></person>(R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I know a lot of people will talk about delegates and strategies and math, and that's all very interesting to the insiders. But I think the American people want to see someone who has the leadership, skill, and experience to defeat the president. I can't tell you exactly how the process is going to work, but I bet (ph) I'm going to become the nominee. I sure hope I'm going to become the nominee.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAMBOLIN: So, Lenny, he knows that he has to get the delegates in order to win. And the polling is showing that it's a very tight race. What's that play in Illinois?</p><p>LENNY MCALLISTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: What's it play is, once again, being able to excite voters. And, he's actually pivoting away from talking about that delegate math, because if you remember what it looked like coming out of southern Tuesday last week, he was talking about how it was inevitable that the delegate math would not allow anybody else other than him to win the nomination.</p><p>Well, that didn't play very well. Voters don't want to be excited about delegate math. They want to be excited about leadership. So, what he's trying to do right now is pivot away from that. He should still win, obviously, the majority of delegates here should he win Illinois tomorrow, but he also needs to excite people.</p><p>He needs to finally coalesced a base, get them behind him so that as he moves into Yankee primary when coming into April and some of these other states going to the District of Columbia in April, et cetera, he can have momentum. He still does not have the momentum of the people to drive him.</p><p>He's going to need the Tea Party momentum, which is really big here in Illinois and other segments of the conservative base behind them so that by the time he gets to Tampa, he's not trying to forge alliances. He's trying to invigorate those alliances that he's forming now in the spring to go after President Obama in the fall. SAMBOLIN: You know what, I want to ask you one more question, and it's about Santorum, that big loss that he sustained in Puerto Rico because of the English language requirement there. Is that something that could actually help him in Illinois, do you think?</p><p>MCALLISTER: I think it will help him down state. Now, <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>stayed consistent with this. He tried his best to ride the line, be consistent with his message, but be respectful to the cultural uniqueness of Puerto Rico.</p><p>At the same time, you look at this other side, <person><nameText>Mitt Romney, </nameText></person>who has a reputation of flip-flopping, said he wanted English to be the official language of the United States at one point in time, goes down to Puerto Rico and completely backs away from that position. That situation right there will play well for <person><nameText>Rick Santorum </nameText></person>in regards to consistency and painting <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>as a flip-flopper.</p><p>Will it be enough in Illinois? Maybe, maybe not. Will it be something that will come up later on in his campaign trail? Absolutely.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. I'll be curious to see how he does in Southern Illinois, so we'll watch that. John, I'm going to switch to you, and we're going to talk about gas prices. Again, we just showed a little while ago that they're actually swinging upwards again. Economists say that the president can't do much to affect prices, right?</p><p>But tell that to 54 percent of the people who believe in president can do a lot to control gas prices. Charles Krauthammer is saying this as well.</p><p>\"Yes, of course, presidents have no direct control over gas prices, but the American people know something about this president and his disdain for oil. To the American worker who doesn't commute by government motorcade and is getting fleeced every week at the pump, oil seems very much a fuel of the present and of the foreseeable future.\"</p><p>So, this affects people's wallets, obviously. What can President Obama do in order to ease this pain at the pump?</p><p>JOHN HLINKO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, the reality is, there's not a heck of a lot he can do, at least, in the short-term. I mean, people would like to believe that the president has a magic wand that he can wave, and you know? I mean --</p><p>BANFIELD: But the perception is there, right? What can you do to fight that perception? Fifty-four percent of Americans believe that it is the president's fault.</p><p>HLINKO: Well, there is some talk about releasing some oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, which could help fight the perception. In other words, show kind of action. Whether or not it makes sense is another question, but that is one thing that could help. It could, at least, let people know that he's trying to do something.</p><p>I think the reality is, we buy a lot of oil from some pretty dangerous places, and there's going to be shutoffs and there's going to be tensions in the Middle East that's going to drive up prices. All of the talk of war in Iran, that drives up prices. Frankly, the mishandled war in Iraq is still hurting us, because Iraq could have been producing more oil and that could have driven down the price.</p><p>But, you know, trying to explain that in a 30-second, you know, sound byte, it's not easy. I suspect the president will open up the strategic petroleum reserve or at least some oil and that should help the perception, at least.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: All right. We're going to talk a lot about that later. Thank you so much, gentlemen. Joe, Lenny, John, thanks for being with us. We'll see you again on the six o'clock hour.</p><p>MCALLISTER: Thanks, Zoraida.</p><p>HLINKO: Thank you.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: And CNN's coverage of the Illinois primary begins tomorrow night at 7:00 eastern with Erin Burnett, then it's followed by live coverage of the primary results at 8:00 with Wolf Blitzer, Anderson Cooper, and the CNN political team.</p><p>BANFIELD: Thirty-eight minutes now past 5:00 on the east coast. Coming up, my one-on-one interview with John Ramsey, JonBenet's father. Can you believe if she were alive today, she would be 21 years old. What is it like when John Ramsey comes into contact with some of her friend who are 21? I'll ask him that question. You'll find out.</p><p>Also, did <person><nameText>Fidel Castro </nameText></person>know that <person><nameText>JFK </nameText></person>would be assassinated before it happened? We'll have that story as well. You're watching EARLY START.</p><p>BANFIELD: It was 16 years ago that this image of a six-year-old beauty queen was splashed across every supermarket tabloid in this country. Her murder, a mystery that no one seems to be able to solve. JonBenet Ramsey's parents would be under an umbrella of suspicion for a decade and a half.</p><p>It's hard to believe, but today, JonBenet would be 21 years old. And although, her family has been cleared of suspicion, the killer may still be out there. I had a chance to sit down with JonBenet's dad, Jon Ramsey. We talked about his brand-new book, \"The Other Side of Suffering,\" about his remarkable journey back from the brink and his new outlook on life.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN RAMSEY, JONBENET RAMSEY'S FATHER: I've learned a lot about suffering, about recovery. I've learned about how your faith is challenged when you suffer tragedy. And my eyes have also been opened to the fact that everybody carries a burden. And so, I want to share that.</p><p>BANFIELD: When I met you, I didn't expect to meet a happy person, but I really kind of feel like I met a happy person. Is that true?</p><p>RAMSEY: Yes. I can say that I have joy in my life, which I think is a deeper appreciation of what life's all about, what your purpose is, where you're going to life, what the future holds. There was a period of time when I was so angry that if I'd knew who he was, we wouldn't need a trial, and I would have no remorse. But that anger has passed to a point now where I want to know why? Why did this happen to my child?</p><p>BANFIELD: How did you get there?</p><p>RAMSEY: Well, it took a long time, and I spent a lot of time thinking about and reading about the whole topic of forgiveness. And then, I realize that forgiveness, really, is a gift that I give myself. It's a letting go. It's moving on. It has nothing to do with, of course, you're forgiving -- maybe not want to be forgiven, not even know you forgiven, but it's a release.</p><p>BANFIELD: What would you want people to know about JonBenet?</p><p>RAMSEY: She was so much more than a beauty queen that she's been tagged, and it really hurts when she's tagged that way because that was just a small element of her life. She was energetic. She was incredibly smart. Just an amazing, young child.</p><p>BANFIELD: You used to call her Johnny B.</p><p>RAMSEY: Yes, Johnny B. She lit the room up and not everybody -- I remember one day, I came home from work, and I was kind of crying about something. She said, dad, I don't like that face. So, I put on a smile. She said, that's better. That is just who she was.</p><p>BANFIELD: Attitude adjustment.</p><p>RAMSEY: Yes, total.</p><p>BANFIELD: Speaking of those, you see these programs on cable, \"Toddlers &amp; Tiaras.\"</p><p>RAMSEY: Yes. it called a little bit of that.</p><p>BANFIELD: When you see those programs, what do you think?</p><p>RAMSEY: I don't care for them at all. And that was certainly not the world in a JonBenet and Patsy participated in back then. That was 15 years ago. When Patsy and JonBenet did it, there was always a talent component to the program. And the only people there were grandparents and moms and dads.</p><p>BANFIELD: Not coaches. RAMSEY: No coaches.</p><p>BANFIELD: Costume designers.</p><p>RAMSEY: No. No. And, but now that they put it -- made a television show out of it, it's pretty questionable. That's a good idea. I don't think it is.</p><p>BANFIELD: Do you regret that JonBenet was even in a small part of that world?</p><p>RAMSEY: Well, in a sense. You know, we questioned it for a while. Was that the reason we were targeted? Was there someone in that audience that looked at her in a different way than they should have?</p><p>BANFIELD: Do you think that's --</p><p>RAMSEY: I don't think so. No, I don't. But we certainly wondered that. But I think the point is that you need to protect your children to not put them on public display like that. It would be my choice if I had to do over again.</p><p>BANFIELD: You carry a medal in your wallet?</p><p>RAMSEY: Yes.</p><p>BANFIELD: To this day?</p><p>RAMSEY: Yes.</p><p>BANFIELD: What's it for?</p><p>RAMSEY: Well, it was a medal that JonBenet won five days before she was killed for a talent contest. I always to tell her when she'd do these little pageant that, you know, just focus on your talent the best you can. They didn't matter. The rest doesn't matter. It was kind of a thing between us.</p><p>I went to the events. I was late, and she already had the contest. She won this all talent award. She came running up to me and said, Daddy, I won this for you and put it around my neck. It was just a little silver dollar medal. And after she died, in my mind, I want that medal, because we never went back in the house.</p><p>BANFIELD: Never?</p><p>RAMSEY: Never. But I wanted to get that medal at some time. And I just had that thought in my mind and tell me -- my sister, Pam, went back to the house to get clothes for us and came back after a few hours and came up to me where we were staying and said, John, I just felt this overwhelming need to bring this to you.</p><p>And it was the medal. And to me, there's a touch of heaven. It was reassurance, to me, that JonBenet was OK. She knew her father needed some help. I cried, but I cried with tears of joy when I got this.</p><p>BANFIELD: You should be a much more bitter person.</p><p>RAMSEY: Well, I heard a sermon once that said you can be, after tragedy, bitter, broken, barren or better. And, the opportunity is to be better.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BANFIELD: John happened just mentioned to me that recently, he bumped into an old friend of JonBenet's from back in the day when she was six years old, and that friend is 21 and getting married. So, I asked him, do you imagine JonBenet at 21? And he said, absolutely not. She's frozen in time at the age of six years old.</p><p>So difficult to go through these details, Zoraida. He seems like such a good man and such positive man despite --</p><p>SAMBOLIN: I was going to say that. It comes across, right? And you always wonder, how do parents survive something like that? And for him to say that he found his joy again, remarkable. And I think an inspiration to a lot of people.</p><p>BANFIELD: Yes. No, without --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BANFIELD: And the book is great. So, I highly recommend. Take a look.</p><p>SAMBOLIN: Thank you. Thank you for that.</p><p>And still ahead on EARLY START, it's an ugly scene in Greece. Soccer fans riot.
