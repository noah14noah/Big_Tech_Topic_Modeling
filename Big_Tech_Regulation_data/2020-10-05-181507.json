Their results will hit a day after CEOs from the four companies testify in front of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. \"The No. 1 company for us, because we think they're such a bellwether, is Apple,\" said John Traynor, chief investment officer of People's United Advisors.  politics   Thursday will be a day like none other for tech investors. Four of the five most valuable U.S. companies Apple , Amazon , Alphabet and Facebook are set to report quarterly results after the closing bell.   Those companies, worth almost $5 trillion in combined market cap , have led the stock market to record levels this month even amid a coronavirus pandemic and growing economic crisis. They're trading at historically high multiples relative to expected earnings. And they're releasing financials a day after their CEOs testify to Congress about the power their companies possess and whether they should be subject to antitrust laws.   The earnings reports will amount to a giant data dump on everything from the state of online advertising and growth of one-day shipping to demand for cloud-computing services from companies adjusting to remote work.   But for John Traynor , chief investment officer of People's United Advisors, the most important detail will come from the largest company by market cap.    \"The No. 1 company for us, because we think they're such a bellwether, is Apple,\" said Traynor, whose firm oversees about $9 billion in investment assets.   \"We expect to see, historically speaking, a lighter quarter, but they'll hopefully give us some indication of what the fourth quarter will look like. Apple gives us such great insight into the the economy and tech spending.\"   Apple's dominance in the smartphone market and its central role in delivering digital content makes the company a proxy for consumer strength and confidence in the broader economy. The company wrapped up its fiscal third quarter at the end of June, and analysts expect a 3.1% decline in revenue from a year earlier, followed by a 3.9% year-over-year drop in its fiscal fourth quarter, according to a Refinitiv. They expect growth to pick back up in the quarter that starts in October.   While Apple still counts heavily on iPhone sales, the company's focus on services like apps, digital music and iCloud is paying off, particularly with people consuming more content from home. Analysts expect revenue growth in its services segment of 15% to $13.1 billion for the third quarter, and 13% to $14.2 billion in the fourth, according to FactSet.  The best of the rest  Tech stocks have pulled back a bit heading into this week's major earnings reports. Since closing at a record on July 20, the Nasdaq has fallen 3.4%, sparked by weaker-than-expected forecasts last week from Microsoft and Intel .   Struggles are anticipated at Google and Facebook, with advertisers in travel, hospitality and retail pulling back on spending. Alphabet is expected to report a drop in revenue for the second quarter and a slight increase in the third quarter, while Facebook's revenue growth in the second quarter is expected to sink into the single digits for the first time since the company's IPO in 2012 and remain there in the third quarter.   Facebook could also lose about $100 million in third-quarter revenue from ad boycotts tied to the \"Stop Hate for Profit\" campaign , according to Wedbush Securities. But Wedbush's Michael Pachter still recommends buying Facebook shares, in part because the company has untapped money-making opportunities from Instagram and WhatsApp.   \"Notwithstanding well-publicized boycotts of Facebook's platform by many major brands beginning in early July, Facebook has consistently executed on its core business model and we expect the company to capture market share in a declining advertising spend environment, given its scale and robust suite of targeting and measurement tools to help advertisers manage costs and maximize budget efficiency,\" Pachter said in a report on Monday.   Amazon has been the best-performing stock among the mega-cap tech companies this year, up 63%. That's despite CEO Jeff Bezos'  suggestion at the end of April that, \"If you're a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat.\"   Bezos said at the time that the company would invest its expected $4 billion second-quarter profit in coronavirus-related efforts, including buying personal protective equipment for workers and building its own testing capability. But Bezos' warning couldn't turn investors off of Amazon's perpetual expansion, which has continued thanks to surging demand for delivery of groceries and household products, combined with growth in Amazon's cloud infrastructure and streaming content units.  Underestimating regulatory risk?  Bezos and his Big Tech CEO counterparts have more to contend with this week than just updating investors. On Wednesday  a day before addressing investors Bezos will make his first appearance before Congress , joining the leaders of Apple, Facebook and Alphabet in trying to convince lawmakers that competition remains plentiful.    In his opening statement to the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, Bezos will remind representatives that Amazon accounts for less than 1% of the $25 trillion global retail market and will name Target, Costco and Walmart as competitors, according to prepared remarks. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg  will defend the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp and will reference his company's contributions to the open-source community.    Apple CEO  plans to tell lawmakers that his company is in fierce competition with Samsung, LG, Huawei, and Google for the smartphone market and \"does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business.\"    The House Judiciary Committee announced its investigation into tech giants in June 2019, a month before the Justice Department  said it was opening a broad antitrust review of Big Tech companies. Then came attorneys general from numerous U.S. states.   David Heinemeier Hansson , a tech entrepreneur and creator of the programming language Ruby on Rails, said investors don't seem to be taking the risks from these investigations seriously. He added that they don't only have domestic concerns. The European Union is investigating Apple's App Store rules and its payment platform, and the EU last year opened a probe into Google's and Facebook's use of data.   \"We've never had as many concurrent lines of inquiry and action ongoing at the same time,\" said Hansson, who testified in front of the House antitrust subcommittee in January, arguing that the top tech companies have made it virtually impossible for smaller challengers to compete. \"If you look at the run-up this year, and how frothily priced these companies are already, if you do anything to undercut those growth assumptions, things come tumbling down very quickly after that.\"   WATCH:  Hey founder on Apple's app approval process following fee backlash</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42711926625</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-GFW1-F07F-82G6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1225\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0005933</classCode><className>PEOPLE'S UNITED CAPITAL FINANCIAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

With\u00a0such concerns now being widely discussed in the United States and other countries,\u00a0including India, Europe's skeptical stance toward Big Tech suddenly appears not to be that old-school anymore.</p><p>In Europe,\u00a0recent revelations about data misuse mostly resulted in calls to speed up work on privacy regulations that was already underway.</p><p>In the United States, however, they may lead to much tougher questions:\u00a0Would American Facebook users become de facto second-class members when it comes to privacy issues, if U.S. lawmakers continue to avoid regulations as foreign governments push ahead?</p><p>As Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0will continue\u00a0to address\u00a0U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday,\u00a0his best bet might\u00a0essentially consist of promising American users the sort of protection the company had to grant its European users. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and other Facebook officials have indicated that this\u00a0is at least part of\u00a0their strategy in recent weeks and during his hearing on Tuesday.</p><p>\"You think the Europeans had it right?\" Sen. Lindsey\u00a0O.\u00a0Graham (R-S.C.) asked during the session, referring to E.U.-style regulations of U.S. tech companies.</p><p>\"I think that they get things right,\"\u00a0Zuckerberg responded, echoing previous company statements.</p><p>\"Europe was ahead on this,\" Facebook's <person><nameText>chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, </nameText></person>acknowledged in a recent interview with\u00a0the London-based Financial Times. Zuckerberg\u00a0later promised to apply E.U. standards worldwide, even if some regional differences\u00a0would probably persist.       </p><p>The Facebook chief executive\u00a0may seek to use his appearances at the\u00a0Capitol Hill hearings\u00a0to further portray\u00a0those promised changes\u00a0as a willingness to self-regulate. But the timeline of events leading up to his promise to adapt to coming European rules\u00a0and to make further changes points to a different conclusion. In Europe, Facebook acted\u00a0only when governmental pressure\u00a0became too risky to ignore\u00a0-\u00a0after\u00a0a\u00a0political and legal struggle that dragged on for years. As Facebook faces mounting pressure in the United States, too, it's worth keeping in mind that its privacy compromises didn't come out of nowhere, privacy advocates here caution.</p><p>The key question is whether <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>promises to implement European standards worldwide are genuine or a strategy to\u00a0persuade U.S. lawmakers to leave the company alone.</p><p>That is why Tuesday's appearance\u00a0was also about a cultural\u00a0difference that has widened in recent years: Should the United States stick to its belief in\u00a0the industry's self-regulation, even as scandals mount? Or should it copy Europe's approach, which has had more impact, even\u00a0though critics warn of governmental overreach?</p><p>Introduced as the\u00a0General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\u00a0and set to take effect next month, the\u00a0landmark European law will force all companies operating here to tell their online European\u00a0users which data they have stored on them and provide them with an option to delete that information. Companies need to explicitly ask their users for consent whenever they seek to deviate from certain standards, rather than forcing them to opt out in case they realize what they have signed up for, as is often the case. Violations can result in\u00a0significant\u00a0fines.</p><p>The right to privacy is costly,\u00a0however. The global law firm Paul Hastings has estimated that any Fortune 500 company dealing with E.U. customers will spend an average of\u00a0$1 million\u00a0on adjusting tech systems. (The law doesn't target only social networks\u00a0such as Facebook but also just about any company that has a website.) Critics have also blasted\u00a0the legislation\u00a0as too protectionist, too vague or too broad.       </p><p>Some even fear the end of the open Internet's business model. \"GDPR, and calls for similar regulation in the U.S., may lead to the end of what has long been the internet's grand bargain: the exchange of free or subsidized content for personalized advertising,\"\u00a0wrote\u00a0Larry Downes of the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy.</p><p>European social media skeptics, however, are celebrating the law as almost revolutionary, especially as companies such as Facebook that\u00a0long escaped E.U. scrutiny promised to adapt to the new rules. The Economist magazine, Britain's leading free-market voice, similarly praised the law, writing that \"the case for copying the best bits of the European Union's approach is compelling.\"</p><p>Still, the\u00a0European changes might have passed virtually unnoticed\u00a0in the United States had\u00a0they not coincided with revelations about the data-harvesting company Cambridge Analytica's collection of Facebook users' personal data for political ends.</p><p>          Facebook\u00a0said last week that Cambridge Analytica\u00a0may have obtained\u00a0information on far more users\u00a0- with about 20 percent of them estimated to be living outside the United States. In a separate revelation, Facebook also had to acknowledge\u00a0last week that\u00a0\"malicious actors\" discovered the\u00a0identities and collected data on most of its 2 billion global users. The mechanisms used by Cambridge Analytica and the \"malicious actors\" cited by Facebook appear to have been legal and do not constitute a data hack but, rather, a deliberate exploitation of\u00a0information through tools or loopholes that Facebook provided in the past.</p><p>Zuckerberg\u00a0appeared to be prepared for\u00a0some uncomfortable questions during his hearing on Tuesday. In a conference call with journalists last week, he already applauded the European efforts,\u00a0calling them \"very positive,\"\u00a0in a somewhat surprising assessment.</p><p>\"Regardless of whether we implement the exact same regulation, I would guess that it would be somewhat different, because we have somewhat different sensibilities in the U.S. as to other countries,\"\u00a0Zuckerberg\u00a0reemphasized during his congressional hearing on Tuesday.       </p><p>In an\u00a0open letter, U.S. and European consumer protection groups still urged <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to provide more\u00a0\"specific details on how the company plans to implement these changes.\"</p><p><person><nameText>Zuckerberg's</nameText></person>\u00a0praise for Europe's tough data rules\u00a0-\u00a0which have\u00a0been considered detrimental to the company's business model\u00a0- may indicate either a real strategy change or, as some consumer protection groups fear, an effort\u00a0to calm nervous\u00a0lawmakers\u00a0by promising eventual change that may or may not materialize.</p><p>          More on WorldViews:       </p><p>          The pope's challenge to Orban and Europe's far right       </p><p>          30 killed, including 23 children, as school bus

He says the adjacent rise of passive investing strategies has put much of the market's value in the coffers of a few tech companies. However, history has repeatedly shown that even the largest companies are subject to disruption. Click here for more BI Prime stories[2]. There's an important difference between the dot-com era and today's stock market. But it is not a palatable one, according to Steven Bregman, the founder of investment adviser Horizon Kinetics[3]. He contends that the overall market \u2014 not just consumer tech and telecom \u2014 is at bubble-level valuations. </p><p>\"There is nowhere within 'the market' to avoid this,\" Bregman said in a recent note[4]. \"It is therefore a far greater systemic danger than during the 1999 environment.\" At the heart of his concern lies passive investing, which has boomed in the last decade at the expense of actively managed funds and helped mega-cap tech stocks emerge as big winners. The passive boom has also fueled exchange-traded funds[5], the tradable baskets of securities that are appealing for their cost, tax, and diversification benefits. The ETF industry attracted $328 billion of net inflows in 2019 \u2014 its second-strongest year ever according to CFRA Research. Experts far and wide have called out the hazards embedded in both trends, including Michael Burry[6], the asset manager who famously bet against the subprime mortgage crisis. According to Bregman, the regime of \"artificially low interest rates\" and passive investing that has prevailed for the past decade is responsible for the ETF explosion. While this enabling environment can persist for much longer, the damage its withdrawal causes will be severe, Bregman said. \"Essentially, the stock market has \u2014 through its reshaping by the indexation business model and ETFs' asset accumulation \u2014 lost substantially all of its sources of resilience in the event of some jarring change to the present economic environment, whether that might a credit crisis, interest rate spike, inflation surge, etc,\" Bregman said. In the interim, he flagged large technology companies as the biggest beneficiaries of passive inflows. But beyond big tech's connection to ETFs, its sheer weight in the S&amp;P 500[7] raises his alarm bells. \"What people think of as 'the market' encompasses only a small fraction of publicly traded companies,\" he said. He further calculated that roughly 20% of the S&amp;P 500 consists of highly valued tech stocks and other companies that are experiencing rapid growth. The problem is that no company is immune to disruption, as history has repeatedly shown. Bregman used some of the top-10 S&amp;P 500 companies in 1999 to illustrate this point: AOL, then no. 10, tried to merge with Time Warner but flopped. Seventh-ranked Lucent Technologies imploded with the dot-com crisis and never quite recovered. General Electric[8], then no. 2, is now no. 62. \"As 'forever' as Amazon[9] and Google[10] seem, the paradox is that just about everyone on this call has just about witnessed this movie before,\" Bregman said during a webcast. And just like previous episodes, there are palpable regulatory and political liabilities that could demote some of the largest companies today, he added.  In light of these risks, the recommended move for investors is to find assets with pathways to returns that are independent of hyper-concentrated indexes, Bregman said. He highlighted the following two: Path-dependent ETF short-sale programs: These profit if the underlying ETF prices fall and can be extremely volatile in the short-term. Bitcoin and blockchain disruptors: Bregman called this cryptocurrency \"the ultimate non-correlated security,\" although its price also fluctuates wildly.NOW WATCH: A big-money investor in juggernauts like Facebook and Netflix breaks down the '3rd wave' firms that are leading the next round of tech disruption[11]See Also: GOLDMAN SACHS: You can make a killing this earnings season using a simple, low-cost strategy on these 20 stocks[12]A Wall Street firm surveyed 300 global investors on the state of ETFs today \u2014 and they revealed the 4 most attractive strategies right now[13]Bill Miller's mutual fund crushed the market for a record 15 straight years, and he's still beating his peers.

So they created the game. But we own it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Blue Jay fans threw decorum to the wind last night and let it all out in celebrations across the country.</p><p>Just ask any of the estimated one million fans who flooded Yonge St. and the downtown core north to St. Clair Ave. early today to take part in the history-making victory - the first time a championship has been decided outside the United States.</p><p>Outside the HMV record store on Yonge St., fans leapt in the air at Joe Carter's winning run at the bottom of the ninth inning.</p><p>At the moment of victory, a SkyDome security guard was on the way to pull down a fan at the stadium's main entrance. The fan had climbed on to a bicycle rack to get closer to a speaker broadcasting Carter's hit.</p><p>As the guard grabbed the man, the home run came.</p><p>Seconds later, the security guard and the man he was about to arrest were hugging and dancing all over the front of stadium, screaming, \"Jays win! Jays win!\"</p><p>As the fans poured out of the stadium, bottles of good Canadian brew appeared miraculously, as well as hip flasks and bottles of whisky.</p><p>People ran to telephones outside the stadium. Front St., at both exit points of the SkyDome, was blocked by a horde of screaming fans a few minutes after the victory.</p><p>Outside the dome, souvenir hunters were offering Game 6 World Series ticket stubs for $10 apiece.</p><p>Firecrackers went off as the mob flowed toward Yonge St. One driving lane on Front was kept clear by police motorcyclists driving two abreast.</p><p>Cars full of fans from the suburbs and out of town plowed into the city core yesterday, packing Yonge St. shortly after the game started.</p><p>Firecrackers went off through the eighth and ninth inning while drunks were being helped to their feet by passersby.</p><p>The party mood turned sour after the gutsy Phillies tied the game and moved ahead with the winning run 6-5. But pandemonium broke out on Carter's incredible winning run.</p><p>The bedlam that blocked traffic was increased when a laser light show began on the CN Tower and people stopped to gawk.</p><p>Sharon Lee said she had hugged a complete stranger.</p><p>\"I don't know who he is, but I'm just so happy, \" Lee said.</p><p>Her friend suggested the man had looked like Carter.</p><p>\"I think I'm going to have a complete fit, \" said fan David Martin on Yonge St. last night. \"What a way to win a game!\"</p><p>\"Jays are the best, \" screamed Peter Flamino, 19. \"This year's series feels even more euphoric than the 1992 championships.\"</p><p>Tony Buruto said he never doubted the Jays would rally. \"We're Number 1, \" he screamed hoarsely. \"We're out here all night it's even better than last year.\"</p><p>\"This is the best game I've ever seen, \" said Jim Monroe, an assistant district attorney from Canton, N.Y. \"Now I know how people feel when they win a lottery - this is better.\"</p><p>Monroe was carrying a yellow placard with the words, \"Molitor vs the Phillies.\"</p><p>Signmaker Ken Reid brought two homemade replicas of the 1992 and 1993 World Series pennants to the game with him.</p><p>\"Hollywood couldn't have written a better ending, \" he exulted. \"If Joe Carter decided to run for prime minister, he'd probably win.\"</p><p>Dozens of fans brought bottles of champagne into the SkyDome with them in anticipation of a Jays' win and wasted no time in popping corks on the bubbly.</p><p>Dozens of other fans got bathed in the stuff. Some appreciated it. Some didn't.</p><p>Tina Pulin, who watched the game on Yonge St. with roommate Tina Rubino, said she was \"very nervous, but I knew they were going to do it.\"</p><p>Rubino wasn't so confident. \"I thought they were going to lose. I thought they were getting too confident. It's amazing.\"</p><p>Fans roamed up and down Yonge St. and Nathan Phillips Square slapping each other on the hand and chanting, \"We are the champions, \" and waving Canadian flags.</p><p>Cars were jammed on Yonge St. and neighboring Bay St. as fans stuck their head outside cars, stood on cars, and even left cars abandoned in the middle of the road as they joined the celebrations.</p><p>With files from Dale Brazao, Philip Mascoll and Peter Edwards.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

So they created the game. But we own it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Blue Jay fans threw decorum to the wind last night and let it all out in celebrations across the country.</p><p>Just ask any of the estimated one million fans who flooded Yonge St. and the downtown core north to St. Clair Ave. early today to take part in the history-making victory - the first time a championship has been decided outside the United States.</p><p>Outside the HMV record store on Yonge St., fans leapt in the air at Joe Carter's winning run at the bottom of the ninth inning.</p><p>At the moment of victory, a SkyDome security guard was on the way to pull down a fan at the stadium's main entrance. The fan had climbed on to a bicycle rack to get closer to a speaker broadcasting Carter's hit.</p><p>As the guard grabbed the man, the home run came.</p><p>Seconds later, the security guard and the man he was about to arrest were hugging and dancing all over the front of stadium, screaming, \"Jays win! Jays win!\"</p><p>As the fans poured out of the stadium, bottles of good Canadian brew appeared miraculously, as well as hip flasks and bottles of whisky.</p><p>People ran to telephones outside the stadium. Front St., at both exit points of the SkyDome, was blocked by a horde of screaming fans a few minutes after the victory.</p><p>Outside the dome, souvenir hunters were offering Game 6 World Series ticket stubs for $10 apiece.</p><p>Firecrackers went off as the mob flowed toward Yonge St. One driving lane on Front was kept clear by police motorcyclists driving two abreast.</p><p>Cars full of fans from the suburbs and out of town plowed into the city core yesterday, packing Yonge St. shortly after the game started.</p><p>Firecrackers went off through the eighth and ninth inning while drunks were being helped to their feet by passersby.</p><p>The party mood turned sour after the gutsy Phillies tied the game and moved ahead with the winning run 6-5. But pandemonium broke out on Carter's incredible winning run.</p><p>The bedlam that blocked traffic was increased when a laser light show began on the CN Tower and people stopped to gawk.</p><p>Sharon Lee said she had hugged a complete stranger.</p><p>\"I don't know who he is, but I'm just so happy, \" Lee said.</p><p>Her friend suggested the man had looked like Carter.</p><p>\"I think I'm going to have a complete fit, \" said fan David Martin on Yonge St. last night. \"What a way to win a game!\"</p><p>\"Jays are the best, \" screamed Peter Flamino, 19. \"This year's series feels even more euphoric than the 1992 championships.\"</p><p>Tony Buruto said he never doubted the Jays would rally. \"We're Number 1, \" he screamed hoarsely. \"We're out here all night it's even better than last year.\"</p><p>\"This is the best game I've ever seen, \" said Jim Monroe, an assistant district attorney from Canton, N.Y. \"Now I know how people feel when they win a lottery - this is better.\"</p><p>Monroe was carrying a yellow placard with the words, \"Molitor vs the Phillies.\"</p><p>Signmaker Ken Reid brought two homemade replicas of the 1992 and 1993 World Series pennants to the game with him.</p><p>\"Hollywood couldn't have written a better ending, \" he exulted. \"If Joe Carter decided to run for prime minister, he'd probably win.\"</p><p>Dozens of fans brought bottles of champagne into the SkyDome with them in anticipation of a Jays' win and wasted no time in popping corks on the bubbly.</p><p>Dozens of other fans got bathed in the stuff. Some appreciated it. Some didn't.</p><p>Tina Pulin, who watched the game on Yonge St. with roommate Tina Rubino, said she was \"very nervous, but I knew they were going to do it.\"</p><p>Rubino wasn't so confident. \"I thought they were going to lose. I thought they were getting too confident. It's amazing.\"</p><p>Fans roamed up and down Yonge St. and Nathan Phillips Square slapping each other on the hand and chanting, \"We are the champions, \" and waving Canadian flags.</p><p>Cars were jammed on Yonge St. and neighboring Bay St. as fans stuck their head outside cars, stood on cars, and even left cars abandoned in the middle of the road as they joined the celebrations.</p><p>With files from Dale Brazao, Philip Mascoll and Peter Edwards.</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

Everyone says is the most important election of our lives. Well, it is an important election at least right now for our lives. Here's The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everybody. I am Jesse Watters, along with Dana Perino, Greg Gutfeld, Juan Williams, and Martha MacCallum. It is 5:00 in New York City, and this is The Five. It's one of the biggest nights of Joe Biden's life. Hours from now, he will accept the Democratic nomination for president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But President Trump is not letting Biden have the spotlight all to himself. Trump campaigning near Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, turning up the heat with searing attacks on the former VP's character and policies. Take a look.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So tonight, we have -- Slow Joe will speak at the Democrat convention. And I am sure that he will just knock them dead. If you want a vision of your life under the Biden presidency, think of the smouldering ruins in Minneapolis, the violent anarchy of Portland, the bloodstained sidewalks of Chicago, and imagine the mayhem coming to your town.</p><p>He left -- he abandoned Pennsylvania and he spent the last half century in Washington selling out our country and ripping off our jobs. And now, he's going to come in and make a change. I don't think so.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: All right, pretty brutal attack there. All right, before we get to the president, Martha MacCallum, let's go to you, because you were actually there in Delaware where Joe Biden's going to be delivering his address tonight. We have seen all week the kind of mediocrely produced campaign. And tonight, is it different? Tonight, it looks like there's a live aspect to it. What do we expect this evening?</p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, you know, I think as we all noticed last night when they took that wide shot of Kamala Harris and you saw that room -- just an empty room that we're all used to seeing delegates standing with the, you know, the cube-like things with the state names all over them and there was no one there. It was just weird.</p><p>So tonight, I do think they're going to try to take that to another level. I tried to find out this afternoon, walking around here, whether or not this was a recent development. It seems like it has been in the works for a little while that there will be some kind of outside event behind us -- Peter (ph) do you he's been reporting on this for us.</p><p>It looks like they could fit about 100 cars back there and that they will. He is -- I asked -- he is expected to make the speech inside as Kamala Harris did. At least, that's what they are telling us so far today. But we do think that after that, there's going to be some sort of outside event here with some fireworks perhaps. And, you know, hallelujah.</p><p>I mean, you know, I think everybody is just dying to see a little bit of regular enthusiasm and excitement that we're used to seeing at these things, but a very sombre week.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. So it's like a drive-in with fireworks. We'll all be watching. Greg, the president is not letting up, hammering Joe Biden for basically abandoning his home state of Pennsylvania, saying he's kind of left them high and dry with open borders, bad trade deals, high regulation, high taxes, not letting his foot off Biden's neck, right, on his big night.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, the key difference there if you -- these are specific claims by Trump as opposed to the amorphous kind of -- I don't know, insults about Trump's personality, the things that can't be measured. At least, what Trump is talking about can be measured. But first, I just want to talk about tonight, because I'm going to tell you the truth. I thought the convention was already over.</p><p>WATTERS: Oh.</p><p>GUTFELD: I totally forgot about Joe. And I am wondering if there was anybody at home who kind of felt the same way. I completely forgot that Joe actually is going to be there and accept the nomination. Completely forgot about it. But I think the -- it's an interesting comparison again. So this has been nothing but Trump-bashing, and that makes sense, because you are the outside party looking in.</p><p>You're hungry for power. So of course, you are going to portray the guy in the White House as awful. But the difference here and it's very important to note, they've replaced awful with evil. And by extension, they're portraying voters who are unsure about Joe or who once voted for Obama and now voted for Trump. People who favored as guilty by association, so you're probably racist, sexist, you're probably evil just like the person you're voting for.</p><p>And this, on the long term, even in the short term, puts targets on voters' backs. That's the thing that worries me. I'm -- used to teach politics. They mirror each other. Both groups say each one of them is wrong. But we're entering a new phase where the Democrats' game plan has lifted from kind of the feverish hate you find on Twitter and Antifa.</p><p>And they are demonizing in exchange for power. And I worry about the consequences of that.</p><p>WATTERS: Juan, what are your expectations for Joe Biden this evening? This is, you know, this is a week where there's a lot bigger and brighter stars than Joe Biden who'd been speaking. And here he is Thursday night, a lot of pressure.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, I think Joe Biden has got to be up for the fight. I think Democrats want to know that he is in there. Biden has a great slogan. You know, this is a battle for the soul of America. I think tonight he has got to be very clear that he is a warrior for the soul of America and that he has values and principles and that he's willing to stand up for.</p><p>He's not going to get distracted by Trump off trolling in Scranton, Pennsylvania, saying that Biden somehow ripped off the people of Scranton in Pennsylvania. Joe Biden is a much loved son of Scranton, Pennsylvania. And while he's saying that Biden was ripping somebody off, you see Steve Bannon, Trump's number one guy there being indicted for fraud, for ripping off Republicans who was sending him money to try to build the wall.</p><p>And it's not just obviously Bannon, but you can go down the line of Stone, Flynn, Manafort, Michael Cohen. You know, drain the swamp. Build a wall. As Senator Warren said today, it's all a con job. But in terms of the speech tonight, Jesse, I think that he has got to make it clear, as I said soul of America.</p><p>And this election is a referendum about Donald Trump and about Trump's record over the last four years. Do you want another four years of this? I think that's the point that he has got to deliver tonight.</p><p>WATTERS: Dana, do you think Joe Biden is capable of delivering, as Juan said?</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, Joe Biden has political strengths, but public speaking has never been one of them. And it's not likely to be one that he all of a sudden gets. Now, I do think that it is hard to do a speech like this without a crowd. Imagine not having anyone, you know, start a chant or shout your name or start crazy applause.</p><p>And you get to stand there and bask in that energy. And instead -- I mean, you and Greg are fantastic at doing monologues, and you read into a prompter, right? You don't have -- you don't at least right now during the pandemic, you don't have immediate audience feedback. I think that's hard. And I also think it's kind of sad for them. But this is what we are dealing with right now, so I think it will be OK.</p><p>But I think that it's hard to screw up a prepared speech like this where you're reading in the teleprompter. I think when you start to see Biden and Harris do some interviews like they're going to do this weekend with David Muir of ABC News. That's where you're going to start to see a little bit more room for error.</p><p>I think at the end of tonight, the goal for the Democrats has to be to look a little bit more like Clinton-Gore than Dole-Kemp, not sure what the consensus is going to be at this point.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. I do miss basking in the applause of live audiences. Greg, I know you agree with that.</p><p>GUTFELD: I still get it, though. Whenever I leave this studio, it's -- I can barely get to my private limo.</p><p>WATTERS: I know.</p><p>GUTFELD: Because people, they're just throwing themselves at me. And it's disgusting, because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: Do they twirl their masks and throw them at you?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: They take it off seductively and they just throw it at me. It's really disgusting.</p><p>WATTERS: In your dreams, Gutfeld. Coming up, Barack Obama upstages Kamala Harris' big night after claiming President Trump is a threat to democracy.</p><p>PERINO: Kamala Harris's big moment accepting her party's vice presidential nomination being overshadowed. Harris had a tough act to follow after former President Obama launched his sharpest attacks yet against President Donald Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously, but he never did. For close to four years now, he has shown no interest in putting in the work. No interest in finding common ground. No interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends.</p><p>Donald Trump hasn't grown into the job because he can't. This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that's what it takes for them to win.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Juan, Democrats let us know that Barack Obama was supposed to be the last speaker, but he asked to go before Kamala Harris so that he could be seen as the attack dog, which is usually a vice presidential role and that she could rise above. Do you think that she was overshadowed, or did she have her own moment?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, first of all, I think that, you know, he didn't want to be an attack dog so much. I mean, he just laid out the case. But yes, it was a hand off to Kamala Harris, kind of a generational thing. A man who had been president saying this woman is well prepared to be vice president. But the bigger point, I think, is that Obama did overshadow her, Dana.</p><p>So to your point, yes, I don't think there is any question. But remember, he is a former president. He is much better known, and in my opinion, a much better speaker. So I didn't think that there was ever going to be a contest there. It was an act of grace on his part to say she should be -- given the last, the primary spot on her night when she makes history.</p><p>A black woman nominated to be vice president of the United States, just a quick note on Obama's speech. You know, it's interesting to me because it's, you know, I think it was Chris Wallace that, you know -- it wasn't hope and change. It was a different tone to that speech. And I really felt like he was speaking to people who were disillusioned, people who might've become cynical about the state of American politics and think things don't change.</p><p>Problems don't get solved. And he said in terms of -- he posed it, I should say. In terms of civil rights, and he said, you know, people who were being beaten, people who were getting even hanged didn't give up hope in those days, but in fact, kept their faith in America and American principles of equal rights and justice and kept going on.</p><p>And he said John Lewis told him that on the day that Barack Obama was born, John Lewis was being ushered into jail in the south. He says things change quickly. You just got to keep your hope. You have to get out there. Get involved. Organize and vote. So in that sense, I found it inspiring.</p><p>PERINO: Greg, I noted that it wasn't so much hope and change as you better vote or we are all screwed. That seemed to be message.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, it went exactly as I think I predicted, which was nothing that Obama said was fact based, it was all feelings based. It was this -- again, this kind of cloudy -- he is unfit. He is mean. He's bad. These are opinions. They actually are not tied to any data. There is no bottom line that the voter can kind of grab onto, because believe -- they want to hear about jobs.</p><p>They want to hear about the economy. They want to hear about specifics. So this is basically just more of that stuff that you've already heard on CNN and MSNBC, which is Trump, is a big meanie. And he is going to be even meaner. Now, what Kamala said -- Kamala said about Trump was that he caused a loss of certainty. And this says a lot about Obama.</p><p>But how can you lose something that you never had before? I think that Kamala forgets the weekly beheadings that occurred when Obama was president. You want to talk about anxiety and uncertainty? We were doing The Five during that. Everybody here was morose and uncertain about the next terror attack, because every single day that those beheadings took place, they were unmatched.</p><p>There was no counter offensive. So -- the Democrats offered no response to that. And that created a level of uncertainty we had not had since 9/11 that then Trump just addressed. Now, what we are seeing? We're seeing the same thing with the interior terrorism, the stuff in the United States, the violence on the street, the mayhem, the murders.</p><p>Again, there is no counter offensive from the Democrats who are running the city. And that, again, is creating uncertainty and anxiety in the American population. Those are the people that are going to vote, because the Democrats are letting them down. They are not even touching this idea because they know they are responsible.</p><p>PERINO: Interesting that you bring up the point about the cynicism and Barack Obama, Martha, saying, you know, we have to get out there. You have to continue to have hope. And yet, there was one line in Kamala Harris' speech that really stuck out to me. She said -- in talking about what they will accomplish, she said we may fall short. And I thought what?</p><p>Did she just say we may fall short? But she said that we're going to be honest with you. We may not get there. I didn't think that was very rousing.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. I think it's a great point, Dana. And you think about the two times in recent history that an incumbent has lost his job, right? And you have Bill Clinton who presented this vision of the man from hope, this young, inspiring, uplifting. Whatever you think about Bill Clinton, that's what, got him to that moment. And then you go back to Ronald Reagan, the other person who was able to do this.</p><p>It's an uphill battle to beat an incumbent, very, very hard to do, OK, especially in a difficult economic time which we're in. So Ronald Reagan had morning in America. Where is the morning in America? We've heard about build back better. Barack Obama had a unique opportunity in that speech to say here's why Joe is the man. Here's why he is the one who can turn this thing around.</p><p>Here's what he's going to do to build us back better and to create that momentum. But it was, like, the Joe lines were sort of somewhat throw-away. He is descent. He's nice. He's a great guy. He's my brother. And then let's move on and talk about other stuff. And just, you know, you better get out there and vote. So I think it was a bit of a wasted opportunity in terms of the mission of the moment.</p><p>PERINO: Jesse, do you think that last night, for either former President Obama or Kamala Harris, did they bring in any new voters, anyone who might have been -- maybe didn't vote in 2016 or have never voted Democrat before?</p><p>WATTERS: Doubt it, Dana. President Obama looked terrified. This was not an uplifting speech at all. It looked like he knows this is going to a low turnout election. And the internal numbers for the Democratic Party must be horrific because this looked like a desperate plea to vote early and cast you ballot immediately. He knows Joe has no base.</p><p>I mean, he didn't want Joe to run in 2016, didn't want Joe to run this year. He knows COVID is on the downtrend. He knows football is around the corner. Schools are reopening. The economy is coming back. And Joe's going to be exposed or -- the writing is on the wall. To say that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy, all Democrats believe if they don't win it's a threat to democracy.</p><p>I actually think the threat to democracy is, you know, buying foreign intelligence to wiretap an opposing political campaign. But what do I know? It looked to me like the president was extremely -- Obama disdainful of the current president, because he just left his legacy in tatters. The Obama mandate is gone. Iran deal is out of there.</p><p>The only thing left right now is kind of a cloud of scandal. Because President Obama knows if Biden doesn't win, Bill Barr stays there and Durham continues to investigate Obamagate. President Obama was not a very effective leader. He was frozen any time he had to make a decision. He had a very weak recovery, astronomical gas prices, a slew of domestic terror attacks, racial polarization.</p><p>These were not great times. And to say that, you know, Trump has bad character. Oh, come on. Everybody in the Democratic Party was palling around with Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein. You had Crooked Hillary out there. Where is Hunter Biden? Those dirty FBI agents, please. A lot of times, people say Barack Obama gave us Donald Trump.</p><p>He could have gone on there last night and just apologized to the Democratic Party for delivering that. So at the end of the day, I don't think he did what he needed to do. And he knows that this is going to be a tough race.</p><p>PERINO: God love you, Jesse. You make me laugh. All right, next, Hillary Clinton makes her return to the Democratic convention with serious accusations against President Trump. We will tell you about them next.</p><p>GUTFELD: Hillary Clinton returning to the spotlight. That's her on the left. And warning President Trump will cheat his way to re-election. She knows cheaters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: This can't be another would've, could've, should've election. Vote for honest elections so we, not a foreign adversary, choose our president. Don't forget. Joe and Kamala can win by three million votes and still lose. Take it from me. So we need numbers, overwhelming, so Trump can't sneak or steal his way to victory.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, Dana, I think Captain Crazy Eyes has a point there. She is the expert when it comes to losing, so maybe they should listen to her.</p><p>PERINO: As Karl Rove said last night, at least there is no bitterness or regret or anything like that happening over there. I do think that one of the things we have not seen as much of is the youth of the party. The -- that -- Joe Biden is an older man, we all know that. He's -- he wants to be president. He is an older man. And he wants to lead a relatively young country.</p><p>And you didn't see as much of that last night or in the last couple of nights. I think you will see a little bit more of that tonight. Andrew Yang is speaking. Pete Buttigieg is going to speak as well. So there will be a little bit more of that sort of pep in your step type of thing. But the other thing that is very different from 2016 to 2020 is the relationship between Bernie Sanders and Biden versus Bernie Sanders and Clinton.</p><p>The Bernie-Clinton people -- if you remember back to 2016, his endorsement of Hillary Clinton was a little bit lukewarm to say the least. So what you have now is Bernie and Biden. They seem to, like, getting along pretty well. Their staffs are getting along. They are putting an effort into it. The progressives might not get everything that they want, but that's a big difference.</p><p>And I have to say she should do a little bit of self-examination as to why that was and why people might not have turned out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, Dana surprisingly made a very good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: That --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Like, Hillary is not like her husband who was a popular scoundrel. She is not very popular among the Democrats. Does the party have to weigh the cost and the benefits of having her on?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, no. I think especially for women. And I think lots of this convention has been targeted, message-wise, at women, Greg. You know, last night, you not only had Clinton. You had Warren, Pelosi. You know, you can go down the line. The idea here, I think, is that President Trump said it last week. If he doesn't win, then the election was rigged.</p><p>And obviously, he's talked about delaying the election. He's trying to undermine the Post Office. He said, you know, he doesn't have faith in this whole structure, because right now so many people want to engage in fraud. I mean, you know, at some point, you say tongue in cheek, she said. You know what, she won by two million votes or whatever and still lost the election.</p><p>So it's a little tongue in cheek because she is not saying anything illegal happened. But she is suggesting don't ever close your eyes in a poker game with Donald Trump, because all that matters for him is winning. It's not about decency, compassion, about standing up for American democracy. It's just about winning.</p><p>GUTFELD: Unlike the Democratic Party, all about compassion as the cities explode. You know, Juan makes a good point, though, Martha, about -- it seems like the Democrats are -- want to be the party of women. Even though their speakers chant being Harvey Weinstein. Their speakers partied with Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>And their most famous female who was up there last night smeared women who were victims of sexual assault of her husband. So it seems like they're trying to have their cake and eat it too. I don't know if that's the right analogy.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, I mean, I thought -- I thought Scott Jennings who worked at the Bush White House with Dana had a great moment over on a rival cable network over there the other night when he said, you know, how has Bill Clinton not been canceled? Everybody's been canceled.</p><p>So how has he survived this process which I think is a good question, given some of the pictures that came out that day? And you know, once they start doing these interviews, when Kamala Harris and Joe Biden sit down, you're going to start to get into hopefully, some nitty-gritty questions about her saying that, you know, she believed the women who accused Joe Biden. I know Tara Reade is back out there today telling her story which I'm sure is something that they're not too excited about.</p><p>But there's a lot of hypocrisy that goes around here and I think that you are about to see a very bare-knuckle moment surface. You know, as soon -- sorry, there's a bug flying around my face. As soon as this moment is over, right, as soon as you get through the DNC and all this, like, you know, this guy's decent and nice and you know, it's all about being decent nice, both sides want to win, right? And you're going to start to see this get really, really ugly in the coming weeks. Mark my words.</p><p>So this has only just begun and yes you know the hypocrisy about the issues of women and kind of aiming at both sides on that front is not going to end.</p><p>GUTFELD: Jesse, I felt like the real worry that I got from Hillary was that voters aren't going to show up for Joe which kind of explains why they're pushing the mail-in ballots because they got to make it as easy as possible for uninterested ambivalent voters to vote.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, that's what I said at the top. They know it's going to be a low turnout deal and they're just freaking out and making sure everybody gets their ballots in early. And honestly, she looked like a ghost haunting the country last night Gutfeld. The way she comes out of there from the dark, screechy audio. It was a hollow speech. No one's talking about it. It was just lifeless.</p><p>To have democrats complain about fairness and election makes me laugh. I mean, big tech censoring Republicans. The Democrats have the media in their back pocket. They have unions squeezing the president before an election to get what they want. I mean, come on, Hillary paid $9 million for foreign interference to get a wiretap. She's complaining about fairness? And when she does play poker with the president, she's only got one card, and that's the race card. And we've seen that many -- too many times.</p><p>The thing that's funny to me is she called on Democrats to volunteer as poll workers. Last night now when I hear Crooked inspiring Trump haters to volunteer as poll workers, it makes me a little uneasy. I think they're nervous about turnout and they're just trying to work the angles or at least trying to get out ahead of this thing so they can have an excuse when they lose.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, I do know her husband loves a good poll worker.</p><p>WATTERS: Don't do it You did it. It's too late.</p><p>GUTFELD: Nightclubs, table dancing.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: So, does Hunter. Hunter doesn't hide it. He loves a good nightclub, a good tipper. Still no mentioned from DNC speakers about the violence plaguing major cities, but we heard plenty about taking away guns.</p><p>MACCALLUM: The third night of the Democratic Convention focused in part on gun control. We had emotional speeches from former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and other victims of gun violence. But so far, still no mention of the violent protests that we have seen in major cities, the huge increase in homicides, and then you've got the example of the Portland Police declaring a riot for the after the 84th night of unrest there. Federal officers clashed with agitators outside of an ICE building. They threw rocks, bottles and a hammer at the authorities there.</p><p>So, Greg, you know, it feels, obviously, no one -- everyone is moved by the story of Gabby Giffords and this woman who spoke about her son being shot at a birthday party, a stray bullet. These are all very tragic stories. But given what we see going on around the nation, and given the fact that you've got I think, an 80 percent increase in gun sales in this country right now because people are concerned, is this moment -- you know, are they meeting the moment?</p><p>GUTFELD: No, they're not. I said this yesterday. Rather than have the courage to condemn the very specific crimes of violence that are terrorizing right now the citizens in our cities, they instead created a broad target out of generic gun violence. So, they use tragedy it kind of as a shield.</p><p>So, when you use -- when you make a generic -- a broad target out of gun violence, what you're saying is everything good or bad resulting from the gun is kind of like all the same. They're all kind of equal. By doing that, they actually -- they deftly or they think they did deftly sidestep confronting an American crisis that they are in part responsible for, because these are cities run by Democratic leaders.</p><p>And they know that by not doing anything, it creates a lot of tension and anxiety so that the voters might stop and think whether voting for Trump is going to make this worse or not. They're essentially leveraging terror. They're extorting a vote out of America. It's pretty disgusting.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You know, Juan, I wonder, with all of this discussion about the suburban voter, you know, the suburban voter is concerned about what's going on in the cities. And if anything, it feels like at this moment, there's concern about these defund the police movements and whether or not that violence is going to make its way as it already has in some cases from the cities out to the suburbs.</p><p>I want to just roll this video. This is in New York. It's a -- I warn you, it's very horrific scene. A former police officer was assaulted on the street. This is on 39th Street. This is basically Midtown, in the middle of the afternoon. And in New York, they pulled 600 police officers off the street. And now we're seeing this. So, is this a mistake for Democrats to ignore this?</p><p>WILLIAMS: They're not ignoring it. I mean, first of all, there's not --</p><p>MACCALLUM: They haven't mentioned it once, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK, there's not widespread violence in American cities. Let's not get buying to Donald Trump's nonsense about American --</p><p>MACCALLUM: Wait a minute, Juan. Homicides are up --</p><p>GUTFELD: Please, where are your facts, Juan? Where are your facts?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's just not true, OK.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Juan, hold on.</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, no, let me finish because you guys are pushing a false narrative.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Homicides are up 37 percent --</p><p>WILLIAMS: You're pushing a totally false narrative. You're pushing a totally false narrative.</p><p>GUTFELD: I'm not Donald Trump. I'm telling you the facts. Every day, I tell you the facts, Juan, and you keep shooting it to Donald Trump. It's pathetic.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There's no facts there because --</p><p>GUTFELD: You need to come up with a new talking point.</p><p>WILLIAMS: In fact, American violence and violent crime in this country is down. It's near 30 years low.</p><p>GUTFELD: The murders are up. The shootings are up. Stop it, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Ok, but it's nothing to do -- it has nothing to do with anarchist violence.</p><p>GUTFELD: Find a new talking point. It makes you wrong, you're embarrassing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK, this is not anarchistic violence, you know, by a small group in Portland, Oregon, that suddenly being blown into like, oh, that represents what's going on in American cities. That's just wrong. That's just a total distraction. The reality is that, you know, Democrats are not responsible for some violent anarchist no more than Donald Trump is responsible for QAnon violence --</p><p>GUTFELD: QAnon violence? There is none.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Hold on. Hold on. I want to get -- I want to get to Dana.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- or saying that there are fine people in Charlottesville who run over somebody and kill people.</p><p>GUTFELD: You are hilarious.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Dana, the fact of the matter is that homicides are up 37 percent in 20 cities across America. This is not -- this is a widespread issue. So, are the suburban voters going to look to Donald Trump in this moment when they might have looked to Joe Biden if this is just not even addressed?</p><p>PERINO: Well, I think I've mentioned on the show that suburban voters -- people that live in the suburbs like to go to the cities, and they do all the great things that they can do in the cities, museums, theater, arts, whatever it is that they want to do, restaurants, things like that.</p><p>So yes, I mean, if you if you know that the violence is up in your city or the homicides, to be specific, are up, would you go? Probably not. And also, if you add the pandemic on top of it, there's nothing to go to. So, we have a twin problem, talking about a twin-demic, there you go. There is one of them.</p><p>I do want to mention one thing about last night. Obviously, Gabby Giffords, amazing story when she talked about she lost her -- some ability to speak but she didn't lose her voice. It was a beautiful line. But I also thought that when you saw those moms and the students who are very frustrated because they feel like they are forgotten, there's a big school shooting, we talked about it for four days, and it goes away. It happens again, we talked about it -- so I don't -- I don't blame the Democrats for bringing that up.</p><p>I do think, though, that they do need to think about something Katie Pavlich brought up last night. There are since January 2.5 million more gunowners in the United States, couple that with the New York State Attorney General has called for the dissolution of the National Rifle Association rather than just punishing for bad behavior on the finances.</p><p>So now, you -- if you're -- if you're looking at a very close election, I don't know if that's the best thing to do, but I understand why they appeal to those younger people and the parents.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Jesse?</p><p>WATTERS: Looting is up, arson is up, shootings are up, and murders up. Maybe the Democratic politicians in the city are misreporting their own criminal activity. I doubt that though. So, I think the Democrats are just misreading the nation. This is not 2015 where we're seeing a rash of school shootings or mass shootings. This is 2020 and you're seeing a rise in homicides, shootings, quality of life issues, homelessness, riots, and street crime.</p><p>If you live in a major metropolitan area or a big market, medium market, and you turn on the local news every single night, they lead with crime stories. And if you're in the burbs of those local markets, you're tuning in, and you're seeing crime, crime, crime at the top of every hour. And then you go on social media, and you're looking at viral videos. The guy in Portland that got kicked in the head, almost died, that's got more views than some of these Democrats speaking at the convention.</p><p>So you can't censor this where CNN doesn't report it or the New York Times as a report it. Everybody feels it. And if you say we're going to take your guns away and defund the police during this surge of chaos, that's just a recipe for disaster. And not only have they not mentioned crime, they haven't mentioned China, Russia, impeachment, judges, North Korea, taxes, border wall, trade, God, or terrorism. They've either just ignored issues or they've seated at all the Donald Trump and that's not good.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right, thanks, guys. Coming up next, pandemic politics. Democrats pointing their fingers at President Trump during the DNC.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A big virtual night for Joe Biden. Hours from now, he will accept the Democratic nomination for president in Delaware. Let's get our final thoughts. Martha, you're on the ground. What are you hearing about what Joe Biden might do to set off some fireworks tonight?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Well, I'm just looking forward to seeing some actual human beings who are going to be sitting in cars behind us, and they're going to come out on the stage behind us as well tonight. And we understand there's going to be fireworks, so I'm looking forward to some semblance of what people want to see.</p><p>I mean, these nights, I also think that there needs to be a message that there's a light at the end of the tunnel. People are tired of being down and depressed in this country, and they want to be lifted up. And I think that's really the mission for tonight for Joe Biden if he hopes to persuade voters that he is the guy to do it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Greg?</p><p>GUTFELD: I would say to the viewers who are watching this in the convention to take heart when you hear about this ominous chaos that Trump causes. You have to consider the source. I mentioned this before. The people that are accusing Trump of creating chaos and horror and hell and all this stuff, they're not cab drivers, they're not bouncers, they're not stockbrokers, they're not real estate agents. They are establishment politicians and workers in the media.</p><p>So, Trump has created legitimate chaos for them. They are experiencing real honest to God pain and suffering, because they are not used to this kind of creature. Trump's actions have actually helped you. But it hasn't helped the bubble of elite. They're going haywire. And that is awesome. So that -- you should always remember that when you hear them melting down.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, Dana, I think most Americans, I think it's like two-thirds disapprove of Trump on the virus, what is Biden have to say about that?</p><p>PERINO: Well, they've said it all week, so I think that he'll probably talk about it again. But I think they have to like look beyond the virus because there's going to be a vaccine, and they know that. So that's why they're hedging their bets on that.</p><p>The thing I'm looking at is the activist side of the Democratic Party has been very, very quiet this week. I'm like, why is that? Then I realized, well, they don't have an opportunity to interrupt. The DNC can absolutely control the message. I don't know if they are as complacent as it appears, because you don't hear from them.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Jesse.</p><p>WATTERS: This is not election about the character of Donald Trump, the soul of the nation, anything like that. This is election about performance, competence, and results. And until the Chinese virus came here, Donald Trump had an excellent track record of accomplishments.</p><p>Now, look at the virus. The Democrats are nervous politically because yesterday in New York, there was only one death. And for the last four straight weeks, deaths and cases have gone down. They see that, it's slipping away, and that's what this is all about.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, \"ONE MORE THING\" up next for you on THE FIVE.</p><p>WATTERS: It's time now for \"ONE MORE THING.\" Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, Jesse, get that tissue box ready, a wet eye alert. Will Claussen is getting married and here he is asking his brother who has down syndrome to be his best man. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Please say yes to be my best man. Well --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What? Will you want to be my best man?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, as you can see, Henry found a clue in the bottle with a note asking him to be Will's best man. And you know, he was just thrilled. You can see it. It's such an act of love among brothers and then that leap of pure joy. What a joy. It's terrific.</p><p>WATTERS: That is really nice. All right, Juan, I have one for you. It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a cow. Take a look at this Juan Williams. In Klausen Pass, Switzerland, a cow is injured on a mountain. And what does his owner do? Airlifted him down with a helicopter just to prevent more injuries. I mean, what a nice owner.</p><p>I'm not even going to report the fact that he slaughtered him later and ate a ribeye that night, but I wanted to show you the video of how kind this owner is. It looks kind of fun up there.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Greg?</p><p>GUTFELD: That's one hell of a moving company. Shoot me. All right, let's do this.</p><p>WATTERS: I have a correction. I have to make a correction.</p><p>GUTFELD: What?</p><p>WATTERS: It was a dairy cow.</p><p>GUTFELD: OK.</p><p>WATTERS: The cows not eaten.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right, let's do this.</p><p>WATTERS: It was just milk.</p><p>GUTFELD: Greg's Guess the Hole in One. All right, let's show this amazing picture. I bet most of you don't know who this man is right there. But that man just scored his ninth, his ninth hole in one on Tuesday. So not only does he have better hair than Jesse, he's better at golf than just about anybody, and a genius musician. I bet nobody here on this panel knows who he is.</p><p>WATTERS: I know who he is.</p><p>GUTFELD: Nope.</p><p>WATTERS: That's King Buzzo.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's King Buzzo from The Melvins. He's got a new album out with Trevor Dunn from Mr. Bungle. It's amazing. Pick it up, nine holes in one. That's incredible.</p><p>WATTERS: It doesn't count if no one is there to see it by the way, so I'm just letting you know that.</p><p>GUTFELD: I lost my sound.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, who do we have next? Is it Martha?</p><p>GUTFELD: I can't hear anything.</p><p>WATTERS: Dana is next.</p><p>PERINO: OK, I just wanted to bring something to your attention. It's not funny, but it is about Iowa. There was a terrible storm in the Midwest last week. It was a windstorm. It's called a Derecho. It destroyed homes, cause hundreds of thousands to lose power. They still don't have power. It upended the corn and soybean fields there after winds just tore it apart, 140 mile per hour winds. The area is still hurting and they really need help. There's a lot going on in the world, I know.</p><p>But if you could -- if you can't volunteer because you don't live there, if you could consider looking to one of these organizations like FeedIowaFirst.com and TableToTable.com. There's also a bunch of verified GoFundMe campaigns that you can look to. Just really think about these people hold them up in your prayers because they have a long road back.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, get out your pocketbooks. Martha, you're up next.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, I'm competing with the soundtrack here which are warming up in the parking lot in Wilmington. But the TSA is having a cute K9 contest for all of those amazing dogs that can sniff out explosives in the airports and keep us safer. So, we've got Kyla, you've got to Johnny. Johnny is in the Phoenix Sky Airport, Alexi from Dallas-Fort Worth, and Ron from the Oakland International Airport. So, you can go on the TSA's Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram accounts. You can vote through Thursday and the National Dog Day as I know you all well know, of course, is August the 26th. That's Buddy. He's not in the final four but he's pretty cute. So National Dog Day coming up.</p><p>PERINO: Go for the Vizsla, everybody. Vote for the Vizsla.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Absolutely.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, I can hear it's starting to rock out there in Wilmington, Delaware. We'll be watching it later tonight. All right, special coverage of the Democratic National Convention begins right now on special report. Hi, Bret.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But efforts such as Apple's Screen Time are a bit misguided, because they don't address the underlying problem of attention manipulation, said Harris, the cofounder of the Center for Humane Technology. Instead of giving consumers tools to monitor how much they use their devices and apps, tech companies ought to be encouraging users to do other things that are more fulfilling, he said. Business Insider named Harris to its list of the 100 people transforming business. </p><p>See the full list here[2]. Tristan Harris is encouraged by the big tech companies' recent focus on the well-being of their customers. Encouraged, but truth be told, not all that impressed. The problem with efforts such as the Screen Time feature[3] Apple added to the iPhone and similar ones that Google added to Android[4] is that the companies don't seem to understand and aren't really addressing the underlying problem, said Harris, a cofounder of the Center for Humane Technology and one of the tech industry's leading critics. \"I want to applaud the direction, but I think we have to get the diagnosis right,\" he told Business Insider in a recent interview. Harris has repeatedly called out tech companies for exploiting what he calls the attention economy. For years, those companies have designed their products to take advantage of their customers' innate human mental proclivities and shortcomings to manipulate them into spending increasing amounts of time with those apps and services, he said. As Harris has detailed[5], design features such a \"refresh to reload\" systems and so-called infinite scroll pages play on users' basic instincts, getting them to devote more of their time and attention to particular products and services. Read this: AN UNLIKELY REVOLUTIONARY: How Tristan Harris went from working at Apple and Google to consulting with heads of state about how to reform Silicon Valley[6]Giving customers usage data won't \"magically\" solve the problemThe companies now seem to think they can empower users to counter that manipulation in part by giving them more information on the time they're spending on their devices and apps, Harris said. But that's an \"under-informed\" approach, he said. The thinking seems to be that if users just saw the data, \"they would magically start to operate differently,\" Harris said. \"And this is clearly not true, unfortunately.\"Similarly misguided are the features that allow users to set limits on the time they spend on their devices or apps, he said. Such features don't address the underlying need or basic desire that users seem to have to interact with such products, he said. \"If the person is feeling the kind of anxiety and novelty-seeking craving in their lower nervous system that causes them to reach for their phone the second time this last 60 seconds ... it's not because they just need a seat belt or ... [need] a limit that says, 'don't do that,'\" Harris said. So what might actually counter the attention manipulation schemes?Designers should encourage users to do things that are fulfillingIn general, designers should focus on having their products encourage people to make time in their lives for the activities that they find \"regenerative\" and that help them connect with the people around them, Harris said. That's going to take something other than asking them to set simple time limits, he said. The most effective counter to addiction is connection, not sobriety, he said, paraphrasing author Johann Hari. When you focus on the things that are fulfilling to you, that connect and regenerate you, \"you come back from that experience not feeling as twitchy for that next dopamine fix\" from our phone or app, Harris said. Harris also offered a practical design suggestion that companies and developers could incorporate into their products to help counter the attention manipulation. They could introduce into infinite scroll systems, like Facebook's News Feed, a randomized delay. As users scrolled through such systems, the feeds or pages would, at an unpredictable point, just start getting slower to scroll through. You would \"start to feel frustrated with how long it's taking, and you just start to give up,\" he said. \"That would work. It wouldn't stop the whole problem, but it would work better than a reminder that says, 'Hey, it's been exactly ... an hour and 23 minutes.'\" But that's just one idea. Harris is confident companies and designers can and will come up with plenty more to address the problems of the attention economy. \"This is the opening inning of, hopefully, a whole reformation of the way we design these products to be sensitive to human nature,\" he said.

The BBC's director of content said they have an \"insatiable greed for data-gathering\" and are motivated by profit, rather than what's good for audiences. It is the latest swing in a sustained attack from the BBC on America's big tech companies. </p><p>One of the world's most powerful TV executives has taken aim at Netflix and Amazon. In a speech on Thursday night[1], the BBC's Director of Content Charlotte Moore said the US tech giants have an enormous thirst for data and are motivated by profit, rather than what's good for audiences. \"So much of what's driving the rapid change in our industry is about technology, not creativity. The television landscape is increasingly defined by what will deliver the biggest profits for companies, not the best programmes for audiences,\" she told an audience in London. \"I worry that the insatiable greed for data-gathering is actually serving the wrong master. That entire businesses are focused on what they can take from audiences, instead of what they can give back.\" It is the most brutal swipe yet in a sustained attack from the BBC on America's big tech companies. The corporation is worried that the global TV market could be dominated by a small handful of companies, who do not have the same public service remit of the BBC. It wants the government to step in and regulate these firms to level the playing field.[2] The broadcaster is funded by the British public and has a duty to air TV shows that appeal to audiences of all backgrounds, as well as foster new talent and empower the UK's 2.7 billion ($3.6 billion) production sector. Moore is in charge of all the BBC's TV output, and the shows she commissions travel around the world. Shows like \"Blue Planet II,\" \"Doctor Who,\" and \"Top Gear.\" Moore argued that while the BBC's funding for content is shrinking, Amazon and Netflix are growing in power. And she doesn't think that's helpful for the British TV industry. \"Netflix's current budget for programmes is $8 billion. Amazon's is $5 billion. But their investment into new UK programmes is only around 150 million a year. Less than 10% of their catalogues is made up of content produced in the UK,\" said Moore, who was delivering the Steve Hewlett Memorial Lecture. \"In a world of incredible, unprecedented choice, the irony is that British audiences may find it harder and harder to choose the stories that matter to them most.\" Netflix declined to comment. The company only uses the data it collects on viewing habits to inform it commissioning decisions. It also has a healthy relationship with the UK's top broadcasters, coproducing and financing programming. It's why hit BBC1 drama \"Bodyguard\" is being beamed to viewers across the world on Netflix.[3] Amazon did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.NOW WATCH: Watch Apple unveil the new iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max[4]See Also: Tech stocks are getting slammed in premarket trading as the bloodbath gets serious[5]Tech gets demolished: The 5 hottest tech stocks just lost $172 billion in market value[6]Walmart has been worried about Amazon since before 2003 and it's a lesson for every business leader, says former board member John Chambers[7] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/speeches/2018/charlotte-moore-steve-hewlett?ns_linkname=corporate...mchannel=social...campaign=bbc_press_office...source=twitter\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/speeches/2018/charlotte-moore-steve-hewlett?ns_linkname=corporate...mchannel=social...campaign=bbc_press_office...source=twitter</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/16/tony-hall-regulate-video-streaming-services-or-risk-killing-off-uk-content\">https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/16/tony-hall-regulate-video-streaming-services-or-risk-killing-off-uk-content</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45579665\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-45579665</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-new-iphone-xr-xs-max-september-2018-9?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-new-iphone-xr-xs-max-september-2018-9?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apple-amazon-netflix-and-google-premarket-trading-2018-10?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apple-amazon-netflix-and-google-premarket-trading-2018-10?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/shares-of-apple-facebook-google-netflix-and-amazon-lost-172-billion-market-value-2018-10?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/shares-of-apple-facebook-google-netflix-and-amazon-lost-172-billion-market-value-2018-10?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-has-been-worried-about-amazon-since-before-2003-2018-10?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner\">https://www.businessinsider.com/walmart-has-been-worried-about-amazon-since-before-2003-2018-10?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BZIN1056451539342044850251762500129</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BZIN-5352</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TG7-G9N1-JCMN-Y419-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Insider</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 12, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

His talk was full of praise for America, as well as for European values. He called for cooperation between the US and Europe on developing new tech like AI. </p><p>His speech then turned to China, which he called a repressive regime that spies on its citizens. And he railed against Chinese telecom giant Huawei, too \u2014 which, incidentally, had a sizable presence at the event. Some in the crowd did not seem pleased, with someone in the back of the room yelling out Edward Snowden's name and receiving a burst of applause. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] LISBON, Portugal \u2014 Michael Kratsios, the chief technology officer of the United States and one of President Donald Trump's top tech advisors, spoke at one of Europe's largest tech conferences to a crowd that was baffled, and at times annoyed, at the content of the talk. Kratsios, who is not a technologist[2] but did work as a venture capitalist under Trump supporter Peter Thiel, gave a politically-charged talk at the Web Summit in Lisbon on Thursday. He began by talking about shared cultural values between the US and Europe, making several references to the notion of American exceptionalism to a crowd of Europeans. \"America succeeds because people have an unparalleled freedom to chase their dreams and pursue excellence,\" he said at one point. At another, he said that America had \"an unrivaled economic system.\" He even gave America kudos for \"quantum supremacy,\" an apparent reference to a technological achievement made by Google[3]. He also expressed his disdain for the notion of increased regulations on the tech industry, calling them \"innovation killing.\" A common theme of Kratsios' remarks: The US and Europe have similar values, he said, which is all the more reason for them to cooperate on on cutting-edge new technologies like artificial intelligence. But then, the talk took a dark turn, when Kratsios began to warn about \"repressive regimes that don't share our same values.\" He called out one, and only one, such regime by name: China. \"The Chinese government has built an advanced authoritarian state by twisting technology to put censorship over free expression and citizen control over empowerment,\" he said. To that point, Kratsios named one and one company: Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that has clashed with the Trump administration since it was banned from doing business with American companies in May. \"And in no case is this more clear than with Huawei. Chinese law compels all Chinese companies, including Huawei, to cooperate with its intelligence and its security services no matter where the company operates,\" he said. Huawei has denied such allegations.[4] The awkward thing about delivering such a speech to this crowd was that Huawei was also an invited guest at Web Summit. Guo Peng, rotating chairman of Huawei[5], was a featured guest who gave a keynote speech on the power of 5G wireless internet. Other Huawei employees gave half a dozen talks of their own, and the company had a booth at Web Summit and did product demos during the event. The reception to Kratsios' remarks was decidedly chilly. At one point, someone in the back of the event room shouted out the name of Edward Snowden, the famous leaker \u2014 prompting the one and only burst of applause during his time on stage. Snowden has accused the US of spying on its citizens, too. And, ironically enough, he was also a star speaker at Web Summit[6]. He live-streamed his appearance from his home in Russia right before the Huawei's president gave his talk. Kratsios full talk can be seen via Web Summit Day 3 YouTube video at 2:35:08.[7]NOW WATCH: Most maps of Louisiana aren't entirely right.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made his second appearance before the US House Committee yesterday. While the first hearing failed to grill Zuckerberg, members of the House Energy Committee seemed more information about Facebook's business model. Key Point: Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that even his own personal data was exposed to Cambridge Analytica. This led to a meme that Zuckerberg is just one among us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zuckerberg's testimony should come a wake up call for tech companies especially when it comes to handling user data. At the hearing, Zuckerberg dodged a number of questions and most often replied with company's AI efforts to tackle critical issues. He also seemed uncomfortable to admit whether the privacy settings and terms of services will be simplified in the future. Few senators made it clear that they plan to regulate big tech companies similar to media companies and it has a potential to hurt their business model. The last important thing to watch is whether Facebook follows up with the promises its CEO made during the two days of hearing that saw Zuckerberg seated on the hot seat for nearly 10 hours.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg can breathe a sigh of relief mainly for coming out unscathed from these hearings. But if you want to know what happened in tech beyond Facebook then we have you covered. Here is a rundown of all the major tech stories:</p><p>OnePlus is at it again. The Chinese smartphone maker has teased its upcoming flagship, OnePlus 6 by placing it on top of OnePlus 5T. The teaser reveals that OnePlus 6 will feature a repositioned Alert Slider button that will offer dual functionality of acting as focus slider as well. The smartphone is also expected to slimmer than its predecessor but retains the antenna lines at the top and bottom edges.</p><p>Apart from that minor design tweak, it will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC coupled with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. There are also rumors of OnePlus launching a limited edition Avengers version as well. As it has been a tradition every passing year, the OnePlus 6 will cost more than its predecessor.</p><p>Lenovo has announced the launch of its 2018 ThinkPad lineup in India. The new ThinkPads were first showcased at CES 2018 and includes models like the 6th generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon, ThinkPad X1 Yoga, ThinkPad X series, ThinkPad T series and ThinkPad L series.</p><p>The new sixth generation X1 Carbon is the flaghsip device here with a true to roots ThinkPad design and latest 8th generation Intel Core processors. The notebook also comes with new features like ThinkShutter, which allows users to disable the webcam by using a mechanical shutter button. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon starts from Rs 1,21,000 while the X1 Yoga starts from Rs 1,26,000.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Note series differed from Galaxy S series primary in terms of battery capacity and support for S Pen stylus. However, with the launch of Galaxy Note 5, Samsung has blurred that line to S Pen stylus alone since it moved back to a smaller battery design. That could change once again with the launch of Galaxy Note 9 later this year.</p><p>A new report states that Galaxy Note 9 might house a larger 4,000mAh battery, which is considerably bigger than the 3,300mAh battery found on Galaxy Note 8 and 3,500mAh battery found under the hood of Galaxy S9+. It is too early to talk about the Galaxy Note 9 so take this with a grain of salt but it will always be nice to have a massive battery especially on a premium device like the Galaxy Note series.</p><p>Let's admit, nobody does software updates quite like Nokia-licensee HMD Global. The Finnish company has released Android 8.1 Oreo update for Nokia 6 (2018) and Nokia 7 plus. These smartphones first announced for global markets at MWC 2018 and were introduced in India last week.</p><p>According to reports, the update weighs 590.2MB for the Nokia 7 Plus and around 802MB for the Nokia 6 (2018). Nokia 6 (2018) and Nokia 7 plus are part of Android One program. The Nokia 6 (2018) is now available through online and offline retail channels while Nokia 7 plus preorders begin from April 20.</p><p>Google is planning a major redesign for its email service, Gmail. The search giant is planning to bring material design template to its email service along with a streamlined access to Google Calendar. It will also include features that are prominently accessible on Inbox.</p><p>The redesigned platform will be available in the coming weeks as an early access program for G Suite customers and personal account users. This will come along with a planned change arriving as part of Material Design 2.</p><p>Reliance Jio might help Qualcomm kickstart its 'Always Connected PC' effort in India. The telecom service provider has held talks with US-based chipmaker to launch always connected PC with connectivity capability built-in.</p><p>The devices are expected to use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 SoC but it is not clear whether Reliance Jio will build its own computers or offer Windows OEM devices as part of network partnership. The launch of always connected PCs from Jio could bring fresh lease of life to PC market.</p><p>Thanks for reading. Stay tuned for more from the world of technology</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGRIND-0039318477</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGRIND2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3B-H5W1-JB5M-W112-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404835</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 India.com, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BGR India</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 12, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0009A96</classCode><className>LENOVO GROUP LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000D3XE</classCode><className>SAMSUNG GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>0992 (HKSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>QCOM (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>INTC (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D17D</classCode><className>NEWS BRIEFS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000781</classCode><className>GENERATION X</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N334413MK</classCode><className>SEMICONDUCTOR MFG</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000CYWJ</classCode><className>SMARTPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp;

He recently presented on VR in China at the Silicon Valley Virtual Reality convention in San Jose, California, where he talked about what's happening with virtual reality in China, his bets on the region, and why the US and China need each other in our new reality. This is an edited transcription of his presentation.A quick history of VR in China The VR boom starts in China roughly around Q3 2016. The\u00a0VR\u00a0companies and\u00a0VR\u00a0revolution in China are actually happening in some kind of pattern. For example, in Q3 2016, the start of\u00a0VR\u00a0in China, there are a number of companies from\u00a0Shenzhen\u00a0that manufactured cardboard like products and ship it worldwide. </p><p>When we come to Q4 in 2016, there are a lot of VR headset makers trying to understand\u00a0what's\u00a0happening with the Oculus SDK2 and they're trying to ship a similar product. Between Q1 and Q2 of 2016 in China, 360 video became extremely hot in China. It's the hottest sector for startups and for public companies to make investments in. In Q3, a lot of companies are working on some kind of VR content, and in Q4, a lot of companies are switching from the content creation space to the B2B solution space. Today, we are looking at fully booming VR ecosystem in China.Why mass adoption will happen in China first We talk a lot about how\u00a0Chinese\u00a0companies are copying business models in the US, but more and more, we talk more about copy by\u00a0the US instead of copy by\u00a0China. I try to learn a lot about US model innovation in China, so during my last trip to China, I actually visited 20+ cities. You can't always stay in Tier 1 cities. Sometimes, you need to go to Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities, or even some rural areas, to really understand what is the situation \u2014 who are the customers, and what they do. Also read: China on its 3rd Phase - Stewards of culture, or sleight of hand?[1] They put the whole\u00a0VR\u00a0solution in this truck. They drive this truck to the rural areas in China. They offer the villagers in these rural areas \u2014 people who have never heard about\u00a0VR, who have never tried\u00a0a VR\u00a0experience \u2014 they charge them 50 to 100\u00a0RMB (US$7.25 to 14.50) so that they can have their once in a lifetime\u00a0VR\u00a0experience. This type of experience to us is OK, but to them, it's awesome. They all get so excited to try it, even though it's not cheap for them. When I show this picture, a lot of people say 'this type of business model is not very sustainable,' but the reality is, if you have to question it, you're\u00a0underestimating\u00a0the population in China.VR Arcades in China will be the main driver for adoptionAt this point, there are over 10,000\u00a0VR\u00a0arcades in China. One of the counterintuitive facts here is that 60\u00a0per cent of customers are actually female customers. Over 70\u00a0per centof arcades are operating at a loss at this point. The worse thing is no industry standard has been established. Business leaders are working very hard to set up the industry standard. We're actually\u00a0working\u00a0with a few of the top companies in the\u00a0VR\u00a0arcade space to talk about how we can set up a dedicated distribution channel to import some high-quality foreign content to distribute to\u00a0VR\u00a0arcades in China. That's\u00a0why I think\u00a0it's\u00a0still a great opportunity, although from the data, it doesn't look very good. The biggest challenge for the industry is not that we don't have a big enough installation base. Right now, we have 5 million plus headsets out there. That's not a big number, but at the same time, that's not a small number. The biggest problem at this point is that there are no real\u00a0VR\u00a0users.\u00a0 For me, I have all the toys at home, but I\u00a0don't\u00a0spend a long time in\u00a0VR\u00a0every day. By the end of the year, there could be a group of people who actually spend two to three\u00a0hours in\u00a0VR\u00a0every day. These types of people will be the true\u00a0VR\u00a0users, will be the real\u00a0VR\u00a0users \u2014 and\u00a0that's\u00a0going to give a lot of hope to the industry. The the first group of adopters for virtual reality, most likely in China, is going to come from the\u00a0VR\u00a0arcades.\u00a0Culture mattersWe all know that at the end of the day, China will be the biggest market. At this point, only a few people are aware that right now, VR has actually been adopted faster in China, and most likely, adoption is going to happen faster in China than the US. To understand this, you need to have a pretty good understanding of the social structure, the culture, and people's entire way up there. Over the years I've\u00a0formed a thesis. Number one, when we look at who is driving the ecosystem, in the US its Facebook, Google, Apple all the big tech companies. In China, we not only have\u00a0Alibaba,\u00a0Tencent,\u00a0Baidu,\u00a0Huawei,\u00a0Xiaomi - these kinds of leading tech companies - we also have the government. The most important driver is that China is a government led society and right now, the\u00a0Chinese\u00a0government\u00a0is pushing virtual reality. They are trying to push the adoption of this technology and stimulate the ecosystem so that it happens faster. Secondly, if we look at the equation from the consumer side, consumers in the US have a different\u00a0mindset compared\u00a0to consumers in China. In the US,\u00a0people find that new technology is not often times good. It's not super easy to use, it's not very affordable, so it's not adopted. They say 'hey, let's wait until its good enough.' But in China, people are not happy with what they have today.\u00a0They have a more adapting mindset. If something is slightly better, most likely they're waiting to try it and they are waiting to use it. There's a huge difference between the consumer mindset. Also, the infrastructure for\u00a0VR\u00a0is different. China is a purely mobile first market and the biggest mobile market. Mass consumer adoption of\u00a0VR\u00a0is going to happen with mobile\u00a0VR. China will definitely have a unique advantage in that case. It's pretty clear to us the US is driving technology in\u00a0the VR/AR\u00a0space, but in terms of consumer adoption, China is leading.What he would tell VR AR companies and investorsIf we look at how the PC, internet, and mobile were adopted, we see the US had their own ecosystem, and then China started catching up. But for\u00a0the VR AR\u00a0industry, the situation is going to be different. It's going to be a globalised adoption of\u00a0VR\u00a0and AR. The ecosystem is going to be global. So again, the US will be driving technology and China will be driving adoption.\u00a0The speed of the circle is going to depend on how much capital is injected into this sector. It doesn't make sense when you go out and just talk about product-market fit. It\u00a0doesn't\u00a0make sense when you talk about go to market strategy because the\u00a0VR\u00a0market at this point is so small that\u00a0it's\u00a0kind of meaningless to talk about. What's\u00a0more important is to\u00a0understand\u00a0which market is going to happen faster, and which market is going to be bigger. In the traditional\u00a0start-up\u00a0financing model in the US, we know that\u00a0it's\u00a0super hard for any startup to break into a foreign market. They've all been a bit big \u2014 Series B, Series C type companies \u2014 so they have enough resources and bandwidth to think about going into a foreign market. But we think that\u00a0it's\u00a0really critical for\u00a0VR/AR\u00a0companies to build an early presence in China to get awareness for\u00a0what's\u00a0going on. We're saying, 'Hey, you need to evaluate your business from day 1. You have to understand\u00a0what's\u00a0going on. You have to know who are your peers. You need to be sensitive and have an awareness of the opportunity, and do something if you have what it takes to connect the dots.' Also read: China's virtual reality investment is moving from hardware to content[2] Right now, the industry is facing a bigger challenge. What we really need is something that can bring the China\u00a0VR\u00a0community and the US\u00a0VR\u00a0community together. I'd like to leave this as an open question to you guys and would like to talk to anyone that has any ideas.VR education will put headsets in more households There are many differences in the education system in the US vs China. In the US, it's more distributed, but in China,\u00a0it's\u00a0more centralised. At the center of the system is the government.\u00a0It's\u00a0always easier for any new technology to penetrate into a centralised system rather than a distributed system. The other thing is there are more students in China than anywhere else in the world, but another reality is that Chinese\u00a0parents care a lot about their kids' education, and they are willing to spend money. On average, a\u00a0Chinese\u00a0household is spending 20\u00a0per cent of their household income on their kid's education. In the US, that number is less than 5 per cent. It's not only a big market;\u00a0it's\u00a0going to drive adoption very quickly. It's\u00a0very likely that the mass-market adoption of\u00a0VR\u00a0is going to happen with the\u00a0VR\u00a0education market in China. For the parents, if they say, 'My kid's friend - they all have\u00a0VR\u00a0headsets in their homes, but my kid doesn't have a\u00a0VR\u00a0headset in my home, so\u00a0I've\u00a0got to buy one. No matter whether\u00a0it's\u00a0effective or not, I can't let my kid fall behind.'\u00a0It's\u00a0a great way to introduce\u00a0VR\u00a0headsets to the families in China.Right now, the US is the center of tech innovation. In a couple years, that's all going to changeThere are different ways it can happen. It could be technology\u00a0IP, it could be content IP, it could be the content\u00a0itself,\u00a0or it could be some kind of software partner. Even if we can stick to the next steps, due to inflation\u00a0and strong regulations, it's harder and harder for\u00a0Chinese\u00a0money to leave China. China is going to attract more talent from the US to move to China to boost the local\u00a0high-tech\u00a0scene in China.\u00a0It's\u00a0not only about content, technology IP, content\u00a0IP, software\u00a0IP - it's\u00a0also about talent. That will be the flow. Top talent in the industry will go from the US to China. They are working in the Chinese\u00a0VR\u00a0ecosystem. They are delivering\u00a0high-quality\u00a0stuff to the China market\u00a0first. In China, we're at a stage where all the platforms have been set up, all the distribution channels have been set up, and the frame of the ecosystem has been built up. But in terms of quality of the content, the quality of the software It's not really there yet. Also read: 5 virtual reality trends to watch in the next 5 years[3] The leading technology and the leading content [in the US].These guys don't have a market to go to. They have the key stuff but they can't commercialise it. But for these guys [Chinese companies], they have all the channels to commercialise, they have the market ready, but they don't have the high-quality content. There are a lot of innovative models happening in the\u00a0Chinese\u00a0market, as well.\u00a0It's not only about the market size; it's not only about the platforms, but also new business models can be explored. For these new business models, some make sense for\u00a0the US\u00a0market. For those, it will be a copy\u00a0to\u00a0the US\u00a0procedure, and people in\u00a0the US\u00a0are going to learn\u00a0what's\u00a0going to happen in China, and they're going to fight to create this similar market base in the US as well.

When I met him in Brussels recently, Buttarelli checked off the barriers to entry for a startup: It needs to first outbid the likes of Amazon.com Inc., Facebookand others for engineering talent; then sell its product through an app store probably run by Googleor Apple Inc.; and finally compete against big players with established networks and huge cash piles. And even it clears all these hurdles, it\u2019s still vulnerable to being taken out.</p><p> There\u2019s a connection between this dominance of Big Tech - which is proven by the decline in venture-capital financing for upstarts, as my colleague Noah Smith has written - and harm to consumers. The EU view is that the \u201cfree\u201d price tag of social media and apps is no t a public good if it\u2019s underpinned by a business model that hoovers up data from users without consent. And if the profits from that are spent on blocking competition, there\u2019s less chance of a market-based alternative. Googleand Facebookrebut this view, insisting that a disruptive rival could unseat them anytime. But regulators have given up waiting for one.</p><p> The recipe for fixing things, according to Buttarelli, is threefold. He wants more competition through antitrust enforcement, more data protection through GDPR, and more fairness and transparency for customers from the tech giants themselves.</p><p> None of this would destroy Facebookor Google. GDPR is estimated to have inflicted a negative impact of 2 to 3 percent on the two companies\u2019 total ad revenues, according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post. The running total of EU antitrust fines against Googleis about 6.7 billion euros ($7.5 billion), while the company\u2019s yearly sales are more than $100 billion. Still, Eric Leandri, co-founder of French search engine Qwant, says he\u2019s confident that recent fines against Googleon competition and data-privacy grounds - which the U.S. firm is appealing - will have had a chilling impact.</p><p> Defenders of the Silicon Valley faith will grumble about mission creep in Brussels. It\u2019s certainly true that regulators need to be careful not to muddy the waters with inconsistent or unclear regulation. The recent German competition ruling against Facebookuses data privacy as its main argument, but without a prior ruling on GDPR infringement. That\u2019s a potential problem because it\u2019s hard to separate the need to enforce user privacy with the need to safeguard competition. Indeed, both things might be in conflict one day, says Ariel Ezrachi, a competition specialist at Oxford University. Imagine the right to keep your data private under one law alongside the need to share your data in a competitive market under another.</p><p> Another thing not covered in Buttarelli\u2019s plan is where investment comes from. It was no surprise when Sweden\u2019s music-streaming giant Spotify Technology SA decided to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange last year. If Europe fails to unify its fragmented capital markets, especially after Brexit, the fruits of Buttarelli\u2019s labor will end up in America regardless.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-4023819</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289A38EA1BA48B NWBKPA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VG5-PBP1-JBCN-40Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"583\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Record Herald<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The group, which included economists, government officials, journalists, NGO workers and private sector folks from over a dozen countries, were visiting as part of a US government sponsored economic co-operation programme (here, let me stop and say thank you to all the public servants in the Swamp who continue to try and do this sort of diplomacy, given the current environment).</p><p>At one point, I asked the group what they considered to be the most under-reported story by American media. The consensus: how China is filling the diplomatic and economic vacuum created by America in places like Africa, eastern Europe, south-east Asia, and so on. They shared a variety of fascinating examples, from ports built by the Chinese (who will seize property if debts aren\u2019t paid) to vocational training offered by Beijing. But the most important influence was around the rollout of Chinese equipment and standards in 5G \u2014 several participants had stories about how China\u2019s technology was being adopted in their own countries.</p><p>As Swampians know, I have been writing about\u00a0 decoupling for some time, and was one of the first to bet that the US and China would create\u00a0 separate technology ecosystems. Every day brings a new beat in that story \u2014 witness national security adviser Robert C. O\u2019Brien\u2019s recent comment that Huawei has the ability to retrieve sensitive information in the next-generation wireless services it is building for countries in Asia, Europe and elsewhere. The idea is that such \u201cback-doors\u201d could present security risks for US allies (Huawei is already banned from use by US government agencies and contractors). </p><p>We\u2019ve seen President Trump \u201capoplectic\u201d after Boris Johnson opted to use Huawei equipment in the UK, and heard him call for the US to take stakes in Nokia and Ericsson to combat the Chinese telecom advance. The fact that the market blew this off confirms what I have heard in recent weeks from very high level European sources, which is that it would be nearly impossible, at least in a cost effective way, to ban Huawei in Europe because the company is already so deeply embedded in 2-, 3- and 4G, on which many 5G systems will be built.</p><p>There was also a less covered, but perhaps more important news event last week \u2014 the Department of Justice challenge to the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s antitrust ruling against\u00a0 Qualcomm, which it had accused of violating patent rules. In an extremely unusual move, the DoJ showed up and argued that the ruling against Qualcomm would hurt national security (the implication being that the San Diego chipmaker should be America\u2019s national champion in the 5G fight). I spoke to someone who had been in the courtroom, who told me that the line of questioning and the tenor of the hearing seemed to support the DoJ point of view, and that the FTC didn\u2019t even send a senior official (its side of the case was argued by a Stanford law professor).</p><p>As Swampians will know, there\u2019s always been a bit of a battle within the Trump administration between the economic nationalists and the pro-business pragmatists. The president seems to favour whichever side works for him at any given moment. </p><p>But I suspect that the coronavirus may end up being a tipping point in the decoupling process \u2014 companies that may have been on the fence about China could start moving their supply chains elsewhere, speeding up the decoupling process. Meanwhile, the Chinese, who feel cornered over their handling of the virus, will have even more reason to hunker down and build out their own tech ecosystem.</p><p>Ed, one thing I\u2019m curious to know more about is what the Democratic frontrunners think about decoupling, and whether they, too, would see big US tech firms as strategic resources to leverage in the national interests (I hear that a cadre of Republicans are trying to tie the continuation of legal loopholes like CDA230, which allows platform firms to avoid liability for what users say or do online, to their willingness to respond to certain types of government requests for security related information. These are the sort of request that Apple, for example, has been unwilling to comply with). Any intelligence there? I think the answers will matter not only for security, but for tech stock prices.</p><p>Recommended reading</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>I must be getting older, because I am finding more things on the WSJ op-ed page that I actually agree with \u2014 this piece by Vivek Ramaswamy on the risk that\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-stakeholders-vs-the-people-11581552372\"> stakeholder capitalism</url> could actually expand corporate power is worth reading.

The truth is that Big Tech regulation has receded as an issue in the Democratic debate, notwithstanding Elizabeth Warren's detailed attempts to rethink what constitutes monopoly abuse. I've been to several of her rallies recently (in Iowa and New Hampshire), in which the topic did not arise either in her speech or during questions. I don't think I've heard the word \"Huawei\u201d once. Part of the reason for this is Trump's aggressive stance on China, which has taken much of the winds out of Democratic sails. They criticise Trump's methods but not his objective. Part of it is also the successful counter-lobbying of the big Silicon Valley companies. </p><p>The more you hear the word China, the more relaxed Silicon Valley feels about heading off the spectre of antitrust action. It's worth keeping a close eye on Facebook in the build up to the election. Mark Zuckerberg has quietly cultivated Trump and it seems to be working. Zuckerberg continues to refuse to monitor the content of political ads. That's good news for the purveyors of deepfakery whom I fear are going to have a field day.\u00a0</p><p>Your feedback</p><p>We\u2019d love to hear from you.

In the run-up to the GDPR, we called out many of the problems[1] with the regulation which, while well-intended, did not seem to deal well with the nature of the internet, speech, or what privacy actually means. In the year since, we've[2] posted[3] numerous[4] stories[5] highlighting[6] the negative[7] consequences[8] of this poorly considered law. Whenever we do that, however, many of the law's defenders insist that these unintended consequences are a small price to pay for either protecting our privacy or reining in the internet giants. </p><p>So, it does seem worth investigating whether or not the GDPR has done either of those things. And, so far, the evidence is sorely lacking. Indeed, on the question of dominance, we pointed out late last year that the early returns suggested that the GDPR had only made Google more dominant[9], which hardly seems like a way to punish the company. And now that we have more results, it seems more and more people are realizing that the GDPR has been an utter failure. As CNBC notes in its evaluation of the law[10], it's hard to see how the GDPR has resulted in any benefits to the public. Instead, it's just created a big mess:...one year later, GDPR hasn't lived up to its potential. Among some consumers, GDPR is perhaps best known as a bothersome series of rapid-fire, pop-up privacy notices. Those astronomical fines have failed to materialize. The law has created new bureaucracies within corporations, and with those, tension and confusion. And it's unclear if the EU data authority that oversees the law is adequately staffed to handle its demands.In short, from the user side especially, all the GDPR has done is made people constantly need to click on annoying privacy and cookie notices that they don't read and don't find useful at all. This shouldn't have been a surprise. We've pointed out for many years[11] that the entire concept of a privacy policy is backwards. It creates a situation where no one actually reads it, and it doesn't do much to protect anyone's privacy. I head someone recently note that they should really be called \"data exploitation policies,\" and that, at least, would be a bit more accurate. But still wouldn't get anyone to read them or better protect anyone's privacy. And, as Politico has pointed out, it appears that not only has the GDPR made the big tech companies more dominant, it's now laid out the rules of the road[12] by which they can introduce even more privacy-destroying offerings:New forms of data collection, including Facebook's reintroduction of its facial recognition technology in Europe and Google's efforts to harvest information on third-party websites, have been given new leases on life under Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. Smaller firms \u2014 whose fortunes were of special concern to the framers of the region's privacy revamp \u2014 also have suffered from the relatively high compliance costs and the perception, at least among some investors, that they can't compete with Silicon Valley's biggest names. 'Big companies like Facebook are 10 steps ahead of everyone else, and 100 steps ahead of regulators,' declared Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a privacy expert who helped uncover Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. 'There are very big questions about what they're doing.'This entire approach is backwards and silly. If we want to have better control over our privacy we're not going to do it through demanding better privacy policies, or confusing data protection laws. We need to create the incentives to put the actual control of the data back into the hands of the users. And that doesn't just mean a right to download your info. It means that you have full control over your data and get to control what apps and services can access it and for what reasons. That's not the world we have today, and nothing in the GDPR gets us any closer to it. And the answer is not \"more enforcement.\" That just locks in the big companies even more and continues to present the roadmap to \"follow\" the rules, or to work the refs. Instead, if we moved to a system of protocols instead of platforms[13] we could decouple the data from the service, putting real control of the data back in the hands of end users. Then things like privacy policies and GDPR enforces wouldn't matter so much, because we'd have direct control over our data. Instead, all we have is a massive law that has harmed startups, entrentched big companies, failed to protect privacy and just served to annoy most users[14].The reality is that many people, in order to save time, simply click 'OK' on the never-ending stream of pop-ups and most everyone I spoke to confess that they just move on when unable to access the desired website. Or, as one Twitter user told expressed, 'I read a lot fewer articles in US papers/magazines.'And, sure, there have been a few fines of internet companies, but as recent GDPR complaints[15] show, there does not appear to be any way to actually fully comply with the GDPR, which makes it a particularly useless law. If you can't actually comply, if it's not actually protecting privacy, and it's just annoying users and creating more bureaucracy, what good is it? Meanwhile, Alec Stapp has collected a ton of stories and examples[16] of the GDPR's negative impact. It notes much of the stuff above, but also highlights just how damaging it's been to innovation on the whole: Startups: One study estimated that venture capital invested in EU startups fell by as much as 50 percent due to GDPR implementation. (NBER[17])Mergers and acquisitions: '55% of respondents said they had worked on deals that fell apart because of concerns about a target company's data protection policies and compliance with GDPR' (WSJ[18])Scientific research: '[B]iomedical researchers fear that the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will make it harder to share information across borders or outside their original research context.' (POLITICO[19])So now that we've had a year, can we admit that the GDPR has been a total failure by almost every possible measure? Supporters of the law will say to give it more time, or to say we need to \"improve\" the rules, but it should be obvious by now that the entire approach is the problem, not the implementation.Permalink[20] | Comments[21] | Email This Story[22] [ 1]: <url

There was just one catch: None of it was true. The scam ads used photos of nearly every U.S. governor   and sometimes President Donald Trump   to claim that with new, lucrative tax incentives, people might actually make money by installing solar technology on their homes. Facebook users only needed to enter their addresses, email, utility information and phone number to find out more. </p><p>Those incentives don t exist. While the ads didn t aim to bilk people of money directly   and it wasn t possible to buy solar panels through these ads   they led to websites that harvested personal information that could be used to expose respondents to future come-ons, legitimate and not. It s not clear that the data was actually used in such a manner. Facebook apparently didn t take action until notified by state government officials who noticed the ads. The fictitious notices reveal how easily scammers can pelt internet users with misinformation for months, undetected. They also raise questions about whether big tech companies such as Facebook are capable of policing misleading ads, especially as the 2020 elections   and the prospect of another onslaught of online misinformation   loom.  This is definitely concerning; definitely, it s misinformation,  said Young Mie Kim, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studied 5 million Facebook ads during the 2016 elections.  I keep telling people: We don t have any basis to regulate such a thing.  Experts say websites and apps need to be more transparent about the ads that run on their platforms. Last year, Facebook launched a searchable database that provides details on the political ads it runs, including who bought them, and the age and gender of the audience. But it doesn t make that information available for other ads. Twitter offers a database of ads and promoted tweets. Google has an archive for political ads only. The partial approaches allow misleading ads to fester. One problem is that ads can be targeted so narrowly, journalists and watchdog groups often don t see them.  That allows people to do more dirty tricks,  said Ian Vanderwalker, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice s Democracy Program. In mid-March, some websites linked in the fake ads for solar energy disappeared. After complaints from governors  offices, Facebook inactivated nearly all the ads and several pages affiliated with them.  These scammy ads have no place on Facebook,  company spokeswoman Devon Kearns said in a statement.  We removed these pages and disabled these ad accounts recently and will continue to take action.  Facebook says it uses an automated process to review the images, text, targeting and position of ads posted to its site. In some cases, employees review the ads. Users can also give feedback if they believe the ads violate company policies. Governors  offices were alarmed to see photos of top politicians alongside claims such as  you can get paid to go solar.  Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, said she notified Facebook last month after staffers saw them. Facebook took them down days later, although some continued to reappear days after that complaint. Facebook also yanked ads featuring images of governors in Texas, Illinois, Colorado, Arizona, South Carolina and other states. But the ads had already been running for some time. After researching solar panel options for his two-story home in Mount Tabor, N.J., 37-year-old Chris Fitzpatrick saw an ad claiming he might qualify for  free  solar panels because Gov. Phil Murphy planned to release  $100 million solar incentives.  He was skeptical because none of the solar companies he worked with mentioned such incentives, but he worried others might not be.  It s very frustrating because it preys upon innocent people,  Fitzpatrick said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN65896750</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT7-YYF1-DYRV-41XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"660\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Ministers heading different ministries have spoken of this need with fervour and determination.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rightly so, as Malaysia does not want to lack far behind in this spurt towards new technology such as the use of artificial intelligence in many important fields, including the use of sophisticated technology in medical diagnostics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Education Ministry has announced the need to relook at the TVET ( Technical and Vocational Education Training ) programme so as to make it more relevant to current innovative industrial demands. But before the wheels churn too fast and far, should we not take 5 to reflect?</p><p>With this rush to obey the imperatives of the 4.0 tech revolution, what would happen to the Humanities (History, Literature, Philosophy, etc) and to the related disciplines of Sociology, Anthropology, to name just two disciplines from the Social Sciences? Would they be given much less attention, or worse, sidelined?</p><p>For me, who has taught Literature for decades and is still enjoying reading and discussing literary works, such a prospect is both frightening and tragic.</p><p>Writing in Hindustani Times (September 16, 2018 ), Vivek Wadhwa, Distiguished Fellow at Harvard Law School and the Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley, reminds us that \"tackling today's biggest societal and technological challenges requires the ability to think critically about their human context, which is something that humanities graduates happen to be best trained to do\". It may surprise some of us to know that key figures heading major technological companies are just this kind of Humanities graduates. Jack Ma graduated with a BA in English; YouTube's CEO, Susan Wojciki, majored in Literature and History and Linkedin's founder, Brian Chesky, has an MA in Philosophy. These are the top brass, you may say. But today the Fordist mode of production which prioritises near passive workers on the factory floor, has given way, or, must give way to innovative, exploratory workers at all levels, workers who can think critically, if a company wants to retain a competitive edge.</p><p>Some of us may recall, with chuckles, the factory floor worker Charlie Chaplin plays in the silent film, Modern Times. This longsuffering fellow had become so \"mechanised\" in repetitive tightening of round nuts and bolts that when his shift is over, he cannot help but take out his spanner to \"tighten\" the round buttons on a lady's blouse! Today, industry wants thinking workers at all levels but will an education merely limited to tech and engineering yield critical and creative thinking? To quote again from Vivek Wadhwa, \"An engineering degree is valuable, but the sense of empathy that comes from music, arts, literature, psychology, etc provides a big advantage in design\". In fact, the more sophisticated 4.0 technology becomes, whether in artificial intelligence, advanced sensors, nano-tech and so on, the more people should be trained to think imaginatively, ethically and with an openness to multicultural sensitivities. For centuries, the Humanities have had an excellent track record for teaching such essentials.</p><p>Literature contributes to the widening of the imagination as well as the enriching of sensibilities, two areas which any tech designer must surely value. A good novel or short story explores the complexity of human identity. We are all, without exception, coloured by race, religion, culture, gender and sexual preferences. Memorable literary works reveal how these interwoven layers that make up an identity, both challenge and enrich each individual. If you are a tech designer ( whether of the most advanced I Phone or some other hi-tech device ), you had better know how complex and fascinatingly different people are. Statistical data is crucial to market research but it will not tell you enough about the human context. I suppose that before any tech product goes to the engineering department, many meetings on statistics would be held but will statistics alone answer deeper questions about cultural and emotional propensities in a certain market, whether in China, Southeast Asia or elsewhere? Literature and the Humanities will give us the ability to think empathetically, not for Good Samaritan reasons ( no business can be overly generous or compassionate ) but for good economic and business sense. It is certainly not enough to conclude as bluntly as the portentous businessman, Mr Birling, in J.B. Priestley's play, An Inspector Calls did,that all one needs to do is \"to keep costs low and profits high\". One may not get the profits one wants without a certain understanding of how complex human beings are and how crucial some respect for history can be in business.</p><p>The study of History, a key Humanities discipline, is not mere excavation of tombs and hieroglyphics ( though we can and have learnt a lot from these over the years ), but it is training in the ability to see how the past, including the recent past, impinges on the present. Surely, any company about to launch into a big tech business in a country would need to hire some experts, who are very knowledgeable about the past of that country, in order to evaluate how these legacies of the past can impinge on the present and even the future. No company can afford to ignore this time trajectory.</p><p>Of course, no man or woman has the God-like ability to predict the future but the critical mind which can hold in symbiotic connection past, present and future is essential to many business ventures, technological or otherwise. This kind of reflective critical thinking is best acquired from a Humanities education. Pure tech and business graduates can work together with Humanities graduates to sharpen the competitive edge of a company.</p><p>Recently, I have been drawn to the elegant writings of a number of medical specialists. Here I mention only two of them. In The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer, Dr Siddhartha Muhkerjee, in a riveting book replete with quotes from Shakespeare and other great writers, gives us a humanising, engaging account of the history of cancer treatments. In a touching recall of his own life, titled When Breath Becomes Air, Dr Paul Kalanithi, who himself succumbed to cancer, writes movingly on his experiences with cancer both as doctor and patient as well as husband and new father. Clearly, these two doctor-writers have read widely outside their medical specialisations. No matter how progressively sophisticated and advanced medical technology becomes, a training in empathy, which the Humanities and Arts disciplines encourage, should be a key priority when planning a medical curriculum.</p><p>Finally, another significant contribution of Literature is its penetrating ability to warn us of the dangers of unthinking, uncritical worship of technology. We find just such a warning in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World or E. M. Foster's short story, \"The Machine Stops\". These literary works, and many others like them, reveal the great danger to us all when only a few powerful institutions or companies control key technologies. In Huxley's dystopian vision of a world of advanced technology, all human behaviour is controlled and standardised.

Ministers heading different ministries have spoken of this need with fervour and determination.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rightly so, as Malaysia does not want to lack far behind in this spurt towards new technology such as the use of artificial intelligence in many important fields, including the use of sophisticated technology in medical diagnostics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Education Ministry has announced the need to relook at the TVET ( Technical and Vocational Education Training ) programme so as to make it more relevant to current innovative industrial demands. But before the wheels churn too fast and far, should we not take 5 to reflect?</p><p>With this rush to obey the imperatives of the 4.0 tech revolution, what would happen to the Humanities (History, Literature, Philosophy, etc) and to the related disciplines of Sociology, Anthropology, to name just two disciplines from the Social Sciences? Would they be given much less attention, or worse, sidelined?</p><p>For me, who has taught Literature for decades and is still enjoying reading and discussing literary works, such a prospect is both frightening and tragic.</p><p>Writing in Hindustani Times (September 16, 2018 ), Vivek Wadhwa, Distiguished Fellow at Harvard Law School and the Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley, reminds us that \"tackling today's biggest societal and technological challenges requires the ability to think critically about their human context, which is something that humanities graduates happen to be best trained to do\". It may surprise some of us to know that key figures heading major technological companies are just this kind of Humanities graduates. Jack Ma graduated with a BA in English; YouTube's CEO, Susan Wojciki, majored in Literature and History and Linkedin's founder, Brian Chesky, has an MA in Philosophy. These are the top brass, you may say. But today the Fordist mode of production which prioritises near passive workers on the factory floor, has given way, or, must give way to innovative, exploratory workers at all levels, workers who can think critically, if a company wants to retain a competitive edge.</p><p>Some of us may recall, with chuckles, the factory floor worker Charlie Chaplin plays in the silent film, Modern Times. This longsuffering fellow had become so \"mechanised\" in repetitive tightening of round nuts and bolts that when his shift is over, he cannot help but take out his spanner to \"tighten\" the round buttons on a lady's blouse! Today, industry wants thinking workers at all levels but will an education merely limited to tech and engineering yield critical and creative thinking? To quote again from Vivek Wadhwa, \"An engineering degree is valuable, but the sense of empathy that comes from music, arts, literature, psychology, etc provides a big advantage in design\". In fact, the more sophisticated 4.0 technology becomes, whether in artificial intelligence, advanced sensors, nano-tech and so on, the more people should be trained to think imaginatively, ethically and with an openness to multicultural sensitivities. For centuries, the Humanities have had an excellent track record for teaching such essentials.</p><p>Literature contributes to the widening of the imagination as well as the enriching of sensibilities, two areas which any tech designer must surely value. A good novel or short story explores the complexity of human identity. We are all, without exception, coloured by race, religion, culture, gender and sexual preferences. Memorable literary works reveal how these interwoven layers that make up an identity, both challenge and enrich each individual. If you are a tech designer ( whether of the most advanced I Phone or some other hi-tech device ), you had better know how complex and fascinatingly different people are. Statistical data is crucial to market research but it will not tell you enough about the human context. I suppose that before any tech product goes to the engineering department, many meetings on statistics would be held but will statistics alone answer deeper questions about cultural and emotional propensities in a certain market, whether in China, Southeast Asia or elsewhere? Literature and the Humanities will give us the ability to think empathetically, not for Good Samaritan reasons ( no business can be overly generous or compassionate ) but for good economic and business sense. It is certainly not enough to conclude as bluntly as the portentous businessman, Mr Birling, in J.B. Priestley's play, An Inspector Calls did,that all one needs to do is \"to keep costs low and profits high\". One may not get the profits one wants without a certain understanding of how complex human beings are and how crucial some respect for history can be in business.</p><p>The study of History, a key Humanities discipline, is not mere excavation of tombs and hieroglyphics ( though we can and have learnt a lot from these over the years ), but it is training in the ability to see how the past, including the recent past, impinges on the present. Surely, any company about to launch into a big tech business in a country would need to hire some experts, who are very knowledgeable about the past of that country, in order to evaluate how these legacies of the past can impinge on the present and even the future. No company can afford to ignore this time trajectory.</p><p>Of course, no man or woman has the God-like ability to predict the future but the critical mind which can hold in symbiotic connection past, present and future is essential to many business ventures, technological or otherwise. This kind of reflective critical thinking is best acquired from a Humanities education. Pure tech and business graduates can work together with Humanities graduates to sharpen the competitive edge of a company.</p><p>Recently, I have been drawn to the elegant writings of a number of medical specialists. Here I mention only two of them. In The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer, Dr Siddhartha Muhkerjee, in a riveting book replete with quotes from Shakespeare and other great writers, gives us a humanising, engaging account of the history of cancer treatments. In a touching recall of his own life, titled When Breath Becomes Air, Dr Paul Kalanithi, who himself succumbed to cancer, writes movingly on his experiences with cancer both as doctor and patient as well as husband and new father. Clearly, these two doctor-writers have read widely outside their medical specialisations. No matter how progressively sophisticated and advanced medical technology becomes, a training in empathy, which the Humanities and Arts disciplines encourage, should be a key priority when planning a medical curriculum.</p><p>Finally, another significant contribution of Literature is its penetrating ability to warn us of the dangers of unthinking, uncritical worship of technology. We find just such a warning in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World or E. M. Foster's short story, \"The Machine Stops\". These literary works, and many others like them, reveal the great danger to us all when only a few powerful institutions or companies control key technologies. In Huxley's dystopian vision of a world of advanced technology, all human behaviour is controlled and standardised. Love is frowned upon, sexuality is supervised, even reproduction itself is regulated and mechanised. And in Forster's story, everyone has been lulled into a cocoon-like slumber since all human wants, physical, mental and spiritual, are met by a connection to the ubiquitous, omnipotent Machine. Are these scenarios mere science fiction or, are some aspects ot these alarming developments already here?</p><p>No matter how much we may laud the 4.0 tech revolution and yes, it is here to stay and it has its merits, we must remain vigilant about the enduring importance of ethical and moral values which the Humanities and Arts have, for so long, helped us to learn. If we aren't careful, we shall, as Steven Spielberg puts it, allow technology, \"to interrupt our ability to have a thought or daydream, to imagine something wonderful because we are too busy bridging the walk from the cafeteria to</p><p>the office on the cell phone\".</p><p>By remaining alert and wakeful, we can explore ways in which technology can partner fruitfully with the Humanities and Arts and so retain our abilty to dream big, to stretch the imagination and, more importantly, to leverage humanising values as we enter new frontiers of science. As the late Steve Jobs stated at the launch of Ipad 2, \"It is in Apple's DNA that technology alone is not enough - it is technology married with liberal arts married with humanities that makes our hearts sing\".</p><p>*Dr Wong Soak Koon is a long time Literature teacher.</p><p>**This is the personal opinion of the writer or organisation and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

Children s organisations and opposition parties claim it does not go far enough in regulating multinational online and social media companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Mr Naughten gave a commitment last January that a digital safety commissioner would be appointed this year, he appeared to backtrack on this promise when launching the action plan yesterday.</p><p> What we ve done with this action plan is actually take the education and co-ordination aspect of the digital safety commissioner role out of that and we re proceeding with that immediately now, implementing that over the coming months so that we have the groundwork in place for this new office when it is established,  said Mr Naughten.</p><p>[quote]We are proceeding with aspects of this that we can proceed with, which is the co-ordination aspect and the education aspect.[/quote]</p><p>Mr Naughten said he is working with Sinn F\u00e9in justice spokesman Donnchadh \u00d3 Laoghaire, who brought forward a bill on the issue, but added that there are  complexities involved  in it.</p><p>The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC) said it cannot support the self-regulation of online companies.</p><p> For several years, the ISPCC has described online safety as the child protection issue of our time, and called for enhanced regulation, enhanced education measures, and law reform, as part of a national strategy on online safety,  said ISPCC director of policy Cliodhna O Neill.</p><p>She said there is  some good practice  in the self-regulation area but  experience shows that legislation and regulation is needed to ensure consistent compliance by all providers .</p><p>[quote]She said:  A digital safety commissioner with real powers and authority would be required to ensure this. There is support in this plan for some aspects of such an office but this may not go far enough.[/quote]</p><p>Labour TD Se\u00e1n Sherlock also slammed the Government for failing to appoint a digital safety commissioner.</p><p> There are 25 goals outlined in the plan but the only mention of a digital commissioner is in goal 18,  he said.  This is a sure sign that there is no intention by Government to establish such an office, despite their previous commitments. It should be front and centre of any proposals. </p><p>Mr \u00d3 Laoghaire said the action plan contains many positive aspects but said it is weak when it comes to industry regulation.</p><p> My bill to establish a digital safety commissioner, which passed second stage in the D\u00e1il earlier this year, would do just that,  he said.</p><p>[quote]While I welcome Minister Naughten s stated support for the bill, which is positive, this needs to be backed up with tangible action. At present, the action plan acknowledges the bill, but it merely commits to working with the committee on the bill.[/quote]</p><p>Attending the launch of the plan, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said multinational companies generally have a good record on taking down offensive or abusive content quickly but social media firms must invest more resources in this area.</p><p> You can pass any law you like in any jurisdiction but the internet by its very nature is the world wide web so companies have a global reach that governments don t have and them taking action, I think, can be very effective,  said Mr Varadkar when asked about self-regulation.</p><p>However, Fianna F\u00e1il s James Lawless said self-regulation will not work.</p><p> The Government s apparent deference to the big tech firms is no excuse for not putting in place a proper, robust regulatory regime,  said Mr Lawless.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-472763</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SSH-77M1-F0BB-S195-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"621\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

figures have revealed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Figures released by the NSPCC have revealed that 247 of these crimes were recorded as having a cyber element in 2019/20, compared to 131 in 2018/19.</p><p>The figures have been described as \"worrying\" by county MPs who are urging parents to be aware of what their children are doing online.</p><p>Nationally the child protection charity has revealed 10,391 child sex crimes were recorded with a cyber flag by all UK forces in 2019/20 - a 16 per cent rise on the previous year.</p><p>That takes the total number of recorded offences in the five years since it became mandatory to record whether a crime involved the internet to more than 37,000.</p><p>In Hampshire, that figure stands at 714 online child sex crimes.</p><p>MP for Southampton Test Alan Whitehead said the figures from the child protection charity are \"worrying\".</p><p>He added: \"I would urge parents to keep a very close eye of what children are up to particularly as they might be spending more time online due to the covid-19.</p><p>\"There is also a role for big tech companies to do more to regulate age limits on social media.\"</p><p>Royston Smith, MP for Southampton Itchen, said the figures are \"highly concerning\".</p><p>\"The Government plans to introduce new Online Harms legislation which aims to better protect young people online,\" he continued.</p><p>\"I am confident that this new legislation will help to crack down on these despicable crimes against children.\"</p><p>The NSPPC says that the figure highlights the urgent need for the Government to push forward with the Online Harms Bill, which would place a legal Duty of Care on tech firms to protect children, enforced by an independent regulator.</p><p>The NSPCC is calling on the Government to publish its final plans before the end of the year, and get an Online Harms Bill on the statute book by the end of 2021.</p><p>Andy Burrows, NSPCC Head of Child Safety Online Policy, said: \"These figures suggest that online abuse was already rising before lockdown, and the risks to children appear to have spiked significantly since.</p><p>\"It is now almost 17 months since the Government's original proposals for social media regulation were published and children continue to face preventable harm online.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

This advertising is often a primary source of revenue for small publishers, many of which struggle with financial sustainability.</p><p>In the last year or two, however, policymakers and internet users alike have become more concerned with the amount of data being tracked online, leading to a new generation of legislation addressing the issue, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) passed in the European Union in 2018.</p><p>Not all websites have adopted such policies, however \u2014 especially those based in the Global South. Although GDPR is considered \u201cthe new global standard,\u201d according to the report, it \u2014 and other similar data protection laws \u2014 can be difficult to enforce. This can mean the incentives to comply are low for countries that are not subject to its jurisdiction, especially when not complying can be financially lucrative.</p><p>Users are often fooled by the \u201cshare\u201d button, F\u00e9rdeline said. While readers might think they are clicking on a link to share a story through Facebook or Twitter, tracking software is often embedded in the link\u2019s code. That one click could bring in another 20 companies tracking that data, of which the reader would not be aware.</p><p>Among the media outlets surveyed in the report, roughly 15 percent of the tracking devices could not be traced, F\u00e9rdeline said. This means users don\u2019t know who is tracking or collecting their personal data.</p><p>The tracking devices found on independent media websites rarely ask for consent to track data, the report found. There are several measures outlets can adopt, however, that would show a greater respect for users\u2019 privacy, such as self-hosting content. Other steps, like switching to internal ad sales instead of third-party advertising would also help mitigate risk, but the costs can be prohibitive for an independent media outlet that might not have the same resources as a larger one.</p><p>Much of the discussion at the June event centered on how users could better advocate for themselves, especially when big tech companies control so much internet traffic as people regularly click on links through third parties such as Twitter or Facebook.</p><p>Nathalie Mar\u00e9chal, one of the panelists and a senior research analyst at Ranking Digital Rights, argued that because big tech companies are lobbying against regulation, consumers need to better educate themselves and speak up for their own interests.</p><p>'Companies are not going to start respecting privacy rights because we ask them nicely,\u201d Mar\u00e9chal said. \u201cIt\u2019s well past the time of asking nicely and self-regulating.

The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism has announced[1] today that it plans on hiring an executive director and separate staff to lead the initiative, which was formed[2] a little more than two years ago. Also joining the initiative will be Amazon, Whatsapp and Linkedin.Group members today met with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern at the United Nations General Assembly to discuss how social media giants are complying with the Christchurch Call to Action. </p><p>The pledge -- written after a mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand that killed 51 people was broadcast on Facebook Live -- called on technology companies to help advert such incidents. Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Google and Microsoft back in May joined the pledge.The independent GIFCT said they would be committed to carrying out the Christchurch Call's nine-point plan[3], which included better protocols for users to report harmful content, collaborating on technology, instilling checks on livestreaming to avoid spreading extremist material and more. Facebook unveiled a \"one-strike\"[4] policy for its Facebook Live feature shortly after the Christchurch mass shooting but has yet to deploy any additional safeguards.Most recently, the group contributed to a shared database[5] of \"hashes\" or digital fingerprints of known terrorist images and video propaganda. Since terrorists often upload the same piece of content on multiple social media platforms, it's oftentimes useful for platforms to be on the lookout for such material before it spreads. The size of the database has grown in a period of two years to include more than 200,000 individual \"hashes\".The group's new independence comes as governments around the world look for ways to take big tech companies to task for violent content. The Australian government earlier this year passed new laws that would penalize[6] technology companies for allowing the streaming of videos containing serious offenses. The UK government is currently looking into fining[7] social media giants for failing to protect their users from harmful content.

Mr. President, this week, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation subpoenaed testimony from Mr. Jack Dorsey of Twitter, Mr. Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, Inc., and Mr. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. I supported the issuance of these subpoenas, and I look forward to hearing testimony on the content moderation policies used by their respective platforms. Over the past few months, I have worked with many members of this body on a statutory fix to section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, specifically to the ingrained liability shield that platforms like Facebook use to defend their content moderation policies. Over the years, we have seen Big Tech's biggest players stretch this shield beyond all recognition, far beyond the limits Congress envisioned when they passed the original act in 1996. Now, content moderators wield their power with abandon, banning and deleting content they disagree with right alongside content of the most vile, universally repulsive nature. Last month, [[Page S6024]] in response to growing outcries over censorship, I introduced the Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act with Chairman Lindsey Graham and Chairman Roger Wicker to introduce accountability into our dealings with digital platforms and services. This bill is unique because it doesn't do specifically what so many here in Washington would like it to do: It doesn't delete section 230 from the U.S Code, nor does it put the power to decide what information should and should not be available online in Congress's or regulators' hands. All it does is remove ambiguities from the original statutory language to help companies and consumers better understand when that liability shield is and is not applicable. Still, as we move forward with legislation, it is important to remember that we are creating policy for the internet we have now and will have in the future and not the internet we had back in 1996, hence the reason for the subpoenas we are sending to those three Silicon Valley executives. They are the ones who created the internet we have today, and their justifications and perspectives regarding the future of content moderation could prove useful.

If am more persuasive and manipulating human instincts better than my competitor then I will win in the attention economy\".</p><p>One of the key features that many companies use, according to Mr Harris,\u00a0is the unpredictable rewards apps can deliver every time we open them or refresh a feed.</p><p>\"Our phone is like a slot machine and the way a slot machine works is on an unpredictable schedule, on a random hit or miss reward, that's how you make it the most addictive,\" he adds.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/20/government-draws-plans-social-media-regulator-following-telegraph/\">Duty of care puff</url></p><p>These days Mr Harris\u00a0devotes his energies to\u00a0lobbying and advising governments\u00a0and organisations on the need to guard against the pernicious effects\u00a0tech can have on users and the fabric of society.</p><p>Yet for him, the issue is not simply about people limiting the time they spend on social media, he wants to see the apps fundamentally redesigned to make them\u00a0\"more humane\".</p><p>He said: \"The entire premise of what we call humane technology is to start with a much more vulnerable view of human nature.</p><p>\"That the human animal has these deep instincts that can be manipulated and seduced,\u00a0and we either protect against those being manipulated or we don't.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-47643005</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TBJ-CH71-F021-623B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"958\"/><timeReceived>10:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 25, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The difference is many of these outlets return the favour of the community with sound, solid, public interest news-reporting.</p><p>Meanwhile Facebook and Google tacitly assist in the spread of misinformation. It is certainly appropriate for the courts to warn jurors about accessing such digital information.But it is equally appropriate for the Australian courts to hold Facebook and Google to the same standards of defamation and contempt of court law long adhered to by credible news reporting organisations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-e817d3243cf811ea9115ab9a48d67c3107edbee37067f593a1395b4507283eaa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HBTMRC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y21-Y6P1-JD3N-509R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Hobart Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Not only is the government proposing a regulator that would handle the direct enforcement action, but the regulator will then have to define a duty of care that internet companies must provide. That regulator must also define a code of best practices that internet companies can follow to show that they are fulfilling that duty of care.</p><p>Those codes could require sweeping changes to online platforms: the best practices to prevent disinformation, for instance, by calling for fact-checking services on platforms, hindering the reach of content that has been marked as false, promoting authoritative news sources, and improving the transparency of political advertising. But these best practices are provided as examples not requirements. Companies are free to argue that they are fulfilling their duty of care in other ways, and the regulator is free to decide to focus only on the largest online platforms anyway.</p><p>In some areas, the white paper shows lessons learned from other efforts to regulate the internet. Requirements in UK and Australian legislation to help law enforcement read encrypted messages led to such a backlash that they have never been applied in practice; the new white paper instead specifically notes that requirements to scan for harmful content don't apply to private channels. </p><p>But a recent proposal from the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission for an independent body to review the algorithms used by online media platforms was not only well received by analysts, it was shortly followed by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/01/why-am-i-seeing-this-new-facebook-tool-to-demystify-news-feed\">a new feature from Facebook allowing users to do just that</url>. So it's not surprising to see the white paper argue that the regulator should have the power to demand information about the impact of algorithms in selecting content for users.</p><p>The tightrope the government is walking is a narrow one. It wants the UK, the white paper says, to become safest place in the world to go online, and also the best place to start and grow a digital business.</p><p>That may be a perfectly reasonable goal, if the UK can achieve its aim of leading the way in responsible legislation while watching others follow largely the same route. Or it could be a dangerous attempt to have its cake and eat it, creating a regulator without the power to prevent the worst abuses, but with just enough power to scare away the best innovations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-52797522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VTB-54Y1-JCJY-G2G7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><timeReceived>6:19 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Digital advances will undoubtedly drive our economy and enrich our society, but to fully harness the internet\u2019s advantages, we must confront the online threats and harms it can propagate, and protect those who are vulnerable to them.</p><p>That\u2019s why we want to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online and the best place to start and grow a digital business. We will make sure the benefits of technology are spread more widely and shared more fairly. Our approach is guided by the need to promote fair and efficient markets where the benefits of technology are shared widely across communities; ensure the safety and security of those online; and maintain a thriving democracy and society, where pluralism and freedom of expression are protected.</p><p>By getting it right, we will drive growth and stimulate innovation and new ideas, whilst giving confidence and certainty to innovators and building trust amongst consumers. As we leave the EU, we have an incredible opportunity to lead the world in regulatory innovation.</p><p>As the internet continues to grow and transform our lives it is essential that we get the balance right between a thriving, open and vibrant virtual world, and one in which users are protected from harm.</p><p>The scale, severity and complexity of online child sexual exploitation and abuse is a concern for government, law enforcement and companies, with 16.8 million referrals of child sexual abuse material by US technology companies to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2019. In the UK, law enforcement is making 500 arrests and safeguarding 700 children a month as a result of these referrals and other sources. Terrorist propaganda and vile online child sexual abuse destroy lives and tear families and communities apart. We cannot allow these harmful behaviours and content to undermine the significant benefits that the digital revolution can offer.</p><p>Two thirds of adults in the UK are concerned about content online, and close to half say that they have seen hateful content in the past year. Online abuse can have a severe impact on people\u2019s lives and is often targeted at the most vulnerable in our society. Cyberbullying has been shown to have psychological and emotional impact. In a large survey of young people who had been cyberbullied, 37% had developed depression and 26% had suicidal thoughts. These figures are higher than corresponding statistics for \u2018offline\u2019 bullying, indicating the increased potential for harm.</p><p>This update shares some of the findings from the Online Harms White Paper consultation, as we work to ensure the digital revolution works for families, communities and businesses. We are grateful to everybody who responded to the consultation on our proposals to eradicate these corrosive and abhorrent harms. There were some clear themes amongst the responses which we will pay close attention to as we move towards the legislation announced in the Queen\u2019s Speech.</p><p>Firstly, freedom of expression, and the role of a free press, is vital to a healthy democracy. We will ensure that there are safeguards in the legislation, so companies and the new regulator have a clear responsibility to protect users\u2019 rights online, including freedom of expression and the need to maintain a vibrant and diverse public square.</p><p>We are also introducing greater transparency about content removal, with the opportunity for users to appeal. We will not prevent adults from accessing or posting legal content, nor require companies to remove specific pieces of legal content. The new regulatory framework will instead require companies, where relevant, to explicitly state what content and behaviour is acceptable on their sites and then for platforms to enforce this consistently.</p><p>Secondly, respondents emphasised the need for clarity and certainty for businesses, and proportionate regulation. Analysis so far suggests that fewer than 5% of UK businesses will be in scope of this regulatory framework. The \u2018duty of care\u2019 will only apply to companies that facilitate the sharing of user generated content, for example through comments, forums or video sharing. Just because a business has a social media presence, does not mean it will be in scope of the regulation. Business to business services, which provide virtual infrastructure to businesses for storing and sharing content, will not have requirements placed on them.</p><p>Thirdly, many respondents reinforced the importance of higher levels of protection for children, which will be reflected in the policy we develop through this consultation. The proposals assume a higher level of protection for children than for the typical adult user, including, where appropriate, measures to prevent children from accessing age-inappropriate or harmful content. This approach will achieve a more consistent and comprehensive approach to harmful content across different sites and go further than the Digital Economy Act\u2019s focus on online pornography on commercial adult sites.</p><p>On the question of who will be taking on the role of the regulator, having listened to feedback from this consultation, we are minded to appoint Ofcom. This would allow us to build on Ofcom\u2019s expertise, avoid fragmentation of the regulatory landscape and enable quick progress on this important issue.</p><p>We are a pro-technology government and we are keen to continue to work with industry to drive forward the digital agenda. We are continuing to work at pace to ensure the right regulatory regime and legislation is in place. The ICO has recently published its Age Appropriate Design Code, and more detailed proposals on online harms regulation will be released in the spring alongside interim voluntary codes on tackling online terrorist and child sexual exploitation and abuse content and activity.</p><p>In the meantime, we will continue our efforts to unlock the huge opportunities presented by digital technologies whilst minimising the risks.</p><p>To ensure that we keep momentum on a comprehensive package of measures we will be publishing and undertaking further work to address online harms, such as:</p><p>\u25cf government media literacy strategy</p><p>\u25cf The Law Commission\u2019s consultation on abusive and offensive online communications</p><p>\u25cf a review into the market for technology designed to improve online safety, where the UK is a leading innovator</p><p>\u25cf developing our understanding and evidence base of online harms and approaches to tackling them. This is why we have supported cross-government research to understand how platforms can recognise their child users through age assurance</p><p>We are confident that this publication, and the other plans we are driving forward, will help us to achieve our objectives; making Britain the safest place to be online and the best digital economy in the world.</p><p>The Rt Hon Baroness Morgan of Cotes</p><p>Secretary of State, Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport</p><p>The Rt Hon Priti Patel MP</p><p>Secretary of State, Home Office</p><p>Executive summary</p><p>1. The Online Harms White Paper set out the intention to improve protections for users online through the introduction of a new duty of care on companies and an independent regulator responsible for overseeing this framework. The White Paper proposed that this regulation follow a proportionate and risk-based approach, and that the duty of care be designed to ensure that all companies have appropriate systems and processes in place to react to concerns over harmful content and improve the safety of their users - from effective complaint mechanisms to transparent decision-making over actions taken in response to reports of harm.</p><p>2. The consultation ran from 8 April 2019 to 1 July 2019. It received over 2,400 responses ranging from companies in the technology industry including large tech giants and small and medium sized enterprises, academics, think tanks, children\u2019s charities, rights groups, publishers, governmental organisations and individuals. In parallel to the consultation process, we have undertaken extensive engagement over the last 12 months with representatives from industry, civil society and others. This engagement is reflected in the response.</p><p>3. This initial government response provides an overview of the consultation responses and wider engagement on the proposals in the White Paper. It includes an in-depth breakdown of the responses to each of the 18 consultation questions asked in relation to the White Paper proposals, and an overview of the feedback in response to our engagement with stakeholders. This document forms an iterative part of the policy development process. We are committed to taking a deliberative and open approach to ensure that we get the detail of this complex and novel policy right. While it does not provide a detailed update on all policy proposals, it does give an indication of our direction of travel in a number of key areas raised as overarching concern across some responses.</p><p>4. In particular, while the risk-based and proportionate approach proposed by the White Paper was positively received by those we consulted with, written responses and our engagement highlighted questions over a number of areas, including freedom of expression and the businesses in scope of the duty of care. Having carefully considered the information gained during this process, we have made a number of developments to our policies. These are clarified in the \u2018Our Response\u2019 section below.</p><p>5. This consultation has been a critical part of the development of this policy and we are grateful to those who took part. This feedback is being factored into the development of this policy, and we will continue to engage with users, industry and civil society as we continue to refine our policies ahead of publication of the full policy response. We believe that an agile and proportionate approach to regulation, developed in collaboration with stakeholders, will strengthen a free and open internet by providing a framework that builds public trust, while encouraging innovation and providing confidence to investors.</p><p>Our response</p><p>Freedom of expression</p><p>1. The consultation responses indicated that some respondents were concerned that the proposals could impact freedom of expression online. We recognise the critical importance of freedom of expression, both as a fundamental right in itself and as an essential enabler of the full range of other human rights protected by UK and international law. As a result, the overarching principle of the regulation of online harms is to protect users\u2019 rights online, including the rights of children and freedom of expression. Safeguards for freedom of expression have been built in throughout the framework. Rather than requiring the removal of specific pieces of legal content, regulation will focus on the wider systems and processes that platforms have in place to deal with online harms, while maintaining a proportionate and risk-based approach.</p><p>2. To ensure protections for freedom of expression, regulation will establish differentiated expectations on companies for illegal content and activity, versus conduct that is not illegal but has the potential to cause harm. Regulation will therefore not force companies to remove specific pieces of legal content. The new regulatory framework will instead require companies, where relevant, to explicitly state what content and behaviour they deem to be acceptable on their sites and enforce this consistently and transparently. All companies in scope will need to ensure a higher level of protection for children, and take reasonable steps to protect them from inappropriate or harmful content.</p><p>3. Services in scope of the regulation will need to ensure that illegal content is removed expeditiously and that the risk of it appearing is minimised by effective systems. Reflecting the threat to national security and the physical safety of children, companies will be required to take particularly robust action to tackle terrorist content and online child sexual exploitation and abuse.</p><p>4. Recognising concerns about freedom of expression, the regulator will not investigate or adjudicate on individual complaints. Companies will be able to decide what type of legal content or behaviour is acceptable on their services, but must take reasonable steps to protect children from harm. They will need to set this out in clear and accessible terms and conditions and enforce these effectively, consistently and transparently. The proposed approach will improve transparency for users about which content is and is not acceptable on different platforms, and will enhance users\u2019 ability to challenge removal of content where this occurs.</p><p>5. Companies will be required to have effective and proportionate user redress mechanisms which will enable users to report harmful content and to challenge content takedown where necessary. This will give users clearer, more effective and more accessible avenues to question content takedown, which is an important safeguard for the right to freedom of expression. These processes will need to be transparent, in line with terms and conditions, and consistently applied.</p><p>Ensuring clarity for businesses</p><p>6. We recognise the need for businesses to have certainty, and will ensure that guidance is provided to help businesses understand potential risks arising from different types of service, and the actions that businesses would need to take to comply with the duty of care as a result. We will ensure that the regulator consults with relevant stakeholders to ensure the guidance is clear and practicable.</p><p>Businesses in scope</p><p>7. The legislation will only apply to companies that provide services or use functionality on their websites which facilitate the sharing of user generated content or user interactions, for example through comments, forums or video sharing. Our assessment is that only a very small proportion of UK businesses (estimated to account to less than 5%) fit within that definition. To ensure clarity, guidance will be provided by the regulator to help businesses understand whether or not the services they provide or functionality contained on their website would fall into the scope of the regulation.</p><p>8. Just because a business has a social media page that does not bring it in scope of regulation. Equally, a business would not be brought in scope purely by providing referral or discount codes on its website to be shared with other potential customers on social media. It would be the social media platform hosting the content that is in scope, not the business using its services to advertise or promote their company. To be in scope, a business would have to operate its own website with the functionality to enable sharing of user-generated content, or user interactions. We will introduce this legislation proportionately, minimising the regulatory burden on small businesses. Most small businesses where there is a lower risk of harm occurring will not have to make disproportionately burdensome changes to their service to be compliant with the proposed regulation.</p><p>9. Regulation must be proportionate and based on evidence of risk of harm and what can feasibly be expected of companies. We anticipate that the regulator would assess the business impacts of any new requirements it introduces. Final policy positions on proportionality will, therefore, align with the evidence of risk of harm and impact to business. Business-to-business services have very limited opportunities to prevent harm occurring to individuals and as such will be out of scope of regulation.</p><p>Identity of the regulator</p><p>11. We are minded to make Ofcom the new regulator, in preference to giving this function to a new body or to another existing organisation. This preference is based on its organisational experience, robustness, and experience of delivering challenging, high-profile remits across a range of sectors. Ofcom is a well-established and experienced regulator, recently assuming high profile roles such as regulation of the BBC. Ofcom\u2019s focus on the communications sector means it already has relationships with many of the major players in the online arena, and its spectrum licensing duties mean that it is practised at dealing with large numbers of small businesses.</p><p>12. We judge that such a role is best served by an existing regulator with a proven track record of experience, expertise and credibility. We think that the best fit for this role is Ofcom, both in terms of policy alignment and organisational experience - for instance, in their existing work, Ofcom already takes the risk-based approach that we expect the online harms regulator will need to employ.</p><p>Transparency</p><p>13. Effective transparency reporting will help ensure that content removal is well-founded and freedom of expression is protected. In particular, increasing transparency around the reasons behind, and prevalence of, content removal may address concerns about some companies\u2019 existing processes for removing content. Companies\u2019 existing processes have in some cases been criticised for being opaque and hard to challenge.</p><p>14. The government is committed to ensuring that conversations about this policy are ongoing, and that stakeholders are being engaged to mitigate concerns. In order to achieve this, we have recently established a multi-stakeholder Transparency Working Group chaired by the Minister for Digital and Broadband which includes representation from all sides of the debate, including from industry and civil society. This group will feed into the government\u2019s transparency report, which was announced in the Online Harms White Paper and which we intend to publish in the coming months.</p><p>15. Some stakeholders expressed concerns about a potential \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to transparency, and the material costs for companies associated with reporting. In line with the overarching principles of the regulatory framework, the reporting requirements that a company may have to comply with will also vary in proportion with the type of service that is being provided, and the risk factors involved. To maintain a proportionate and risk-based approach, the regulator will apply minimum thresholds in determining the level of detail that an in-scope business would need to provide in its transparency reporting, or whether it would need to produce reports at all.</p><p>Ensuring that the regulator acts proportionately</p><p>16. The consideration of freedom of expression is at the heart of our policy development, and we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are included throughout the legislation. By taking action to address harmful online behaviours, we are confident that our approach will support more people to enjoy their right to freedom of expression and participate in online discussions.</p><p>17. At the same time, we also remain confident that proposals will not place an undue burden on business. Companies will be expected to take reasonable and proportionate steps to protect users. This will vary according to the organisation\u2019s associated risk, first and foremost, size and the resources available to it, as well as by the risk associated with the service provided. To ensure clarity about how the duty of care could be fulfilled, we will ensure there is sufficient clarity in the regulation and codes of practice about the applicable expectations on business, including where businesses are exempt from certain requirements due to their size or risk.</p><p>18. This will help companies to comply with the legislation, and to feel confident that they have done so appropriately.</p><p>Enforcement</p><p>19. We recognise the importance of the regulator having a range of enforcement powers that it uses in a fair, proportionate and transparent way. It is equally essential that company executives are sufficiently incentivised to take online safety seriously and that the regulator can take action when they fail to do so. We are considering the responses to the consultation on senior management liability and business disruption measures and will set out our final policy position in the Spring.</p><p>Protection of children</p><p>20. Under our proposals we expect companies to use a proportionate range of tools including age assurance, and age verification technologies to prevent children from accessing age-inappropriate content and to protect them from other harms. This would achieve our objective of protecting children from online pornography, and would also fulfil the aims of the Digital Economy Act.</p><p>Next steps</p><p>1. Online Harms is a key legislative priority for this government, and we have a comprehensive programme of work planned to ensure that we keep momentum until legislation is introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows. As mentioned above, this is an iterative step as we consider how best to approach this complex and important issue. We will continue to engage closely with industry and civil society as we finalise the remaining policy. While preparation of legislation continues, and in addition to the full response to be published in the spring, we are developing other wider measures in order to ensure progress now on online safety. These will include:</p><p>Interim codes of practice</p><p>2. The government expects companies to take action now to tackle harmful content or activity on their services. For those harms where there is a risk to national security or to the safety of children, the government is working with law enforcement and other relevant bodies to produce interim codes of practice.</p><p>3. The interim codes of practice will provide guidance to companies on how to tackle online terrorist and Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (CSEA) content and activity. The codes will be voluntary but are intended to bridge the gap until the regulator becomes operational, given the seriousness of these harms. We are continuing to engage with key stakeholders in the development of the codes to ensure that they are effective. We will publish these interim codes of practice in the coming months.</p><p>Government transparency report</p><p>4. The Online Harms White Paper committed the government to producing its first annual transparency report. We intend to publish this report in the next few months. The report will be informed by discussions at a multi-stakeholder Transparency Working Group chaired by the Minister for Digital and Broadband.</p><p>Non-legislative measures</p><p>5. The White Paper made clear that all users should have the tools and resources available to manage their own online safety, and that of others in their care. It committed the government to developing a media literacy strategy and we announced in the government\u2019s response to the Cairncross Review that the strategy would be published in summer 2020. The media literacy strategy will ensure a coordinated and strategic approach to online media literacy education and awareness for children, young people and adults. It will aim to support citizens as users in managing their privacy settings and their online footprint, thinking critically about the things they come across online (disinformation, catfishing etc), and how the terms of service and moderating processes can be used to report harmful content. We will publish this in the summer of 2020.</p><p>6. We are keen to continue to work in partnership with tech companies and wider stakeholders to refine our approach, and to work on collaborative solutions, especially looking at how we can use technology to tackle these issues. Industries such as the safety tech sector are central to the government\u2019s aim to promote innovation and develop a flourishing tech industry that also delivers technological solutions to meet regulatory requirements. To that end, we can also announce the upcoming publication of a full report into the safety technology ecosystem, which will identify opportunities for increasing competition and quality within the sector.</p><p>Wider regulation and governance of the digital landscape</p><p>7. As well as delivering on our commitments set out in the Online Harms White Paper, the government is undertaking an ambitious programme of wider work on how we govern digital technologies to unlock the huge opportunities presented by digital technologies whilst minimising the risks. Work on electoral integrity and related online transparency issues is being taken forward as part of the Defending Democracy programme together with the Cabinet Office.</p><p>8. We want the wider institutional landscape for digital technologies to be future-proof and fit for the digital age. As a result, over the coming months we will engage experts, regulators, industry, civil society and the general public to ensure our overarching regulatory regime for digital technologies is fully coherent, efficient, and effective.</p><p>Chapter one: Detailed findings from the consultation</p><p>1. The next sections cover:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Chapter One: Methodology of the written consultation and engagement with stakeholders across industry, civil society, international partners and user groups</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Chapter Two: Responses on the regulatory framework (ie scope, user redress, industry transparency, enforcement options and appeals)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Chapter Three: Responses on the proposals for the independent regulator, regulatory accountability and funding models</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Chapter Four: Responses to the non-legislative measures: the opportunities and challenges around technological innovation, safety by design, child online safety and education and awareness</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Methodology - public consultation</p><p>2. Following the White Paper\u2019s publication, we undertook a formal 12-week public written consultation, complemented by an extensive programme of stakeholder engagement. The written consultation took place between April and July 2019, and included 18 questions on aspects of the government\u2019s plans for regulation and tackling online harms. In total, we gathered 2,439 responses from across academia, civil society, industry and the general public. The face-to-face stakeholder engagement enabled a constructive dialogue with key stakeholders, and those groups that may have been underrepresented in the written consultation.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>3. We gathered written consultation responses via an online portal, email and post, both from organisations and from members of the public. Not all respondents engaged with every question - and indeed the response rate dropped throughout the questions. Of the 18 questions, 6 were closed questions with predefined response options on the online portal, allowing us to provide statistics for the responses to these questions for those who responded via the portal. These statistics, therefore, represent 63% of all responses (69% of all individuals and 32% of all organisations), and do not represent the major organisational respondents.</p><p>4. The remainder of the questions invited free text qualitative responses and each response was individually analysed. The response summaries below include the key themes and issues highlighted across all responses, but do not include statistics due to the nature of these questions.</p><p>5. A notable number of individual respondents to the written consultation disagreed with the overall proposals set out in the White Paper. Those respondents often seemed not to engage with the substance of questions on the specific proposals, but instead reiterated a general disagreement with the overall approach. This was most notable in those questions on regulatory advice, proportionality, the identity and funding of the regulator, innovation and safety by design, which seemed to attract a relatively large amount of confusion in responses. For these respondents, it was therefore difficult to delineate between an objection to the overall regime and an objection to the specific proposal within the question.</p><p>Profile of respondents</p><p>6. In total we received 1,531 online responses and 908 responses via email. 84% of these responses were from individuals and 16% from organisations (including tech sector, civil society, charities etc).</p><p>7. We collected demographic information for just over 90% of individuals who responded via the online portal, covering 58% of all responses:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Age: The largest proportions of responses were from those aged 45-54 (21%) and 55-64 (17%), followed by those aged 35-44 (16%) and 25-34 (15%). Respondents aged 18-24 and over 65 each made up 13% of the sample while 5% were under 18</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Gender: Almost three quarters (72%) of respondents identified as male, with around a quarter (24%) female and 4% identified as \u201cother\u201d</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Ethnicity: A little under two thirds (60%) of respondents identified as \u201cWhite British/English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish\u201d.

Fewer than 1% identified as \u201cArab\u201d, 13% selected \u201cother\u201d and 9% preferred not to say</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Disability: Just over one in ten (11%) consider themselves as disabled under the Equality Act 2010, 75% do not and 14% preferred not to say.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>8. As these demographics indicate, this sample, as with all written consultation samples, may not be representative of public opinion as some key groups are over- or under-represented.</p><p>9. A number of \u2018campaigns\u2019 were organised in response to the consultation from three sources: Samaritans, Open Rights Group, and Hacked Off. These responses were either identical or very similar and were submitted through central coordination. These responses were analysed and included in the same way as all other responses.</p><p>Engagement</p><p>10. Over the 12 week period we held 100 meetings, which supported the written consultation. This engagement enabled detailed conversations with a wide range of stakeholders and ensured we heard the views of important groups. Our engagement reflected the range of organisations that may be in scope of the online harms regulatory framework, including tech organisations, the games industry and retail. We also engaged with academia, regulators and civil society. Furthermore, we consulted the devolved administrations and discussed the policy in international multi-stakeholder fora and with international partners.</p><p>11. We recognise that some abuse or content which targets users based on actual or perceived protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 means that some people face disproportionately negative experiences online. In line with this, during the consultation period we conducted workshops with groups representing users with various protected characteristics. This included engaging with a range of user groups representing those who are likely to be disportionately affected by online harms, such as the LGBTQ+ community; survivors of abuse and violence; disabled users; mental health organisations; religious groups; children, parents and child safety organisations. This engagement ensured groups were able to feed back expert knowledge on specific issues faced by the users they represent.</p><p>12. Engagement included a series of thematic workshops to consult on the core White Paper policies. These workshops focused on: the scope of regulation; transparency; enforcement powers; technology as a solution; safety by design; the regulator; user complaints; media literacy and education. Other meetings included 17 ministerial engagements, \u2018deepdive\u2019 sessions with major technology companies, and roundtable meetings with industry associations. We also engaged stakeholders on specific, key issues raised following the White Paper\u2019s release, including the regulation of the press and freedom of expression, and the approach to the interim codes of practice on terrorist content and child sexual exploitation and abuse.</p><p>Summary of response findings:</p><p>13. The key themes from responses to the consultation and our engagement were:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper stated, on the activities and organisations in scope, that the regulatory framework will apply to online providers that supply services or tools which allow, enable or facilitate users to share or discover user-generated content or interact with each other online. Respondents welcomed the targeted, proportionate and risk based approach that the regulator is expected to take. Responses also highlighted the need to ensure that proposals remain flexible and able to respond as technology develops in the future. Companies and stakeholders, however, asked for more detail on the breadth of both services and harms in scope. Responses focused on ensuring that freedom of expression is protected.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper made clear that under the new duty of care, companies will need to ensure they have user redress mechanisms in place. This would mean that companies need to have effective, accessible complaints and reporting mechanisms for users to raise concerns about specific pieces of harmful content or activity and seek redress. The White Paper also highlighted a role for designated bodies to make \u2018super complaints\u2019 to the regulator to defend the needs of users. Respondents welcomed this, and highlighted the importance of ensuring that companies have effective reporting mechanisms for harmful content, accessible to all users. Organisations showed stronger support for the proposals for super-complaints than individuals did. Broadly, respondents requested more guidance on how a super-complaints function could work, and how it could take into account accountability and transparency mechanisms.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>On transparency, the White Paper set out that companies in scope will be required to issue annual transparency reports. Respondents to the consultation as well as the stakeholders who were engaged highlighted the importance of transparency, both in terms of reporting processes and moderation practices. They see this as being central in holding companies accountable for enforcement of their own standards. Industry respondents suggested that transparency requirements should be proportionate \u2013 noting that a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach was unlikely to be effective and could be costly to implement for smaller companies.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper set out that the regulator will have an escalating range of powers to take enforcement action against companies that fail to fulfil their duty of care - including notices and warnings, fines, business disruption measures, but also senior manager liability, and Internet Service Provider (ISP) blocking in the most egregious cases. Respondents to the consultation as well as the stakeholders who were engaged recognised the role for a tiered enforcement structure, ensuring that enforcement powers are used fairly and proportionately. Civil society groups overall expressed support for firm enforcement actions in cases of non-compliance. Industry and rights groups expressed some concerns about the impact of some of the measures on the UK\u2019s attractiveness to the tech sector and on freedom of expression. They sought further clarity on the intervention and escalation structure, including the grounds for enforcement. They want the regulator to support compliance with the regime in the first instance.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper proposed that companies have nominated representatives in the UK, to assist the regulator in taking enforcement action against companies based overseas. Respondents acknowledged that this system would support the effectiveness of the proposed legislation, however concerns were raised about the potential impact on smaller businesses.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper set out that the regulator will offer regulatory advice to companies on reasonable expectations for compliance, based on both the severity and scale of the harm, the age of their users and the size of the company and resources available to it. Respondents welcomed this. The main suggestions provided were on opportunities for the regulator to provide clarity on any specific standards and thresholds, alongside guidelines and expert advice on how organisations could comply.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper acknowledged that online harms can materialise via private communications services, and committed to setting out a differentiated framework for harm over private communications. Responses across stakeholders recognised the balance between taking appropriate action to address the serious harms, such as child grooming, that can be initiated and escalate from private forums and ensuring appropriate protections for users\u2019 privacy. Most companies and organisations agreed that expectations of private services to tackle harm should be greater, firstly where content and activity is illegal, and secondly where children are involved. Most respondents opposed the inclusion of private communication services in scope of regulation. However, some responses - both from individuals and organisations acknowledged that abuse, harassment and some of the most serious illegal activity occur in private spaces, like closed community forums and chat rooms. These responses expressed support for the principle that platforms should be responsible for their users\u2019 safety in private channels.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper set out that there must be an appeals mechanism for companies and others to challenge against a decision by the regulator when appropriate. Responses showed broad support for a mechanism allowing appeals against enforcement action by the regulator. Companies suggested that appeals mechanisms should be quick and affordable, focussed on the merits of the action taken and that administrative processes should be as streamlined as possible.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper stated that proportionality would be central to enforcement decisions by the regulator. Respondents welcomed the suggestion that the compliance systems could be designed similarly to current models in, for example, the finance sector. Specifically, they expressed support for options allowing companies to self-assess whether their services are in scope, and enabling members of the public to raise concerns with the regulator where a company is not complying.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper did not express a specific preference for the identity of the regulator. Most of the stakeholders we engaged with had no particular preference. Responses were supportive of a new body or of extending the duties of an existing regulator. Some feared that the latter option could prove overwhelming for an existing body and thus instead voiced support for a transitional or temporary body.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper set out that the regulator will be cost-neutral, and that for funding it would recoup costs via charges or a levy on companies in scope. Companies who responded to the consultation viewed the application of a charge with concern, citing worries around potential double or disproportionate costs to certain services and exemption for others.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper proposed a duty on the regulator to lay an annual report and accounts before Parliament and provide Parliament with information as and when requested for accountability. All groups generally expressed support for Parliament to have a defined oversight role over the regulator in order to hold it to account, maintain independence from government and build public trust and hold industry confidence.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper committed to developing a framework on safety by design and innovation, to make it easier for start-ups and small businesses to embed safety in their products. Stakeholders expressed broad agreement and recognition that safety is improved when organisations build in user-safety at the design and development stage of their online services. They also emphasised that machine learning solutions require extensive data and were supportive of the \u2018regulatory sandbox\u2019 model (i.e allowing businesses to test innovations in a controlled environment).</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper committed to make the UK the safest place to be online, having key regard for child online safety. Respondents welcomed this, and one of the key themes of our engagement was parents\u2019 concerns about the safety of their children online. In particular, although parents felt that they know their children best and are therefore usually the best placed to tailor standard advice for them, they also agreed on the need for more advice and education on how to be online safely.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The White Paper recognised that users want to be empowered to manage their safety online, and that the regulator should consider education and awareness to support this. Throughout our engagement, digital education and awareness were key recurring themes. Many felt that the regulator could have an important role in creating a framework for evaluating the impact of existing education and awareness activity in their space. Others recognised that there could be a role for the regulator or for government in supporting the most vulnerable children and disseminating alerts about emerging online threats for young people.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Chapter two: Regulatory framework</p><p>1. The Online Harms White Paper set out the intention to bring in a new duty of care on companies towards their users, with an independent regulator to oversee this framework. The approach will be proportionate and risk-based with the duty of care designed to ensure companies have appropriate systems and processes in place to improve the safety of their users.</p><p>2. The White Paper stated that the regulatory framework will apply to online providers that supply services or tools which allow, enable or facilitate users to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with each other online. The government will set the parameters for the regulatory framework, including specifying which services are in scope of the regime, the requirements put upon them, user redress mechanisms and the enforcement powers of the regulator.</p><p>3. The consultation responses indicated that some respondents were concerned that the proposals could impact freedom of expression online. We recognise the critical importance of freedom of expression, and an overarching principle of the regulation of online harms is to protect users\u2019 rights online, including the rights of children and freedom of expression. In fact, the new regulatory framework will not require the removal of specific pieces of legal content. Instead, it will focus on the wider systems and processes that platforms have in place to deal with online harms, while maintaining a proportionate and risk-based approach.</p><p>4. To ensure protections for freedom of expression, regulation will establish differentiated expectations on companies for illegal content and activity, versus conduct that may not be illegal but has the potential to cause harm, such as online bullying, intimidation in public life, or self-harm and suicide imagery.</p><p>5. In-scope services will need to ensure that illegal content is removed expeditiously and that the risk of it appearing is minimised by effective systems. Reflecting the threat to national security and the physical safety of children, companies will be required to take particularly robust action to tackle terrorist content and online child sexual exploitation and abuse.</p><p>6. Companies will be able to decide what type of legal content or behaviour is acceptable on their services. They will need to set this out in clear and accessible terms and conditions and enforce these effectively, consistently and transparently.</p><p>7. We do not expect there to be a code of practice for each category of harmful content. We recognise that this would pose an unreasonable regulatory burden on in-scope services. However, we will publish interim codes of practice in the coming months to provide guidance for companies on how to tackle online terrorist and CSEA content and activity. The codes will be voluntary but are intended to bridge the gap and incentivise companies to take early action prior to the regulator becoming operational, thus continuing to promote behaviour change from industry on the most serious online harms. We are continuing to engage with key stakeholders in the development of the codes to ensure that they are effective.</p><p>8. We will expect the regulator to set expectations around imagery that may not be visibly illegal, but is linked to child sexual exploitation and abuse, for example, a series of images, some of which were taken prior to or after the act of abuse itself. We will consider further how to address this issue through the duty of care.</p><p>9. The legislation will only apply to companies that provide services which facilitate the sharing of user generated content or user interactions, for example through comments, forums or video sharing. Only a very small proportion of UK businesses (estimated to account for less than 5%) fit within that definition. To ensure clarity, guidance would be provided to help businesses understand whether or not the services they provide would fall into the scope of the regulation.</p><p>10. To be in scope, a business\u2019s own website would need to provide functionalities that enable sharing of user generated content or user interactions. We will introduce this legislation proportionately. We will pay particular attention to minimising the regulatory burden on small businesses and where there is a lower risk of harm occurring.</p><p>11. We have listened to and taken into account feedback from industry stakeholders. It is clear that business-to-business services have very limited opportunities to prevent harm occurring to individuals and as such remain out of scope of the Duty of Care.</p><p>12. We are continuing the work on the final details of the organisations in scope, to ensure proportionality and effective implementation of our proposals. We will produce an impact assessment to accompany legislation which will take into account burdens to businesses.</p><p>Activities and organisations in scope</p><p>Are proposals for the online platforms and services in scope of the regulatory framework a suitable basis for an effective and proportionate approach?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>13. Throughout our engagement, organisations expressed support for the targeted, proportionate, and risk-based approach for the regulator. Many parties expressed a need for clarity as the proposals develop around the kind of organisation and platforms that would be in scope.</p><p>14. The tech industry, while broadly supportive, emphasised the importance of providing clear definitions of the companies and harms in scope, in particular addressing what is meant by \u2018user generated content\u2019. A number of organisations suggested that business to business (B2B) services should not be in scope, as their view was that there was a lower risk that the harms covered in the White Paper would develop on such platforms. Press freedom organisations and media actors also expressed the view that journalistic content should not be in scope, to protect freedom of expression and in accordance with established conventions of press regulation.</p><p>15. Civil society organisations representing disadvantaged groups demonstrated strong support for the proposals and emphasised the importance of including any provider of a platform or service made available to users in the UK within the scope of the regulation. Women\u2019s groups , LGBT+, disability, and religious groups cited larger social media companies most frequently as the platforms of greatest concern, but were also concerned about smaller platforms, chat rooms, and anonymous apps, which they believe can easily be infiltrated for harm. A number of organisations suggested that economic harms (for instance, fraud) should be in scope. While the White Paper was clear that the list of harms provided was not intended to be exhaustive or definitive, a number of organisations suggested specific harms, for example misogyny. Many civil society organisations also raised concerns about the inclusion of harms which are harder to identify, such as disinformation, citing concerns of the impact this could have on freedom of expression.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>16. Just over half of respondents to the written consultation answered this question. Responses which expressed support for the proposed platforms and activities in scope called on the government to increase education and public awareness of online harms. Responses also stressed the need to ensure that the proposals remain flexible and able to change as technology develops in the future, and that they maintain a special focus on young people and children.</p><p>17. Many respondents expressed concerns around the potential for the scope of the regulator to be too broad or for it to have an adverse impact on freedom of expression. Many of these respondents, therefore, called for further clarification of services and harms in scope. Some respondents also raised concerns that the proposals would have disproportionate impacts on specific organisations or, on the other hand, that they may not go far enough.</p><p>A systems based approach to online safety</p><p>The White Paper outlined a systems based approach:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The duty of care is designed to ensure companies have appropriate systems and processes in place to improve the safety of their users.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The focus on robust processes and systems rather than individual pieces of content means it will remain effective even as new harms emerge. It will also ensure that service providers develop, clearly communicate and enforce their own thresholds for harmful but legal content.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Of course, companies will be required to take particularly robust action to tackle terrorist content and online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse. The new regulatory framework will not remove companies\u2019 existing duty to remove illegal content.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>18. When broken down, the responses from organisations and members of the public differed in regard to the main perceived issues. For instance, concerns for freedom of expression were significantly more prevalent amongst individual respondents than amongst organisations. Instead, organisations reported a higher concern around the overreach of scope and a need for further clarity.</p><p>19. In general, organisations were more supportive of regulation when compared to public respondents. The tech sector and civil society groups expressed a level of support for the activities listed in scope, with many agreeing that focus should be on risk of harm, and that the regulator should take a proportionate approach to the companies in scope according to their risk profile.</p><p>20. At the same time, almost all industry respondents asked for greater clarity about definitions of harms, and highlighted the subjectivity inherent in identifying many of the harms, especially those which are legal. The majority of respondents objected to the latter being in scope.</p><p>21. Regarding harms in scope, several respondents stated that the 23 harms listed in the White Paper were overly broad and argued that too many codes of practice would cause confusion, duplication, and potentially, an over-reliance on removal of content by risk-averse companies. We do not expect there to be a code of practice for each category of harmful content, however, as set out above we intend to publish interim codes of practice on how to tackle online terrorist and Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (CSEA) content and activity in the coming months.</p><p>22. Specific groups echoed many of the general points raised in the written consultation, as well as suggesting specific services for inclusion in scope. For example, counter-extremism and religious groups noted the need for clarity to ensure that harms can properly be protected against and to minimise risks to constraining free expression. A common perspective among children\u2019s charities was that gaming should be in scope.</p><p>23. Across responses and engagement, there was broad support for the proposed targeted, proportionate and risk-based approach that the regulator is expected to take. Responses also highlighted the need to ensure that proposals remain flexible and able to respond as technology develops in the future. However, companies and stakeholders wanted more detail on the breadth of both services and harms in scope. There was also a consistent focus on ensuring that freedom of expression was protected. Respondents welcomed the focus on protecting vulnerable users, including young people and children, and a number of respondents also suggested that further work should be done to increase education and public awareness of online harms.</p><p>User redress</p><p>24. The White Paper recognised that companies\u2019 claims of having a strong track record on online safety are often at odds with users\u2019 reported experiences. The White Paper made clear that, under the new duty of care, government expects companies to ensure they have effective, accessible complaints and reporting mechanisms for users to raise concerns about specific pieces of harmful content or activity and seek redress, or to raise wider concerns that the company has breached its duty of care. The White Paper also highlighted a role for designated bodies to make \u2018super complaints\u2019 to the regulator to defend the needs of users.</p><p>25. The regulator will have oversight of these processes, including through transparency information about the volume and outcome of complaints, and the power to require improvements where necessary. The regulator will be focused on oversight of complaints processes, it will not make decisions on individual pieces of content.</p><p>26. Recognising concerns about freedom of expression, while the regulator will not investigate or adjudicate on individual complaints, companies will be required to have effective and proportionate user redress mechanisms which will enable users to report harmful content and to challenge content takedown where necessary. This will give users clearer, more effective and more accessible avenues to question content takedown, which is an important safeguard for the right to freedom of expression. These processes will need to be transparent, in line with terms and conditions, and consistently applied.</p><p>Should designated bodies be able to bring super complaints to the regulator in specific and clearly evidenced circumstances? If your answer is yes, in what circumstances should this happen?</p><p>What, if any, other measures should the government consider for users who wish to raise concerns about specific pieces of harmful content or activity, and/or breaches of the duty of care?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>27. While the written consultation did not directly ask about internal company processes, many organisations shared their views in written responses and in supporting stakeholder engagement. They overwhelmingly agreed that companies should have effective and accessible mechanisms for reporting harmful content and felt that current processes often fell short. They agreed that this process should start with reports directly to the platform. Some respondents, including disability and children\u2019s advocates, noted the importance of making these mechanisms accessible and prominent for all users, as they are often not easy to find on websites. Some also noted the importance of companies providing explanations to users whose content is removed, in order to protect rights and to help all users understand what is acceptable on different platforms. Some respondents also argued for a more standardised approach to reporting complaints to enable comparison and analysis.</p><p>28. A number of organisations highlighted concerns about a potential risk that the regulator would become the arbiter of what is considered harmful and the potential impact of this on freedom of expression.</p><p>29. A recurrent theme in organisational responses was that more effective complaints and reporting processes must also be accompanied by education and awareness-raising by companies and other stakeholders, including on people\u2019s rights and responsibilities and the avenues available to them to raise concerns. Nevertheless, as the section summarising responses to the question of how users should be educated shows, there was no consensus on which body or bodies should be responsible for educating users.</p><p>30. We stated that we do not envisage a role for the regulator itself in determining disputes between individuals and companies. Several organisations agreed with this, noting that it would not be feasible for the regulator to look into individual complaints and that it could risk users\u2019 rights to freedom of expression. Other respondents instead suggested that the regulator should have powers to look at specific cases, for example those which are particularly high-profile or serious.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>31. The White Paper written consultation included a specific question on whether legislative provision should be made for designated bodies to bring \u2018super-complaints\u2019 to the regulator for consideration, in specific and clearly evidenced circumstances. 88% of respondents online answered this question, of whom almost a third (32%) agreed with the proposal and almost half (49%) disagreed. The remainder (19%) said they did not know.</p><p>Figure 1: Should designated bodies be able to bring super complaints to the regulator in specific and clearly evidenced circumstances? Note: \u200bOnline portal respondents only.</p><p>32. When considering organisational responses only, the proportion of respondents who agreed with the proposal rises to almost two-thirds (63%). The majority of stakeholders with whom we engaged also supported super-complaints. Many noted that super-complaints could prove particularly useful for tackling issues regarding legal harms, which cannot be addressed through law enforcement agency routes. Groups representing religious users felt that super-complaints could provide an effective means to address online discrimination and abuse. Disability and children\u2019s advocacy groups, as well as some academics, were especially supportive, noting that super-complaints would allow for people who might not otherwise raise concerns or report issues to be heard and to have their concerns alerted to the regulator.</p><p>33. Several organisational respondents sought further clarity on how a super-complaints function would work in practice, and others (including regulators with super-complaint functions) noted that they are not normally intended to deliver direct redress to individuals. Women\u2019s charities expressed support, but noted that other mechanisms may be necessary, for example in the case of low-level continuous harassment, which causes distress through its repetitiveness rather than its content. Some respondents also noted that a super-complaints function would only be effective if it was transparent and backed up by accountability mechanisms.</p><p>34. For those answering \u2018yes\u2019, we asked a further question on the circumstances under which super complaints should be admissible. Among organisational respondents, there was a high level of agreement that super-complaints should be permitted when there has been a large number of complaints or where there is evidence of clear abuses of company policy or standards. However , there was little consensus on what the criteria would look like in practice. There were relatively few individual responses to this question, as individuals responding online were only shown the question if they had responded \u2018yes\u2019 to part one. Of those individuals who did respond, there was little consensus, although in general individuals were more supportive than organisations of super-complaints regarding specific pieces of content.</p><p>35. We also consulted on other measures for users who wish to raise concerns about specific pieces of harmful content or activity, and/or breaches of the duty of care. Less than two fifths of respondents answered this question, and while the majority of responses expressed general disagreement with the proposals, a significant number expressed support and proposed options for users to raise concerns.</p><p>36. Many responses, particularly from organisations, argued for an independent review mechanism, such as an ombudsman, although no-one gave further detail on how this could work and some organisations raised concerns about the feasibility and desirability of an ombudsman. Other proposals included the possibility for automatic suspensions of reported posts on request by regulator or individuals.</p><p>37. While many individual respondents raised concerns about freedom of expression and how the envisaged user redress framework will be implemented in practice, there was a general consensus amongst organisations about the need for effective and accessible mechanisms for users to seek redress, and in favour of the measures we proposed.</p><p>Protecting users\u2019 rights online</p><p>The White Paper stressed that users should receive timely, clear and transparent responses to their complaints of harmful content and committed to protecting their rights.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Companies covered by the regulator will be required to have an effective, proportionate, easy-to-access complaints process, allowing users to raise concerns about harmful content or activity, or that the company has breached its duty of care.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The regulator will set minimum standards for these processes, so that users will know how they can raise a complaint, how long it will take a company to investigate, and what response they can expect.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>We do not envisage a role for the regulator itself in determining disputes between individuals and companies, but where users raise concerns with the regulator, it will be able to use this information as part of its consideration of whether a company may have breached duty of care.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>38. The importance of ensuring that companies should have effective reporting mechanisms for harmful content, accessible to all users, was highlighted here. There was stronger support for the proposals for super-complaints from organisations responding than from individuals, with organisations highlighting that super-complaints could provide particularly useful for addressing legal-but-harmful content prevalent on some platforms. Broadly, respondents requested more support on how a super-complaints function could work, and how it could take into account accountability and transparency mechanisms. A number of respondents suggested a role for an independent review mechanism.</p><p>Transparency</p><p>39. As set out in the White Paper, the government has committed to giving the regulator the power to require annual transparency reports from companies in scope. These reports would, for example, outline the prevalence of harmful content on their platforms, and what measures are being taken to address these.</p><p>40. The regulator would publish these reports online to support users and parents in making informed decisions about internet use. The regulator would also have powers to require additional information from companies to inform its oversight or enforcement activity, and to establish requirements to disclose information.</p><p>41. Effective transparency reporting will help ensure that content removal is well-founded and freedom of expression is protected. In particular, increasing transparency around the reasons behind, and prevalence of, content removal may address concerns about some companies\u2019 existing processes for removing content. Companies\u2019 existing processes have in some cases been criticised for being opaque and hard to challenge.</p><p>42. In addition, as part of the transparency reporting framework, the regulator will encourage companies to share anonymised information with independent researchers, and ensure companies make relevant information available.</p><p>43. The government is committed to ensuring that conversations about this policy are ongoing, and that stakeholders are being engaged to mitigate concerns. In order to achieve this, we have recently established a multi-stakeholder Transparency Working Group chaired by the Minister for Digital and Broadband, which includes representation from all sides of the debate, including civil society members as well as industry. This group will feed into the government\u2019s transparency report, which was announced in the Online Harms White Paper and which we intend to publish in the coming months.</p><p>44. Some stakeholders expressed concerns about a potential \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to transparency, and the material costs for companies associated with reporting. The regulatory framework is designed to be proportionate, and so will set out minimum thresholds that a company would need to meet before reporting requirements would apply. In line with the overarching principles of the regulatory framework, the reporting requirements that a company may have to comply with will also vary in proportion with the type of service that is being provided, and the risk factors involved.</p><p>The government has committed to Annual Transparency Reporting. Beyond the measures set out in this White Paper, should the government do more to build a culture of transparency, trust and accountability across industry and, if so, what?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>45. Transparency has been a key theme discussed with a range of organisations and user groups. A wide variety of stakeholders, including rights groups and tech companies, supported such measures and agreed that increased transparency is needed. Children\u2019s charities, LGBT+ organisations and religious groups especially welcomed the framework\u2019s focus on transparency - both in terms of reporting processes and moderation practices for the purpose of holding companies accountable to their own standards. Freedom of expression groups were similarly supportive of greater transparency and accountability but were keen to emphasise that transparency reporting should promote users\u2019 rights and should contain information about how companies uphold users\u2019 right to freedom of expression online.</p><p>46. The importance of proportionality in relation to the transparency requirements emerged as a key point. Furthermore, a number of companies noted that, given the variation between companies, a \u2018one size fits all approach\u2019 was unlikely to be effective.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>47. The written consultation asked people whether, beyond the measures set out in the White Paper, the government should do more to build a culture of transparency, trust and accountability across industry and, if so, what? 90% of online respondents answered this closed question. Of these, there was little difference between those who agreed the government should do more and those who disagreed (41% and 39% respectively). Almost a fifth (19%) said they didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Figure 2: The government has committed to Annual Transparency Reporting. Beyond the measures set out in this White Paper, should the government do more to build a culture of transparency, trust and accountability across industry? Note: \u200bOnline portal respondents only.</p><p>48. When broken down, the responses from organisations and members of the public differ, with 72% of organisations agreeing that the government should do more, compared to only 39% of individuals.</p><p>49. Those who agreed that the government should do more provided answers for how and what measures could go beyond the White Paper proposals to increase transparency. A large proportion of responses suggested this could be done through requiring increased clarity and detail of reporting. Many responses also suggested that engagement with international partners would help to promote a culture of transparency and trust.</p><p>50. In particular, amongst organisations, civil society groups were considerably more supportive of the proposals advanced in the White Paper around transparency, which they saw as a crucial mechanism to increase companies\u2019 accountability and foster positive relationships with the regulator. While the technology sector was also overall broadly supportive of transparency, there was less consensus about the format the reporting should take. Some small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) highlighted resource and capability challenges associated with collecting or reporting certain types of information. Other respondents, including dating sites and retailers, echoed this concern, stating that transparency reporting might be overly onerous on them should it require significant re-engineering of their given product or service if it had not been designed to gather certain types of data. Generally, respondents expressed support for flexibility over rigid guidelines, although, at the same time, some did acknowledge the benefit of having structure and direction from the regulator.</p><p>51. Many responses also explicitly mentioned that reporting should be qualitative, not just quantitative, avoiding a one size fits all approach, and that the data reported should be clear and meaningful. Respondents also asked that transparency reports be written in plain English and made accessible to the public.</p><p>52. Responses from both organisations and individuals contained specific proposals for how to increase transparency. These proposals included requiring social media companies to show how safety features are being improved in line with the regulator\u2019s recommendations. Other suggestions included: increased transparency from social media platforms on content moderation decisions, involving the public in formulating online harms policy and encouraging social media companies to promote their own transparency reports to their users.</p><p>53. Responses also suggested specific focal points and metrics for the transparency report, such as an independent review of AI/algorithms, an attention to \u2018addiction by design,\u2019 a specific separate focus on child safety, advertising, and finally expert medical advice.</p><p>54. Additionally, although not directly relevant to the question, many responses took the opportunity to suggest an increase in government transparency and that any future regulator should also be transparent.</p><p>55. Many of those who disagreed that the government should do more asserted that government should not be involved or should be less involved. Other responses attested that it was not possible to hold the companies in scope to account.</p><p>56. Overall, responses to this question varied, expressing suggestions for what government should do to increase transparency, trust and accountability across industry, as well as some respondents expressing concerns with an increasing government role.</p><p>Enforcement</p><p>57. The regulator will have a range of enforcement powers to take action against companies that fail to fulfil their duty of care. This will drive rapid remedial action, and ensure that non-compliance faces serious consequences. The enforcement powers referenced are the power to issue warnings, notices and substantial fines. The White Paper also included proposals for business disruption measures - including potential for business disruption, Internet Service provider (ISP) blocking, senior management liability.</p><p>Should the regulator be empowered to i) disrupt business activities, or ii) undertake ISP blocking, or iii) implement a regime for senior management liability? What, if any, further powers should be available to the regulator?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>58. Throughout our engagement, industry representatives ranging from larger tech firms to start-up companies expressed a measure of support for the tiered enforcement approach set out in the White Paper. At the same time, they asked for further clarity on what would be considered appropriate points for intervention and escalation, as well as what limits could be considered reasonable for sanctions in order for these not to represent an unacceptable business risk. Internet service provider (ISP) blocking represented the main area of concern across discussions. Industry stated in principle support in some cases (e.g when websites are set up for solely unlawful purposes), but argued that it would need to be mandated only as a last resort following due process and underpinned by the legal framework.</p><p>59. Senior manager liability emerged as an area of concern. Discussions with industry highlighted the risk of potential negative impacts on the attractiveness of the UK tech sector. Further concerns emerged that this approach may unduly penalise individuals for content often originating from other third-parties who would not be adversely affected by the sanctions, unless the regime proposed is able to account for these. With regard to further powers, industry representatives felt that the regulator should fulfill a supervisory function and look to support compliance in the first instance.</p><p>60. Civil society groups overall expressed support for firm enforcement actions, in cases of non-compliance. Nevertheless, rights organisations expressed concerns about risks to freedom of expression and the potential impact of censorship associated with enforcement powers.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>61. The written consultation specifically asked whether the regulator should be empowered to:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>disrupt business activities</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>undertake ISP blocking</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>implement a regime for senior management liability</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>62. We also asked if any further powers should be available to the regulator.</p><p>63. This question did not receive a high response rate. Across all categories, the majority of respondents highlighted concerns that excessive enforcement could have a detrimental effect on both business and personal freedoms - and risk that measures could incentivise companies to over-block user-generated content to avoid penalties.</p><p>64. Analysis of the responses of organisations and individuals showed a large difference in levels of support - with a significantly larger portion of concerns coming from the individual respondents, while organisations generally supported the proposals. This result is not surprising given the apprehension amongst many individual respondents about how the proposals would impact usability and personal freedoms. The creative industries, sport sector, local government, law enforcement organisations and children\u2019s charities particularly expressed broad support for the majority of enforcement mechanisms listed in the White Paper.</p><p>65. Respondents who supported the proposals took the view that the regulator should have robust enforcement powers that are used fairly and proportionately.</p><p>66. Respondents expressing support for the business disruption proposals highlighted the importance of the need to ensure these powers are used proportionately and should be an escalation from demonstrable non-compliance and prior warnings being issued. This view was also expressed for senior management liability. Many who welcomed it as a measure to hold individuals to account felt it should only be used after demonstrable non-compliance and the failure of previous measures. For ISP blocking the common view was that it be used as a last resort. A small number of respondents suggested additional powers, including further enforcement measures against companies such as temporary content takedowns, and sanctions for failing to duly protect freedom of expression.</p><p>67. Organisations raised other points of criticism. Rights groups expressed concerns that the proposed enforcement approach may be disproportionately punitive, and the regulator would need to demonstrate it had met the proportionality test for freedom of expression under human rights law. This was a particular concern for ISP blocking.</p><p>68. Although many industry members noted their opposition to ISP blocking in general, they acknowledged that there may be circumstances in which the exercise of such powers would be appropriate. Practically, industry requested clear guidance and an agreed process for notifying operators when websites are required to be blocked (or reinstated), and clarification on the anticipated volume of websites that would be in scope.</p><p>69. From a technical perspective, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) also noted the importance of developing the future regulation with reference to wider technical developments such as encryption, which might undermine the effectiveness of website blocking. Industry requested a transition period to adjust to or implement the new regulations without the threat of severe sanctions. Larger tech companies highlighted the implementation challenges they may have due to the size and complexity of their systems.</p><p>70. In summary, while civil society groups overall expressed support for firm enforcement actions, the proposals remain contentious for industry, freedom of expression groups, and members of the public. For the implementation of the proposed measures, respondents expressed a preference for the regulator to begin its operations by supervising companies and supporting compliance through advice, and that any further enforcement measures should be used proportionately and following a clear process.</p><p>Nominated Representative</p><p>71. Noting the particularly serious nature of some of the harms in scope and the global nature of many online services, the White Paper proposed that the regulator should have the power to ensure that action can be taken against companies without a legal presence in the UK. It sets out the possibility of a requirement for companies to nominate a UK or EEA-based representative for these purposes, similar to the concept in the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><p>Should the regulator have the power to require a company based outside the UK or EEA to appoint a nominated representative in the UK or EEA in certain circumstances?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>72. Throughout our engagement with industry, concerns of impracticality and challenges of implementation emerged as a key theme, with SMEs arguing that this could be excessively burdensome for them. Some proposed other ideas, such as the establishment of an endorsement system for companies demonstrating best practice.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>73. Less than half of online respondents answered this question (48%), of which almost two thirds (62%) responded\u201cno\u201d, followed by \u201cyes\u201d (27%) and \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d (11%). Respondents to the written consultation generally disagreed that the regulator should have the power to require a company based outside the UK or EEA to appoint a nominated UK or EEA representative.</p><p>Figure 3: Should the regulator have the power to require a company based outside the UK or EEA to appoint a nominated representative in the UK or EEA in certain circumstances? Note: \u200bOnline portal respondents only.</p><p>74. When broken down by organisations and members of the public, the responses are contrasting, with the majority of organisations responding \u201cyes\u201d (63%) as opposed to less than a quarter of individuals (24%). Furthermore, the proportion of those that responded \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d is larger amongst organisations than members of the public (25% and 10% respectively).</p><p>75. Across both groups, among those who agreed that the regulator should have the power to require a UK or EEA representative, many responses focused on this being necessary to support international consistency and cooperation. A large proportion of these responses highlighted a need for increased international dialogue, followed by consideration of issues such as online harms being too complex to be regulated in a single country.</p><p>76. Responses from organisations in particular often suggested that a representative would be necessary to enable UK legislation to be effective, aid the implementation of regulation and making it harder for companies to avoid complying.</p><p>77. Additionally, many responses suggested that the requirement to have a UK or EEA representative should only apply to organisations over a certain size or with a particular user base, echoing a theme that regulation should be proportionate.</p><p>78. Of the majority of all respondents who disagreed with the proposed requirement, the most common concern was around the potential negative impact on business. Some small business respondents explicitly expressed disagreement, feeling that this proposal would impose costs and demands that will negatively affect them.</p><p>79. Other concerns included: potential for a negative impact on users; a lack of effectiveness when the UK leaves the European Union; and concerns over how it could be practically enforced.</p><p>80. Overall, it is clear that the impacts of nominated representation on business costs and operations is a point of concern for industry, and SMEs in particular.</p><p>Regulatory advice</p><p>81. The White Paper set out how the regulator will take a proportionate approach, with reasonable expectations of companies dependent on both the severity and scale of the harm, the age of their users and the size of the company and resources available to it. The White Paper also set out the principles of better regulation, including a commitment for the regulator to help SMEs and start-ups to fulfill their obligations for compliance.</p><p>82. The written consultation asked how the regulator could provide advice and support to help businesses comply with the regulatory framework, acknowledging the potential for specific impacts to SMEs and start-ups.</p><p>What, if any, advice or support could the regulator provide to help businesses, particularly start-ups and SMEs, comply with the regulatory framework?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>83. Throughout our engagement with industry, the main ask was for the regulator to provide clarity over any specific standards as a basis for the new regulation.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>84. Written responses provided a variety of suggestions for how the regulator could provide support to businesses. The most common response from both organisations and individuals was for guidelines and expert advice on how organisations need to comply, and for a need for effective engagement strategies.</p><p>85. Some responses made suggestions about the approach to regulation more generally, suggesting exemptions for start-ups and SMEs and a differentiated approach depending on the business type. Respondents also highlighted that engagement would need to be clear on how regulation interacts with international legal obligations. A number of responses, the majority from individuals, also expressed disagreement with the implicit assumption in the question that a regulator would be established, possibly further impacted by confusion in the role of regulators amongst some responses. A small proportion expressed that no advice or support should be provided to help businesses.</p><p>86. Organisations particularly emphasised the need for support and advice. SMEs and cloud service providers emphasised that they would like to see the regulator have an open door policy with business stakeholders and begin its operation offering advice through resources and \u201chow-to\u201d guides. Similarly, other respondents advanced suggestions that the regulator offer, and have the power to charge for, specific advice services to companies that request detailed advice on how they can comply with the regulations.</p><p>87. It is clear that organisations, particularly SMEs, want the regulator to provide guidance on how different services can fulfil the duty of care. Organisations also want to be able to contact the regulator for more tailored advice. They feel that the regulator should be able to provide advice at an early stage of its operation.</p><p>Private communications</p><p>88. The White Paper acknowledged both the importance of privacy online and the aim to protect UK users from harmful content or behaviour wherever it occurs online. It noted that criminals should not be able to exploit the online space to conduct illegal activity. The development of harmful activity online frequently involves a combination of activity taking place on both \u2018public\u2019 and \u2018private\u2019 communication channels. For example, people targeting children to commit serious online harms often make initial contact with a child on public social media platforms, before moving to private messaging services to continue the grooming process. The White Paper consulted on what criteria should be considered in developing a definition for \u2018private\u2019 communication services, noting the complexity of defining \u2018private\u2019 and \u2018public\u2019 in the online space.</p><p>89. Reflecting the importance of privacy, the White Paper committed to setting out a framework that will ensure a differentiated approach for private communication. The White Paper consulted on which channels or forums which could be considered private should be in scope of the regulatory framework. It asked what specific requirements might be appropriate to apply to private channels and forums in order to tackle online harms.</p><p>In developing a definition for private communications, what criteria should be considered?</p><p>Which channels or forums that can be considered private should be in scope of the regulatory framework?</p><p>What specific requirements might be appropriate to apply to private channels and forums in order to tackle online harms?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>90. We engaged with experts from academia, industry, think tanks and wider civil society organisations on the questions of defining private communications, the scope of the regulatory framework in relation to private channels, and what requirements should be applied to private channels.</p><p>91. Throughout our engagement, organisations representing vulnerable groups expressed strong support for private communications falling in scope of the regulatory framework. Children\u2019s charities were particularly insistent that community forums, chat rooms and messaging apps all need to be in scope, providing evidence of how people targeting children to commit serious online harms use these services to groom and abuse children.</p><p>92. Industry representatives and some civil society groups expressed concern that to include private channels in scope might lead platforms to take steps that create unacceptable, negative impacts on users\u2019 privacy. Some civil society groups were more comfortable with online platforms empowering users to themselves report harmful activity on private channels, but expressed concern about more intrusive steps such as proactive moderation of private channels. Most companies and organisations agreed that the regulator\u2019s expectations of companies to tackle harms on private services should be greater where the content and activity is illegal and/or where children are involved.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>93. Around a third of respondents answered question 6. Organisations were more likely to advance criteria for defining private communications than individual respondents. A common response was that user intent and purpose of the service should be taken into account when considering if a communication is private.</p><p>94. Several responses from organisations stated that one-to-one phone calls, messages, and video calls should not be included in scope and cautioned against using the number of users as the sole indicator for whether a communication is private. However, others state that identifying a maximum number of people beyond which a conversation is no longer considered private could be helpful.</p><p>95. In terms of which fora and services should be in scope, many organisations responded \u201cnone\u201d, and only a small proportion responded \u201call\u201d. In between these two, the other most common responses were based on suggestions for specific activities or platforms.</p><p>96. Those who answered \u201cnone\u201d with regard to which private services should be in scope, when elaborating on their answer, argued that the presence of a blocking feature on a private service, enabling users to block content from other individuals, is sufficient for tackling harm. These respondents argued for the need to respect user privacy and also maintained that encrypted services be ruled out of scope.</p><p>97. Among those who expressed agreement with including private communications in scope, a large portion of responses from organisations mentioned specific activities and platforms to include, such as social media, dating, and gaming sites as well as services enabling private messaging, and video and photo sharing. These responses identified the significance of private communications as spaces where harms can be planned and carried out. Some responses also expressed concern about the migration of illegal activity - such as child grooming and the sharing of child abuse imagery - to encrypted spaces, arguing that encrypted services should be in scope.</p><p>98. Those respondents - both organisations and individuals - who responded \u2018none\u2019 to the question of which private services should be in scope also tended to answer \u2018none\u2019 to the question of which requirements should be applied to private services.</p><p>99. Those respondents who agreed that some private communication services should be in scope provided a range of answers to the question of which requirements should be applied to private services. These included suggestions of requirements which might limit the impact on users\u2019 privacy. For example, responses suggested that platforms should offer reporting mechanisms allowing users to report abusive or offensive content sent to them privately - a process, which would not require companies to monitor private messages for harm.</p><p>100. In conclusion, overall respondents opposed the inclusion of private communication services in scope of regulation. However, there was acknowledgement in some responses - both from individuals and organisations - that abuse, and harassment and some of the most serious illegal activity occur in private spaces, like closed community forums and chat rooms. These responses expressed support for the principle that platforms should be responsible for their users\u2019 safety in private channels.</p><p>Appeals</p><p>101. The White Paper acknowledged that companies and others must have confidence that the regulator is acting fairly and within its powers. As with other regulatory systems, companies will have the ability to seek a judicial review of the regulator\u2019s decisions through the High Court. The White Paper also considered other avenues of appeal and asked whether there should be a further statutory mechanism for companies to appeal against a decision of the regulator. We gave the example of section 192-196 of the Communications Act 2003, through which there is the ability to appeal against an Ofcom decision via the Competition Appeal Tribunal.</p><p>In addition to judicial review should there be a statutory mechanism for companies to appeal against a decision of the regulator, as exists in relation to Ofcom under sections 192-196 of the Communications Act 2003?</p><p>If your answer to question 14 is \u2018yes\u2019, in what circumstances should companies be able to use this statutory mechanism?</p><p>If your answer to question 14 is \u2018yes\u2019, should the appeal be decided on the basis of the principles that would be applied on an application for judicial review or on the merits of the case?</p><p>Engagement</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>During engagement, companies suggested that the appeals mechanism should be quick and affordable, and focused on the merits of the action taken. Companies mentioned blocking measures and app removal as areas where they would especially seek to be able to appeal regulator decisions. Companies also emphasised that for an appeals mechanism involving judicial scrutiny, an administrative process as seamless as possible would be needed to minimise bureaucratic burdens, and accelerate the process. SMEs expressed support for additional mechanisms other than Judicial Review due to concerns around the costs and overall accessibility of the latter.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Written consultation</p><p>Figure 4: In addition to judicial review should there be a statutory mechanism for companies to appeal against a decision of the regulator, as exists in relation to Ofcom under sections 192-196 of the Communications Act 2003? Note: \u200bOnline portal respondents only.</p><p>103. Less than half of all online portal respondents (48%) answered this question. Of those who did over two thirds (71%) of respondents were in favour of such an additional statutory mechanism. 15% of respondents disagreed with such a mechanism and the remaining 14% said they did not know.</p><p>104. A relatively large proportion of respondents suggested specific circumstances where access to this appeal mechanism should be allowed. Respondents suggested that the mechanism be available in cases where decisions related to legal content that is not harmful, when it is claimed that the best effort was made to deal with an issue by the company, when the penalty applied is considered disproportionate, and if a company is adversely affected financially and operationally.</p><p>105. The second supplementary question (question 14b) asked whether the appeal should be decided on the basis of the principles that would be applied on an application for judicial review (i.e whether the regulator in reaching its decision had acted lawfully and fairly) or on the merits of the specific case. An appeal on the merits of the case would involve a full reappraisal of both the facts and the applicable law relating to the regulator\u2019s original decision. The majority of responses were in favour of an appeal being decided on the merits of the case, but with minimal further commentary about the reasons for this preference.</p><p>106. Overall, responses were supportive of companies in scope of regulation being able to appeal decisions, offering a range of circumstances when companies may need to do this. Respondents did not provide further details about the advantages of a statutory appeals body in particular or how the duties of such a body could be discharged.</p><p>Chapter three: The regulator</p><p>1. The White Paper stated that the online harms regime will be overseen and enforced by an independent regulator. To inform the set up of this regulator, we asked a number of questions about the identity of the regulator, its funding model and accountability to Parliament.</p><p>2. The White Paper also explained that the government is carefully considering whether a broader restructuring of the regulatory landscape would reduce the risk of duplication and minimise burdens on business. Over the coming months we will engage experts, regulators, industry, civil society and the wider public to ensure our overarching regulatory regime for digital technologies is fully coherent, efficient, and effective. This is part of an ambitious programme of wider work to unlock the huge opportunities presented by digital technologies whilst minimising the risks.</p><p>Proportionality</p><p>What further steps could be taken to ensure the regulator will act in a targeted and proportionate manner?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>3. In our engagement with industry, companies suggested a model whereby companies self assess whether their services are in scope, notifying the regulator if something goes wrong, and where members of the public would be able to raise concerns with the regulator where a company is not complying. Another suggestion was that, similar to the banking regulatory model, the regulator could build the scope through dialogue with industry, designating systemically important services on which higher responsibilities would be placed.</p><p>4. Freedom of expression groups suggested that further transparency requirements placed on the regulator, and the incorporation of a duty to respect freedom of expression within the codes of practice, would also serve to ensure proportionality.</p><p>5. The consideration of freedom of expression is at the heart of our policy development, and we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are included throughout the legislation. By reducing the prevalence of online abuse, we are confident that our approach will support more people to enjoy their right to freedom of expression and participate in online discussions.</p><p>6. At the same time, we also remain confident that proposals as set out here will not place an undue burden on business. Companies will be expected to take reasonable and proportionate steps to protect users. This will vary according to the organisation\u2019s size and the resources available to it, as well as by the risk associated with the service provided. In recognition of concerns raised about possible uncertainty about how the duty of care could be fulfilled, we will ensure that there is sufficient clarity in the regulation and codes of practice about the applicable expectations on business. This will help companies to comply with the legislation, and to feel confident that they have done so appropriately.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>7. Around half of respondents answered this question. Those who responded positively suggested that the regulator take steps to:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>adopt an international approach</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>prioritise vulnerable groups</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>issue tight guidelines and code of practice</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>clarify its scope</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>follow a code of conduct</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>work with other existing bodies from the tech sector (e.g  Ofcom)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>offer support and guidance</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>receive expert advice/evidence and</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>collaborate with industry players</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>8. Many industry respondents expressed approval for the targeted, proportionate, risk-based and systematic approach proposed in the White Paper.</p><p>9. Multiple responses proposed that the government carry out an economic impact assessment to determine the anticipated effect regulation will have upon businesses and the United Kingdom\u2019s economy. A number of individual respondents also expressed concerns, around the creation of the regulator and possible restrictions on freedom of expression.</p><p>10. In conclusion, responses identified that the government should take further steps to ensure the regulator will act in a targeted and proportionate manner. Respondents expected regulation to balance respect of freedom of expression standards, while applying reasonable requirements and providing appropriate support for business.</p><p>Proportionality</p><p>In the White Paper, we made it clear that the regulatory framework would be proportionate and that we would avoid imposing excessive burdens. For example, we said:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>All companies will be required to take reasonable and proportionate action to tackle harms on their services, but we will minimise excessive burdens, particularly on small businesses and civil society organisations.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The regulator\u2019s initial focus will be on those companies that pose the biggest and clearest risk of harm to users.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The regulator will set clear expectations of what companies should do to tackle illegal activity and keep children safe online.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The regulator will be required to assess the action of companies according to their size and resources, and the age of their users, as well as the risk and prevalence of harms on their service.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Identity of regulator</p><p>11. The White Paper proposed to establish an independent regulator to implement, oversee and enforce the regulatory framework. The regulator will be equipped with the powers, resources and expertise it needs to effectively carry out its role. Ofcom was the only regulator referenced in the White Paper as a possible candidate.</p><p>12. We judge that such a role is best served by an existing regulator with a proven track record of experience, expertise and credibility. We are minded to appoint Ofcom as they present the best fit for this role, both in terms of policy alignment and organisational experience - for instance, in their existing work, Ofcom already take the risk-based approach that we have outlined above.</p><p>13. Our proposal also sits within a wider programme of work by the government to respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by digital technology, through carefully considering the wider institutional landscape to ensure an effective overall approach to digital regulation that avoids overlap and confusion.</p><p>Should an online harms regulator be: (i) a new public body, or (ii) an existing public body? If your answer to question 10 is (ii), which body or bodies should it be?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>14. In engaging with different groups we learned that most were neutral towards the identity of the regulator. Some stakeholders felt that the scope of work envisaged by the White Paper could overwhelm an existing regulator, but at the same time organisations recognised the inherent challenges of creating a new body and setting up operations to process an enormous volume of information, and voiced support for a transitional or temporary body.</p><p>15. Several organisations expressed a preference for Ofcom to be the new regulator, citing its regulatory expertise. Some civil society groups, particularly children\u2019s charities, proposed the establishment of an interim body to reflect the urgency of the harms. Most of the big tech companies had no preference either way but stressed the point that the regulator should have the necessary capabilities, infrastructure, resources and expertise to function effectively.</p><p>16. During engagement, respondents emphasised the need for there to be consistency between existing and new regulatory regimes, with some suggesting a need for a coordinating body. In their view, the regulator should draw upon existing expertise across government and across current arrangements for self and co-regulation.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>17. In the consultation we asked whether the proposed regulator should be a new public body or an existing public body. For those respondents who preferred an existing public body, we asked which body or bodies it should be.</p><p>18. The response rate via the online portal for this question was low at 38%, and of these a majority (62%) were in favour of a new public body.</p><p>19. There were a number of different reasons for respondents expressing a preference for a new body. Both organisations and individuals believed that there was a need for a new body with specific focus and expertise in tech and online safety. Other less frequent themes such as placing too much burden on an existing regulator or the need for a regulator to be independent from government were also identified in the written responses.</p><p>20. Over a third of those responding (38%) favoured an existing body; citing a variety of reasons. The experience of existing organisations and their understanding of the sector were the two most significant and recurring advantages highlighted. Respondents also believed it would be cheaper to set up the regulator within an existing body.</p><p>Figure 5: Should an online harms regulator be: (i) a new public body, or (ii) an existing public body? If you answer to question 10 is (ii), which body or bodies should it be? Note: \u200bOnline portal respondents only.</p><p>21. The sub-question (10a) asked, where respondents had expressed a preference for an existing body, which body it should be. This question received a variety of suggestions, with Ofcom receiving the greatest level of endorsement, particularly amongst organisations.</p><p>22. Other common suggestions for the regulator were the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) and the police, and a very small proportion of respondents believed the courts should act as the regulator. Other respondents suggested a range of public and private bodies, such as the Advertising Standards Agency, or the UK Council for Internet Safety, but also government departments including DCMS, the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice.</p><p>23. Overall the response to this question demonstrated that the options on regulatory bodies for online harms come with different benefits and risks. Whilst a new body provides the opportunity for a dedicated focus and an innovative approach, it was suggested that it will be challenging to implement a new regulatory regime without the expertise, experience and organisational structure that an existing body brings.</p><p>24. We are minded to give Ofcom the role of the new regulator, in preference to giving this function to a new body or to another existing organisation. This preference is based on its organisational experience, robustness, and experience of delivering challenging, high-profile remits across a range of sectors. Ofcom is a well-established and experienced regulator, recently assuming high profile roles such as regulation of the BBC. Ofcom\u2019s focus on the communications sector means it already has relationships with many of the major players in the online arena, and its spectrum licensing duties mean that it is practised at dealing with large numbers of small businesses (both in terms of regulatory activity and fees collection). Further, Ofcom already takes a risk-based approach to investigations, similar to that envisaged for the Online Harms regulator. Ofcom would also remain subject to the Public Sector Equality Duty in its work on online harms, meaning that it must consider how its approach or decisions affect people with protected characteristics.</p><p>Funding</p><p>25. The White Paper makes clear that in order to recoup both the implementation costs and running costs of the regulator, the government is considering fees, charges or a levy on companies whose services are in scope. This could fund the full range of the regulator\u2019s activity. The government intends the new regulator to become cost neutral to the public sector.</p><p>A new or existing regulator is intended to be cost neutral: on what basis should any funding contributions from industry be determined?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>26. During engagement, companies viewed the application of a charge/tax with concern. For some, there was a risk that a regulatory charge or tax would amount to double taxation on the same businesses. Companies with only a small segment of their business activities within the scope of the regulator requested clarity on how the regulator funding would be proportionate and affordable. Others contended that an unintended consequence of the charge/tax is that it could be diverting money away from businesses who may use it to address online harms. The collection of contributions from companies based overseas, particularly from smaller companies with a higher prevalence of online harms on their platforms compared to businesses in the UK, was expressed as a further concern.</p><p>27. Finally, some companies felt that a business\u2019s revenue/profit would not be an appropriate basis on which to determine funding contributions from industry, but instead the age profile of users and work currently being undertaken by a company to combat online harms should be taken into consideration. On the other hand, the companies acknowledged that the inclusion of any non-financial measures may lead to a charge or tax being subjective.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>28. Around a third of respondents answered this question, suggesting a variety of considerations for funding contributions. The size and type of business was highlighted as being the main factor on which funding contributions should be determined. Beyond that, there was also support for licence fee/taxes on industry, from both organisations and individuals at broadly the same level.</p><p>29. There was some limited support from both individuals and organisations for the regulator to be funded by the government. There was also limited support for the regulator to be funded by fines against companies for breaking the law, and general funding from the private sector.</p><p>30. Many individual respondents expressed disagreement with the formation of the regulator, and, therefore, with the need for a funding mechanism and the proposal that industry should contribute.</p><p>31. In conclusion, respondents and stakeholders both agreed that whilst funding should primarily be from industry, the model should be proportionate and practical.</p><p>Accountability</p><p>32. The White Paper stated that the regulator will be an independent body and that it will be important to ensure that Parliament is able to scrutinise the regulator\u2019s work. We consulted on this and on what role Parliament should play in developing regulatory codes of practice.</p><p>33. As the White Paper notes, Parliament\u2019s role particularly \u201cin relation to codes of practice and guidance issued\u2026varies across different regulatory regimes, ranging from formal approval to no specific role\u201d. The starting point of accountability in the White Paper is a duty on the regulator to lay an annual report and accounts before Parliament and provide Parliament with information as and when requested.</p><p>What role should Parliament play in scrutinising the work of the regulator, including the development of codes of practice?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>34. During our engagement with stakeholders, all groups generally expressed support for Parliament to have a defined oversight role over the regulator in order to maintain independence from government and build public trust and hold industry confidence. Freedom of Expression groups advanced specific proposals calling for parliamentary oversight over codes of practice to protect fundamental freedoms. Several responses suggested establishing a dedicated body for reviewing codes to ensure consistency with civil liberties or establishing an independent Children\u2019s Digital Champion to inform and report on codes to Parliament. Some respondents suggested that the regulator should report targeted areas of concern in platform failures to allow Parliament to debate further evidence.</p><p>35. The most popular reason for giving Parliament a role, for both organisations and individuals, was the need to hold the regulator to account.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>36. Broadly, responses showed strong support for parliamentary oversight, with various ideas on how this should be carried out. Many respondents called for the regulator to draft the codes of practice independently. Some responses proposed that codes of practice should be subject to public consultation and agreed by Parliament. A limited number of organisations and individual respondents believed that Parliament should have no role in scrutinising the role of the regulator.</p><p>37. Overall, respondents generally agreed that Parliament should have an important role in scrutinising the work of the regulator. Whilst some respondents advocated a more active role for parliament in developing codes of practice, others maintained that this would encroach upon the regulator\u2019s independence.</p><p>Codes of practice</p><p>The White Paper talked about the different codes of practice that the regulator will issue to outline the processes that companies need to adopt to help demonstrate that they have fulfilled their duty of care to their users.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The kind of processes the codes of practice will focus on are systems, procedures, technologies and investment, including in staffing, training and support of human moderators.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>As such, the codes of practice will contain guidance on, for example, what steps companies should take to ensure products and services are safe by design or deliver prompt action on harmful content or activity.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Given the range of services in scope of the regulatory framework, some of the expectations below may not be applicable to every company.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The primary responsibility for each company in scope is that they will be required to complete an assessment of the risk associated with its service(s) and take reasonable steps to guard against the risk of harm in order to fulfill its duty of care.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>We do not expect there to be a code of practice for each category of harmful content, however, we intend to publish interim codes of practice on how to tackle online terrorist and Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (CSEA) content and activity in the coming months.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Chapter four: Non-legislative</p><p>1. Alongside the proposed regulatory framework, we are committed to implementing a number of non-legislative measures in order to ensure a holistic response to online harms. In order to inform these measures, the consultation asked questions about safety by design, children\u2019s online safety and media literacy.</p><p>Innovation and adoption of safety technologies</p><p>2. The White Paper set out the government\u2019s ambition to position the UK as a world leader in safety technology. It included commitments that the government and new regulator will work with leading industry bodies and other regulators to support innovation in and adoption of products and services that support user safety, and the growth of the UK\u2019s safety technology market. It proposed specific action to assess the online safety sector\u2019s capability and potential, and to explore how organisations can securely access training data to develop AI solutions while ensuring that AI use is safe and ethical.</p><p>What are the greatest opportunities and barriers for (i) innovation and (ii) adoption of safety technologies by UK organisations, and what role should government play in addressing these?</p><p>Engagement</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>During our engagement with industry, organisations emphasised that machine learning solutions required large amounts of training data. Several highlighted the opportunity for government or the regulator to enable the development of a system of common reference datasets, which third parties could use to safely and securely develop and test machine learning solutions. Organisations were supportive of the \u2018regulatory sandbox\u2019 model (ie. allowing businesses to test innovations in a controlled environment), and several respondents suggested that the data trust model could facilitate data sharing around online harms. Some organisations highlighted that machine learning still needs human assistance to identify context and nuance.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Written consultation</p><p>4. The written consultation asked respondents to identify the opportunities and barriers for innovation and adoption and to suggest how the government could work to address these. This question received a relatively low number of responses, particularly from individuals.</p><p>5. Where a response was given, a relatively large number of responses expressed disagreement with the overall proposals for regulation, with many focusing on concerns around freedom of expression. Many responses, in particular from individuals, did not engage with the different elements of the question, making it difficult in many cases to identify clear reasons for disagreement or concerns with the focus of the question.</p><p>6. Some respondents expressed concerns that regulation could stifle innovation if it was over-prescriptive, disproportionate or inflexible, or if a regulator did not have sufficient in-house technical capability. Conversely, several responses highlighted the positive role that regulators could play in supporting innovation, for example by increasing competition, preventing monopolies and addressing market failures.</p><p>7. In terms of opportunities, the most common one highlighted for innovation was the role that government could play through influence and advocacy, for example by supporting cross-sector initiatives to share technologies and ideas to tackle potential harms, and through using its convening power to help ensure closer collaboration and coordination across the value chain. In particular, organisations highlighted the positive role that groups such as the Technology Coalition and the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism played in supporting the development and adoption of cross-sector solutions, such as hash-sharing databases for illegal content. A number of respondents felt that more action was needed to strengthen the evidence base used to inform and assess technical innovations - for example, through greater research into user behaviour online.</p><p>8. Some respondents to the written consultation focused on the role that government and the regulator could play in encouraging a competitive and world-leading market in online safety solutions, through which companies of all sizes could access a range of solutions to achieve safer outcomes for users. Several organisations felt that more could be done by government to articulate priorities for investment or innovation, or to identify the standards which safety technologies should adhere; to provide assistance in linking SMEs with larger organisations; and where appropriate to fund programmes of development support for startups and scaleups, for example through accelerators or incubator programmes.</p><p>9. In terms of the opportunities highlighted for adoption of safety technologies, many responses, particularly from organisations, highlighted the need to provide companies with high-quality information, training and guidance. Some responses focused on how regulation, government influence and public pressure also had the potential to drive adoption of safety technology.</p><p>10. Many of the barriers to both innovation and adoption were similar. Organisations were particularly concerned about the cost of innovation and adoption of safety technologies, and a potential lack of clear definitions of safety standards by a regulator. There was concern that smaller platforms\u2019 ability to innovate for safety might be restricted by regulation geared toward the capabilities and needs of larger platforms.</p><p>11. Overall, the consultation response suggested a number of ways in which the government or the regulator could support the innovation and adoption of safety technology. These were suggestions such as designing the regulatory framework to ensure that the goals of innovation and safety are intertwined, advocacy of the emerging safety tech sector, and enabling a data and AI infrastructure that supports innovation, competition and transparency. The main barrier highlighted for both innovation and adoption was the cost to businesses of such development.</p><p>Safety by Design</p><p>12. In the White Paper, the government committed to developing a safety by design framework to make it easier for start-ups and small businesses to embed safety during the design, development or updates of products and services.</p><p>What, if any, are the most significant areas in which organisations need practical guidance to build products that are safe by design?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>13. Throughout our engagement with industry during the lead up to the Online Harms White Paper, stakeholders expressed broad agreement and recognition that standards of safety are improved when organisations build in user-safety at the design and development stage of their online services. They also recognised that a safety by design approach was needed for smaller companies in particular, and that the government should help them build capacity and technical expertise as they grow. Stakeholders also argued that assistance for designing safer services was specifically required in areas such as the needs of vulnerable users, age assurance, and more generally the different safety considerations applicable to children and adults.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>14. This question had a relatively low number and wide variety of written responses, suggesting both drop off in the response rate and potential confusion amongst respondents due to the specificity of the question. This pattern of responses could also potentially indicate a lack of understanding amongst responders on what the principle of safety by design encompasses. This is compounded by the lack of specificity amongst the noticeable minority of, mostly individual, responses which expressed their disagreement with the overall proposals.</p><p>15. Of the responses which suggested areas for inclusion in the guidance, many seemed to focus on guidance in general and not specifically in areas that would enable organisations to build services that are safe by design. Educating users and new technologies were the most common areas highlighted as being those where organisations need guidance. Other responses also highlighted general compliance, data privacy, ethical guidance, encryption and content moderation.</p><p>16. Responses from organisations in particular highlighted child safety as a key area where organisations require guidance. This was followed by calls for overarching guidance on all areas, as well as age assurance. Responses from charities for girls and young women, and for other vulnerable groups, suggested that members of these groups should be actively involved and consulted in designing safe products.</p><p>17. During direct engagement over the consultation period, organisations also raised the need for broader organisational support and culture-changing efforts to help embed a safety by design approach. Organisations in particular felt that, while, specific guidance on high impact safety measures in many of the areas highlighted above are needed and effective, interventions further \u201cupstream\u201d in the design process would also be an impactful way to deliver a safety by design approach - and for this, they argued, government guidance is needed. They also recognised that support on safety by design needs to address all levels within an organisation to be effective at driving change.</p><p>18. Overall, it is clear that there is a strong feeling amongst organisations that greater guidance to enable a safety by design approach is needed. The breadth of the responses and the general lack of specificity on what type of intervention would be helpful also suggests that greater education is required on the function and objective of \u2018safety by design\u2019. Work is taking place to develop the key emerging themes, including guidance on specific high impact safety measures and supporting safety interventions upstream in the design process. For example, work is already underway with the VoCO (Verification of Children Online) project, a cross-sector research initiative undertaken in partnership between DCMS, HO and GCHQ, exploring the concept of age assurance as a risk-based approach to recognising child users online, without undermining their privacy. The project has engaged with children, parents, industry &amp; regulators and other experts to build a vision for a safer internet for children, and it has produced research into key technologies, data sources, standards and commercial models. Future work will look to develop further the key emerging themes, including guidance on specific high impact safety measures and supporting safety interventions upstream in the design process.</p><p>Child online safety</p><p>19. The White Paper committed to make the UK the safest place to be online. It also recognised that users want to be empowered to manage their online safety, and that of their children, but there is insufficient support in place and users currently feel vulnerable online.</p><p>20. As part of the overarching mission to protect the rights of users online, the duty of care will enshrine in legislation the requirement for companies to have appropriate and proportionate measures and processes in place to ensure a higher level of protection for children and vulnerable users. The extent of those processes would be correlated with the risk of harm to young people taking place on the site. This provides the most comprehensive approach possible to protecting children from inappropriate content online, and also enables the regulatory framework to deliver the objectives of Part 3 of the Digital Economy Act,. Companies would be able to use a number of methods to protect children, including possibly - but not necessarily - age assurance tools, which we expect will continue to play a key role in keeping children safe online.</p><p>Should the government be doing more to help people manage their own and their children\u2019s online safety and, if so, what?</p><p>Engagement</p><p>21. One of the key themes of our engagement was parents\u2019 concerns about the safety of their children online. Parents\u2019 groups, especially, considered online safety to be a particular area where parents\u2019 confidence needs to be raised. Although parents felt that they know their children best and are therefore usually the best placed to tailor standard advice for them, they also agreed on the need for more advice and education on how to be online safely. Organisations against violence against women and girls (VAWG) argued that education for online safety should focus not only on behaviours to adopt, but also on discouraging adoption of negative behaviours.</p><p>Written consultation</p><p>22. From those individual respondents using the online portal, there was an almost even split between those who agreed with the question and those who disagreed (49% and 51% respectively). Conversely, this result was very different amongst organisations who responded online, with 95% agreeing that the government should be doing more.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2974525</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y78-T7S1-JDG9-Y3XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"20576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 15, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The cooperation of technology companies with international law agencies has become a necessary step in the enforcement of civil and criminal law.</p><p>But their cooperation is not legally mandated. The question as to which court has jurisdiction over information that is internationally accessible from numerous international servers is ambiguous. As the principles of cyberlaw become defined, there is an emerging need for a supranational court to enforce regulations and hold accountable those technology companies that do not comply.</p><p>A supranational court is required to govern the battlefield of cyberspace. In 2010, the National Security Strategy review released by the White House cited cybersecurity as \"one of the most serious national security, public safety and economic challenges we face as a nation.\"</p><p>Cyberattacks have become more common in the last decade with rogue states, including North Korea and Iran, surreptitiously attacking vital U.S. online infrastructure on a daily basis. But when does an attack become a declaration of war? An international treaty, and an international criminal court, must determine when a cybercrime descends into cyberwar.</p><p>Many common areas of law cannot simply be applied to the Internet. The everchanging landscape of the Internet led to five focus areas of cyberlaw as outlined by the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School - architecture and public policy, copyright and fair use, intermediary liability, privacy and robotics.</p><p>Intermediary liability, pertaining to whether online platforms are liable for its user's content, has been a contentious issue in light of David Cameron's battle for online child pornogrpahy policy. Whether an online platform based in one country can be held for data posted by users in countries around the world is still unclear and continues to complicate Internet regulations.</p><p>The beneficial aspects of the Internet are found in its freedom. The production and access of information has become a process that transcends spatial distances and - until recently - national borders. However, it is this very freedom that complicates the legal questions that have emerged.</p><p>While big tech companies like Google and Microsoft have teamed up with law enforcement to eliminate exploitative images of children from the Internet, an international law must be established to ensure that all web corporations are held accountable for removing all cybercrime activity.</p><p>International legal regulations would serve as a deterrent to both states, individuals and tech companies. In all of its forms, cybercrime can no longer be outside the sphere of law.</p><p>A version of this article appeared in the Tuesday, Nov. 19 print edition.

Europe is particularly sensitive to privacy issues because spying by the Nazi-era Gestapo and the secret services in the Soviet Union is still within living memory. </p><p>\"For us, it's all about citizens and citizens have the right to privacy,\" said Eric Leandri, chairman of Paris-based Qwant. He said that view contrasts with the mindset across the Atlantic, where internet users are seen as consumers whose rights are dictated by the terms of their agreements with tech companies. </p><p>Traffic numbers show interest is rising. Qwant's queries tripled to 10 billion in 2017. It's getting 80 million visits monthly, while requests are growing 20 percent. Leandri said the site now accounts for 6 percent of search engine market share in France, its biggest market. </p><p>Qwant is even getting official support. Last month the French army and parliament said they would drop Google and use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European \"digital sovereignty.\" </p><p>The site doesn't use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian and plans to expand it to about two dozen other languages, for which results currently come from Microsoft's Bing. </p><p>To be sure, Google's in no danger of toppling. The company based in Mountain View, Calif., accounts for three-quarters or more of global market share, depending on whom you ask, and rules the mobile market with its Android operating system. </p><p>Mojeek, based in Brighton, England, operates on similar principles and has so far cataloged 2 billion webpages. The company says it gets 200,000 unique visitors a month, and search queries have quintupled over the past year. </p><p>Another British startup, Oscobo, does anonymous searches for U.K. users with results licensed from Yahoo/Bing. Netherlands-based Startpage anonymizes Google search results, stripping out ads and tracking. </p><p>Pat Walshe, a U.K.-based privacy consultant, has been using Startpage and Qwant for years and has never felt their services were inferior to Google's. </p><p>\"I don't think people would go back if they started using these sites,\" Walshe said. They're \"allowing you to have greater choice and control and should hopefully minimize the tracking,\" which means you'll no longer see, for example, the same ad for a pair of shoes following you around online, he said. </p><p>Walshe likes Startpage's new \"anonymous view\" feature, which goes a step further by letting users browse a copy of a website from its search results, not the actual site. </p><p>Germany's Unbubble is a \"meta-search\" site, sending encrypted queries to more than 30 other search engines. It promises neutral search results rather than ones filtered by an algorithm catering to personal biases. </p><p>Outside Europe, there's also U.S. site DuckDuckGo. </p><p>Some privacy search operators say it's equally important to help users avoid \"filter bubbles,\" in which content is pre-selected by the likes of Google and Facebook based on previous searches and other data. </p><p>\"The main idea is to provide neutral information and allow people to depend less on machine learning-based filters,\" said Unbubble founder Tobias Sasse. \"If you are using Google today, perhaps you'll notice that there is always the same mainstream information,\" preventing people from seeing the \"great diversity\" online, he said. </p><p>Some sites rely on donations, others from \"affiliate advertising\" - links from shopping sites that pay a commission but don't target or track users. That's different from Google's behavioral, or targeted, ads that come up based on your search history, which many find creepy and invasive. </p><p>Mojeek has private investors.

Europe is particularly sensitive to privacy issues because spying by the Nazi-era Gestapo and the secret services in the Soviet Union is still within living memory.</p><p>\"For us, it's all about citizens and citizens have the right to privacy,\" said Eric Leandri, chairman of Paris-based Qwant. He said that view contrasts with the mindset across the Atlantic, where internet users are seen as consumers whose rights are dictated by the terms of their agreements with tech companies.</p><p>Traffic numbers show interest is rising. Qwant's queries tripled to 10 billion in 2017. It's getting 80 million visits monthly, while requests are growing 20 percent. Leandri said the site now accounts for 6 percent of search engine market share in France, its biggest market.</p><p>Qwant is even getting official support. Last month the French army and parliament said they would drop Google and use Qwant as their default search engine, as part of efforts to reclaim European \"digital sovereignty.\"</p><p>The site doesn't use tracking cookies or profile users, allowing it to give two different users the exact same result. It has built its own index of 20 billion pages covering French, German and Italian and plans to expand it to about two dozen other languages, for which results currently come from Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>To be sure, Google's in no danger of toppling. The company based in Mountain View, Calif., accounts for three-quarters or more of global market share, depending on whom you ask, and rules the mobile market with its Android operating system.</p><p>Mojeek, based in Brighton, England, operates on similar principles and has so far cataloged 2 billion webpages. The company says it gets 200,000 unique visitors a month, and search queries have quintupled over the past year.</p><p>Another British startup, Oscobo, does anonymous searches for U.K. users with results licensed from Yahoo/Bing. Netherlands-based Startpage anonymizes Google search results, stripping out ads and tracking.</p><p>Pat Walshe, a U.K.-based privacy consultant, has been using Startpage and Qwant for years and has never felt their services were inferior to Google's.</p><p>\"I don't think people would go back if they started using these sites,\" Walshe said. They're \"allowing you to have greater choice and control and should hopefully minimize the tracking,\" which means you'll no longer see, for example, the same ad for a pair of shoes following you around online, he said.</p><p>Walshe likes Startpage's new \"anonymous view\" feature, which goes a step further by letting users browse a copy of a website from its search results, not the actual site.</p><p>Germany's Unbubble is a \"meta-search\" site, sending encrypted queries to more than 30 other search engines. It promises neutral search results rather than ones filtered by an algorithm catering to personal biases.</p><p>Outside Europe, there's also U.S. site DuckDuckGo.</p><p>Some privacy search operators say it's equally important to help users avoid \"filter bubbles,\" in which content is pre-selected by the likes of Google and Facebook based on previous searches and other data.</p><p>\"The main idea is to provide neutral information and allow people to depend less on machine learning-based filters,\" said Unbubble founder Tobias Sasse. \"If you are using Google today, perhaps you'll notice that there is always the same mainstream information,\" preventing people from seeing the \"great diversity\" online, he said.</p><p>Some sites rely on donations, others from \"affiliate advertising\" -- links from shopping sites that pay a commission but don't target or track users. That's different from Google's behavioral, or targeted, ads that come up based on your search history, which many find creepy and invasive.</p><p>Mojeek has private investors. Founder Marc Smith, who began in 2004 with two servers in his bedroom, believes advertising is \"a necessary evil and we'll look for whatever route we can to avoid it,\" said marketing chief Finn Brownbill.</p><p>In Switzerland, a country whose banking sector became a byword for secrecy, Swisscows has thrived, with monthly search queries jumping by nearly half to 20 million from a year ago, said founder Andreas Wiebe, who also runs software company Hulbee.</p><p>Even so, Wiebe said he met plenty of skepticism at the start. \"In 2014, I had people talking to me (saying) 'you're crazy,' \" and that the project would be dead within a year.

The FCC's action reversed the agency's 2015 Open Internet Order, during the Obama administration, to have stronger oversight over broadband providers. </p><p>That order, commonly referred to as net neutrality rules, prohibits internet service providers from blocking websites, charging more for access to certain websites, or secretly slowing, or 'throttling,' website content. The federal government will also no longer regulate high-speed internet delivery as if it were a utility, like phone service. 'The FCC has effectively ended net neutrality, undoing years of hard work and bipartisan agreement,' said Bill McClellan, Vice President of Government Affairs for the Electronic Retailing Association (ERA). 'It is unfortunate that the FCC has disregarded the will of millions of Americans who have contacted the commission to voice their fears and concerns of discrimination at the hands of a few large internet providers. Consumers and businesses big and small will suffer.' It will take weeks for the repeal to go into effect, so consumers will not see any of the potential changes right away. But the political and legal fight started immediately. Numerous Democrats called for a bill that would reestablish the rules, and several Democratic state attorneys general, including Eric T. Schneiderman of New York, said they would file a suit to stop the change. McClellan said ERA will support these legal challenges and efforts to pass net neutrality legislation. Several public interest groups including Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition also promised to file a suit. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents big tech firms such as Google and Facebook, said it also was considering legal action.

Yet, lacking any central authority, it has also given every malcontent a megaphone and thereby an opportunity to inflict demonstrable damage. The British Home Office and Department for Culture, Media and Sport have responded to the phenomenon of \"online harms\" with a white paper proposing an independent regulator that would write a code of practice for big tech companies.</p><p>Regulating online content poses risks but there are also real safety concerns about a historically unprecedented technology. The British government is right to produce a white paper to examine the issues. If there is to be regulation, it is better that it develop through scrutiny and parliamentary debate, rather than that government proceed by fiat driven by public outrage at particular infractions of online freedom.</p><p>The white paper proposes a new statutory duty of care on the part of technology companies, with regulatory powers to levy big fines and impose liability on senior members of management. And the problem it points to is undeniable. Disturbing examples of online harm are legion, and websites promoting self-harm may have contributed to deaths of young people. After Molly Russell, 14, took her own life in 2017, her parents found material about depression and suicide on her Instagram account.</p><p>Beyond these tragic cases is a culture of enmity that social media has not invented but has given wings. Almost anyone who uses Twitter or Facebook will be aware of the ease with which the hateful sentiments of racists, xenophobes and antisemites and Islamophobes are disseminated. When a fanatic murdered scores of worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, in New Zealand, last month he broadcast his depravities in real time on Facebook. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, complains that tech companies have allowed parts of the internet to become \"a hunting ground for monsters\". It is difficult to gainsay this judgment.</p><p>Critics are not wrong to be wary, however. Free speech is the bedrock of a democratic society and, by definition, that principle is tested by its most difficult cases.

Yet, lacking any central authority, it has also given every malcontent a megaphone and thereby an opportunity to inflict demonstrable damage. The Home Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) have responded to the phenomenon of \"online harms\" with a white paper proposing an independent regulator that would write a code of practice for big tech companies.</p><p>Regulating online content poses risks but there are also real safety concerns about a historically unprecedented technology. The government is right to produce a white paper to examine the issues. If there is to be regulation, it is better that it develop through scrutiny and parliamentary debate, rather than that government proceed by fiat driven by public outrage at particular infractions of online freedom.</p><p>The white paper proposes a new statutory duty of care on the part of technology companies, with regulatory powers to levy big fines and impose liability on senior members of management. And the problem it points to is undeniable. Disturbing examples of online harm are legion, and websites promoting self-harm may have contributed to deaths of young people. After Molly Russell, 14, took her own life in 2017, her parents found material about depression and suicide on her Instagram account.</p><p>Beyond these tragic cases is a culture of enmity that social media has not invented but has given wings. Almost anyone who uses Twitter or Facebook will be aware of the ease with which the hateful sentiments of racists, xenophobes and antisemites and Islamophobes are disseminated. When a fanatic murdered scores of worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, in New Zealand, last month he broadcast his depravities in real time on Facebook. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, complains that tech companies have allowed parts of the internet to become \"a hunting ground for monsters\". It is difficult to gainsay this judgment.</p><p>Critics are not wrong to be wary, however. Free speech is the bedrock of a democratic society and, by definition, that principle is tested by its most difficult cases. Social media has brought into sharp relief the phenomenon of malevolent material that has the design (not merely the incidental outcome) of harming vulnerable and impressionable people. Yet the tech companies are not pushing this content of their own volition and it is an error to see them as malefactors. It is rather that they are deliberately uninterested in the content that online platforms spread.</p><p>A hands-off approach is not always irresponsible. Holocaust denial is the archetype of a noxious sentiment founded on bigotry and fraud and that may sway impressionable people who stumble across its facade of inquiry. There are laws against it in some European countries but none in Britain.</p><p>It would be a mistake to suppress such fakery by statute. The proper recourse is historical scholarship and the irrefutable evidence derived from genuine research. The problem arises with material that is not only foul but predictably damaging to specified categories of people. To enable, for example, the advocacy of self-harm to teenagers or the mentally ill is grossly irresponsible. There is no need for grandstanding, but there is a serious case for regulation.

They have since floated other changes as well, like making Facebook or other platforms liable when opioids are sold on their sites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But now, as the real-world effects of the sex-trafficking change take hold, some experts and politicians say the results are not all positive. And even some lawmakers who have championed a crackdown on Big Tech are now calling to revisit the change. This week, Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, two of the tech industry's loudest critics, joined 11 other lawmakers in backing a federal study of its effects.</p><p> Law enforcement officials say that it is sometimes more difficult to track traffickers because the law pushed them further underground. Advocates say that sex workers now face higher safety risks. The removal of sites advertising sex hinders their ability to vet their clients, the advocates say, and is pushing more of them onto the streets.</p><p> The renewed focus on the 2018 measure illustrates the difficulty of regulating the internet, including changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the 1996 law that enshrined platforms' widespread immunity for what their users post. Even when lawmakers reach a consensus that a change is necessary \u2014 as was the case with sex trafficking \u2014 the ramifications can be wider than many expect.</p><p> \"It's really a good test case as we're looking at other types of carve-outs to Section 230,\" said Jeff Kosseff, an expert on the Section 230 protections. Lawyers across the country have also fought to limit the protections, arguing they don't apply in cases where a digital product is defective. A set of anti-trafficking lawsuits in Texas threatens to chip away at the protections as well.</p><p> When lawmakers approved the law last year, it was hailed as a way to catch up to the reality that the bartering of children and adults had moved from the streets to the web. It came after alarming allegations emerged about how Backpage, a classifieds site, may have been playing a role in trafficking.</p><p> Advocates for sex workers warned ahead of the vote in Washington about some of the potential downsides of the law. But they struggled to break through to lawmakers, who were hearing testimony from groups representing trafficking survivors.</p><p> \"It misunderstands the way that trafficking works, if you think that making it less visible reduces the occurrence,\" said Kate D'Adamo, an advocate for sex workers' rights.</p><p> Their concerns have found a broader audience in recent months, even bubbling up on the campaign trail. During a CNN town hall with the Democratic candidates this fall, for example, a questioner asked Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who had voted for the bill, what she would do to \"counteract the negative impact this law has had.\"</p><p> Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Fremont, who was one of the few votes against the bill last year, said he believes Congress should have heard more about those concerns. He helped write the new legislation to study the law after hearing more from sex worker advocates.</p><p> \"They didn't hear the perspective of the impact it's having on sex workers,\" he said of his colleagues. \"This is a cautionary tale that we have to be very deliberate, thoughtful, inclusive in how we regulate the internet.\"</p><p> Khanna said that if a study of the law showed harm to sex workers, he hoped it would bolster the case for a repeal of the 2018 law.</p><p> Many supporters of the 2018 law say it has had a positive effect on the internet and has helped curb sex trafficking. They note that no site has cropped up to replace Backpage, which was taken down as part of a federal criminal case before the law passed.</p><p> Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who sponsored the 2018 law, said in a statement that the sex trafficking carve-out was written to \"change tech industry practices\" and that it had succeeded.</p><p> Any website that closed down because of the law, he said, \"did so because it was knowingly facilitating sex trafficking or it was misled by critics of the law.\"</p><p> But sex worker advocates point to changes on Craigslist and Reddit. Both sites removed swaths of content that referred to sex because the companies found it too difficult to tell whether people featured in the posts were being trafficked. Craigslist shuttered its personals section, for example, and Reddit closed forums called \"Escorts\" and \"SugarDaddy.\"</p><p> \"Any tool or service can be misused,\" Craigslist said in a statement at the time, explaining its decision to remove some ads in response to the law. \"We can't take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services.\"</p><p> The company did not respond to recent requests for comment.</p><p> Kosseff said the moves by Craigslist and other sites demonstrated that even minor changes to Section 230 could alter the venues for speech online.</p><p> \"Now, whether that's good or bad, that really depends on what your goals are,\" he said.</p><p> David McCabe and Kate Conger are New York Times writers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-213b772b71b6d72d9d152b2cb811a58ab5c720</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSX-HH51-DXVP-V304-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"889\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The figures suggest the number of offences is accelerating, with 23 per cent of offences taking place in the six months up to October last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leicestershire Police recorded a total of 180 offences, with 18 per cent of these taking place between April and October 2019, the latest statistics available.</p><p>The NSPCC is warning there could be a sharper increase this year due to the unique threats caused by coronavirus that are being exacerbated by years of industry failure to design basic child protection into platforms.</p><p>The charity is now calling on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to urgently press ahead with legislation that would help prevent offenders from using social media to target children for sexual abuse.</p><p>The NSPCC also revealed that Facebook-owned apps were used in more than half of cases nationally, from April 2017 to October 2019, where police recorded information about how a child was groomed.</p><p>Nationally the figure stands at 55 per cent, while in Leicestershire the figure is 51 per cent.</p><p>In instances where the means of communication were provided, Facebook-owned apps - Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp - were used more than 3,200 times to send images.</p><p>Half of these offences involved Instagram, while Snapchat was used over 1,060 times.</p><p>Emily* was 13 when she exchanged messages and photos with a man who was posing as a 15-year-old on Facebook and Snapchat. The man turned out to be 24 and sexually abused her. Emily's mum, Wendy*, said: \"It's important for social media to be regulated and for Facebook and Instagram to take more responsibility to keep the people who use their platform safe.</p><p>\"All other businesses have a duty of care to keep children safe, so why not them?\" In February, then Digital Minister Matt Warman promised to publish an Online Harms Bill during the current parliamentary session following proposals set out in a White Paper.</p><p>These proposals set out independent regulation of social networks with potential criminal sanctions if tech directors fail to keep children safe on their platforms.</p><p>However, frustration is growing at delays to the legislation with a full response to consultation on the White Paper not now expected until the end of the year and concerns we might not see a regulator until 2023.</p><p>This has been expressed by the chairs of both the Home Affairs and Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committees, who scrutinise the work of the government departments responsible for online harms.</p><p>The NSPCC is calling on the Prime Minister to deliver an Online Harms Bill, that sets out a duty of care on tech firms to make their sites safer for children, within 18 months.</p><p>The charity wants the government to publish a time-scale for a \"world-leading Bill to go through Parliament as a matter of urgency\".</p><p>NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless spoke to Mr Johnson at a hidden harms round table last week and highlighted how coronavirus had created a perfect storm for abusers, because platforms had not done enough to tackle safety risks going into the crisis.</p><p>He urged the Prime Minister to ensure there is no unnecessary delay to legislation.</p><p>Mr Wanless said: \"Child abuse is an inconvenient truth for tech bosses who have failed to make their sites safe and enabled offenders to use them as a playground in which to groom our kids.</p><p>\"Last week the Prime Minister signalled to me his determination to stand up to Silicon Valley and make the UK the world leader in online safety.</p><p>\"He can do this by committing to an Online Harms Bill that puts a legal Duty of Care on big tech to proactively identify and manage safety risks.</p><p>\"Now is the time to get regulation done and create a watchdog with the teeth to hold tech directors criminally accountable if their platforms allow children to come to serious but avoidable harm.\"</p><p>* Names have been changed.</p><p>THE proposed Online Harms Bill should: \u00a6 \u00a6Enforce a duty of care on tech companies to identify and mitigate reasonably foreseeable risks on their platforms, including at the design stage, to proactively protect users from harm; \u00a6 \u00a6Create a regulator that can hand out GDPR equivalent fines - up to of 4 per cent of global turnover - and hold named directors criminally accountable for the most serious breaches of their duty of care; \u00a6 \u00a6Give the regulator robust powers to investigate companies and request information; \u00a6 \u00a6Create a culture of transparency by legally compelling tech firms to disclose any breaches of the duty of care and major design changes to their platforms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PICTURE POSED BY MODEL / GETTY IMAGES</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LEICMY-160361445</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LEICMY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6017-VWG1-DYTY-C12B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">166717</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Localworld All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Leicester Mercury</publicationName><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 30, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Only 25 percent of investors surveyed are confident that firms' digital transformation strategies will be effective, and less than 1 percent believe the plans are both clear and credible.</p><p><br/><br/>\"The need to invest and build the firm of the future is pressing, but the window to deliver is closing and a reckoning is inevitable,\" said Mathieu Vasseux, Head of Financial Services in the Middle East and Africa. \"While some breakthroughs are occurring, macroeconomic conditions are going to put a lot of pressure on investment in areas where there has not been a positive enough impact yet on the bottom line.\"<br/><br/>Investor Disconnect<br/><br/>According to the report, When Vision and Value Collide, financial services firms spend an average of 5 percent of revenue per year on transformation \u2013 but investors say they do not understand what firms are investing in, or why. They don't know what transformation includes or what the endgame looks like. Investors don't receive useful metrics on progress, and they are distrustful of the cost-benefit case of significant technology investments.<br/><br/>The ambitious, large-budget transformation programs banks talk about and the actual return they produce have left the investor community struggling to make sense of what is really happening. Ninety-eight percent of European banks mentioned \"digital\" in their external communications, compared to only 27 percent of analyst research reports.<br/><br/>This disconnect is happening at a time when valuation growth among big tech and fintech firms has eclipsed financial services. Since 2010, price-to-earnings ratio for fintechs have steadily risen, with multiples now twice financial services firms. Banks have seen the price-to-earnings multiple fall from 14 times to 11 times.<br/><br/>In mature markets, low interest rates have already delivered cyclical revenue declines that are worse than any digital disruption. Oliver Wyman estimates that 75 percent of the value erosion in European banking has come from macro factors and regulation, and only 25 percent from new entrants, fintech and margin compression. A further downturn could have a severe impact on investment budgets.<br/><br/>The major recessions and financial crises of the past 30 years have coincided with single-year losses for banks of between 10 and 50 percent of revenue, likely far exceeding the funds available to invest.<br/><br/>While revenue growth is low and macroeconomic conditions are deteriorating, the need for financial services firms to invest in transformation remains pressing. Challenging returns and overcapacity mean a step-change in productivity is often needed. Longer-term, the increasing competitive pressure from technology companies will increase the pace of financial services offerings being brought to the market.<br/><br/>Some firms have backed their vision mindset and spent aggressively on innovation and transformation efforts, often with disappointing bottom-line results. In other firms the value mindset has dominated, leading to a myriad of small changes with known but often low-impact outcomes.<br/><br/>Firms will need a mix of both vision and value mindsets to succeed over the short and long term. Right now, firms are struggling to get investment to their strategic priorities, with 40 percent of change budgets still going toward mandatory regulatory changes. Light touch management of digital initiatives will come to an end, and a more disciplined, interventionist approach will emerge.<br/><br/>Oliver Wyman see five keys for firms to get the balance right: 1) take a surgical approach to investment, avoiding me-too digital capability building; 2) focus on a smaller number of well-funded growth initiatives; 3) increase focus on productivity gains from investment in technology; 4) develop better science on how to measure and manage change; and 5) improve external communications so investors can better understand what drives performance and allow progress on long-term change to be tracked.<br/><br/>\"Winning firms will need a mix of both the vision and value mindsets, but many will get the balance wrong,\" concluded Vasseux. \"Each company needs to find the right mix to bring vision and value together and agree on a path forward \u2013 all while the threat of big tech looms, a recession may be coming, and investors are growing increasingly impatient.\" \u2014 SG</p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/511/1526/93/158006162557.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/511/1526/93/158006162557.jpeg</url></p><p>Only 25% of investors are confident in banks' digital strategies<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSDIGZ-165562184</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSDIGZ2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2N-Y0H1-JDJN-63D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Saudi Gazette.

Light touch management of digital initiatives will come to an end, and a more disciplined, interventionist approach will emerge.</p><p>Oliver Wyman see five keys for firms to get the balance right: 1) take a surgical approach to investment, avoiding me-too digital capability building; 2) focus on a smaller number of well-funded growth initiatives; 3) increase focus on productivity gains from investment in technology; 4) develop better science on how to measure and manage change; and 5) improve external communications so investors can better understand what drives performance and allow progress on long-term change to be tracked.</p><p>\"Winning firms will need a mix of both the vision and value mindsets, but many will get the balance wrong,\" concluded Vasseux. \"Each company needs to find the right mix to bring vision and value together and agree on a path forward \u2013 all while the threat of big tech looms, a recession may be coming, and investors are growing increasingly impatient.\" -- Tradearabia News Service</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/4/6/72/157976823489.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/4/6/72/157976823489.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRARAB-165297780</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRARAB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y20-PVT1-JDJN-61FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335146</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TradeArabia - Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group.
