Happy  Wednesday.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is  Wednesday, August 9th.  Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East  Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news right now, an attack near Paris, six soldiers are injured  after a vehicle plows into them.  A massive manhunt is underway right now  for the driver of that vehicle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">North Korea is threatening to strike the United States territory of Guam  after President Trump put his country on notice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  North Korea best not make  anymore threats to the United States.  They will be met with fire and fury  like the world has never seen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will have the very latest on this escalating tension this  morning.  The news putting global markets on edge, in Asia Overnight,  declines across the board.  As you can see there, Japan down one and a  quarter percent. </p><p>Moving over to Europe, markets are under pressure this morning, as you'll  see, down almost one percent on the FTSE100.  Down one and three quarters  percent on the CAC Krones in Paris and the DAX Index in Germany down one  and a quarter percent.</p><p>In the U.S., Futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages  this morning, the U.S. taking a cue from Europe, the DOW Jones Industrial  Average down a quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P500 down one half of one  percent, and the Nasdaq down two-third of a percent.</p><p>Disney set to weigh on the DOW, that's for sure.  The company announcing it  will take on Netflix in the streaming wars as third quarter revenue misses  analyst's expectations.  The stock down three and a half percent right now.  </p><p>Southwest Airlines hit by a tech outage triggering flight delays along the  West Coast.  We've got the latest coming out of Southwest.  </p><p>And so much for complicated computer passwords, the man who created the  rule says he got them all wrong, regrets them and that hackers will always  be able to break into your computer.</p><p>Remembering the Rhinestone Cowboy this morning, Glen Campbell dies after a  long battle with Alzheimer's.  We will look back at the country music  legend's career.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Former Presidential Candidate  and Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.  And Rosecliff CEO Managing Partner  Mike Murphy.  Great to see you.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FMR. ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And wow we came back --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I missed you when you're not here, when we're not together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  But we come back to some big stuff.  Governor, what's  your take on this escalating situation with North Korea?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  A lot of people are trying to compare it to the Cuban Missile  Crisis but the difference is we were dealing with a regime in the Soviet  Union that was very different than North Korea.  They knew they had a lot  to lose.</p><p>Kim Jong-un has really nothing to lose.  I mean this is brinkmanship at its  worst and I think it's a very delicate situation for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is, it's so scary.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  From the outside looking in though it seems like because the  Hermit Kingdom is so isolated that it would -- that it would be possible to  isolate and cutoff all the flow of funds.  But those sanctions from the  United Nations do not go far enough according to many.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think it's kind of important to point out, this isn't a  President Trump issue though, this has been going on for years and years,  some that they've allowed to be built up this way.  So the fact that we're  dealing with it now I think is kind of something that has to be dealt with.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean what else is he supposed to do other than push  back with the creation and the implementation of these nuclear warheads  now?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And I think the key is China.  China is the one country that has  the leverage, that has the ability and also has the most really in terms of  the neighborhood to lose.  I think that's where we're going to have to see  the leverage supply.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to talk more about this this morning.  We got  a big program ahead.</p><p>Coming up this morning, \"FOX NEWS\" Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano is here.  The Governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker is back with  us this morning.  Eric Trump's wife, President Trump's daughter-in-law and  the Trump for President Senior Adviser, Lara Trump is with us this morning.   And Former McDonald's CEO of the U.S., Former Famous Dave CEO, Ed Rensi  joins us as well.</p><p>Big program ahead so don't miss a moment of it.  And we're following  breaking news out of the suburbs of Paris this morning where authority say  six soldiers were injured after a vehicle deliberately slammed into them  before driving off.</p><p>Authorities are now searching for that vehicle and its driver.  The  incident, the very latest of several attacks targeting security forces in  France.  Joining us right now Trump 2020 Advisory Board Member and Former  Navy Seal, Carl Higbie.  Carl, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  us this morning.</p><p>CARL HIGBIE, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Good  morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is what, the third or fourth attack in Paris or around  Paris in the last year.</p><p>HIGBIE:  They just keep coming.  And you know what, like my heart goes out  to the people of France but at the end of the day they've allowed this to  happen.  They've allowed this kind of loose societal grip and the expansion  of these extreme views.</p><p>I mean, I'm not saying that it was something that it's not but at the end  of the day that they've allowed this to expand and they've tolerated this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We want to find out exactly who's behind this and we  don't want to speculate.  We do want to talk about North Korea though Carl  with you because the country's state land media announced and it was,  \"Carefully examining plans for a missile strike that would create an  enveloping fire around the Western Pacific Island of Guam where the U.S.  has a critical Air Force base.\"</p><p>This threat is coming just a day after the U.S. flew a pair of B1 Bombers  that took off from Guam over the Korean Peninsula.  And then it was just  hours after President Trump used the harshest language we've heard yet in  his response to recent taunt by North Korea.  Listen to this Carl.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  North Korea best not make anymore threats to the United States.   They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.  </p><p>He has been very threatening beyond a normal statement.  And as I said,  they will be met with fire, fury, and frankly, power the likes of which  this world has never seen before.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well those high level war of words coming as \"FOX NEWS\"  confirmed reports from U.S. Intelligence agencies that North Korea has in  fact successfully miniaturized a nuclear warhead that could fit inside one  of its missiles.  </p><p>Carl Higbie, what do you make of this ratcheting up of the tensions here?</p><p>HIGBIE:  Well I mean, this is ratcheting up -- as Governor Huckabee had  said earlier, these ratcheting up has been happening over the last decade.   I mean we stepped off the world's -- the world is in safer place America is  strong and when America's in the front.</p><p>And this is something that we stepped out of the way and we've allowed this  to happen.  Much like France has allowed their population to run them up,  we've allowed this and we've -- China has allowed this, Russia has allowed  this.  </p><p>We need to step up now and say enough is enough.  I mean everyone's shocked  when President Trump comes out with strong rhetoric like this.  All he's  doing is saying, \"Stop threatening us.\"  It's not like he's going on the  offense here.</p><p>But sooner or later we're going to have to do something about it because  obviously sanctions haven't worked, we cut away a third of their imports  but at the end of the day, all he does is redirect the already limited  sources going to his people back to his military complex.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  You know Carl, I think all of us would love to see a diplomatic  solution but it doesn't appear that North Koreans are prone to accepting  any diplomacy.</p><p>From a military perspective, what are the options that the U.S has?  I  think a lot of Americans are saying, what could we do militarily that would  stop this?</p><p>HIGBIE:  Yes.  Well our military is the population of some small countries  out there.  So it will -- what we can do is we can park three carrier  strike groups off the Coast.</p><p>And I wrote about this in an Op-Ed this morning and next time he shoots a  missile you shoot it down.  The next time he shoots another missile, you  shoot that down, you blow up the installation that it came from and you  continue to repeat this over and over again.</p><p>And I think that Kim Jong, part of the problem is is his military leaders  are probably telling him that he is the greatest military, he can't be  defeated because they're worried about being executed themselves.  So I  think part of it is perception internally that we need to combat also with  propaganda.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Are we dealing with something similar to the Emperor of Japan  where it took an atomic bomb?  I'm not saying we nuke the place, I'm just  saying that it takes something as dramatic so that his own military people  finally say, \"This isn't going to end well.\"</p><p>HIGBIE:  Unfortunately, I think it's going to come to a show force and it  may be at the hands of our military blowing up many of their military  installations.</p><p>I hope that we don't have to take it out on the people because the people  suffer so much and I wish we could avoid a conflict but at the end of the  day, if he's threatening the United States and Guam with nuclear weapons,  we need to do something.  Sanctions and talking is not going to make any  difference.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- but one, because we're talking about the sanctions Carl,  does sanctions out of the U.N. even though China did vote for them, they  only caught $1 billion of the $3 billion in exports, those could have gone  further.</p><p>And \"The Wall Street Journal\" certainly in the editorial page has raised  the issue of why did China sign on with these sanctions?  Is it because  it's worried legitimately so about the United States cracking down on  Chinese firms doing business with North Korea and elsewhere?  </p><p>So there's more to be done on sanctions.  This country theoretically would  be easy to starve, no pun intended.</p><p>HIGBIE:  Right.  Well that's the thing too.  China is kind of stuck in a  rock in a hard place.  China doesn't want America to go into South -- or  into North Korea because then it would have U.S. troops in their borders.</p><p>So that's one of the things they do not want.  And also they are worried  about us sanctioning them or working against their banks and their system  but at the end of the day, it's one of those things.  </p><p>Like China has kind of let this devolved into what it is.  China can crush  them if they wanted to, they're just not willing to do it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So should we give up on China?  I mean is there anything else  to do in terms of China and get engaging China further?</p><p>HIGBIE:  I think we're kind of stuck in a stalemate and I think Ambassador  Nikki Hailey did a great job negotiating these sanctions.  I saw her the  other morning speaking about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HIGBIE:  But I think this is -- I think what's -- the first thing that's  going to happen is China's going to come back to the table and say, \"Hey,  how can we help?\"  Once we take some sort of military action whether it be  shooting down a missile or something to that effect.</p><p>I don't advocate for preemptive strike on North Korea at this time but I  think we definitely need to start shooting down their missiles because  they've made the threat, we need to assume that they are coming at one of  our targets or one of our bases or allies so we need to get rid of it.</p><p>MURPHY:  Hey Carl, it's Mike Murphy.  If they do come at one of our bases  or one of our allies, doesn't that make President Trump's job that much  easier because I don't think there's anyone out there that would say we  shouldn't defend ourselves or defend our interest.</p><p>So while it's stable rattling back and forth, people can knock President  Trump.  But once they attack us, I think we have to at that point respond,  right?</p><p>HIGBIE:  Well like the Governor said, this is -- I mean this is indicative  of the world -- the Pre-World War II, Pre-Pearl Harbor Attack.  I mean like  we were just sitting there waiting trying to avoid getting into a conflict  with them and ultimately it cost us Pearl Harbor.</p><p>So are we willing to wait that much longer?  I mean look, if the left wing  media is going to spin this as Donald Trump is a warmonger no matter what.   Whether we're attacked or whether we do preemptive strikes.</p><p>So in the eyes of the media they're not going to be happy with them but I  think this is about keeping the American people safe.  And if we can't do  that because the left wing media is so amped up at making sure that Donald  Trump is the enemy and not actually North Korea itself, I mean we need to  start doing what's in the best interest of us and (INAUDIBLE) is scared  right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's not just the left wing media though.  I mean this  morning I saw soundbytes of Chuck Schumer, of other leading democrats  basically attacking the president and saying this was irresponsible.  </p><p>And you would think that those people who've been in congress for years  even before Donald Trump entered Washington knew the threat that is North  Korea and wouldn't pile on but try to help with solutions.  Meanwhile  there's this new \"CBS\" -- yes, go ahead Carl.</p><p>HIGBIE:  Yes.  Well Maria, what was irresponsible is people like Chuck  Schumer sitting idly by, why Barrack Obama allowed them to expand the  technology to get to where we are now.  That's their fault and that was  irresponsible for them.  President Trump is reacting. </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Carl, I'm confident of the fact that Donald Trump is surrounded  by some military experts, Kelly, McMaster, Mattis.  These are people who  understand not only the full capacity of the U.S. and of North Korea but  they've studied this and game this at the table over and over again.</p><p>With all due respect to Chuck Schumer which is not a lot, he has no idea  what he's doing.  This is not a political issue, this is an issue of  extraordinary sensitivity and I'm glad that he's surrounded by military  people and not just by a bunch of whiny diplomats and politicians.</p><p>HIGBIE:  Couldn't agree more Governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true, they're treating it like a political issue.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well they make it about Donald Trump's language and his words  and rhetoric, whatever you want to call it and not make it about the issue  at hand.  And that is North Korea from administration to administration.</p><p>We have stepped back and allowed the Hermit Kingdom to develop and  intercontinental ballistic missile and miniaturized warheads that could  deliver a nuclear vice potential to the United States, period.  And the  fact that that is still loss on many people and government and outside of  government is mindboggling.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It really is.  And to treat it as a political issue is really  so unacceptable.  Carl, good to see you.  Thanks very much for weighing in  here.</p><p>HIGBIE:  Thanks folks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments obviously.  Carl Higbie  there.  Coming up, a technical issue for Southwest Airlines causes major  delays.  What you need to know before you head to the airport, that's next.</p><p>And then remembering Glen Campbell, the legendary singer famous for  combining country and pop music has died at the age of 81.  We'll take a  look at his achievements straight ahead, back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news out of China this morning, Cheryl  Casone with the details of a devastating earthquake, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  So Maria, this very strong  earthquake in Southwest China has killed at least 19 people, about 250  others also injured.  Forty of those injured in serious conditions as quake  knocking out power and phone networks which is right now complicating  search efforts.  </p><p>We're also following Tropical Storm Franklin which is moving into the sea  after hitting Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.  Forecasters are saying that  Franklin is expected to strengthen into a hurricane before it makes its  second landfall on Mexico Central Gulf Coasts.</p><p>Meanwhile here in the U.S., heavy rains caused a major flooding down in  Houston, Texas.  There's been about two dozen water rescues in the area,  look at this.  The National Weather Service has issued a flashflood watch  for the region, that will go through until this morning. </p><p>Well a technology issue causing some problems on the West Coast for  travelers flying on Southwest Airlines.  Southwest says the problem delay  about 120 flights last night.  All but seven departed after experiencing an  average delay of at least 90 minutes.</p><p>Those delays reported at Reno Tahoe International Airport, at Sacramento  also as well.  So we're following that story and the stock shares at  Southwest up 10 percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well finally this morning, the world is mourning.  The loss of country  legend Glen Campbell, he lost his battle with Alzheimer's.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GLEN CAMPBELL:  Like a rhinestone cowboy, riding out on a horse in a star- spangled rodeo.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well Campbell became a staple in country music history.  His  career spend 50 years.  Friends and family are remembering Campbell at an  outpouring of messages.  His long-time friend Dolly Parton Twitted this:</p><p>TEXT:  Glen Campbell was one of the greatest voices of all time.  I will  always love you, Glen.</p><p>Fellow country music singer Tim McGraw said:</p><p>TEXT: Songs, songs, songs, man in a world of good stuff, his was great.  In  a world of great stuff, his was special.</p><p>And his daughter Ashley tweeted this picture which is just -- it's a sad  picture:</p><p>TEXT:  Heartbroken, I owe him everything I am and everything I ever will  be.  He will be remembered so well and with so much love.</p><p>Glen Campbell died in Nashville yesterday.  He was surrounded by his  family, he was 81 years old Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much Cheryl.  I like that picture.  I thought that  picture said a lot actually.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Beautiful picture.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it with his hand.  Good Arkansas boy?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  Came from --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like yourself.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  -- Billstown, Arkansas near Delight, a suburb of Delight which  I'm sure you've never heard off.  Not far from where I grew up in Hope,  Arkansas.  Southwest Arkansas guy, wonderful family.  He was like the fifth  of twelve kids.</p><p>But his agility on the guitar was something a lot of people never  understood.  He was a studio musician with a famed Wrecking Crew.  If you  haven't seen the documentary, the Wrecking Crew by Denny Tedesco, one of  the best music documentaries I've ever witnessed and it will explain why  the music of the '60s were so amazing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wish all of the obituaries and in remembrance of Glen Campbell  because we were talking about it in the break mentioned the Wrecking Crew  because it really goes to his musical chops and agility.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Unbelievable guitar player.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I know that the surviving members, the Wrecking Crew  recorded some of the most famous songs coming out of California and --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Basically all the songs coming out of California.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Whether it's the Beach Boys or --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Sonny and Cher.  And I know Carol Kaye we're talking about  the famous --</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, greatest bases player ever.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Female bassist with the Wrecking Crew.  She has sent her  remembrance there published online.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But Glen Campbell, everything thinks of him as the voice and the  singing.  He was great at that.  He had a distinctive voice.</p><p>But, again, as a musician, he was a musician's musician at the top of the  game, unbelievable on the guitar.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So great to hear all of that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, great man.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, how safe is  your password?  The man who wrote the rule now says he regrets his original  advice.  The new guidelines on passwords, next.</p><p>And then one restaurant is dangerously cheesy, the whacky menu items at the  new Cheetos Cafe, straight ahead.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Does your password contain at least one capital  letter, a number, and a symbol?  Why your strong password is not really  that strong at all.  Tracee Carrasco with all the details here, Tracee.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  Yes.  The man who wrote  the go-to guide for federal agencies, universities, and large companies  looking for password, setting rules to follow now says he was wrong.</p><p>Bill Burr now retired from the National Institute of Standards and  Technology says you don't need to make up funny words, use a letter,  number, uppercase, and lowercase letter, and a special character like an  exclamation point.</p><p>He also said your password doesn't need an expiration date because all of  these rules do very little for security and don't keep the hackers away.   The NIST revised the guidelines in June and now say to use long, easy to  remember phrases.  And user should only be forced to change passwords if  there's a sign they may have been stolen.  It makes sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how do you know if your password is stolen?</p><p>CARRASCO:  Well first of all obviously if it doesn't work.  If you start  getting random messages like antivirus messages, if you get unwanted  browser tools, all of these show that your password may have been  compromised.</p><p>MURPHY:  Bank account is empty.</p><p>CARRASCO:  Yes.  Identity stolen.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes, I got hacked but the thieves were spending less than I was  on my credit card.  So I never reported it.  So why bother.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you -- this is slightly different but I think that the  efforts by financial institutions and other institution to protect your  identity, they overstepped.  I went to take out a little bit of cash from  an ATM when I was in Virginia and it wouldn't let me take the cash out  because it automatically assumed that I was -- that the card had been  stolen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That you weren't there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the card had been stolen and that the pass code had been  compromised.  That -- and it wasn't much money either, there was a few  hundred dollars.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Dagen, you just didn't have any money in your account.  That's  why they didn't let you have any money.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I immediately got a call from this bank that I increasingly  despise and, again, the -- if you make any mistake -- if you put the wrong  password in a couple times you get locked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thanks for losing a ton of money from this fraud because when  money's taken out of your account by a hacker, it's not your  responsibility.  Ultimately the bank eats it so they'd rather aggravate you  then lose money on the other side.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Aggravate me and I'll be walking across the street to the bank  next door.</p><p>MURPHY:  Good point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Tracee thank you.  Tracee Carrasco there.  We'll  take a break.  When we come back, Disney saying goodbye to Netflix ending  its movie distribution deal with the streaming company.  What does it mean  for the future of TV and how will Disney create its own streaming service?</p><p>Plus, some coffee lovers are going nuts over a new drink at Starbucks.   Details on the new frapuccino inspired by Mexico, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Happy Wednesday everybody.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, August 9th.  Your top  stories right now 6:30a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>On the brink, President Trump promising fire and fury against North Korea  if the Hermit Kingdom continues with its threat against the United States.  </p><p>The country is now responding with state media reporting it is considering  a missile strike around the Western Pacific Island of Guam where the U.S.  has a critical air force base.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We woke up to the media reports of North Korea's talk  of revenge on the United States and the so-called new found technology that  allows them to target Guam and attack or threat on Guam is a threat or  attack on the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The news putting global markets on edge.  In Asia overnight,  declines across the board as you can see, the Nikkei in Japan and the Kospi  in Korea, the worst performers.  In Europe this morning, markets are under  pressure there as well, taking a cue from Asia.  </p><p>The European indices are down between three-quarters of one percent and  almost two percent in Paris, and in the U.S. futures indicating a lower  opening for the broader averages as you can see.  The Dow Jones Industrial  Average down a fraction with the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ down a round and a  half a percent of piece.  An arrest made in the shooting death of the  Missouri police officer.  </p><p>The very latest says the suspect has taken into custody, following a  manhunt that lasted several days.  And new details this morning, in Taylor  Swift's case, against the former radio DJ, why he's coming under fire for  changing his story.  Disney cuts the cord and its deal with Netflix, why  Mickey and Company are planning to launch their own streaming services and  not give any films to Netflix.  </p><p>Talk about perfectly cooked.  How you can now get your luxury meal covered  in Cheetos.  And next step, Super Bowl.  The details, as the New England  Patriots become the first NFL team with its own plane, all that coming up  this morning.  And our top story first this half an hour, earnings and  focus on Wall Street this morning.  </p><p>The parent company of the Fox Business Network 21st Century Fox set to  report after the bell tonight, while Kohl's, Macy's and Snap, among the  names due out tomorrow.  Disney beat earnings expectations last night while  missing on revenue.  The big story was the company's bombshell streaming  reveal to combat its cable woes.  </p><p>The company is one working on two new services, one for ESPN Sports  Programming and another for its movies and TV shows, which means Disney is  pulling its content from Netflix to start its own streaming service.  The  announcement a huge blow to the streaming giant which is down, Netflix this  morning, down almost four percent in the pre-market.  </p><p>The news quickly overshadowed Netflix a surprise deal for a talk show with  late night legend, David Letterman.  Joining us right now is, Alpine Funds  Portfolio Manager, Sarah Hunt.  And Sarah, the race to the stringing  supremacies certainly heating up, I know you own technology, do you also  own Netflix and some of the streaming in media or Disney?</p><p>SARAH HUNT, MANAGER, ALPINE FUNDS PORTFOLIO:  So, we're dividend players,  so a lot of those companies are not paying dividends right now.  So, we  would own something like an Apple, which says they (INAUDIBLE) Microsoft  but we wouldn't own something like a Netflix here.  </p><p>And I think that this just shows you also the tension between, is the  content -- who is going to be in charge of what's going to happen and I  think that this is a big -- when I saw these numbers last night, and when I  saw the announcement from Disney, I thought, this is going to be  interesting because Netflix is one of those companies that's held up very  well.  So let's see how that goes on the back of this, and whether or not  other people think about following suit.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the broader markets?  What do you think?</p><p>HUNT:  I think, what it appears, where we've had some really nice earnings  for Q2, right?  The first half of this year has been really good relative  to the last couple of years where you had barely, stagnant earnings.  So, I  think, that's been very supportive.  </p><p>But I also think that the market is expecting a lot of things to happen on  the political front and the question of whether or not they are going to  happen, becomes one that becomes more and more important as we get through  the balance of this year.  </p><p>I also think as we enter into the second half of the year, let's see if we  -- what people start saying about next year.  And I think that there is  some concern that valuations are at pretty high level and so, therefore,  you have to see continued growth or some changes on the other economic  fronts.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  I agree with you on the  growth front, that we need growth to keep crisis where they are.  But, I  would kind of disagree on the political front.  I think where we are right  now the market is supported up here at these levels by the earnings growth  we have seen.  </p><p>I think if you get something out of Washington would actually be a next leg  higher in the market, because I don't really see it being priced in here.   I think the numbers can't support it.  But then when you see a company like  Disney that misses on numbers, the market is going to punish that stock and  that's what you're seeing this morning.</p><p>HUNT:  We have also seen -- there was an interesting report yesterday that  talked a lot about how companies are reacting to positive surprises and  that they're not reacting as well the positive surprises that they have in  the last couple of years.  And that might also tell you that there's a  little bit of push to what do I get to that next increment?  So maybe  that's that, but I also think that people started build in some numbers  into '18 on tax reform that may have to come out.  We will see how that  goes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  If you're looking now, if you  think this market is overvalued or a lot of the really popular stocks are  overvalued, and you're looking for ballast, you're looking for something to  offset the risk in your equity portfolio, can you really put money in  treasuries at this point, if you look at the yield on the 10-year treasury,  it's below 2.3 percent, those are also rich and theoretically, if you had  both markets go the wrong way on you, that's all she wrote.</p><p>HUNT:  Yes, and you probably have more risk in Treasuries if they go  against you because the change in interest rates because they're so -- the  rates are so low now.  It's probably more problematic on price.  I think  that a lot of the stocks underneath the big tech names and some of the big  stocks in the averages have actually gotten.  </p><p>You've seen a lot of stocks actually come down in the last six months on  the retail side, on energy, there have been places where there is room.   Now, there's also some threats there which is why those stocks have gotten  cheaper.  But I think there are places to look in the defense stocks while  they are expensive, if you look at what's going on right now, I think that  there's some places there that you can look.  </p><p>And it's the same problem that everyone has had for the last couple of  years.  Where do you put your money?  Where you've driven interest rates  low across not only the U.S., but international, it's even worse.  You get  negative rates across parts of Europe, so that's even harder for people  looking to put money to work.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS:  Sarah, let me just ask this,  if Congress were to actually get tax reform done, does that super charge  the market in all the sectors?  Does that really make that kind of  difference?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think, for sure, it does, Governor, if I could weigh in on that,  because that gives all companies a tax break, it gives more companies  increased earnings, just balance sheets will look better from that.  Now,  you have seen in this market the reason why at all-time highs, is that  you're seeing rotations.  </p><p>When people sell energy or they sell retail, they are putting that money in  large cap tech, or they are putting that money in the financials, in the  banks.  So I think, money would come off the side lines, new money would  come into the market if that were to happen.  I'd think that would push the  market higher.</p><p>HUNT:  I think it would definitely help.  I mean, you're definitely --  there's a lot of companies that have a lot of sales overseas.  So the  companies that would benefit the most are the ones that are primarily U.S.- based because that's where their taxes are going to get better the most.   If you could bring some of the money back from overseas, I think there's a  lot of cash dropped over there.  </p><p>There's been a lot of discussions about that back and forth about whether  or not, how to bring that back and what do you do with it and do you put  parameters around what you do with it.  Because I think, that we're still  looking for capital spending and that still been a sub par version of the  kind of growth that we're looking for in the economic front that's absent  what the government can do.  </p><p>So, if you could bring some of that money back or free up more money from a  tax perspective, maybe that's something that starts to kick-start other  parts of the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Businesses have been sitting on cash because of the regulatory  environment largely.  But, let me ask you about North Korea, how much of a  focus is this for the market?  Yesterday, it felt like the market did  react, was that what it was reacting to yesterday in your view?</p><p>HUNT:  It felt like it was reacting but it was still a fairly moderate  reaction.  Even the Kospi, which you would think of all the places where  you would see a bigger --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of a wild card does this represent for markets?</p><p>HUNT:  I think the market has seen so many different wild cards in the last  year or two that it's very -- it needs to see something that feels more  like, other than rhetoric for it to be more of an impact, but I also think  you're getting out of earning season.  </p><p>So from a catalyst standpoint, you've taken that off the table.  So maybe  August, which can be a tough month anyway from a volume perspective, is  trickier to react to things because you have less trading going on and so,  therefore, you might see a bigger reaction.  But so far, I wouldn't say  that this is a huge reaction thus far.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you want safety in your portfolio, erase the issue of 10-year  treasuries, want a little bit of security, less risk, what do you buy at  this point?  Because you have vast numbers of asset classes that look  expensive, not wildly overvalued.</p><p>HUNT:  So we're (INAUDIBLE) stock mutual funds that basically on dividends.   So we would look for higher dividend stocks in places where you may have  seen some corrections already.  You know, MBP, something like that, but I  agree with you, I think it's very difficult and I think that that's part of  the problem.  </p><p>And if you look at credit spreads, they have gotten incredibly tight, which  is telling you, you know, how yield has been chased down both in the U.S.  and in Europe, in Europe, it's even worse.  The high yields spread over  governments, because governments in some cases are almost nothing  negligible or negative.  </p><p>So I think that it is a really challenging period of time and to be putting  together a portfolio if you're an insurance company or somebody else who is  trying to then work out pensions later, is a very big challenge in this  environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did you get a sense of the rest of the year from what you just  heard in the second-quarter earnings reports, second quarter profits up 11  percent or so, revenue up 6 percent or so.  What about the rest of the  year, did you get a sense of their guidance?</p><p>HUNT:  I would say that it was pretty positive, although what was  interesting is, a lot of people who had beats in the second quarter, didn't  want to raise full year guidance.  So that's telling you that maybe the  back half of the year isn't as strong or they would rather be cautious and  let themselves be in a position where they can beat earnings again, because  what also happens --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they want to see what's going to come out of Washington.</p><p>HUNT:  Right.  And what also happens is that the analysts take numbers down  in the middle of the quarter, for next quarter and they end up coming back  up in the -- there's a lot of gaming that goes on in that respect.  But I  would say that they are --I didn't hear a lot of very cautionary second- half statements.  I heard more, you know, we are doing pretty well and  we're pretty optimistic about the next few months.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the executives are talking less about President Trump on --  at least, early analysis of all the conference calls.  You just heard less  discussion about Washington and about President Trump, so they are sticking  to their knitting, so to speak.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Which is a good thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Four billion dollars in assets under management, are you fully  invested?</p><p>HUNT:  We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great.  Sarah, great to see you.</p><p>HUNT:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Sarah Hunt, there.   Coming up, police arrest the suspect who allegedly reportedly shot and  killed the cop in Missouri.  The details on what lead to that capture,  next.  And then, Taylor Swift's going to court after she claims that  Colorado DJ groped her.  The opening statement for her lawyer made, coming  up, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, futures indicating a lower opening for the  broader averages, take a look, Dow Industrial set to open down about 30  points, NASDAQ also down 30 points, that's one-half of one percent.  We are  looking at a few names on the move, Priceline is one to watch.  The stock  is falling following the company's latest earnings release.  </p><p>Earnings of $15.14 a share, topped expectations but the stock has been  weighed down by weak guidance for the third quarter.  The shares are down  better than seven percent right now.  We're watching Office Depot this  morning, set to report its second quarter earnings before the bell this  morning.  Analysts are expecting earnings of $0.08 a share.  </p><p>Shares of Office Depot are up better than 70 percent in the last year,  good-looking chart there.  A manhunt in Missouri for a police officer is  over, police officer killer.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  So, Maria, a suspect  wanted in the fatal shooting of a Missouri police officer over the weekend  was arrested last night.  Ian McCarthy had been on the run for nearly two  days.  He was arrested for shooting Officer Gary Michael that happened  after a traffic stop, Sunday night.  McCarthy has been charged with first- degree murder.  </p><p>Well, a former DJ denies ever touching Taylor Swift's backside on the  opening day of, we call it the groping trial.  David Mueller testifying he  may have touched Swift's rib cage or a rib, she says otherwise.  He's  seeking at least $3 million.  He's accusing the singer of getting him  fired.  Courtroom sketches show the pop star sitting not far from Mueller  yesterday.  Swift's lawyers saying the evidence of the assault is  overwhelming.  </p><p>Well, Starbucks launching a drink that's (INAUDIBLE) it's rooted in Mexico.   It's called the Horchata, it's almond milk Frappuccino, that's basically  what it is.  It's a blend of Almond milk, cinnamon syrup, coffee, yes,  whipped cream, caramel, and then cinnamon and sugars on top.  I'll be  checking that out at participating locations here in New York.  Anyway, you  can get it in the U.S. and Canada for extra, folks.  Here is the stock.   It's under pressure in the premarket just slightly, 54.04.  </p><p>And then finally, let's proceed on the food thing, Cheetos fans are going  to be in heaven over the next week, three days to be specifically.  A  Cheetos-themed restaurant is going to open in New York City between August  15th and 17th.  The menu for the Cheetos pop-up restaurant designed Anne  Burrell from the Food Network.  There she is, her hair and all.  I love  Anne Burrell.  Cheetos tacos, Cheetos fried pickles, Maria, Cheetos  cheesecake.  I know you're interested, maybe not.  Anyway, random offerings  of Cheetos.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Good news.  Dagen, do you like that, Cheetos?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  On occasion.  It's like one of those ribs and things.  You just  --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On Occasion.  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They would like you just, you know, sitting in the airport and  then all of a sudden, it's like, whoa!  You get hit with that wave of  needing some Cheetos.  Horchata is delicious.  If you go into authentic  Mexican restaurants here in the United States, they will serve it.  I think  it's usually made from rice milk rather than almond milk.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like the almond milk idea.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's just one more thing to slow down things at Starbucks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're hyper sweet, by the way.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  For those of us who just want a stinking cup of coffee, we've  got to stand behind these people who are asking for things that are more  complicated than the formula for a nuclear weapon.</p><p>MURPHY:  And it's amazing.  As the country goes to healthier options,  Starbucks puts these drinks out that have thousands of calories.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A horchata is extremely, extremely sweet.  And I haven't tasted  this one, but the traditional horchata is.</p><p>MURPHY:  You don't need a doughnut to dunk in there.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That's exactly right.</p><p>MURPHY:  It was the doughnut inside.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Drinking your doughnuts.  Now, get this -- I mean, seriously,  look at the calorie content, it's just as --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But how do they keep turning out these products and people are  buying them even in this new era of --</p><p>MURPHY:  I will tell you.  Millennials, children, even teenagers, are going  to Starbucks.  They'll spend $4.00 or $5.00 for a Frappuccino and mixed  whipped thing.  And Starbucks has a secret menu that's not posted and kids  access that on their phones, and they love it.  I can speak to that.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's elitism.  Elitism and (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, their parents will say no, no, you're not going to  Starbucks.  You're going to drink water and like it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up, it is not a bird, it is the new Patriots  plane.  A behind-the-scenes look at the two, yes, two Boeing jets the  football team just purchased.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now this, you're out, Major League Baseball has suspended  one of the most experienced umpires.  Jared Max with the details here.   Jared, good morning.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SPORTSCASTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  Joe  West has been a Major League ump since 1976.  He's not 64 year's old and  he's become a baseball celebrity of sorts, as we saw at the all-star game  last month.  Remember this when Nelson Cruz asked for a photo with West  just after he stepped to the plate.  Everyone loves country Joe West,  right?  Wrong.  </p><p>West has been suspended three games without pay by Major League Baseball  because when asked by USA Today last month, who's the biggest complainer in  the game?  Joe West said, it's got to be Adrian Beltre.  Every pitch you  call that's a strike, he says, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\"  I had a game with him  recently and the pitch was right down the middle.  He tells me, \"That ball  is outside.  I told him, \"You may be a great baseball player, but you're  the worst umpire in the league.  You stink.\"  Suspended three games without  pay.</p><p>Is there a way to make football a safer sport?  A Seattle-based sports  equipment company called VICIS has created a new helmet called \"Zero1\".   The helmet's outermost layer deforms like a car bumper, it yields when it's  hit and slows impact forces.  A second layer, reflex layer of columns that  bend and eventually buckle upon impact.  A third layer, a very thin hard  shell that protects against skull fractures.  And the fourth innermost  layer is the form layer which conforms to the player's head.  Now, the co- founder of the company, Dave Marver, says Zero1 makes a thump noise on  impact, not a crack.  He says the sound of the game is going to change.   Interestingly, I was told yesterday by forensic pathologists Dr. Bennett  Omalu who Will Smith portrayed in the movie, Concussion, \"Helmets prevent  only catastrophic injuries that could cause sudden and unexpected death on  the field.  </p><p>Off the field, August 23rd, on the streets of New York City, 5:00 p.m. at  the heart of rush hour, a protest rally has been planned to take place  outside the NFL League offices on Park Avenue in honor of Colin Kaepernick  because he's still unemployed.  While filmmaker Spike Lee tweeted this  poster for the event yesterday, Spike Lee later clarified on Twitter that  he is not the one in charge of this protest that will take place, again,  outside the NFL League offices of the 23rd.  Right --- again, right in 5:00  p.m.  That ought to be fun to stay on the east side at that point of the  day.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That would really (INAUDIBLE) and influence people, won't it?   Absolutely.</p><p>MAX:  Last night, I got to attend an event, former New York Giant, George  Martin, spent 14 years with the team, walked 3,000 miles across the country  to raise money for first responders for 9/11, spoke about his time going  across the country as an African-American from the deep south.  He was  concerned I might run into trouble somewhere along the way and he stressed  that what he saw is how much more that we are the same than divided.  And  that really rang true to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  Absolutely.  And if you're going live in this country to not stand  for our national anthem, you know, I have a problem with it.  And if I  owned the team, I wouldn't want someone to express their views like that,  so I think a team owner has the right to not bring in Colin Kaepernick.   So, when he protest that, I will avoid at all cost.</p><p>MAX:  And like I still believe that I don't think he wants to play in the  NFL.  When you look at the comments that he has made, why would -- you  know, you're talking about calling owners, slave owners, does he really  want to work in this league for anything, and why did he opt out of his  contract with the 49ers.  He could be signed up right now playing and he's  not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  Meanwhile, my favorite story of sports this  morning is about what the New England Patriots are doing.  They bought two  new huge planes, Boeing 767.  The team will be first in the NFL to have its  own planes rather than charter them.</p><p>MAX:  That's so cool.  It's great.  Well, it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Leave it to Bob Crest.</p><p>MAX:  A great reward for that Super Bowl 51 comeback.  It'll have all the  designs, the Super Bowl Trophies, the Lombardi Trophies.  Every seat on the  flight is a first-class seat, and some recline all the way and it will help  the players recover from the games.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Yes.  But there's one big problem, Jared.  You know, the reports  are that the plane will not be pressurized, they're going to keep the  planes deflated as they fly.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MAX:  I knew something was coming.  I knew it was coming.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, god.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  They have a soft landing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A very good one.  That's a very good one.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why don't more teams -- why don't they already own their  aircraft before now?</p><p>MAX:  Somebody -- that's like somebody said before the New York Yankees  started the YES Network, why don't more teams have their own networks, they  can control a lot more revenue and I get --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  All the NASCAR drivers for the most part, at the top tour of the  series, they have their own private jets, and they fly -- they lease some  of them very often, but they fly to the racetracks on the weekend to these  -- in these small private aircrafts where there's a gulf stream.</p><p>MAX:  Right.  Golfers, too, get crazy like that.</p><p>MURPHY:  I would like to see a lot more of this now, Patriots did it, now,  I think you'll see more and more teams.</p><p>MAX:  It would have made sense if it'd be the Jets, but, you know, they're  the Jets.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Jared.  Thank you, Jared Max.  Catch Jared's sports  reports in Fox News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius XM 115.</p><p>Still to come, researchers make a gigantic discovery.

Happy  Wednesday.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is  Wednesday, August 9th.  Your top stories right now, 6:00a.m. on the East  Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking news right now, an attack near Paris, six soldiers are injured  after a vehicle plows into them.  A massive manhunt is underway right now  for the driver of that vehicle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> North Korea is threatening to strike the United States territory of Guam  after President Trump put his country on notice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  North Korea best not make  anymore threats to the United States.  They will be met with fire and fury  like the world has never seen.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will have the very latest on this escalating tension this  morning.  The news putting global markets on edge, in Asia Overnight,  declines across the board.  As you can see there, Japan down one and a  quarter percent. </p><p> Moving over to Europe, markets are under pressure this morning, as you'll  see, down almost one percent on the FTSE100.  Down one and three quarters  percent on the CAC Krones in Paris and the DAX Index in Germany down one  and a quarter percent.</p><p> In the U.S., Futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages  this morning, the U.S. taking a cue from Europe, the DOW Jones Industrial  Average down a quarter of a percent, the S&amp;P500 down one half of one  percent, and the Nasdaq down two-third of a percent.</p><p>Disney set to weigh on the DOW, that's for sure.  The company announcing it  will take on Netflix in the streaming wars as third quarter revenue misses  analyst's expectations.  The stock down three and a half percent right now.  </p><p>Southwest Airlines hit by a tech outage triggering flight delays along the  West Coast.  We've got the latest coming out of Southwest.  </p><p> And so much for complicated computer passwords, the man who created the  rule says he got them all wrong, regrets them and that hackers will always  be able to break into your computer.</p><p> Remembering the Rhinestone Cowboy this morning, Glen Campbell dies after a  long battle with Alzheimer's.  We will look back at the country music  legend's career.  </p><p> All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about  it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  Former Presidential Candidate  and Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.  And Rosecliff CEO Managing Partner  Mike Murphy.  Great to see you.</p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FMR. ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Good morning Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  Good morning.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Great to see you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> MURPHY:  Thank you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And wow we came back --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I missed you when you're not here, when we're not together.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  But we come back to some big stuff.  Governor, what's  your take on this escalating situation with North Korea?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  A lot of people are trying to compare it to the Cuban Missile  Crisis but the difference is we were dealing with a regime in the Soviet  Union that was very different than North Korea.  They knew they had a lot  to lose.</p><p> Kim Jong-un has really nothing to lose.  I mean this is brinkmanship at its  worst and I think it's a very delicate situation for us.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It is, it's so scary.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  From the outside looking in though it seems like because the  Hermit Kingdom is so isolated that it would -- that it would be possible to  isolate and cutoff all the flow of funds.  But those sanctions from the  United Nations do not go far enough according to many.</p><p> MURPHY:  I think it's kind of important to point out, this isn't a  President Trump issue though, this has been going on for years and years,  some that they've allowed to be built up this way.  So the fact that we're  dealing with it now I think is kind of something that has to be dealt with.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean what else is he supposed to do other than push  back with the creation and the implementation of these nuclear warheads  now?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  And I think the key is China.  China is the one country that has  the leverage, that has the ability and also has the most really in terms of  the neighborhood to lose.  I think that's where we're going to have to see  the leverage supply.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're going to talk more about this this morning.  We got  a big program ahead.</p><p> Coming up this morning, \"FOX NEWS\" Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano is here.  The Governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker is back with  us this morning.  Eric Trump's wife, President Trump's daughter-in-law and  the Trump for President Senior Adviser, Lara Trump is with us this morning.   And Former McDonald's CEO of the U.S., Former Famous Dave CEO, Ed Rensi  joins us as well.</p><p> Big program ahead so don't miss a moment of it.  And we're following  breaking news out of the suburbs of Paris this morning where authority say  six soldiers were injured after a vehicle deliberately slammed into them  before driving off.</p><p> Authorities are now searching for that vehicle and its driver.  The  incident, the very latest of several attacks targeting security forces in  France.  Joining us right now Trump 2020 Advisory Board Member and Former  Navy Seal, Carl Higbie.  Carl, good to see you, thanks so much for joining  us this morning.</p><p> CARL HIGBIE, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, FORMER NAVY SEAL:  Good  morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is what, the third or fourth attack in Paris or around  Paris in the last year.</p><p> HIGBIE:  They just keep coming.  And you know what, like my heart goes out  to the people of France but at the end of the day they've allowed this to  happen.  They've allowed this kind of loose societal grip and the expansion  of these extreme views.</p><p> I mean, I'm not saying that it was something that it's not but at the end  of the day that they've allowed this to expand and they've tolerated this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We want to find out exactly who's behind this and we  don't want to speculate.  We do want to talk about North Korea though Carl  with you because the country's state land media announced and it was,  \"Carefully examining plans for a missile strike that would create an  enveloping fire around the Western Pacific Island of Guam where the U.S.  has a critical Air Force base.\"</p><p> This threat is coming just a day after the U.S. flew a pair of B1 Bombers  that took off from Guam over the Korean Peninsula.  And then it was just  hours after President Trump used the harshest language we've heard yet in  his response to recent taunt by North Korea.  Listen to this Carl.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  North Korea best not make anymore threats to the United States.   They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.  </p><p> He has been very threatening beyond a normal statement.  And as I said,  they will be met with fire, fury, and frankly, power the likes of which  this world has never seen before.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well those high level war of words coming as \"FOX NEWS\"  confirmed reports from U.S. Intelligence agencies that North Korea has in  fact successfully miniaturized a nuclear warhead that could fit inside one  of its missiles.  </p><p> Carl Higbie, what do you make of this ratcheting up of the tensions here?</p><p> HIGBIE:  Well I mean, this is ratcheting up -- as Governor Huckabee had  said earlier, these ratcheting up has been happening over the last decade.   I mean we stepped off the world's -- the world is in safer place America is  strong and when America's in the front.</p><p> And this is something that we stepped out of the way and we've allowed this  to happen.  Much like France has allowed their population to run them up,  we've allowed this and we've -- China has allowed this, Russia has allowed  this.  </p><p> We need to step up now and say enough is enough.  I mean everyone's shocked  when President Trump comes out with strong rhetoric like this.  All he's  doing is saying, \"Stop threatening us.\"  It's not like he's going on the  offense here.</p><p> But sooner or later we're going to have to do something about it because  obviously sanctions haven't worked, we cut away a third of their imports  but at the end of the day, all he does is redirect the already limited  sources going to his people back to his military complex.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  You know Carl, I think all of us would love to see a diplomatic  solution but it doesn't appear that North Koreans are prone to accepting  any diplomacy.</p><p> From a military perspective, what are the options that the U.S has?  I  think a lot of Americans are saying, what could we do militarily that would  stop this?</p><p> HIGBIE:  Yes.  Well our military is the population of some small countries  out there.  So it will -- what we can do is we can park three carrier  strike groups off the Coast.</p><p> And I wrote about this in an Op-Ed this morning and next time he shoots a  missile you shoot it down.  The next time he shoots another missile, you  shoot that down, you blow up the installation that it came from and you  continue to repeat this over and over again.</p><p> And I think that Kim Jong, part of the problem is is his military leaders  are probably telling him that he is the greatest military, he can't be  defeated because they're worried about being executed themselves.  So I  think part of it is perception internally that we need to combat also with  propaganda.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Are we dealing with something similar to the Emperor of Japan  where it took an atomic bomb?  I'm not saying we nuke the place, I'm just  saying that it takes something as dramatic so that his own military people  finally say, \"This isn't going to end well.\"</p><p> HIGBIE:  Unfortunately, I think it's going to come to a show force and it  may be at the hands of our military blowing up many of their military  installations.</p><p> I hope that we don't have to take it out on the people because the people  suffer so much and I wish we could avoid a conflict but at the end of the  day, if he's threatening the United States and Guam with nuclear weapons,  we need to do something.  Sanctions and talking is not going to make any  difference.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well -- but one, because we're talking about the sanctions Carl,  does sanctions out of the U.N. even though China did vote for them, they  only caught $1 billion of the $3 billion in exports, those could have gone  further.</p><p> And \"The Wall Street Journal\" certainly in the editorial page has raised  the issue of why did China sign on with these sanctions?  Is it because  it's worried legitimately so about the United States cracking down on  Chinese firms doing business with North Korea and elsewhere?  </p><p> So there's more to be done on sanctions.  This country theoretically would  be easy to starve, no pun intended.</p><p> HIGBIE:  Right.  Well that's the thing too.  China is kind of stuck in a  rock in a hard place.  China doesn't want America to go into South -- or  into North Korea because then it would have U.S. troops in their borders.</p><p> So that's one of the things they do not want.  And also they are worried  about us sanctioning them or working against their banks and their system  but at the end of the day, it's one of those things.  </p><p> Like China has kind of let this devolved into what it is.  China can crush  them if they wanted to, they're just not willing to do it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So should we give up on China?  I mean is there anything else  to do in terms of China and get engaging China further?</p><p> HIGBIE:  I think we're kind of stuck in a stalemate and I think Ambassador  Nikki Hailey did a great job negotiating these sanctions.  I saw her the  other morning speaking about it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> HIGBIE:  But I think this is -- I think what's -- the first thing that's  going to happen is China's going to come back to the table and say, \"Hey,  how can we help?\"  Once we take some sort of military action whether it be  shooting down a missile or something to that effect.</p><p> I don't advocate for preemptive strike on North Korea at this time but I  think we definitely need to start shooting down their missiles because  they've made the threat, we need to assume that they are coming at one of  our targets or one of our bases or allies so we need to get rid of it.</p><p> MURPHY:  Hey Carl, it's Mike Murphy.  If they do come at one of our bases  or one of our allies, doesn't that make President Trump's job that much  easier because I don't think there's anyone out there that would say we  shouldn't defend ourselves or defend our interest.</p><p> So while it's stable rattling back and forth, people can knock President  Trump.  But once they attack us, I think we have to at that point respond,  right?</p><p> HIGBIE:  Well like the Governor said, this is -- I mean this is indicative  of the world -- the Pre-World War II, Pre-Pearl Harbor Attack.  I mean like  we were just sitting there waiting trying to avoid getting into a conflict  with them and ultimately it cost us Pearl Harbor.</p><p> So are we willing to wait that much longer?  I mean look, if the left wing  media is going to spin this as Donald Trump is a warmonger no matter what.   Whether we're attacked or whether we do preemptive strikes.</p><p> So in the eyes of the media they're not going to be happy with them but I  think this is about keeping the American people safe.  And if we can't do  that because the left wing media is so amped up at making sure that Donald  Trump is the enemy and not actually North Korea itself, I mean we need to  start doing what's in the best interest of us and (INAUDIBLE) is scared  right now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's not just the left wing media though.  I mean this  morning I saw soundbytes of Chuck Schumer, of other leading democrats  basically attacking the president and saying this was irresponsible.  </p><p> And you would think that those people who've been in congress for years  even before Donald Trump entered Washington knew the threat that is North  Korea and wouldn't pile on but try to help with solutions.  Meanwhile  there's this new \"CBS\" -- yes, go ahead Carl.</p><p> HIGBIE:  Yes.  Well Maria, what was irresponsible is people like Chuck  Schumer sitting idly by, why Barrack Obama allowed them to expand the  technology to get to where we are now.  That's their fault and that was  irresponsible for them.  President Trump is reacting. </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Carl, I'm confident of the fact that Donald Trump is surrounded  by some military experts, Kelly, McMaster, Mattis.  These are people who  understand not only the full capacity of the U.S. and of North Korea but  they've studied this and game this at the table over and over again.</p><p> With all due respect to Chuck Schumer which is not a lot, he has no idea  what he's doing.  This is not a political issue, this is an issue of  extraordinary sensitivity and I'm glad that he's surrounded by military  people and not just by a bunch of whiny diplomats and politicians.</p><p> HIGBIE:  Couldn't agree more Governor.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's true, they're treating it like a political issue.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well they make it about Donald Trump's language and his words  and rhetoric, whatever you want to call it and not make it about the issue  at hand.  And that is North Korea from administration to administration.</p><p> We have stepped back and allowed the Hermit Kingdom to develop and  intercontinental ballistic missile and miniaturized warheads that could  deliver a nuclear vice potential to the United States, period.  And the  fact that that is still loss on many people and government and outside of  government is mindboggling.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It really is.  And to treat it as a political issue is really  so unacceptable.  Carl, good to see you.  Thanks very much for weighing in  here.</p><p> HIGBIE:  Thanks folks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching the developments obviously.  Carl Higbie  there.  Coming up, a technical issue for Southwest Airlines causes major  delays.  What you need to know before you head to the airport, that's next.</p><p> And then remembering Glen Campbell, the legendary singer famous for  combining country and pop music has died at the age of 81.  We'll take a  look at his achievements straight ahead, back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news out of China this morning, Cheryl  Casone with the details of a devastating earthquake, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  So Maria, this very strong  earthquake in Southwest China has killed at least 19 people, about 250  others also injured.  Forty of those injured in serious conditions as quake  knocking out power and phone networks which is right now complicating  search efforts.  </p><p> We're also following Tropical Storm Franklin which is moving into the sea  after hitting Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.  Forecasters are saying that  Franklin is expected to strengthen into a hurricane before it makes its  second landfall on Mexico Central Gulf Coasts.</p><p> Meanwhile here in the U.S., heavy rains caused a major flooding down in  Houston, Texas.  There's been about two dozen water rescues in the area,  look at this.  The National Weather Service has issued a flashflood watch  for the region, that will go through until this morning. </p><p> Well a technology issue causing some problems on the West Coast for  travelers flying on Southwest Airlines.  Southwest says the problem delay  about 120 flights last night.  All but seven departed after experiencing an  average delay of at least 90 minutes.</p><p> Those delays reported at Reno Tahoe International Airport, at Sacramento  also as well.  So we're following that story and the stock shares at  Southwest up 10 percent so far this year.  </p><p> Well finally this morning, the world is mourning.  The loss of country  legend Glen Campbell, he lost his battle with Alzheimer's.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> GLEN CAMPBELL:  Like a rhinestone cowboy, riding out on a horse in a star- spangled rodeo.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well Campbell became a staple in country music history.  His  career spend 50 years.  Friends and family are remembering Campbell at an  outpouring of messages.  His long-time friend Dolly Parton Twitted this:</p><p> TEXT:  Glen Campbell was one of the greatest voices of all time.  I will  always love you, Glen.</p><p> Fellow country music singer Tim McGraw said:</p><p> TEXT: Songs, songs, songs, man in a world of good stuff, his was great.  In  a world of great stuff, his was special.</p><p> And his daughter Ashley tweeted this picture which is just -- it's a sad  picture:</p><p> TEXT:  Heartbroken, I owe him everything I am and everything I ever will  be.  He will be remembered so well and with so much love.</p><p> Glen Campbell died in Nashville yesterday.  He was surrounded by his  family, he was 81 years old Maria, back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much Cheryl.  I like that picture.  I thought that  picture said a lot actually.  </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Beautiful picture.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I like it with his hand.  Good Arkansas boy?</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.  Came from --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Like yourself.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  -- Billstown, Arkansas near Delight, a suburb of Delight which  I'm sure you've never heard off.  Not far from where I grew up in Hope,  Arkansas.  Southwest Arkansas guy, wonderful family.  He was like the fifth  of twelve kids.</p><p> But his agility on the guitar was something a lot of people never  understood.  He was a studio musician with a famed Wrecking Crew.  If you  haven't seen the documentary, the Wrecking Crew by Denny Tedesco, one of  the best music documentaries I've ever witnessed and it will explain why  the music of the '60s were so amazing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I wish all of the obituaries and in remembrance of Glen Campbell  because we were talking about it in the break mentioned the Wrecking Crew  because it really goes to his musical chops and agility.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Unbelievable guitar player.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I know that the surviving members, the Wrecking Crew  recorded some of the most famous songs coming out of California and --</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Basically all the songs coming out of California.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Whether it's the Beach Boys or --</p><p> HUCKABEE:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- Sonny and Cher.  And I know Carol Kaye we're talking about  the famous --</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes, greatest bases player ever.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Female bassist with the Wrecking Crew.  She has sent her  remembrance there published online.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  But Glen Campbell, everything thinks of him as the voice and the  singing.  He was great at that.  He had a distinctive voice.</p><p> But, again, as a musician, he was a musician's musician at the top of the  game, unbelievable on the guitar.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So great to hear all of that.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes, great man.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back, how safe is  your password?  The man who wrote the rule now says he regrets his original  advice.  The new guidelines on passwords, next.</p><p> And then one restaurant is dangerously cheesy, the whacky menu items at the  new Cheetos Cafe, straight ahead.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Does your password contain at least one capital  letter, a number, and a symbol?  Why your strong password is not really  that strong at all.  Tracee Carrasco with all the details here, Tracee.</p><p> TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  Yes.  The man who wrote  the go-to guide for federal agencies, universities, and large companies  looking for password, setting rules to follow now says he was wrong.</p><p> Bill Burr now retired from the National Institute of Standards and  Technology says you don't need to make up funny words, use a letter,  number, uppercase, and lowercase letter, and a special character like an  exclamation point.</p><p> He also said your password doesn't need an expiration date because all of  these rules do very little for security and don't keep the hackers away.   The NIST revised the guidelines in June and now say to use long, easy to  remember phrases.  And user should only be forced to change passwords if  there's a sign they may have been stolen.  It makes sense.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And how do you know if your password is stolen?</p><p> CARRASCO:  Well first of all obviously if it doesn't work.  If you start  getting random messages like antivirus messages, if you get unwanted  browser tools, all of these show that your password may have been  compromised.</p><p> MURPHY:  Bank account is empty.</p><p> CARRASCO:  Yes.  Identity stolen.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes, I got hacked but the thieves were spending less than I was  on my credit card.  So I never reported it.  So why bother.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But you -- this is slightly different but I think that the  efforts by financial institutions and other institution to protect your  identity, they overstepped.  I went to take out a little bit of cash from  an ATM when I was in Virginia and it wouldn't let me take the cash out  because it automatically assumed that I was -- that the card had been  stolen.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That you weren't there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But the card had been stolen and that the pass code had been  compromised.  That -- and it wasn't much money either, there was a few  hundred dollars.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Dagen, you just didn't have any money in your account.  That's  why they didn't let you have any money.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I immediately got a call from this bank that I increasingly  despise and, again, the -- if you make any mistake -- if you put the wrong  password in a couple times you get locked out.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MURPHY:  Thanks for losing a ton of money from this fraud because when  money's taken out of your account by a hacker, it's not your  responsibility.  Ultimately the bank eats it so they'd rather aggravate you  then lose money on the other side.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Aggravate me and I'll be walking across the street to the bank  next door.</p><p> MURPHY:  Good point.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Tracee thank you.  Tracee Carrasco there.  We'll  take a break.  When we come back, Disney saying goodbye to Netflix ending  its movie distribution deal with the streaming company.  What does it mean  for the future of TV and how will Disney create its own streaming service?</p><p> Plus, some coffee lovers are going nuts over a new drink at Starbucks.   Details on the new frapuccino inspired by Mexico, straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Happy Wednesday everybody.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, August 9th.  Your top  stories right now 6:30a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> On the brink, President Trump promising fire and fury against North Korea  if the Hermit Kingdom continues with its threat against the United States.  </p><p> The country is now responding with state media reporting it is considering  a missile strike around the Western Pacific Island of Guam where the U.S.  has a critical air force base.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We woke up to the media reports of North Korea's talk  of revenge on the United States and the so-called new found technology that  allows them to target Guam and attack or threat on Guam is a threat or  attack on the United States.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The news putting global markets on edge.  In Asia overnight,  declines across the board as you can see, the Nikkei in Japan and the Kospi  in Korea, the worst performers.  In Europe this morning, markets are under  pressure there as well, taking a cue from Asia.  </p><p> The European indices are down between three-quarters of one percent and  almost two percent in Paris, and in the U.S. futures indicating a lower  opening for the broader averages as you can see.  The Dow Jones Industrial  Average down a fraction with the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ down a round and a  half a percent of piece.  An arrest made in the shooting death of the  Missouri police officer.  </p><p> The very latest says the suspect has taken into custody, following a  manhunt that lasted several days.  And new details this morning, in Taylor  Swift's case, against the former radio DJ, why he's coming under fire for  changing his story.  Disney cuts the cord and its deal with Netflix, why  Mickey and Company are planning to launch their own streaming services and  not give any films to Netflix.  </p><p> Talk about perfectly cooked.  How you can now get your luxury meal covered  in Cheetos.  And next step, Super Bowl.  The details, as the New England  Patriots become the first NFL team with its own plane, all that coming up  this morning.  And our top story first this half an hour, earnings and  focus on Wall Street this morning.  </p><p> The parent company of the Fox Business Network 21st Century Fox set to  report after the bell tonight, while Kohl's, Macy's and Snap, among the  names due out tomorrow.  Disney beat earnings expectations last night while  missing on revenue.  The big story was the company's bombshell streaming  reveal to combat its cable woes.  </p><p> The company is one working on two new services, one for ESPN Sports  Programming and another for its movies and TV shows, which means Disney is  pulling its content from Netflix to start its own streaming service.  The  announcement a huge blow to the streaming giant which is down, Netflix this  morning, down almost four percent in the pre-market.  </p><p> The news quickly overshadowed Netflix a surprise deal for a talk show with  late night legend, David Letterman.  Joining us right now is, Alpine Funds  Portfolio Manager, Sarah Hunt.  And Sarah, the race to the stringing  supremacies certainly heating up, I know you own technology, do you also  own Netflix and some of the streaming in media or Disney?</p><p> SARAH HUNT, MANAGER, ALPINE FUNDS PORTFOLIO:  So, we're dividend players,  so a lot of those companies are not paying dividends right now.  So, we  would own something like an Apple, which says they (INAUDIBLE) Microsoft  but we wouldn't own something like a Netflix here.  </p><p> And I think that this just shows you also the tension between, is the  content -- who is going to be in charge of what's going to happen and I  think that this is a big -- when I saw these numbers last night, and when I  saw the announcement from Disney, I thought, this is going to be  interesting because Netflix is one of those companies that's held up very  well.  So let's see how that goes on the back of this, and whether or not  other people think about following suit.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about the broader markets?  What do you think?</p><p> HUNT:  I think, what it appears, where we've had some really nice earnings  for Q2, right?  The first half of this year has been really good relative  to the last couple of years where you had barely, stagnant earnings.  So, I  think, that's been very supportive.  </p><p> But I also think that the market is expecting a lot of things to happen on  the political front and the question of whether or not they are going to  happen, becomes one that becomes more and more important as we get through  the balance of this year.  </p><p> I also think as we enter into the second half of the year, let's see if we  -- what people start saying about next year.  And I think that there is  some concern that valuations are at pretty high level and so, therefore,  you have to see continued growth or some changes on the other economic  fronts.</p><p> MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES:  I agree with you on the  growth front, that we need growth to keep crisis where they are.  But, I  would kind of disagree on the political front.  I think where we are right  now the market is supported up here at these levels by the earnings growth  we have seen.  </p><p> I think if you get something out of Washington would actually be a next leg  higher in the market, because I don't really see it being priced in here.   I think the numbers can't support it.  But then when you see a company like  Disney that misses on numbers, the market is going to punish that stock and  that's what you're seeing this morning.</p><p> HUNT:  We have also seen -- there was an interesting report yesterday that  talked a lot about how companies are reacting to positive surprises and  that they're not reacting as well the positive surprises that they have in  the last couple of years.  And that might also tell you that there's a  little bit of push to what do I get to that next increment?  So maybe  that's that, but I also think that people started build in some numbers  into '18 on tax reform that may have to come out.  We will see how that  goes.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  If you're looking now, if you  think this market is overvalued or a lot of the really popular stocks are  overvalued, and you're looking for ballast, you're looking for something to  offset the risk in your equity portfolio, can you really put money in  treasuries at this point, if you look at the yield on the 10-year treasury,  it's below 2.3 percent, those are also rich and theoretically, if you had  both markets go the wrong way on you, that's all she wrote.</p><p> HUNT:  Yes, and you probably have more risk in Treasuries if they go  against you because the change in interest rates because they're so -- the  rates are so low now.  It's probably more problematic on price.  I think  that a lot of the stocks underneath the big tech names and some of the big  stocks in the averages have actually gotten.  </p><p> You've seen a lot of stocks actually come down in the last six months on  the retail side, on energy, there have been places where there is room.   Now, there's also some threats there which is why those stocks have gotten  cheaper.  But I think there are places to look in the defense stocks while  they are expensive, if you look at what's going on right now, I think that  there's some places there that you can look.  </p><p> And it's the same problem that everyone has had for the last couple of  years.  Where do you put your money?  Where you've driven interest rates  low across not only the U.S., but international, it's even worse.  You get  negative rates across parts of Europe, so that's even harder for people  looking to put money to work.</p><p> MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS:  Sarah, let me just ask this,  if Congress were to actually get tax reform done, does that super charge  the market in all the sectors?  Does that really make that kind of  difference?</p><p> MURPHY:  I think, for sure, it does, Governor, if I could weigh in on that,  because that gives all companies a tax break, it gives more companies  increased earnings, just balance sheets will look better from that.  Now,  you have seen in this market the reason why at all-time highs, is that  you're seeing rotations.  </p><p> When people sell energy or they sell retail, they are putting that money in  large cap tech, or they are putting that money in the financials, in the  banks.  So I think, money would come off the side lines, new money would  come into the market if that were to happen.  I'd think that would push the  market higher.</p><p> HUNT:  I think it would definitely help.  I mean, you're definitely --  there's a lot of companies that have a lot of sales overseas.  So the  companies that would benefit the most are the ones that are primarily U.S.- based because that's where their taxes are going to get better the most.   If you could bring some of the money back from overseas, I think there's a  lot of cash dropped over there.  </p><p> There's been a lot of discussions about that back and forth about whether  or not, how to bring that back and what do you do with it and do you put  parameters around what you do with it.  Because I think, that we're still  looking for capital spending and that still been a sub par version of the  kind of growth that we're looking for in the economic front that's absent  what the government can do.  </p><p> So, if you could bring some of that money back or free up more money from a  tax perspective, maybe that's something that starts to kick-start other  parts of the economy.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Businesses have been sitting on cash because of the regulatory  environment largely.  But, let me ask you about North Korea, how much of a  focus is this for the market?  Yesterday, it felt like the market did  react, was that what it was reacting to yesterday in your view?</p><p> HUNT:  It felt like it was reacting but it was still a fairly moderate  reaction.  Even the Kospi, which you would think of all the places where  you would see a bigger --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What kind of a wild card does this represent for markets?</p><p> HUNT:  I think the market has seen so many different wild cards in the last  year or two that it's very -- it needs to see something that feels more  like, other than rhetoric for it to be more of an impact, but I also think  you're getting out of earning season.  </p><p> So from a catalyst standpoint, you've taken that off the table.  So maybe  August, which can be a tough month anyway from a volume perspective, is  trickier to react to things because you have less trading going on and so,  therefore, you might see a bigger reaction.  But so far, I wouldn't say  that this is a huge reaction thus far.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  If you want safety in your portfolio, erase the issue of 10-year  treasuries, want a little bit of security, less risk, what do you buy at  this point?  Because you have vast numbers of asset classes that look  expensive, not wildly overvalued.</p><p> HUNT:  So we're (INAUDIBLE) stock mutual funds that basically on dividends.   So we would look for higher dividend stocks in places where you may have  seen some corrections already.  You know, MBP, something like that, but I  agree with you, I think it's very difficult and I think that that's part of  the problem.  </p><p> And if you look at credit spreads, they have gotten incredibly tight, which  is telling you, you know, how yield has been chased down both in the U.S.  and in Europe, in Europe, it's even worse.  The high yields spread over  governments, because governments in some cases are almost nothing  negligible or negative.  </p><p> So I think that it is a really challenging period of time and to be putting  together a portfolio if you're an insurance company or somebody else who is  trying to then work out pensions later, is a very big challenge in this  environment.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Did you get a sense of the rest of the year from what you just  heard in the second-quarter earnings reports, second quarter profits up 11  percent or so, revenue up 6 percent or so.  What about the rest of the  year, did you get a sense of their guidance?</p><p> HUNT:  I would say that it was pretty positive, although what was  interesting is, a lot of people who had beats in the second quarter, didn't  want to raise full year guidance.  So that's telling you that maybe the  back half of the year isn't as strong or they would rather be cautious and  let themselves be in a position where they can beat earnings again, because  what also happens --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And they want to see what's going to come out of Washington.</p><p> HUNT:  Right.  And what also happens is that the analysts take numbers down  in the middle of the quarter, for next quarter and they end up coming back  up in the -- there's a lot of gaming that goes on in that respect.  But I  would say that they are --I didn't hear a lot of very cautionary second- half statements.  I heard more, you know, we are doing pretty well and  we're pretty optimistic about the next few months.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And the executives are talking less about President Trump on --  at least, early analysis of all the conference calls.  You just heard less  discussion about Washington and about President Trump, so they are sticking  to their knitting, so to speak.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Which is a good thing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Four billion dollars in assets under management, are you fully  invested?</p><p> HUNT:  We are.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great.  Sarah, great to see you.</p><p> HUNT:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Sarah Hunt, there.   Coming up, police arrest the suspect who allegedly reportedly shot and  killed the cop in Missouri.  The details on what lead to that capture,  next.  And then, Taylor Swift's going to court after she claims that  Colorado DJ groped her.  The opening statement for her lawyer made, coming  up, back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, futures indicating a lower opening for the  broader averages, take a look, Dow Industrial set to open down about 30  points, NASDAQ also down 30 points, that's one-half of one percent.  We are  looking at a few names on the move, Priceline is one to watch.  The stock  is falling following the company's latest earnings release.  </p><p> Earnings of $15.14 a share, topped expectations but the stock has been  weighed down by weak guidance for the third quarter.  The shares are down  better than seven percent right now.  We're watching Office Depot this  morning, set to report its second quarter earnings before the bell this  morning.  Analysts are expecting earnings of $0.08 a share.  </p><p> Shares of Office Depot are up better than 70 percent in the last year,  good-looking chart there.  A manhunt in Missouri for a police officer is  over, police officer killer.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  So, Maria, a suspect  wanted in the fatal shooting of a Missouri police officer over the weekend  was arrested last night.  Ian McCarthy had been on the run for nearly two  days.  He was arrested for shooting Officer Gary Michael that happened  after a traffic stop, Sunday night.  McCarthy has been charged with first- degree murder.  </p><p> Well, a former DJ denies ever touching Taylor Swift's backside on the  opening day of, we call it the groping trial.  David Mueller testifying he  may have touched Swift's rib cage or a rib, she says otherwise.  He's  seeking at least $3 million.  He's accusing the singer of getting him  fired.  Courtroom sketches show the pop star sitting not far from Mueller  yesterday.  Swift's lawyers saying the evidence of the assault is  overwhelming.  </p><p> Well, Starbucks launching a drink that's (INAUDIBLE) it's rooted in Mexico.   It's called the Horchata, it's almond milk Frappuccino, that's basically  what it is.  It's a blend of Almond milk, cinnamon syrup, coffee, yes,  whipped cream, caramel, and then cinnamon and sugars on top.  I'll be  checking that out at participating locations here in New York.  Anyway, you  can get it in the U.S. and Canada for extra, folks.  Here is the stock.   It's under pressure in the premarket just slightly, 54.04.  </p><p> And then finally, let's proceed on the food thing, Cheetos fans are going  to be in heaven over the next week, three days to be specifically.  A  Cheetos-themed restaurant is going to open in New York City between August  15th and 17th.  The menu for the Cheetos pop-up restaurant designed Anne  Burrell from the Food Network.  There she is, her hair and all.  I love  Anne Burrell.  Cheetos tacos, Cheetos fried pickles, Maria, Cheetos  cheesecake.  I know you're interested, maybe not.  Anyway, random offerings  of Cheetos.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Good news.  Dagen, do you like that, Cheetos?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  On occasion.  It's like one of those ribs and things.  You just  --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  On Occasion.  OK.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  They would like you just, you know, sitting in the airport and  then all of a sudden, it's like, whoa!  You get hit with that wave of  needing some Cheetos.  Horchata is delicious.  If you go into authentic  Mexican restaurants here in the United States, they will serve it.  I think  it's usually made from rice milk rather than almond milk.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I like the almond milk idea.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  That's just one more thing to slow down things at Starbucks.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're hyper sweet, by the way.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  For those of us who just want a stinking cup of coffee, we've  got to stand behind these people who are asking for things that are more  complicated than the formula for a nuclear weapon.</p><p> MURPHY:  And it's amazing.  As the country goes to healthier options,  Starbucks puts these drinks out that have thousands of calories.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A horchata is extremely, extremely sweet.  And I haven't tasted  this one, but the traditional horchata is.</p><p> MURPHY:  You don't need a doughnut to dunk in there.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  That's exactly right.</p><p> MURPHY:  It was the doughnut inside.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Drinking your doughnuts.  Now, get this -- I mean, seriously,  look at the calorie content, it's just as --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But how do they keep turning out these products and people are  buying them even in this new era of --</p><p> MURPHY:  I will tell you.  Millennials, children, even teenagers, are going  to Starbucks.  They'll spend $4.00 or $5.00 for a Frappuccino and mixed  whipped thing.  And Starbucks has a secret menu that's not posted and kids  access that on their phones, and they love it.  I can speak to that.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  It's elitism.  Elitism and (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, their parents will say no, no, you're not going to  Starbucks.  You're going to drink water and like it.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up, it is not a bird, it is the new Patriots  plane.  A behind-the-scenes look at the two, yes, two Boeing jets the  football team just purchased.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And now this, you're out, Major League Baseball has suspended  one of the most experienced umpires.  Jared Max with the details here.   Jared, good morning.</p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SPORTSCASTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  Joe  West has been a Major League ump since 1976.  He's not 64 year's old and  he's become a baseball celebrity of sorts, as we saw at the all-star game  last month.  Remember this when Nelson Cruz asked for a photo with West  just after he stepped to the plate.  Everyone loves country Joe West,  right?  Wrong.  </p><p> West has been suspended three games without pay by Major League Baseball  because when asked by USA Today last month, who's the biggest complainer in  the game?  Joe West said, it's got to be Adrian Beltre.  Every pitch you  call that's a strike, he says, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\"  I had a game with him  recently and the pitch was right down the middle.  He tells me, \"That ball  is outside.  I told him, \"You may be a great baseball player, but you're  the worst umpire in the league.  You stink.\"  Suspended three games without  pay.</p><p> Is there a way to make football a safer sport?  A Seattle-based sports  equipment company called VICIS has created a new helmet called \"Zero1\".   The helmet's outermost layer deforms like a car bumper, it yields when it's  hit and slows impact forces.  A second layer, reflex layer of columns that  bend and eventually buckle upon impact.  A third layer, a very thin hard  shell that protects against skull fractures.  And the fourth innermost  layer is the form layer which conforms to the player's head.  Now, the co- founder of the company, Dave Marver, says Zero1 makes a thump noise on  impact, not a crack.  He says the sound of the game is going to change.   Interestingly, I was told yesterday by forensic pathologists Dr. Bennett  Omalu who Will Smith portrayed in the movie, Concussion, \"Helmets prevent  only catastrophic injuries that could cause sudden and unexpected death on  the field.  </p><p> Off the field, August 23rd, on the streets of New York City, 5:00 p.m. at  the heart of rush hour, a protest rally has been planned to take place  outside the NFL League offices on Park Avenue in honor of Colin Kaepernick  because he's still unemployed.  While filmmaker Spike Lee tweeted this  poster for the event yesterday, Spike Lee later clarified on Twitter that  he is not the one in charge of this protest that will take place, again,  outside the NFL League offices of the 23rd.  Right --- again, right in 5:00  p.m.  That ought to be fun to stay on the east side at that point of the  day.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  That would really (INAUDIBLE) and influence people, won't it?   Absolutely.</p><p> MAX:  Last night, I got to attend an event, former New York Giant, George  Martin, spent 14 years with the team, walked 3,000 miles across the country  to raise money for first responders for 9/11, spoke about his time going  across the country as an African-American from the deep south.  He was  concerned I might run into trouble somewhere along the way and he stressed  that what he saw is how much more that we are the same than divided.  And  that really rang true to me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MURPHY:  Absolutely.  And if you're going live in this country to not stand  for our national anthem, you know, I have a problem with it.  And if I  owned the team, I wouldn't want someone to express their views like that,  so I think a team owner has the right to not bring in Colin Kaepernick.   So, when he protest that, I will avoid at all cost.</p><p> MAX:  And like I still believe that I don't think he wants to play in the  NFL.  When you look at the comments that he has made, why would -- you  know, you're talking about calling owners, slave owners, does he really  want to work in this league for anything, and why did he opt out of his  contract with the 49ers.  He could be signed up right now playing and he's  not.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.  Meanwhile, my favorite story of sports this  morning is about what the New England Patriots are doing.  They bought two  new huge planes, Boeing 767.  The team will be first in the NFL to have its  own planes rather than charter them.</p><p> MAX:  That's so cool.  It's great.  Well, it's --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Leave it to Bob Crest.</p><p> MAX:  A great reward for that Super Bowl 51 comeback.  It'll have all the  designs, the Super Bowl Trophies, the Lombardi Trophies.  Every seat on the  flight is a first-class seat, and some recline all the way and it will help  the players recover from the games.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  Yes.  But there's one big problem, Jared.  You know, the reports  are that the plane will not be pressurized, they're going to keep the  planes deflated as they fly.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MAX:  I knew something was coming.  I knew it was coming.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, god.</p><p> HUCKABEE:  They have a soft landing.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  A very good one.  That's a very good one.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Why don't more teams -- why don't they already own their  aircraft before now?</p><p> MAX:  Somebody -- that's like somebody said before the New York Yankees  started the YES Network, why don't more teams have their own networks, they  can control a lot more revenue and I get --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  All the NASCAR drivers for the most part, at the top tour of the  series, they have their own private jets, and they fly -- they lease some  of them very often, but they fly to the racetracks on the weekend to these  -- in these small private aircrafts where there's a gulf stream.</p><p> MAX:  Right.  Golfers, too, get crazy like that.</p><p> MURPHY:  I would like to see a lot more of this now, Patriots did it, now,  I think you'll see more and more teams.</p><p> MAX:  It would have made sense if it'd be the Jets, but, you know, they're  the Jets.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Jared.  Thank you, Jared Max.  Catch Jared's sports  reports in Fox News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius XM 115.</p><p> Still to come, researchers make a gigantic discovery.  The new dinosaur  fossils found and then the biggest ever recorded on earth.

I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, August 9th.   Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Thousands of American soldiers threatened.

Former Presidential Candidate and Arkansas<person><nameText>Governor Mike Huckabee. </nameText></person>And Rosecliff CEO Managing Partner Mike Murphy. Great to see you.</p><p><person><nameText>MIKE HUCKABEE, </nameText></person>FMR. ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Good morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF: Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>MURPHY: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And wow we came back --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I missed you when you're not here, when we're not together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. But we come back to some big stuff. Governor, what's your take on this escalating situation with North Korea?</p><p>HUCKABEE: A lot of people are trying to compare it to the Cuban Missile Crisis but the difference is we were dealing with a regime in the Soviet Union that was very different than North Korea. They knew they had a lot to lose.</p><p>Kim Jong-un has really nothing to lose. I mean this is brinkmanship at its worst and I think it's a very delicate situation for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is, it's so scary.</p><p>MCDOWELL: From the outside looking in though it seems like because the Hermit Kingdom is so isolated that it would -- that it would be possible to isolate and cutoff all the flow of funds. But those sanctions from the United Nations do not go far enough according to many.</p><p>MURPHY: I think it's kind of important to point out, this isn't a <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>issue though, this has been going on for years and years, some that they've allowed to be built up this way. So the fact that we're dealing with it now I think is kind of something that has to be dealt with.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean what else is he supposed to do other than push back with the creation and the implementation of these nuclear warheads now?</p><p>HUCKABEE: And I think the key is China. China is the one country that has the leverage, that has the ability and also has the most really in terms of the neighborhood to lose. I think that's where we're going to have to see the leverage supply.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We're going to talk more about this this morning. We got a big program ahead.</p><p>Coming up this morning, \"FOX NEWS\" Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano is here. The Governor of Wisconsin, Scott Walker is back with us this morning. Eric Trump's wife, <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>daughter-in-law and the Trump for President Senior Adviser, Lara Trump is with us this morning. And Former McDonald's CEO of the U.S., Former Famous Dave CEO, Ed Rensi joins us as well.</p><p>Big program ahead so don't miss a moment of it. And we're following breaking news out of the suburbs of Paris this morning where authority say six soldiers were injured after a vehicle deliberately slammed into them before driving off.</p><p>Authorities are now searching for that vehicle and its driver. The incident, the very latest of several attacks targeting security forces in France. Joining us right now Trump 2020 Advisory Board Member and Former Navy Seal, Carl Higbie. Carl, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>CARL HIGBIE, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, FORMER NAVY SEAL: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is what, the third or fourth attack in Paris or around Paris in the last year.</p><p>HIGBIE: They just keep coming. And you know what, like my heart goes out to the people of France but at the end of the day they've allowed this to happen. They've allowed this kind of loose societal grip and the expansion of these extreme views.</p><p>I mean, I'm not saying that it was something that it's not but at the end of the day that they've allowed this to expand and they've tolerated this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We want to find out exactly who's behind this and we don't want to speculate. We do want to talk about North Korea though Carl with you because the country's state land media announced and it was, \"Carefully examining plans for a missile strike that would create an enveloping fire around the Western Pacific Island of Guam where the U.S. has a critical Air Force base.\"</p><p>This threat is coming just a day after the U.S. flew a pair of B1 Bombers that took off from Guam over the Korean Peninsula. And then it was just hours after <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>used the harshest language we've heard yet in his response to recent taunt by North Korea. Listen to this Carl.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: North Korea best not make anymore threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.</p><p>He has been very threatening beyond a normal statement. And as I said, they will be met with fire, fury, and frankly, power the likes of which this world has never seen before.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well those high level war of words coming as \"FOX NEWS\" confirmed reports from U.S. Intelligence agencies that North Korea has in fact successfully miniaturized a nuclear warhead that could fit inside one of its missiles.</p><p>Carl Higbie, what do you make of this ratcheting up of the tensions here?</p><p>HIGBIE: Well I mean, this is ratcheting up -- as Governor Huckabee had said earlier, these ratcheting up has been happening over the last decade. I mean we stepped off the world's -- the world is in safer place America is strong and when America's in the front.</p><p>And this is something that we stepped out of the way and we've allowed this to happen. Much like France has allowed their population to run them up, we've allowed this and we've -- China has allowed this, Russia has allowed this.</p><p>We need to step up now and say enough is enough. I mean everyone's shocked when <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>comes out with strong rhetoric like this. All he's doing is saying, \"Stop threatening us.\" It's not like he's going on the offense here.</p><p>But sooner or later we're going to have to do something about it because obviously sanctions haven't worked, we cut away a third of their imports but at the end of the day, all he does is redirect the already limited sources going to his people back to his military complex.</p><p>HUCKABEE: You know Carl, I think all of us would love to see a diplomatic solution but it doesn't appear that North Koreans are prone to accepting any diplomacy.</p><p>From a military perspective, what are the options that the U.S has? I think a lot of Americans are saying, what could we do militarily that would stop this?</p><p>HIGBIE: Yes. Well our military is the population of some small countries out there. So it will -- what we can do is we can park three carrier strike groups off the Coast.</p><p>And I wrote about this in an Op-Ed this morning and next time he shoots a missile you shoot it down. The next time he shoots another missile, you shoot that down, you blow up the installation that it came from and you continue to repeat this over and over again.</p><p>And I think that Kim Jong, part of the problem is is his military leaders are probably telling him that he is the greatest military, he can't be defeated because they're worried about being executed themselves. So I think part of it is perception internally that we need to combat also with propaganda.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Are we dealing with something similar to the Emperor of Japan where it took an atomic bomb? I'm not saying we nuke the place, I'm just saying that it takes something as dramatic so that his own military people finally say, \"This isn't going to end well.\"</p><p>HIGBIE: Unfortunately, I think it's going to come to a show force and it may be at the hands of our military blowing up many of their military installations.</p><p>I hope that we don't have to take it out on the people because the people suffer so much and I wish we could avoid a conflict but at the end of the day, if he's threatening the United States and Guam with nuclear weapons, we need to do something. Sanctions and talking is not going to make any difference.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well -- but one, because we're talking about the sanctions Carl, does sanctions out of the U.N. even though China did vote for them, they only caught $1 billion of the $3 billion in exports, those could have gone further.</p><p>And \"The Wall Street Journal\" certainly in the editorial page has raised the issue of why did China sign on with these sanctions? Is it because it's worried legitimately so about the United States cracking down on Chinese firms doing business with North Korea and elsewhere?</p><p>So there's more to be done on sanctions. This country theoretically would be easy to starve, no pun intended.</p><p>HIGBIE: Right. Well that's the thing too. China is kind of stuck in a rock in a hard place. China doesn't want America to go into South -- or into North Korea because then it would have U.S. troops in their borders.</p><p>So that's one of the things they do not want. And also they are worried about us sanctioning them or working against their banks and their system but at the end of the day, it's one of those things.</p><p>Like China has kind of let this devolved into what it is. China can crush them if they wanted to, they're just not willing to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So should we give up on China? I mean is there anything else to do in terms of China and get engaging China further?</p><p>HIGBIE: I think we're kind of stuck in a stalemate and I think Ambassador Nikki Hailey did a great job negotiating these sanctions. I saw her the other morning speaking about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HIGBIE: But I think this is -- I think what's -- the first thing that's going to happen is China's going to come back to the table and say, \"Hey, how can we help?\" Once we take some sort of military action whether it be shooting down a missile or something to that effect.</p><p>I don't advocate for preemptive strike on North Korea at this time but I think we definitely need to start shooting down their missiles because they've made the threat, we need to assume that they are coming at one of our targets or one of our bases or allies so we need to get rid of it.</p><p>MURPHY: Hey Carl, it's Mike Murphy. If they do come at one of our bases or one of our allies, doesn't that make <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>job that much easier because I don't think there's anyone out there that would say we shouldn't defend ourselves or defend our interest.</p><p>So while it's stable rattling back and forth, people can knock <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>But once they attack us, I think we have to at that point respond, right?</p><p>HIGBIE: Well like the Governor said, this is -- I mean this is indicative of the world -- the Pre-World War II, Pre-Pearl Harbor Attack. I mean like we were just sitting there waiting trying to avoid getting into a conflict with them and ultimately it cost us Pearl Harbor.</p><p>So are we willing to wait that much longer? I mean look, if the left wing media is going to spin this as <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is a warmonger no matter what. Whether we're attacked or whether we do preemptive strikes.</p><p>So in the eyes of the media they're not going to be happy with them but I think this is about keeping the American people safe. And if we can't do that because the left wing media is so amped up at making sure that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is the enemy and not actually North Korea itself, I mean we need to start doing what's in the best interest of us and (INAUDIBLE) is scared right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It's not just the left wing media though. I mean this morning I saw soundbytes of Chuck Schumer, of other leading democrats basically attacking the president and saying this was irresponsible.</p><p>And you would think that those people who've been in congress for years even before <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>entered Washington knew the threat that is North Korea and wouldn't pile on but try to help with solutions. Meanwhile there's this new \"CBS\" -- yes, go ahead Carl.</p><p>HIGBIE: Yes. Well Maria, what was irresponsible is people like Chuck Schumer sitting idly by, why Barrack Obama allowed them to expand the technology to get to where we are now. That's their fault and that was irresponsible for them. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is reacting.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Carl, I'm confident of the fact that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is surrounded by some military experts, Kelly, McMaster, Mattis. These are people who understand not only the full capacity of the U.S. and of North Korea but they've studied this and game this at the table over and over again.</p><p>With all due respect to Chuck Schumer which is not a lot, he has no idea what he's doing. This is not a political issue, this is an issue of extraordinary sensitivity and I'm glad that he's surrounded by military people and not just by a bunch of whiny diplomats and politicians.</p><p>HIGBIE: Couldn't agree more Governor.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true, they're treating it like a political issue.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well they make it about <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>language and his words and rhetoric, whatever you want to call it and not make it about the issue at hand. And that is North Korea from administration to administration.</p><p>We have stepped back and allowed the Hermit Kingdom to develop and intercontinental ballistic missile and miniaturized warheads that could deliver a nuclear vice potential to the United States, period. And the fact that that is still loss on many people and government and outside of government is mindboggling.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It really is. And to treat it as a political issue is really so unacceptable. Carl, good to see you. Thanks very much for weighing in here.</p><p>HIGBIE: Thanks folks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching the developments obviously. Carl Higbie there. Coming up, a technical issue for Southwest Airlines causes major delays. What you need to know before you head to the airport, that's next.</p><p>And then remembering Glen Campbell, the legendary singer famous for combining country and pop music has died at the age of 81. We'll take a look at his achievements straight ahead, back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news out of China this morning, Cheryl Casone with the details of a devastating earthquake, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So Maria, this very strong earthquake in Southwest China has killed at least 19 people, about 250 others also injured. Forty of those injured in serious conditions as quake knocking out power and phone networks which is right now complicating search efforts.</p><p>We're also following Tropical Storm Franklin which is moving into the sea after hitting Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Forecasters are saying that Franklin is expected to strengthen into a hurricane before it makes its second landfall on Mexico Central Gulf Coasts.</p><p>Meanwhile here in the U.S., heavy rains caused a major flooding down in Houston, Texas. There's been about two dozen water rescues in the area, look at this. The National Weather Service has issued a flashflood watch for the region, that will go through until this morning.</p><p>Well a technology issue causing some problems on the West Coast for travelers flying on Southwest Airlines. Southwest says the problem delay about 120 flights last night. All but seven departed after experiencing an average delay of at least 90 minutes.</p><p>Those delays reported at Reno Tahoe International Airport, at Sacramento also as well. So we're following that story and the stock shares at Southwest up 10 percent so far this year.</p><p>Well finally this morning, the world is mourning. The loss of country legend Glen Campbell, he lost his battle with Alzheimer's.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLEN CAMPBELL: Like a rhinestone cowboy, riding out on a horse in a star- spangled rodeo.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well Campbell became a staple in country music history. His career spend 50 years. Friends and family are remembering Campbell at an outpouring of messages. His long-time friend Dolly Parton Twitted this:</p><p>TEXT: Glen Campbell was one of the greatest voices of all time. I will always love you, Glen.</p><p>Fellow country music singer Tim McGraw said:</p><p>TEXT: Songs, songs, songs, man in a world of good stuff, his was great. In a world of great stuff, his was special.</p><p>And his daughter Ashley tweeted this picture which is just -- it's a sad picture:</p><p>TEXT: Heartbroken, I owe him everything I am and everything I ever will be. He will be remembered so well and with so much love.</p><p>Glen Campbell died in Nashville yesterday. He was surrounded by his family, he was 81 years old Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much Cheryl. I like that picture. I thought that picture said a lot actually.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Beautiful picture. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like it with his hand. Good Arkansas boy?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes. Came from --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like yourself.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- Billstown, Arkansas near Delight, a suburb of Delight which I'm sure you've never heard off. Not far from where I grew up in Hope, Arkansas. Southwest Arkansas guy, wonderful family. He was like the fifth of twelve kids.</p><p>But his agility on the guitar was something a lot of people never understood. He was a studio musician with a famed Wrecking Crew. If you haven't seen the documentary, the Wrecking Crew by Denny Tedesco, one of the best music documentaries I've ever witnessed and it will explain why the music of the '60s were so amazing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I wish all of the obituaries and in remembrance of Glen Campbell because we were talking about it in the break mentioned the Wrecking Crew because it really goes to his musical chops and agility.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Unbelievable guitar player.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I know that the surviving members, the Wrecking Crew recorded some of the most famous songs coming out of California and --</p><p>HUCKABEE: Basically all the songs coming out of California.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Whether it's the Beach Boys or --</p><p>HUCKABEE: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- Sonny and Cher. And I know Carol Kaye we're talking about the famous --</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes, greatest bases player ever.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Female bassist with the Wrecking Crew. She has sent her remembrance there published online.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But Glen Campbell, everything thinks of him as the voice and the singing. He was great at that. He had a distinctive voice.</p><p>But, again, as a musician, he was a musician's musician at the top of the game, unbelievable on the guitar.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So great to hear all of that.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes, great man.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a break. When we come back, how safe is your password? The man who wrote the rule now says he regrets his original advice. The new guidelines on passwords, next.</p><p>And then one restaurant is dangerously cheesy, the whacky menu items at the new Cheetos Cafe, straight ahead. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Does your password contain at least one capital letter, a number, and a symbol? Why your strong password is not really that strong at all. Tracee Carrasco with all the details here, Tracee.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. Yes. The man who wrote the go-to guide for federal agencies, universities, and large companies looking for password, setting rules to follow now says he was wrong.</p><p>Bill Burr now retired from the National Institute of Standards and Technology says you don't need to make up funny words, use a letter, number, uppercase, and lowercase letter, and a special character like an exclamation point.</p><p>He also said your password doesn't need an expiration date because all of these rules do very little for security and don't keep the hackers away. The NIST revised the guidelines in June and now say to use long, easy to remember phrases. And user should only be forced to change passwords if there's a sign they may have been stolen. It makes sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And how do you know if your password is stolen?</p><p>CARRASCO: Well first of all obviously if it doesn't work. If you start getting random messages like antivirus messages, if you get unwanted browser tools, all of these show that your password may have been compromised.</p><p>MURPHY: Bank account is empty.</p><p>CARRASCO: Yes. Identity stolen.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes, I got hacked but the thieves were spending less than I was on my credit card. So I never reported it. So why bother.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you -- this is slightly different but I think that the efforts by financial institutions and other institution to protect your identity, they overstepped. I went to take out a little bit of cash from an ATM when I was in Virginia and it wouldn't let me take the cash out because it automatically assumed that I was -- that the card had been stolen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That you weren't there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the card had been stolen and that the pass code had been compromised. That -- and it wasn't much money either, there was a few hundred dollars.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Dagen, you just didn't have any money in your account. That's why they didn't let you have any money.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I immediately got a call from this bank that I increasingly despise and, again, the -- if you make any mistake -- if you put the wrong password in a couple times you get locked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MURPHY: Thanks for losing a ton of money from this fraud because when money's taken out of your account by a hacker, it's not your responsibility. Ultimately the bank eats it so they'd rather aggravate you then lose money on the other side.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Aggravate me and I'll be walking across the street to the bank next door.</p><p>MURPHY: Good point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Tracee thank you. Tracee Carrasco there. We'll take a break. When we come back, Disney saying goodbye to Netflixending its movie distribution deal with the streaming company. What does it mean for the future of TV and how will Disney create its own streaming service?</p><p>Plus, some coffee lovers are going nuts over a new drink at Starbucks. Details on the new frapuccino inspired by Mexico, straight ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Happy Wednesday everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo </nameText></person>and it is Wednesday, August 9th. Your top stories right now 6:30a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>On the brink, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>promising fire and fury against North Korea if the Hermit Kingdom continues with its threat against the United States.</p><p>The country is now responding with state media reporting it is considering a missile strike around the Western Pacific Island of Guam where the U.S. has a critical air force base.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We woke up to the media reports of North Korea's talk of revenge on the United States and the so-called new found technology that allows them to target Guam and attack or threat on Guam is a threat or attack on the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The news putting global markets on edge. In Asia overnight, declines across the board as you can see, the Nikkei in Japan and the Kospi in Korea, the worst performers. In Europe this morning, markets are under pressure there as well, taking a cue from Asia.</p><p>The European indices are down between three-quarters of one percent and almost two percent in Paris, and in the U.S. futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages as you can see. The Dow Jones Industrial Average down a fraction with the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ down a round and a half a percent of piece. An arrest made in the shooting death of the Missouri police officer.</p><p>The very latest says the suspect has taken into custody, following a manhunt that lasted several days. And new details this morning, in Taylor Swift's case, against the former radio DJ, why he's coming under fire for changing his story. Disney cuts the cord and its deal with Netflix, why Mickey and Company are planning to launch their own streaming services and not give any films to Netflix.</p><p>Talk about perfectly cooked. How you can now get your luxury meal covered in Cheetos. And next step, Super Bowl. The details, as the New England Patriots become the first NFL team with its own plane, all that coming up this morning. And our top story first this half an hour, earnings and focus on Wall Street this morning.</p><p>The parent company of the Fox Business Network 21st Century Fox set to report after the bell tonight, while Kohl's, Macy's and Snap, among the names due out tomorrow. Disney beat earnings expectations last night while missing on revenue. The big story was the company's bombshell streaming reveal to combat its cable woes.</p><p>The company is one working on two new services, one for ESPN Sports Programming and another for its movies and TV shows, which means Disney is pulling its content from Netflixto start its own streaming service. The announcement a huge blow to the streaming giant which is down, Netflixthis morning, down almost four percent in the pre-market.</p><p>The news quickly overshadowed Netflixa surprise deal for a talk show with late night legend, David Letterman. Joining us right now is, Alpine Funds Portfolio Manager, Sarah Hunt. And Sarah, the race to the stringing supremacies certainly heating up, I know you own technology, do you also own Netflixand some of the streaming in media or Disney?</p><p>SARAH HUNT, MANAGER, ALPINE FUNDS PORTFOLIO: So, we're dividend players, so a lot of those companies are not paying dividends right now. So, we would own something like an Apple, which says they (INAUDIBLE) Microsoft but we wouldn't own something like a Netflix here.</p><p>And I think that this just shows you also the tension between, is the content -- who is going to be in charge of what's going to happen and I think that this is a big -- when I saw these numbers last night, and when I saw the announcement from Disney, I thought, this is going to be interesting because Netflixis one of those companies that's held up very well. So let's see how that goes on the back of this, and whether or not other people think about following suit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the broader markets? What do you think?</p><p>HUNT: I think, what it appears, where we've had some really nice earnings for Q2, right? The first half of this year has been really good relative to the last couple of years where you had barely, stagnant earnings. So, I think, that's been very supportive.</p><p>But I also think that the market is expecting a lot of things to happen on the political front and the question of whether or not they are going to happen, becomes one that becomes more and more important as we get through the balance of this year.</p><p>I also think as we enter into the second half of the year, let's see if we -- what people start saying about next year. And I think that there is some concern that valuations are at pretty high level and so, therefore, you have to see continued growth or some changes on the other economic fronts.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; FOUNDER, ROSECLIFF VENTURES: I agree with you on the growth front, that we need growth to keep crisis where they are. But, I would kind of disagree on the political front. I think where we are right now the market is supported up here at these levels by the earnings growth we have seen.</p><p>I think if you get something out of Washington would actually be a next leg higher in the market, because I don't really see it being priced in here. I think the numbers can't support it. But then when you see a company like Disney that misses on numbers, the market is going to punish that stock and that's what you're seeing this morning.</p><p>HUNT: We have also seen -- there was an interesting report yesterday that talked a lot about how companies are reacting to positive surprises and that they're not reacting as well the positive surprises that they have in the last couple of years. And that might also tell you that there's a little bit of push to what do I get to that next increment? So maybe that's that, but I also think that people started build in some numbers into '18 on tax reform that may have to come out. We will see how that goes.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: If you're looking now, if you think this market is overvalued or a lot of the really popular stocks are overvalued, and you're looking for ballast, you're looking for something to offset the risk in your equity portfolio, can you really put money in treasuries at this point, if you look at the yield on the 10-year treasury, it's below 2.3 percent, those are also rich and theoretically, if you had both markets go the wrong way on you, that's all she wrote.</p><p>HUNT: Yes, and you probably have more risk in Treasuries if they go against you because the change in interest rates because they're so -- the rates are so low now. It's probably more problematic on price. I think that a lot of the stocks underneath the big tech names and some of the big stocks in the averages have actually gotten.</p><p>You've seen a lot of stocks actually come down in the last six months on the retail side, on energy, there have been places where there is room. Now, there's also some threats there which is why those stocks have gotten cheaper. But I think there are places to look in the defense stocks while they are expensive, if you look at what's going on right now, I think that there's some places there that you can look.</p><p>And it's the same problem that everyone has had for the last couple of years. Where do you put your money? Where you've driven interest rates low across not only the U.S., but international, it's even worse. You get negative rates across parts of Europe, so that's even harder for people looking to put money to work.</p><p><person><nameText>MIKE HUCKABEE, </nameText></person>FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS: Sarah, let me just ask this, if Congress were to actually get tax reform done, does that super charge the market in all the sectors? Does that really make that kind of difference?</p><p>MURPHY: I think, for sure, it does, Governor, if I could weigh in on that, because that gives all companies a tax break, it gives more companies increased earnings, just balance sheets will look better from that. Now, you have seen in this market the reason why at all-time highs, is that you're seeing rotations.</p><p>When people sell energy or they sell retail, they are putting that money in large cap tech, or they are putting that money in the financials, in the banks. So I think, money would come off the side lines, new money would come into the market if that were to happen. I'd think that would push the market higher.</p><p>HUNT: I think it would definitely help. I mean, you're definitely -- there's a lot of companies that have a lot of sales overseas. So the companies that would benefit the most are the ones that are primarily U.S.- based because that's where their taxes are going to get better the most. If you could bring some of the money back from overseas, I think there's a lot of cash dropped over there.</p><p>There's been a lot of discussions about that back and forth about whether or not, how to bring that back and what do you do with it and do you put parameters around what you do with it. Because I think, that we're still looking for capital spending and that still been a sub par version of the kind of growth that we're looking for in the economic front that's absent what the government can do.</p><p>So, if you could bring some of that money back or free up more money from a tax perspective, maybe that's something that starts to kick-start other parts of the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Businesses have been sitting on cash because of the regulatory environment largely. But, let me ask you about North Korea, how much of a focus is this for the market? Yesterday, it felt like the market did react, was that what it was reacting to yesterday in your view?</p><p>HUNT: It felt like it was reacting but it was still a fairly moderate reaction. Even the Kospi, which you would think of all the places where you would see a bigger --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What kind of a wild card does this represent for markets?</p><p>HUNT: I think the market has seen so many different wild cards in the last year or two that it's very -- it needs to see something that feels more like, other than rhetoric for it to be more of an impact, but I also think you're getting out of earning season.</p><p>So from a catalyst standpoint, you've taken that off the table. So maybe August, which can be a tough month anyway from a volume perspective, is trickier to react to things because you have less trading going on and so, therefore, you might see a bigger reaction. But so far, I wouldn't say that this is a huge reaction thus far.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you want safety in your portfolio, erase the issue of 10-year treasuries, want a little bit of security, less risk, what do you buy at this point? Because you have vast numbers of asset classes that look expensive, not wildly overvalued.</p><p>HUNT: So we're (INAUDIBLE) stock mutual funds that basically on dividends. So we would look for higher dividend stocks in places where you may have seen some corrections already. You know, MBP, something like that, but I agree with you, I think it's very difficult and I think that that's part of the problem.</p><p>And if you look at credit spreads, they have gotten incredibly tight, which is telling you, you know, how yield has been chased down both in the U.S. and in Europe, in Europe, it's even worse. The high yields spread over governments, because governments in some cases are almost nothing negligible or negative.</p><p>So I think that it is a really challenging period of time and to be putting together a portfolio if you're an insurance company or somebody else who is trying to then work out pensions later, is a very big challenge in this environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did you get a sense of the rest of the year from what you just heard in the second-quarter earnings reports, second quarter profits up 11 percent or so, revenue up 6 percent or so. What about the rest of the year, did you get a sense of their guidance?</p><p>HUNT: I would say that it was pretty positive, although what was interesting is, a lot of people who had beats in the second quarter, didn't want to raise full year guidance. So that's telling you that maybe the back half of the year isn't as strong or they would rather be cautious and let themselves be in a position where they can beat earnings again, because what also happens --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they want to see what's going to come out of Washington.</p><p>HUNT: Right. And what also happens is that the analysts take numbers down in the middle of the quarter, for next quarter and they end up coming back up in the -- there's a lot of gaming that goes on in that respect. But I would say that they are --I didn't hear a lot of very cautionary second- half statements. I heard more, you know, we are doing pretty well and we're pretty optimistic about the next few months.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the executives are talking less about <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>on -- at least, early analysis of all the conference calls. You just heard less discussion about Washington and about <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>so they are sticking to their knitting, so to speak.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Which is a good thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Four billion dollars in assets under management, are you fully invested?</p><p>HUNT: We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great. Sarah, great to see you.</p><p>HUNT: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Sarah Hunt, there. Coming up, police arrest the suspect who allegedly reportedly shot and killed the cop in Missouri. The details on what lead to that capture, next. And then, Taylor Swift's going to court after she claims that Colorado DJ groped her. The opening statement for her lawyer made, coming up, back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages, take a look, Dow Industrial set to open down about 30 points, NASDAQ also down 30 points, that's one-half of one percent. We are looking at a few names on the move, Priceline is one to watch. The stock is falling following the company's latest earnings release.</p><p>Earnings of $15.14 a share, topped expectations but the stock has been weighed down by weak guidance for the third quarter. The shares are down better than seven percent right now. We're watching Office Depot this morning, set to report its second quarter earnings before the bell this morning. Analysts are expecting earnings of $0.08 a share.</p><p>Shares of Office Depot are up better than 70 percent in the last year, good-looking chart there. A manhunt in Missouri for a police officer is over, police officer killer. Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. So, Maria, a suspect wanted in the fatal shooting of a Missouri police officer over the weekend was arrested last night. Ian McCarthy had been on the run for nearly two days. He was arrested for shooting Officer Gary Michael that happened after a traffic stop, Sunday night. McCarthy has been charged with first- degree murder.</p><p>Well, a former DJ denies ever touching Taylor Swift's backside on the opening day of, we call it the groping trial. David Mueller testifying he may have touched Swift's rib cage or a rib, she says otherwise. He's seeking at least $3 million. He's accusing the singer of getting him fired. Courtroom sketches show the pop star sitting not far from Mueller yesterday. Swift's lawyers saying the evidence of the assault is overwhelming.</p><p>Well, Starbucks launching a drink that's (INAUDIBLE) it's rooted in Mexico. It's called the Horchata, it's almond milk Frappuccino, that's basically what it is. It's a blend of Almond milk, cinnamon syrup, coffee, yes, whipped cream, caramel, and then cinnamon and sugars on top. I'll be checking that out at participating locations here in New York. Anyway, you can get it in the U.S. and Canada for extra, folks. Here is the stock. It's under pressure in the premarket just slightly, 54.04.</p><p>And then finally, let's proceed on the food thing, Cheetos fans are going to be in heaven over the next week, three days to be specifically. A Cheetos-themed restaurant is going to open in New York City between August 15th and 17th. The menu for the Cheetos pop-up restaurant designed Anne Burrell from the Food Network. There she is, her hair and all. I love Anne Burrell. Cheetos tacos, Cheetos fried pickles, Maria, Cheetos cheesecake. I know you're interested, maybe not. Anyway, random offerings of Cheetos.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Good news. Dagen, do you like that, Cheetos?</p><p>MCDOWELL: On occasion. It's like one of those ribs and things. You just --</p><p>BARTIROMO: On Occasion. OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They would like you just, you know, sitting in the airport and then all of a sudden, it's like, whoa! You get hit with that wave of needing some Cheetos. Horchata is delicious. If you go into authentic Mexican restaurants here in the United States, they will serve it. I think it's usually made from rice milk rather than almond milk.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like the almond milk idea.</p><p>HUCKABEE: That's just one more thing to slow down things at Starbucks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're hyper sweet, by the way.</p><p>HUCKABEE: For those of us who just want a stinking cup of coffee, we've got to stand behind these people who are asking for things that are more complicated than the formula for a nuclear weapon.</p><p>MURPHY: And it's amazing. As the country goes to healthier options, Starbucks puts these drinks out that have thousands of calories.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A horchata is extremely, extremely sweet. And I haven't tasted this one, but the traditional horchata is.</p><p>MURPHY: You don't need a doughnut to dunk in there.</p><p>HUCKABEE: That's exactly right.</p><p>MURPHY: It was the doughnut inside.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Drinking your doughnuts. Now, get this -- I mean, seriously, look at the calorie content, it's just as --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But how do they keep turning out these products and people are buying them even in this new era of --</p><p>MURPHY: I will tell you. Millennials, children, even teenagers, are going to Starbucks. They'll spend $4.00 or $5.00 for a Frappuccino and mixed whipped thing. And Starbucks has a secret menu that's not posted and kids access that on their phones, and they love it. I can speak to that.</p><p>HUCKABEE: It's elitism. Elitism and (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, their parents will say no, no, you're not going to Starbucks. You're going to drink water and like it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Coming up, it is not a bird, it is the new Patriots plane. A behind-the-scenes look at the two, yes, two Boeing jets the football team just purchased. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And now this, you're out, Major League Baseball has suspended one of the most experienced umpires. Jared Max with the details here. Jared, good morning.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS CHANNEL SPORTSCASTER: Hey, good morning, Maria. Joe West has been a Major League ump since 1976. He's not 64 year's old and he's become a baseball celebrity of sorts, as we saw at the all-star game last month. Remember this when Nelson Cruz asked for a photo with West just after he stepped to the plate. Everyone loves country Joe West, right? Wrong.</p><p>West has been suspended three games without pay by Major League Baseball because when asked by USA Today last month, who's the biggest complainer in the game? Joe West said, it's got to be Adrian Beltre. Every pitch you call that's a strike, he says, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\" I had a game with him recently and the pitch was right down the middle. He tells me, \"That ball is outside. I told him, \"You may be a great baseball player, but you're the worst umpire in the league. You stink.\" Suspended three games without pay.</p><p>Is there a way to make football a safer sport? A Seattle-based sports equipment company called VICIS has created a new helmet called \"Zero1\". The helmet's outermost layer deforms like a car bumper, it yields when it's hit and slows impact forces. A second layer, reflex layer of columns that bend and eventually buckle upon impact. A third layer, a very thin hard shell that protects against skull fractures. And the fourth innermost layer is the form layer which conforms to the player's head. Now, the co- founder of the company, Dave Marver, says Zero1 makes a thump noise on impact, not a crack. He says the sound of the game is going to change. Interestingly, I was told yesterday by forensic pathologists Dr. Bennett Omalu who Will Smith portrayed in the movie, Concussion, \"Helmets prevent only catastrophic injuries that could cause sudden and unexpected death on the field.</p><p>Off the field, August 23rd, on the streets of New York City, 5:00 p.m. at the heart of rush hour, a protest rally has been planned to take place outside the NFL League offices on Park Avenue in honor of Colin Kaepernick because he's still unemployed. While filmmaker Spike Lee tweeted this poster for the event yesterday, Spike Lee later clarified on Twitter that he is not the one in charge of this protest that will take place, again, outside the NFL League offices of the 23rd. Right --- again, right in 5:00 p.m. That ought to be fun to stay on the east side at that point of the day.</p><p>HUCKABEE: That would really (INAUDIBLE) and influence people, won't it? Absolutely.</p><p>MAX: Last night, I got to attend an event, former New York Giant, George Martin, spent 14 years with the team, walked 3,000 miles across the country to raise money for first responders for 9/11, spoke about his time going across the country as an African-American from the deep south. He was concerned I might run into trouble somewhere along the way and he stressed that what he saw is how much more that we are the same than divided. And that really rang true to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MURPHY: Absolutely. And if you're going live in this country to not stand for our national anthem, you know, I have a problem with it. And if I owned the team, I wouldn't want someone to express their views like that, so I think a team owner has the right to not bring in Colin Kaepernick. So, when he protest that, I will avoid at all cost.</p><p>MAX: And like I still believe that I don't think he wants to play in the NFL. When you look at the comments that he has made, why would -- you know, you're talking about calling owners, slave owners, does he really want to work in this league for anything, and why did he opt out of his contract with the 49ers. He could be signed up right now playing and he's not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true. Meanwhile, my favorite story of sports this morning is about what the New England Patriots are doing. They bought two new huge planes, Boeing 767. The team will be first in the NFL to have its own planes rather than charter them.</p><p>MAX: That's so cool. It's great. Well, it's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Leave it to Bob Crest.</p><p>MAX: A great reward for that Super Bowl 51 comeback. It'll have all the designs, the Super Bowl Trophies, the Lombardi Trophies. Every seat on the flight is a first-class seat, and some recline all the way and it will help the players recover from the games.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes. But there's one big problem, Jared. You know, the reports are that the plane will not be pressurized, they're going to keep the planes deflated as they fly.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MAX: I knew something was coming. I knew it was coming.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, god.</p><p>HUCKABEE: They have a soft landing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: A very good one. That's a very good one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why don't more teams -- why don't they already own their aircraft before now?</p><p>MAX: Somebody -- that's like somebody said before the New York Yankees started the YES Network, why don't more teams have their own networks, they can control a lot more revenue and I get --</p><p>MCDOWELL: All the NASCAR drivers for the most part, at the top tour of the series, they have their own private jets, and they fly -- they lease some of them very often, but they fly to the racetracks on the weekend to these -- in these small private aircrafts where there's a gulf stream.</p><p>MAX: Right. Golfers, too, get crazy like that.</p><p>MURPHY: I would like to see a lot more of this now, Patriots did it, now, I think you'll see more and more teams.</p><p>MAX: It would have made sense if it'd be the Jets, but, you know, they're the Jets.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Jared. Thank you, Jared Max. Catch Jared's sports reports in Fox News Headlines 24/7 or Sirius XM 115.</p><p>Still to come, researchers make a gigantic discovery.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished essentially flat. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Investors weighed another batch of mostly solid company earnings reports. Sprint soared after a federal judge cleared a major obstacle to the company being acquired by T-Mobile. Microsoft and Facebook slumped after federal regulators announced they've ramped up an antitrust probe into the two companies as well as Amazon, Apple and Google parent Alphabet.</p><p>  Cruise operators, hotels and other companies that focus on travel made solid gains, the latest sign that traders are feeling less worried about the economic impact from the virus outbreak that began in China.</p><p>  ''Stocks are collectively saying, 'hey, maybe we can work past some of the noise with the virus; maybe the fallout won't be as big as we thought,\" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird. ''And the U.S. economy, so far at least, looks like it's weathering it pretty well.'' </p><p>  The S&amp;P 500 index rose 5.66 points, or 0.2%, to 3,357.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.48 points, or less than 0.1%, to 29,276.34. It had been up 0.5%. </p><p>  The Nasdaq composite gained 10.55 points, or 0.1%, to 9,638.94. The Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks picked up 9.85 points, or 0.6%, to 1,677.51.</p><p>  Markets in Europe and Asia rose.</p><p>  Bond prices fell, sending bond yields higher. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.60% from 1.54% late Monday.</p><p>  After a downbeat January, U.S. stocks have been mostly notching gains this month as traders brush off fears about the virus outbreak and its impact on businesses and the global economy. Beijing has promised to take measures to soften the blow to China's economy and investors are hopeful that other governments will do the same if necessary.</p><p>  China remained mostly closed for business Tuesday as the daily death toll from a new virus topped 100 for the first time, pushing the total deaths above 1,000. The outbreak has infected more than 43,000 people globally, though most of the cases and deaths are in China.</p><p>  Travel-related stocks, which have been hammered by traders in recent weeks, notched gains Tuesday. Hilton Worldwide rose 1.4%, Carnival climbed 2.8% and American Airlines gained 3.6%.</p><p>  Wall Street got some encouragement Tuesday from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. In his semiannual monetary report to Congress, Powell said it was too early to assess the threat the virus poses to the U.S. economy, but he noted that the economy ''is in a very good place'' with strong job creation and moderate growth.</p><p>  Traders welcomed a federal judge's decision to reject claims by a group of states arguing T-Mobile's proposed $26.5 billion buyout of rival Sprint would mean less competition and higher phone bills. Shares in Sprint surged 77.5%, while T-Mobile jumped 11.8%.</p><p>  Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday it has ordered Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google's parent Alphabet to turn over detailed information on their acquisitions going back to 2010 as part of an investigation into the five giant tech companies' market dominance. </p><p>  The FTC, the Justice Department and a House committee have been investigating the conduct of big tech companies and whether they aggressively bought potential rivals to suppress competition. Some critics have pointed to Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp, for example, as deals that should be questioned.</p><p>Microsoft slid 2.3%, Facebook fell 2.8% and Apple dropped 0.6%. Amazon rose 0.8%, while Alphabet inched up 0.1%.</p><p>  Investors also assessed the latest batch of company earnings reports Tuesday.</p><p>AutoNation climbed 6.3% after the car dealership's latest quarterly results topped Wall Street's forecasts, aided by higher demand for used cars.</p><p>  Cloud-based phone system provider RingCentral also posted surprisingly good earnings and issued a solid forecast. The stock rose 6.8%.</p><p>  Strong fourth-quarter results also gave shares in Brighthouse Financial a boost. Shares in the annuity and life insurance company, which announced a $500 million share buyback program, jumped 10.7%. </p><p>  Results from other companies failed to impress traders. </p><p>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber slumped 12.4% after the tire maker's fourth-quarter earnings and revenue fell short of Wall Street forecasts.</p><p>  Under Armour plunged 18.9% after the athletic gear company said it may need to restructure this year, which may involve scuttling the opening of its New York City flagship store. The company also gave investors a weak profit forecast for the year and said the virus outbreak in China will drag first-quarter sales down by $50 million to $60 million.</p><p>  Benchmark crude oil rose 37 cents to settle at $49.94 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, gained 74 cents to close at $54.01 a barrel. Wholesale gasoline fell 1 cent to $1.51 per gallon. Heating oil climbed 2 cents to $1.63 per gallon. Natural gas rose 2 cents to $1.79 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p><p>  Gold fell $9.10 to $1,565.60 per ounce, silver fell 19 cents to $17.57 per ounce and copper rose 3 cents to $2.59 per pound.</p><p>  The dollar rose to 109.76 Japanese yen from 109.70 yen on Monday. The euro strengthened to $1.0922 from $1.0914.</p><p>  ___</p><p>  AP Business Writer Damian J.

Many other firms are quietly shedding staff. McCarthy T\u00e9trault, one of the pillars of Bay Street law, is down from a pre-2008 high of nearly 700 lawyers to 560. Some top-tier firms are finding less expensive offices, or sloughing off a floor or two.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A rarely heard word has gained currency in this moment: de-equitization. It describes the formerly unthinkable process of removing a partner from the ranks of those with ownership shares in the firm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"Up until a year, a year and a half ago, there were critics, but it seemed nothing would ever change,\" says Hudson's Bay Co.'s general counsel, David Pickwoad, formerly an associate at Stikeman Elliott. \"But now, the pace of change in the profession is breathtaking.\" </p><p> And things are tight where they were never tight before. In recent years, between 12% and 15% of law graduates have been unable to find articling posts in Ontario. Meanwhile, \"the market for  associates, including senior associates, isn't nearly what it once was,\" says Christopher Sweeney, the CEO of Canada's leading legal recruitment firm, ZSA. \"We're mainly concentrating these days on partners making lateral moves and in-house hiring [at corporations].\" </p><p> Up to a point, the industry is having this existential moment for a simple reason: There's not as much deal-making going on as there used to be. But the slowdown is also exposing archaic practices in a business that is perhaps just a little too steeped in tradition, mystique and notions of prestige. Billing rates as high as $1,000 an hour don't seem sustainable in light of stark facts like the spectacular collapse of Wall Street firm Dewey &amp; LeBeouf. Technology, outsourcing, modern management methods and a spirit of transparency are finally remaking corporate law, just as they have so many other businesses. At the same time, these tectonic forces are creating opportunities for both lawyers and their clients. </p><p> All the upheaval makes me glad I didn't stay in law myself. I followed my father into the practice, but left in the late '90s, for the riskier, lower-paid business of journalism. If I'd stayed, I'd be in the thick of the upheaval now - like Rubsun Ho, who was a year behind me at the University of Toronto's law school in the '90s. He's an affable, soft-spoken guy who, after graduating, joined Stikeman. Following that stint, he was hired as in-house counsel at a software company.</p><p> And then he became one of the revolutionaries of what is sometimes called New Law: In 2005, Ho and former Osler Hoskin &amp; Harcourt lawyer Joe Milstone founded Cognition. </p><p> That sounds like a funny name for a law firm, but it's not unusual: Big Law firms are named after venerated partners; New Law firms are branded with vaguely positive handles. </p><p> And where the offices of Big Law firms are all about the mahogany, New Law is more about particleboard. </p><p> Indeed, Cognition's loft-style offices, west of Toronto's downtown core, are a little shabby, with dog-eared law texts jumbled on Ikea shelves. An interview with Ho and Milstone is held instead at a small satellite \"intake centre\" they've set up in Toronto's MaRS Centre.</p><p> The old hospital complex where Banting and Best hopefully injected diabetes patients has lately become, in part, an incubator for innovative science- and technology-driven companies. Ho and Milstone's lawyers offer informal counsel (and free doughnuts) once a week to the incubator's denizens, hoping to catch a clean-tech or Internet start-up on its way to success. </p><p> Seems pretty entrepreneurial for a law firm, doesn't it? But the fundamentals of New Law go further than a willingness to prospect for business. The principles behind Cognition - and behind the U.S. firm, Axiom, that inspired it - include being tech-savvy, efficiency-conscious, low-overhead and partner-free. </p><p> Ho explains that something came to him one day when he was staring out his 53rd-floor window at Stikeman: His work was being billed to clients at $250 an hour, while his take-home worked out to about $40 an hour. </p><p> That rang a bell for me. A couple of years ago, I heard a Canadian-born venture capitalist working in Silicon Valley explain why he'd been happy to have a hand in backing Axiom. </p><p> \"The buy-sell in law is awfully broken,\" Chris Albinson said. \"How many lawyers do you know who enjoy their work lives? Look at the cost structure of law firms: A third of the dollars goes to the senior partners who are doing no work; one third into physical plant - marble conference rooms that add no value; one third goes to the guys and gals doing the work, the associates.</p><p> \"And all clients hate it....They want to work with the person most capable of doing the work quickly - and in a flat social web, where all our experience and capability is fully visible, they know who that person is. They think: 'Why do I need this pyramid scam that was invented 150 years ago?'\" </p><p> Axiom was the brainchild of Mark Harris, who, in the late 1990s, had the same revelatory moment as Ho. After a particularly busy January, he realized he'd almost billed out his annual salary, and so the rest of the year he'd be working to cover Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell's overhead and the partners' draws. </p><p> Harris set up a meeting with a tech entrepreneur he knew, Alec Guettel. \"It's an embarrassing clich\u00e9,\" Guettel says, \"but Mark sketched it all out - what became Axiom - on a napkin.\" </p><p> They would hire lawyers who had graduated from the best schools and trained at elite firms, and then get them to work out of client offices for the duration of a project - for as long as the businesses retaining them wanted. The client wouldn't have to bear the expense of a new staffer, but could bulk up when necessary. And the \"embedded\" lawyer would see how the world looked from the client's point of view, and therefore serve up more tailored advice.</p><p> For voluminous, repetitive work, meanwhile, Axiom would retain outside organizations adept at delivering speedily, and at a fraction of the cost that a law firm would generally bill by the hour to have young associates do the work. The new firm would, for instance, send corporate due diligence and document review to groups of lawyers working in India and routine contract drafting to a high-volume shop in Houston. </p><p> But why would a top lawyer want to give up all the perks and parent-impressing prestige of Big Law for what skeptics have called a glorified temp agency? \"It's not for everyone, but we give attorneys more flexibility in their careers,\" Guettel says. \"We knew a lot of incredibly talented, incredibly unhappy attorneys working incredibly hard. For them, partnership is not the brass ring that it once was. And...we saw a lot of clients who felt it wasn't an efficient system and getting top-tier legal advice was too expensive.\"</p><p> Founded in 2000, Axiom limped through its first few years, but soon enough, big tech, seeing a firm speaking its language, came calling; it was followed by other, more traditional businesses - Google, Yahoo and Cisco were joined by Thomson Reuters, Avon and Citigroup. Today even the most complacent senior lawyers at major firms are taking notice of the numbers Axiom is racking up: annual revenues that have grown to a reported $150 million (U.S.), 1,000 employees and 12 modestly appointed offices in America and the U.K. </p><p> As yet, Axiom's Canadian equivalent doesn't pose a substantial threat to the top firms on Bay Street. But, unlike them, it's growing. As at Axiom, Cognition places lawyers at client businesses - and the firm has grown to 32 roving lawyers, almost all, like the founders, ex-\"downtowners.\" The clients are growing from small or mid-size concerns to the likes of Volkswagen Canada, Torstar Corp. and the operator of the Rexall drugstore chain. </p><p> Cognition is about to hire another six attorneys and anticipates taking on another half-dozen by the end of the year. Ho and Milstone haven't needed to work too hard to find qualified candidates - with minimal advertising, they had 260 applications come their way last year. </p><p> Milstone plans to open a small Calgary office, and perhaps then expand to Vancouver and Montreal. Though he and Ho won't disclose the hard figures, they say Cognition's revenues have grown in the past five years at a compound annual rate of more than 25%, placing the firm on Profit magazine's list of Canada's fastest-growing companies. </p><p> Kevin West is not the sort of lawyer who would likely ever have gone the boutique route in generations past. After graduating from Dalhousie, he clerked at the Supreme Court, landed plum jobs at the New York and Sydney offices of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, and then became a partner at what is arguably Toronto's pre-eminent business firm, Davies Ward Phillips &amp; Vineberg. In 2010, he left downtown for a basic office at Yonge and St. Clair, calling his new start-up SkyLaw.</p><p> His approach is to cherry-pick top lawyers from different firms to consult on various aspects of a deal. \"I want the right person to answer a tax problem - not just whoever is in the firm I've retained's tax department. The idea is that through my network, I'll be able to find out who that [right person] is.\" </p><p> West's first partner at SkyLaw didn't stay long, perferring to work at a Big Law firm in London. The parting was amicable, West says. The new, entrepreneurial approach to the the business isn't the right one for every talented young lawyer. For now, West has on board an   experienced law clerk, an articling student, and a former senior counsel at a Bay Street firm, who decided not to retire after leaving downtown but to keep doing work for some key clients, using SkyLaw as a base of operations. On the day we meet, West is delighted to have just cut cheques for some serious bonuses for his small staff. </p><p> The founder of another new-school firm, Peter Carayiannis, is a former corporate associate at what is now the nation's second-largest firm, the 700-lawyers-plus Gowling Lafleur Henderson. Founded in 2012, his firm, Conduit Law, fits into a single room whose one swanky touch, apart from the exposed brick, is a cabinet housing state-of-the-art IT equipment. The desks, except for Carayiannis's, are devoid of personal effects, since his 12 lawyers work there only occasionally - \"hotelling\" at any desk that's available on a given day. </p><p> Carayiannis rejects law's long-time cornerstone: the billable hour. \"We bill based on the value the client receives - the amount of work it takes to get there is relevant, but we want to take less time, often using tech, outsourcing, or by matching a lawyer with relevant skills to the problem at hand.\" </p><p> When we speak, Carayiannis has just returned from a gathering of the New Law tribe in Manhattan, called ReInvent Law NYC. The packed one-day conference heard a keynote address from the movement's leading thinker, British academic Richard Susskind.</p><p> Susskind's essential message, contained in books such as The End of Lawyers?, is that project-management principles, of the Six Sigma variety, ought to be injected into the legal sphere. Firms should break projects into parts, then match the work with whoever can do it most efficiently - whether they be lawyers or not, in-house or not. </p><p> Compared with the U.S., the Canadian legal outsourcing industry is still in a rudimentary state, but not as rudimentary as when Shelby Austin left Davies to start ATD Legal Services in 2010. \"I was just a dutiful young female partner - I always did everything by the book,\" she says. \"But then I went home over the December holidays one year, thought about it, came back in January and...quit.\" Her company contracts about 200 attorneys to review and organize documents in big litigation files, and to conduct due diligence. Many of these freelancers are young; Austin is benefitting from the tough job market for freshly minted lawyers. </p><p> Not that she had it easy herself starting out. \"To land work, I met with anyone and everyone early on - the firm's janitor, someone's cousin's sister,\" Austin jokes. She is cagey about her private company's revenues, but will say they were between $2 and $5 million in 2012, and have grown \"significantly\" since then. In January, ATD was acquired by Deloitte - \"my posh buyer\" she calls the professional-services giant. </p><p> Rob Centa, one of Toronto's top young litigators, working out of the boutique firm Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein, has made extensive use of Austin's services. \"It's great to have someone, a trained lawyer, at a relatively low cost, going through the reams and reams of documents - sorting out relevant documents from the e-mails that just say, 'Are you going home for Mother's Day this weekend?'\" Centa says. \"We want our junior lawyers to have the experience of doing that, at least once, so they know what it's like and can manage that process appropriately. But it's not always a good use of their time, and our clients don't want to pay their rates for that. It's good that Shelby's here [in Canada], because you can meet with the reviewing lawyer and have this comfort - you can spot-check 100 documents in the less-relevant pile, make sure nothing was missed.\" </p><p> Austin herself is \"bullish on the India story. Maybe local lawyers aren't ready for that yet, but I can see a time when they might be.\" </p><p> When that time comes, it will likely be in-house counsel that makes the call. Indeed, one of the shifts under way in corporate law is a movement in power from outside counsel to inside.</p><p> When David Allgood left Osler to join RBC in 1998, it wasn't common for someone who'd achieved the brass ring of partnership, as he had, to go in-house. \"It used to be like they said of teaching, those who could, did. ...Those who could succeed downtown did and stayed down there,\" he says. But after he made the switch, \"soon all the banks had taken on former partners.\"</p><p> The prestige and size of the in-house bar have both grown, according to observers, and RBC's 240-lawyer complement is larger than most Canadian firms. Allgood, who is the bank's general counsel, and Emily Jelich, who is associate general counsel, have striven to make the department efficient, applying Six Sigma-style principles to work that ranges from regulatory compliance to drafting standard financial instruments to real estate. </p><p> With the help of consultants, they dutifully analyzed their work, broke it into chunks and figured out who could best do it; they looked at the risks in their practice and what was a manageable level for each activity.</p><p> Employees now train in the project-management system, receiving recognition in the form of martial-arts-style belts. \"We've found savings of more than $7 million, and $20 million in avoided costs,\" Jelich says. As in so many legal departments, they have been, and remain, under considerable pressure to reduce their own budgets and the amount they spend on outside counsel. (Corporate counsel have, post-downturn, become increasingly proactive - even activist - about how, and for how much, their external counsel will work.) </p><p> Having been through their own up- with-efficiency processes, Allgood and Jelich have looked to the firms they do business with to follow their lead. They want more certainty in their bills; they're not, as a rule, happy with just the billable-hour system. \"We're waiting for a firm to mine its own data and price to us on a value basis - it's very early days on that,\" Jelich says. \"Lawyers provide a service; they aren't special.\" </p><p> At Hudson's Bay Co., general counsel Pickwoad is also pushing his outside counsel to give him more certainty in billing. In an increasingly common practice, he drafts detailed requests for proposals, getting outside lawyers to indicate how they'd handle a job and what it might cost. Having worked outside law - at Deloitte, and at a steel company when he was young - he, like Jelich, doesn't buy into a model that treats lawyers as exceptional cases. \"For many years, in a way, the onus has been on the client to manage the lawyers, to manage the cost. In my view, that should be something they should increasingly do themselves.\" </p><p> It's not as if Big Law has been twiddling its thumbs while all this change - economic, cultural, technological - swirls around it. The most obvious attempt at 21st-century renewal is a series of cross-border mergers. Most striking among them is Norton Rose Fulbright, formed when the old Montreal firm OgilvyRenault threw in its lot with an even older City of London firm, and others, to create a 3,800-lawyer international practice. </p><p> Meanwhile Carayiannis's former firm, Gowling, recently hired (from McCarthy T\u00e9trault) a legal project management specialist to help recalibrate its practice. A partner in the firm's Hamilton office, Mark Tamminga, has developed a computer-aided system to process work relating to mortgages, allowing Gowling to get a huge volume of work done efficiently. And the firm where my father was a partner, Borden Ladner Gervais, has adopted something they call Adroit, seemingly inspired (again) by the Six Sigma system. </p><p> Osler recently employed a computer program developed in part by a young Canadian lawyer to aid in due diligence on a $900-million (U.S.) deal that closed in January - Chemtrade Logistics's acquisition of General Chemical Holding Co. Built over three years, Noah Waisberg's DiligenceEngine searches contracts for relevant clauses and puts its findings into summary charts. The tool is used (after training) by lawyers. It's not outsourcing per se, but it can dramatically reduce the time an associate spends on due diligence. </p><p> At Osler, partner Terry Burgoyne and chief knowledge officer Mara Nickerson talk animatedly about disaggregation (the buzzword for dividing up a big project), about budgeting, about scope-setting meetings with clients, about the sophisticated software they've found to track progress on each file and about how they're using the data to manage the next similar one more efficiently.</p><p> They talk too about the process of persuading sometimes technophobic lawyers to change tack. There is an energy and enthusiasm in the room - which makes me think back to a comment by Shelby Austin. </p><p> Although she admires Axiom's founders, I was surprised to find she's not a disciple of Susskind's. \"As far as the big firms are concerned, Susskind's got it wrong,\" Austin said. \"They have some of the smartest people in the country working in them. I know - I was there, inside. It's crazy for anyone to count them out, to think they aren't going to be among those able to adjust to whatever changes there are in the marketplace.\" </p><p> ****** </p><p> THE LIFE OF BIG LAW </p><p> A slow start, a rush to bulk up - and then mishaps and splintering </p><p> 1856-1862  D'Alton McCarthy, Britton Bath Osler and Edward Blake begin practising law in Upper Canada, incubating firms that would become large and prestigious in the Toronto market. McCarthy went on to serve as an influential (if intolerant) MP, Osler to prosecute Louis Riel and Blake to serve as Ontario's premier. </p><p> 1981  The firm McCarthys seeks to open a Calgary office, over the Alberta Law Society's objections to the Upper Canadian interloper.</p><p> 1989  The Supreme Court allows McCarthys to set up shop in Alberta - and a high-stakes game of musical chairs results. Most major Toronto, Calgary, Montreal and Vancouver firms merge their way into national powerhouses with ever-morphing names. </p><p> 1992 Five barristers exit McCarthys, led by Alan Lenczner, to set up an elite commercial litigation boutique. </p><p> 1996  Toronto firm Holden Day Wilson (55 lawyers) closes a couple of years after a senior associate bursts through the TD Centre conference-room glass and falls 24 storeys to his death. </p><p> 1998  Osler Hoskin Harcourt partner David Allgood goes in-house at RBC. It was then rare for a downtown-firm partner to go client-side, but it soon becomes common as the prestige of the in-house bar grows.</p><p> 2000  Tory Tory DesLauriers &amp; Binnington, a Toronto partnership founded in 1941, becomes the first major Canadian firm to merge with an American one: New York's Haythe &amp; Curley, forming the 300-lawyer Tory Haythe. (After accusations of sexual harassment surface against Tom Haythe, the firm rebranded as Torys.) </p><p> 2000  Former New York firm associate Mark Harris and serial tech entrepreneur Alec Guettel found Axiom, a legal services organization predicated on low overhead, project-to-project lawyers and no partners. </p><p> 2005  Rubsun Ho (ex of Stikeman Elliott) and Joe Milstone (ex of Osler) found Cognition, an early Canadian exponent of the Axiom approach. </p><p> 2007  Goodman and Carr (140 lawyers at its peak) closes, after bleeding partners and the failure of merger talks with global behemoth Baker &amp; McKenzie. </p><p> 2009  Osler invites Richard Susskind, the savage English critic of Big Law, to address its partners. </p><p> 2010  Partner Shelby Austin leaves premier Toronto firm Davies Ward Phillips &amp; Vineberg to found ATD Legal Services, which employs specialist lawyers to do document review; Deloitte later purchases her company. </p><p> 2011  OgilvyRenault, a firm with roots in 19th-century Montreal, merges with a storied City of London firm (founded in 1794) to become part of what is now the 3,800-lawyer, 54-office Norton Rose Fulbright. </p><p> 2013  Canadian firm Fraser Milner Casgrain merges with second-tier English and American firms to form colossus Dentons (2,600 lawyers). Meanwhile, the pre-Confederation firms soldier on as some of the country's oldest businesses: McCarthy T\u00e9trault (560 lawyers), Blake Cassels &amp; Graydon (555) and Osler Hoskin  &amp; Harcourt (403). </p><p> 2014  Canada's seventh-largest firm, Heenan Blaikie (about 500 lawyers), suddenly collapses - and then the world's biggest firm, DLA Piper (4,200 lawyers), exits talks to found a Canadian office with some of Heenan's former lawyers. A suddenly displaced lawyer remarks to The Globe and Mail: \"The freight train that is headed towards Big Law slammed into our firm.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20140328LAWFIRM363738394041</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BVC-YG21-JCRP-C0N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Scott suggests breaking up Facebook by spinning off their recent acquisitions, Instagram and Whatsapp. Facebook has 3.5 billion total users. Facebook without Whatsapp and Instagram would have about 2.7 billion users. Whatsapp has 2 billion users. Instagram has 855 million users.The combined value of Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram will likely end up being higher after they are broken up. They will be able to compete and this might curb some of the monopoly abuses of Facebook. He suggests splitting Google up into Search, Youtube and Cloud. He suggests splitting Amazon up into Retail, AWS (Cloud) and Fulfillment. AWS alone was worth about $500 billion in 2019 and is worth $800 billion to $1 trillion now. Apple just needs to be regulated. Apple's power is its brand. The App store needs be regulated.

Scott suggests breaking up Facebook by spinning off their recent acquisitions, Instagram and Whatsapp.    Facebook has 3.5 billion total users. Facebook without Whatsapp and Instagram would have about 2.7 billion users.  Whatsapp has 2 billion users.  Instagram has 855 million users.      The combined value of Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram will likely end up being higher after they are broken up. They will be able to compete and this might curb some of the monopoly abuses of Facebook.    He suggests splitting Google up into Search, Youtube and Cloud.    He suggests splitting Amazon up into Retail, AWS (Cloud) and Fulfillment.    AWS alone was worth about $500 billion in 2019 and is worth $800 billion to $1 trillion now.    Apple just needs to be regulated. Apple\u2019s power is its brand. The App store needs be regulated.

Jamie talked about Silicon Valley eating the bankers' lunch[1]and Francisco forecast less than 50 banks surviving[2]. Now the rallying call has been picked up by many other bank CEOs from John Cryan, former boss of Deutsche Bank, to Antonio Horta-Osario at Lloyds. In the very latest discussion Dave McKay, CEO of Royal Bank of Canada(RBC), made some interesting commentary around how banks need to reincarnate and rebuild their business models and turn into platforms, rather than just focusing upon banking. </p><p>The idea is that the bank will expand its services way beyond finance into accountancy, home moves, starting up a business and more. According to the Financial Times:[3] RBC aims to offer more end-to-end services \u2014 or 'ecosystems' \u2014 covering wider customer needs than only financial, such as when they want to start their own business, sell their house, or find a new car. For instance, the bank is offering a service for entrepreneurs to register their start-up company with the government, provide it with cloud-based accounting software, supply a branding service and send it letterheads and business cards, all before it has lent the company a cent. For people looking to buy or sell a home, it offers to research neighbourhoods, move furniture, remove garbage, paint a house and even decide which bins to take out each week. Many of these services are supplied by partners integrated into RBC's digital platform. He also makes a key point as to why the bank has to do this, which is that banks have historically been the place the would learn when people were starting a business, buying a home or expecting a birth. This is because they would walk into the bank and ask for advice. Now, they don't do that anymore and the first place to get to know about these life events is Google or Facebook. As a result, there players are far better positioned to service those needs than the banks, who are still reliant on old ways of communicating. This is why banks need to create better life event ecosystems. Now this is something I've heard talked about for over two decades: servicing customer journeys during life events, rather than focusing upon transactional moments; but it's the first time I've heard a bank CEO talking about creating a financial ecosystem around those life events. It makes sense. In fact, in another Financial Times article this week[4], Francisco Gonzalez has been writing again about the tech change in banking. Big tech's threat to banking is no longer a headline. It is close to consensus. China is the clearest example: Tencent and Ant Financial absorbing huge parts of the payments market, and a new league of competition is in the making  Some banks that have invested in platforms and digital services will be able to build their own ecosystems, starting from financial services and expanding into other areas. With customer consent, banks have access to valuable data that can be used to help clients make better, more informed decisions about their finances. This, in turn, will encourage them to take on other services from the bank or a partner. This natural evolution into a marketplace transforms a bank's role into that of a trusted adviser. But it only works if we create tailored offerings with the best suitable products and services wherever they are available. This is what we call the circle of trust argument: if customers are willing to confide their data in us, we can use it to suggest money saving alternative investments. The exchange builds trust, leading to more data-sharing, better recommendations and data-driven sales of products and services  This is a paradigm shift for banking \u2014 but, at the same time, it is also the evolution of something we have been doing for many years. It is about finding a new way to support customers to increase their assets \u2014 to make their money, and now their data, work harder for them. So much resonates with my recent writing about big tech giants getting regulated, banks becoming data vaults and curators of marketplaces of apps, APIs and analytics. However, the new addition to this is the serious consideration of how to build that ecosystem focused upon end-to-end services for customers' life events:Moving in together Buying our first home Having a child Starting a new job or new business Being in an accident Losing your job Dealing with illness Being a carer Dealing with separating Retiring Dealing with a death and so on. My favourite is one I blogged about recently[5] iswhere a bank had been mapping financial moments - getting married, buying a house, having a baby, crashing your car, etc - and had started to reimagine the whole customer experience in those moments using APIs. A good example was the car crash. Today, you'd call your insurer (if you could remember who they were and what their number was), maybe the police (if your phone had enough juice) and probably your nearest and dearest. But what if the car could tell the network what had happened? What if it could tell the tow truck to come, inform the insurer automatically, order you a taxi (or ambulance if needed) and arrange for a replacement vehicle to be delivered to your home that evening? This is the future of finance: wrapping a financial cushion around the customers' life to be relevant to them in these times of higher stress and higher value. It's a whole new world.

Chipmakers Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc, mobile research firm InterDigital Wireless Inc and South Korean carrier LG Uplus have restricted employees from informal conversations with Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, the sources said. </p><p>Such discussions are a routine part of international meetings where engineers gather to set technical standards for communications technologies, including the next generation of mobile networks known as 5G. The U.S. Department of Commerce has not banned contact between companies and Huawei. On May 16, the agency put Huawei on a blacklist, barring it from doing business with U.S. companies without government approval, then a few days later it authorized U.S. companies to interact with Huawei in standards bodies through August 'as necessary for the development of 5G standards.' The Commerce Department reiterated that position on Friday in response to a question from Reuters. Nevertheless, at least a handful of major U.S. and overseas tech companies are telling their employees to limit some forms of direct interaction, the people said, as they seek to avoid any potential issues with the U.S. government. Intel and Qualcomm said they have provided compliance instructions to employees, but declined to comment on them further. A spokesman for InterDigital said it has provided guidance to engineers to ensure the company is in compliance with U.S. regulations. An official with LG Uplus said the company is 'voluntarily refraining from interacting with Huawei workers, other than meeting for network equipment installation or maintenance issues.' Huawei did not provide comment.5G SLOWDOWNThe new restrictions could slow the rollout of 5G, which is expected to power everything from high-speed video transmissions to self-driving cars, according to several industry experts. At a 5G standards meeting last week in Newport Beach, California, participants privately expressed alarm to Reuters that the long-standing cooperation among engineers that is needed for phones and networks to connect globally could fall victim to what one participant described as a 'tech war' between the U.S. and China. A representative of a European company that has instituted rules against interaction with Huawei described people involved in 5G development as 'shaken.' 'This could push everyone to their own corners, and we need cooperation to get to 5G. It should be a global market,' the person said. To be sure, several workers at smaller telecoms firms said they had not been told to avoid discussions with Huawei at standards meetings, and many vendors continue to support existing deals with Huawei. It is unclear how much further communications with Huawei have been curtailed in the tech industry, if at all. 'There's been a lot of misunderstanding from what I'm seeing and hearing from clients and colleagues, as far as what the (Commerce Department) restrictions actually entail,' said Doug Jacobson, a Washington-based export controls lawyer. He said that companies prohibiting their employees contacting Huawei was 'excessive, because the restrictions don't preclude communication, only the transfer of technology.' Huawei, whose equipment the U.S. has alleged could be used by China to spy, has emerged as a central figure in the trade war between the world's two largest economies. Huawei has repeatedly denied it is controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services. China, U.S, and European companies have split before on standards for Wi-Fi, cell networks and other technologies, and the tit-for-tat over tariffs between Beijing and Washington has increased fears of another bifurcation. Huawei is a top player at various global organizations that set technical specifications. As one of the world's biggest manufacturers of devices like smartphones, and the vital parts of networks such as routers and switches, Huawei will need to be at the standards-setting table to ensure a seamless customer experience when 5G networks become prevalent, engineers and experts said. NO MORE INFORMAL CHATSEngineers and system architects representing their employers at meetings of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), a global consortium of industry associations that aims to set 5G specifications by March 2020, often take formal, general discussions into smaller, less documented sessions as they try to find agreement with rivals. But at 3GPP's meeting last week in California, one of the group's three chairmen, Balazs Bertenyi of Nokia, told attendees that more of those so-called 'offline' conversations than usual would be documented by the standards body with notes and other publicly available records. It was the 'practical implication' of the new U.S. Commerce Department rules given industry-wide caution despite the exemption for 5G talks, he said. Companies want to limit informal exchanges, in which their engineers feel more comfortable discussing proprietary technology with rivals to persuade them why their research or innovations are more sound, the sources said. A separate standards body, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), put restrictions on Huawei engineers' ability to participate in peer reviews for its publications, drawing criticism from some in China's industry and elsewhere. The organization, which declined to comment beyond generic statements on its website, then backtracked days later after saying it had received the all-clear from the U.S. Commerce Department with respect to the peer review issue. It did not respond to requests for comment on this story. 'Huawei isn't just some company. They, by many accounts, are the leader in 5G technology. Excluding them is very hard to work around, so it does stand to disrupt the entire project,' said Jorge Contreras, a law professor at the University of Utah and an IEEE member. 'If the idea is to create a non-Chinese 5G, I'm not sure that's possible. Even if it is, would it be as good?' </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-EURP134582156015214461125176900167</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURP-134582</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9J-YK71-JCMN-Y392-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1096\"/><timeReceived>7:35 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>EU Reporter</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 10, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0001QUW</classCode><className>QUALCOMM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000CFJS</classCode><className>HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

As perception has shifted, the public outcry for social media regulation has increasingly grown.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Surprisingly, conservatives have been among the loudest in that chorus. </p><p>Many Republicans claim conservative content is being targeted and silenced by big tech companies. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has championed this line of attack, recently holding a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing called \u201cStifling Free Speech: Technological Censorship and the Public Discourse.\u201d Under his legally incorrect interpretation, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act requires platforms to be \u201cneutral\u201d to enjoy the protection from liability. </p><p>Maybe Cruz skipped or slept through that class when he was at Harvard Law, but there is no requirement for content on a platform to be neutral to trigger the First Amendment protections. If conservatives believe that a private actor should be neutral to be protected by the First Amendment, they are definitely on the wrong side of the Masterpiece Cakeshop case. </p><p>That Supreme Court case dealt with the question of whether a baker can decline to bake a cake for a gay wedding because of the baker's personal religious beliefs. In practice, the implication of Cruz\u2019s idea, that platforms must be neutral to enjoy First Amendment protection, would make websites tailored for specific populations cease to exist. Projects such as creating a version of Facebook for conservatives (this proposal was backed by Donald Trump, Jr.) would be illegal. Since Cruz wants every platform to be neutral, an American won\u2019t be able to have a website to discuss issues that matter to them (abortion, gun control) without people who oppose their views participating.</p><p>Requiring \u201cneutrality\u201d by platforms is, in effect, a rejiggered version of the long-dead \u201cFairness Doctrine,\u201d but for the internet. That policy required broadcasters to present controversial issues in a balanced way, giving equal time to both sides. Generations of conservatives opposed this policy and, after it passed a Democrat-controlled Congress, President Ronald Reagan vetoed it.</p><p>To ensure that the internet exists as a space in which speech can thrive, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was written to protect platforms from liability for the content of third parties. Today, it serves as the cornerstone of free speech online. </p><p>Contemporary attempts by the government to force platforms into creating a \u201cneutral public forum\u201d present a threat to the internet as it is known today for three reasons:</p><p>First, in response to the vague standards associated with content neutrality likely to follow from the Cruz approach, platforms will be incentivized to over-censor to avoid liability. In the process, conservatives crying of censorship now will be shocked by the restraints of such a brave new world. </p><p>Second, smaller businesses will not have the resources to comply and respond to the avalanche of litigation associated with such a requirement. Ironically, for politicians worried about \u201cbias\u201d from widely used platforms; making them liable would only strengthen their dominance. Lawyer squads and resources available to the Facebooks and Googles of the world will handle any litigation going their way, but smaller websites that facilitate discussion and are trying to break into the industry won\u2019t stand a chance. </p><p>Third, countries that are in the process of building democratic institutions, or those that have autocratic regimes, will be emboldened to suppress opposing views online, following the U.S. lead under the auspices of \u201cneutrality.\u201d This phenomenon will be particularly problematic in nations where democratic institutions aren\u2019t strong enough to resist the allure of authoritarianism.</p><p>Arguing about the employee make-up of tech companies who wield tremendous power is fair game. Demanding more transparency, so the public knows how content moderation decisions are made, won\u2019t harm free speech. </p><p>In contrast, trying to play referee on the internet would entirely harm free speech.</p><p>Ashkhen Kazaryan (@Ashkhen) is director of civil liberties at TechFreedom. </p><p>Photo Caption:Sen.

The policy patterns and battles over ridesharing will inevitably be felt in other sectors of the economy. As the gig economy becomes more widespread, conservatives will have to be ready to adapt to the trends of 21st century to achieve conservative goals, and look into at a variety of tools to make the market work for American families. One of these oft-ignored tools is organized labor and unionization. </p><p>When it comes to ridesharing, unions make be the answer to maximize market outcomes and bring Big Tech to heel. This will not only be good for workers but for conservatives. Recently several states and cities have all taken aim at rideshare giants like Uber and Lyft. In March, the National Labor Relations Board decided[1] that rideshare drivers are not employees, but rather are independent contractors. Cities and states, like New York, Seattle and California, are looking at a variety of options from sector-specific minimum wage and driver caps to unionization as a means of addressing chronically poor pay[2] and working conditions due to the sector's innate instability. California recently defined rideshare drivers as employees.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) While some drivers are pushing for union organization, unions have also allegedly been meeting [3]with Uber and Lyft in their efforts to exempt their workers from being defined as employees. Some[4] argue that blanket unionization could negatively affect rideshare drivers who use the app solely for part-time cash. Others argue that unionization could decrease [5]labor flexibility. Since many of these laws, like California's AB-5, defining independent contractors as full-time employees, have yet to take effect[6], time will tell as to the full outcome. Given how past work stoppages and protests resulted in immediate promises of raises[7], the idea that increased regulation and organization really will negatively affect the market as warned remains unproven. In Europe last year, Uber promised thousands of drivers healthcare coverage[8], which has yet to result in a collapse in the company's European profits. Moreover, blanket unionization doesn't have to be the answer. Across the country, cities are creating structures for local drivers to organize[9] and negotiate with Uber and Lyft themselves. Local solutions and negotiations can provide the civic laboratory to make sure both labor and management can walk away happy. Some conservatives see this dispute and immediately side with Uber and Lyft. One case in point was a tweet[10] from Representative Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), proudly labeling the GOP as the 'party of Uber.' Libertarian leaning conservatives see disputes like this and see an intrusive state impeding the freedom of a voluntarily organization corporation. They see unions as merely tools of the left. They ask, Why help unions which simply jam up the free market and help out Democrats? However, this picture is neither accurate (40% of union members vote Republican[11]) nor all that conservative.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Sponsored Content  First, the market dispute between unions and management is hardly one of statists against plucky free marketeers. The decision of who can and cannot organize in the market is not a market decision but rather the state's. The market didn't rule that Uber drivers can't collectively organize, the federal government did. The market didn't rule that corporate entities can organize as market actors, our corporate legal code does. In many cases, unionization allows working individuals to choose to access the market as an entity in the same spirit that the law recognizes incorporation. If Uber drivers wish to use private organization to pressure Uber management to change practices and pay, who is the state to restrict them? Second, unions do not have to play a negative role in a conservative understanding of the common good but instead can be constructive market forces. Not only have private sector unions historically been critical[12] in creating favorable pay and working conditions, but sustained a sense of identity, stability and dignity usually lacking in today's outsourced and faceless corporate environment. Unions can play a critical and conservative role in creating in the economy of the 21st century. James Poulos, author of The Art of Being Free, put it best when he noted[13], 'Unions exist because, without them, the path is opened wide to crony collaboration between big government and big business. That's the fundamental insight behind a conservative case for unions. Without the balancing effect of organized labor, corporations can easily threaten political liberty by creating an economic system in which millions of citizens are effectively locked into servile, dependent labor relations.' Third, conservatives need to recognize the economic realities on the ground. The majority of Americans report a lack of satisfaction[14] in their job. The Republican Party can decide if it wants to be the 'Party of Uber[15],' an economy of holding down several part-time gigs and 'flexibility,' or the party where, as Oren Cass put it, 'workers can support strong families[16] and communities.' Lastly, we need to realize that Big Tech and the gig economy are not our friends and not uniquely positive trends[17] to be embraced. Voices on the right and left are recognizing the potentially distorting role[18] Big Tech can play in the market. It's not much use to rightly raise the alarm about Big Brother only to succumb to other, equally powerful and unfriendly[19] corporations. What labor policy can and should look like in the gig economy will continue to develop in the upcoming years. It is apparent that the truly conservative policy is not to back management over labor and Big Tech over workers, but to develop new ways[20] forward. Empowering individual Americans in the market by allowing them to voluntarily organize[21] will be a necessary tool to renewing the American Dream. Joseph S.

The policy patterns and battles over ridesharing will inevitably be felt in other sectors of the economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the gig economy becomes more widespread, conservatives will have to be ready to adapt to\u00a0 the trends of 21st century to achieve conservative goals, and look into at a variety of tools to make the market work for American families. One of these oft-ignored tools is organized labor and unionization. When it comes to ridesharing, unions make be the answer to maximize market outcomes and bring Big Tech to heel. This will not only be good for workers but for conservatives. <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/14/california-gig-economy-debate-gavin-newsom-uber/\">(RELATED: Fixing The Gig Economy Doesn't Require Turning All Uber Drivers Into Employees)</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recently several states and cities have all taken aim at rideshare giants like Uber and Lyft. In March, the National Labor Relations Board <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/05/15/723768986/uber-drivers-are-not-employees-national-relations-board-rules-drivers-saw-it-com\">decided</url> that rideshare drivers are not employees, but rather are independent contractors. Cities and states, like New York, Seattle and California, are looking at a variety of options from sector-specific minimum wage and driver caps to unionization as a means of addressing       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/22/uber-lyft-ipo-drivers-unionize-low-pay-expenses\">chronically poor pay</url> and working conditions due to the sector's innate instability. California recently defined rideshare drivers as employees.</p><p>While some drivers are pushing for union organization, unions have also allegedly been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/7/1/20677095/uber-lyft-labor-unions-ab5-california\">meeting </url>with Uber and Lyft in their efforts to exempt their workers from being defined as employees.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170572843.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Rideshare drivers hold signs during a protest outside of Uber headquarters on August 27, 2019 in San Francisco. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaredmeyer/2015/12/14/uber-union-vote-seattle-millennials/#3d35c8696602\">Some</url> argue that blanket unionization could negatively affect rideshare drivers who use the app solely for part-time cash. Others argue that unionization could       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thinkmarkets.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/rigidity-and-flexibility-unions-in-the-on-demand-economy/\">decrease </url>labor flexibility. Since many of these laws, like California's AB-5, defining independent contractors as full-time employees,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/4/20898940/uber-lyft-drivers-ab5-law-california-minimum-wage-benefits-gig-economy-disrupted\">have yet to take effect</url>, time will tell as to the full outcome. Given how past work stoppages and protests resulted in immediate promises of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3037371/the-teamsters-of-the-21st-century-how-uber-lyft-and-facebook-drivers-are-organizing\">raises</url>, the idea that increased regulation and organization really will negatively affect the market as warned remains unproven. In Europe last year, Uber promised thousands of drivers       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-to-offer-limited-health-insurance-to-european-drivers-1527082557\">healthcare coverage</url>, which has yet to result in a collapse in the company's European profits.</p><p>Moreover, blanket unionization doesn't have to be the answer. Across the country, cities are creating structures for local drivers to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/a-new-law-is-letting-uber-drivers-unionize/\">organize</url> and negotiate with Uber and Lyft themselves. Local solutions and negotiations can provide the civic laboratory to make sure both labor and management can walk away happy.</p><p>Some conservatives see this dispute and immediately side with Uber and Lyft. One case in point was a <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/dancrenshawtx/status/1195459751024451595?lang=en\">tweet</url> from Representative Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), proudly labeling the GOP as the \u201cparty of Uber.\u201d Libertarian leaning conservatives see disputes like this and see an intrusive state impeding the freedom of a voluntarily organization corporation. They see unions as merely tools of the left. They ask, Why help unions which simply jam up the free market and help out Democrats? However, this picture is neither accurate (40% of union members       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://fortune.com/2018/01/17/employee-rights-act-labor-unions-democratic-party/\">vote Republican</url>) nor all that conservative.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/01/american-renewal-unions-eisenhower-republican-defeat-socialism/\">(RELATED: The Eisenhower Option: A Union-Friendly Republican Party Can Defeat Socialism)</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1170572556.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><p>A San Francisco police officer monitors a protest outside of Uber headquarters on August 27, 2019 in San Francisco (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p><p>First, the market dispute between unions and management is hardly one of statists against plucky free marketeers. The decision of who can and cannot organize in the market is not a market decision but rather the state's. The market didn't rule that Uber drivers can't collectively organize, the federal government did. The market didn't rule that corporate entities can organize as market actors, our corporate legal code does. In many cases, unionization allows working individuals to choose to access the market as an entity in the same spirit that the law recognizes incorporation. If Uber drivers wish to use private organization to pressure Uber management to change practices and pay, who is the state to restrict them?</p><p>Second, unions do not have to play a negative role in a conservative understanding of the common good but instead can be constructive market forces. Not only have private sector unions historically been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/07/the-conservative-case-for-unions/528708/\">critical</url> in creating favorable pay and working conditions, but sustained a sense of identity, stability and dignity usually lacking in today's outsourced and faceless corporate environment.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2018/02/08/the-gig-economy-just-scored-a-big-legal-victory/\">(RELATED: The Gig Economy Just Scored A Big Legal Victory)</url></p><p>Unions can play a critical and conservative role in creating in the economy of the 21st century. James Poulos, author of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Art of Being Free</emphasis>, put it best when he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2016/04/04/republicans-labor-supreme-court-rich-barlow\">noted</url>, \u201cUnions exist because, without them, the path is opened wide to crony collaboration between big government and big business. That's the fundamental insight behind a conservative case for unions. Without the balancing effect of organized labor, corporations can easily threaten political liberty by creating an economic system in which millions of citizens are effectively locked into servile, dependent labor relations.\u201d</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1008535426.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Hector Figueroa, President of 32BJ Service Employees International Union, speaks at a rally in front of City Hall in support of a proposed City Council vote on a 12-month cap of For Hire Vehicles (FHV) in New York City on July 31, 2018 in New York City. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p><p>Third, conservatives need to recognize the economic realities on the ground.

In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission dated May 31, Ellison urged the watchdog agency to take a closer look at Google and its parent company, Alphabet, given that European regulators recently found that the search giant harmed its rivals and fined it $2.7 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The FTC should determine whether Alphabet has engaged in similar conduct in the United States and whether such conduct violates the FTC Act,\" he wrote.</p><p>Ellison's letter arrived about a month after the FTC gained a fresh roster, including new Chairman Joseph Simons, who previously has spoken about the need for the agency to \"devote substantial resources to determining whether its merger enforcement has been too lax.\" Many experts took the statement as a sign that Simons could be tough on corporate consolidation and antitrust.</p><p>Simons has not spoken publicly about Google, and the FTC declined to comment. A Google spokeswoman did not comment on Ellison's letter.</p><p>Going forward, though, Ellison's criticism could presage even tougher scrutiny for Silicon Valley if Democrats emerge victorious in the 2018 midterm elections.</p><p>\"We're seeing breaks in the ranks,\" said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, which has advocated for antitrust scrutiny of major tech companies. \"The Democratic Party is going to end up within the next two to three years doing something about big tech because the rank and file is going to force them.\"</p><p>The probe Ellison seeks would mark Google's second antitrust investigation by the FTC. During its last inquiry, under President Barack Obama, the agency chose not to force Google to make major changes to its business practices or separate into smaller companies.</p><p>That decision didn't satisfy consumer advocates and corporate rivals, including Yelp, who still allege that Google continues to give preference in search results to its services over competitors - one of the arguments that prompted Europe to levy its fine. Citing those charges, Ellison on Thursday urged the FTC to release more information about its earlier probe. He also asked the FTC to detail whether Google had run afoul of a settlement it brokered with the agency in 2011 on another matter - misusing its customers' private information.</p><p>Among <person><nameText>Democrats, Ellison </nameText></person>is not alone in encouraging the FTC to apply more pressure to Google or its peers. On Capitol Hill, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) has previously recommended that the FTC reopen its competition case. He and fellow Democratic Sen. <person><nameText>Edward J. Markey </nameText></person>(Mass.) also wrote the FTC in May to investigate the way Google tracks smartphone users' location data.</p><p>National party leaders, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), more generally have accused tech companies of trying to \"snuff out competition.\" Democrats' \"A Better Deal\" blueprint also stressed that merger reviews should \"consider the ways in which control of consumer data can be used to stifle competition or jeopardize consumer privacy.\"</p><p>If Democrats capture the House or Senate in the midterm elections in November, the spoils of their victories would include control of the gavels on key committees with the power to hold hearings on the tech industry, dig deep into its business practices and grill executives about the extent to which they aid or inhibit competition.</p><p>\"Democrats are committed to restoring competition and aggressively cracking down on market power and economic concentration,\" said Rep. David N. Cicilline (R.I.), the top Democrat serving on the House's antitrust-focused subcommittee.</p><p>Politically, though, lawmakers' new push could also dent some Democrats' efforts to continue raising money from major Silicon Valley sources. Workers, companies and other entities in the computers and electronics industry so far have contributed more than $42 million to Democrats ahead of the 2018 election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That's nearly double the amount that GOP candidates have received, the group's data shows.</p><p>\"I don't care if they don't give me another penny,\" Ellison said in an interview Thursday. \"It's not my job to look out for their profit margin.\"</p><p>Some Republicans similarly have trained their fire on the tech industry. That includes Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, who opened his own probe to determine whether Google is stifling competitors. Hawley is also running for a seat in the U.S. Senate.</p><p>Asked whether Democrats would be tougher on tech if they controlled Congress, Ellison said, \"I hope so, but I'm not limiting my advocacy to just Democrats.\"</p><p>\"These folks are doing good things. I use them. I bought stuff off Amazon, and I get on Google several times a day,\" the congressman said. \"There probably needs to be greater oversight. . . . I don't want them so big they can control the markets.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-c3fcdab6-683d-11e8-9e38-24e693b38637</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SGM-W4R1-JBFW-C17M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 5, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002LOB</classCode><className>DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission dated May 31, Ellison urged the watchdog agency to take a closer look at Google and its parent company, Alphabet, given that European regulators recently found that the search giant harmed its rivals and fined it $2.7 billion.                </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The FTC should determine whether Alphabet has engaged in similar conduct in the United States and whether such conduct violates the FTC Act,\" he wrote.</p><p>Ellison's letter arrived about a month after the FTC gained a fresh roster, including new Chairman Joseph Simons, who previously has spoken about the need for the agency to \"devote substantial resources to determining whether its merger enforcement has been too lax.\" Many experts took the statement as a sign that Simons could be tough on corporate consolidation and antitrust.</p><p>Simons has not spoken publicly about Google, and the FTC declined to comment. A Google spokeswoman did not comment on Ellison's letter.</p><p>Going forward, though, Ellison's criticism could presage even tougher scrutiny for Silicon Valley if Democrats emerge victorious in the 2018 midterm elections.</p><p>\"We're seeing breaks in the ranks,\" said Barry Lynn, the director of the Open Markets Institute, which has advocated for antitrust scrutiny of major tech companies. \"The Democratic Party is going to end up within the next two to three years doing something about big tech because the rank and file is going to force them.\"</p><p>The probe Ellison seeks would mark Google's second antitrust investigation by the FTC. During its last inquiry, under President Barack Obama, the agency chose not to force Google to make major changes to its business practices or separate into smaller companies.</p><p>That decision didn't satisfy consumer advocates and corporate rivals, including Yelp, who still allege that Google continues to give preference in search results to its services over competitors - one of the arguments that prompted Europe to levy its fine. Citing those charges, Ellison on Thursday urged the FTC to release more information about its earlier probe. He also asked the FTC to detail whether Google had run afoul of a settlement it brokered with the agency in 2011 on another matter - misusing its customers' private information.</p><p>Among <person><nameText>Democrats, Ellison </nameText></person>is not alone in encouraging the FTC to apply more pressure to Google or its peers. On Capitol Hill, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) has previously recommended that the FTC reopen its competition case. He and fellow Democratic Sen. <person><nameText>Edward J. Markey </nameText></person>(Mass.) also wrote the FTC in May to investigate the way Google tracks smartphone users' location data.</p><p>National party leaders, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), more generally have accused tech companies of trying to \"snuff out competition.\" Democrats' \"A Better Deal\" blueprint also stressed that merger reviews should \"consider the ways in which control of consumer data can be used to stifle competition or jeopardize consumer privacy.\"</p><p>If Democrats capture the House or Senate in the midterm elections in November, the spoils of their victories would include control of the gavels on key committees with the power to hold hearings on the tech industry, dig deep into its business practices and grill executives about the extent to which they aid or inhibit competition.</p><p>\"Democrats are committed to restoring competition and aggressively cracking down on market power and economic concentration,\" said Rep. David N. Cicilline (R.I.), the top Democrat serving on the House's antitrust-focused subcommittee.</p><p>Politically, though, lawmakers' new push could also dent some Democrats' efforts to continue raising money from major Silicon Valley sources. Workers, companies and other entities in the computers and electronics industry so far have contributed more than $42 million to Democrats ahead of the 2018 election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That's nearly double the amount that GOP candidates have received, the group's data shows.</p><p>\"I don't care if they don't give me another penny,\" Ellison said in an interview Thursday. \"It's not my job to look out for their profit margin.\"</p><p>Some Republicans similarly have trained their fire on the tech industry. That includes Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, who opened his own probe to determine whether Google is stifling competitors. Hawley is also running for a seat in the U.S. Senate.</p><p>Asked whether Democrats would be tougher on tech if they controlled Congress, Ellison said, \"I hope so, but I'm not limiting my advocacy to just Democrats.\"</p><p>\"These folks are doing good things. I use them. I bought stuff off Amazon, and I get on Google several times a day,\" the congressman said. \"There probably needs to be greater oversight. . . . I don't want them so big they can control the markets.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-c3fcdab6683d11e89e3824e693b38637</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SGM-R2P1-DYX1-H1C2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"855\"/><timeReceived>11:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 5, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002LOB</classCode><className>DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

'It's not ideal because it's very messy,' Simons said. 'But if you have to, you have to.' The resignation with which Simons viewed the prospect that the FTC might have to use statutory law to its logical conclusion makes clear that our Second Gilded Age's inability to restrain runaway monopolies is the product of deficient will. </p><p>And we know this not just because of one line in a news report, or the recent history of the FTC effectively taking bribes[2] to halt investigations. Just take a stroll with me through a selection of available FTC internal emails. When journalists or outside groups petition the FTC for Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, the agency helpfully posts the results[3] if the same subject gets requested more than three times in a calendar year. There are frequently requested records\u2014internal emails and documents, mostly\u2014about crowdfunding and football helmets, hotel pricing and online dating, even some personnel information[4] about the most well-known former director of the Office of Policy Planning in agency history, a certain Ted Cruz. But it's the files involving Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple\u2014the four Big Tech firms under scrutiny[5] from the FTC and the Justice Department\u2014that will sap your faith, if you had any left, that the agency will engage in a full investigation of the platforms. The communications depict top staff at the FTC constantly in contact with Big Tech lobbyists, relying on them for information, and generally seeing them as partners rather than companies subject to regulation. That this stuff has just been sitting on the FTC website for years suggests that the agency isn't particularly ashamed of it, either. The key documents involve communications[6] between FTC staff and representatives from Facebook, Google, and Apple between January 1 and March 25, 2015. This was a particularly critical time for Google, because of a separate FOIA report filed by The Wall Street Journal. That March, the FTC inadvertently released a 160-page report of the Bureau of Competition, which recommended that the agency sue Google over the anti-competitive conduct of its search engine. In 2013, the FTC overruled the Bureau of Competition and settled with Google for peanuts. Some of the communications involve this Wall Street Journal report, but the overriding sense one gets on reading them is just how much time Google and its Big Tech brethren spend with FTC staff. In just this three-month period, there are 19 instances of Rob Mahini, a senior policy counsel with Google, setting up meetings, lunches, or other meetups with FTC personnel. 'Have a minute to chat this afternoon?' Mahini asks Aaron Burstein, an FTC adviser, in January 2015. 'It would be great to have coffee to catch up,' Mahini writes to Henry Su in February. 'I'd love to get together for lunch again. What works for you this month?' he asks Shaundra Watson the next day. There's also a fair bit of flattery: little nuggets of information that Mahini passes around to FTC staff, pre-release demos of new site features, a flow of updates that make staff feel like trusted insiders. This constant, low-level communication to work the staffs of the FTC's top staffers and the commissioners themselves is surely common practice among other lobbyists and other agencies, but the relentlessness and aggressiveness in these emails is striking. In some cases, the conversation goes the other way. On January 14, 2015, Neil Chilson, at the time an attorney adviser to Republican commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen, wrote Mahini looking for advice. 'One of the offices here (you can guess which) is convinced that a major weakness of the use-based approach is that it cannot address sensitive inferences,' Chilson wrote. 'You and I know that is exactly backwards, but I am looking for concrete examples to counter (to the Chairwoman's office) that mistaken perception.' To translate this from alien to English, then-Chairwoman Edith Ramirez's staff had expressed concern about Google's creating targets for advertising based on a user's gender, age, height, and weight (the so-called 'sensitive inferences'), and Chilson (who doesn't consider that a problem) wanted Google's lobbyist to give him examples of how this is no big deal. So this is Google working directly with an FTC official, who is giving the company intel about what a (mildly) adversarial commissioner is thinking, and asking for specific examples to rebut it, which Mahini gladly supplies. (After being made acting chief technologist[7] at the FTC, Chilson now works for the Charles Koch Institute[8]. The Kochs have been siding with Big Tech[9] in policy debates.) But the most interesting stuff in the FOIA documents concerns that Wall Street Journal article. On March 18, the day before the story's release, Mahini wrote to top advisers to then-chair Ramirez. 'We have an urgent situation that Kent Walker would like to speak with the Chairwoman about,' Mahini writes, and you can feel the panic. Kent Walker is the chief legal officer at Google. He's quoted in the Wall Street Journal piece[10]. Clearly he wanted to go over the imminent story release. Mahini even offers Walker's personal cellphone for Ramirez to call. A few days later, Johanna Shelton, Google's top lobbyist, wrote an official-sounding email to FTC staff, describing Google as 'deeply troubled by the FTC's lack of an on-the-record clarification about the effect of the Bureau of Competition staff memo.' Shelton pushed the agency to correct what Google saw as erroneous news stories that the FTC's settlement went against the Bureau of Competition's recommendations (which it did). She was also upset that the FTC didn't comment for the record about the story. 'We believe it is critical for the FTC to defend its reputation, showing that it followed a thorough process and fully took into account the Bureau of Competition staff memo, among other internal agency opinions including the Bureau of Economics,' Shelton wrote. Google wanted the FTC to take Google's side and read from Google's talking points about the settlement, which the FTC effectively did, in a formal statement[11] from Ramirez, two days after the Shelton email. 'Contrary to recent press reports, the Commission's decision on the search allegations was in accord with the recommendations of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, Bureau of Economics, and Office of General Counsel.' This mirrors precisely what Shelton wanted the FTC to say. A separate public FOIA document series shows that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was initially named[12] in a draft 2011 consent decree with the FTC over privacy violations. You can see the track changes where Zuckerberg's name and all references to him were crossed out. Zuckerberg came up again in the recent $5 billion settlement with Facebook over violations of that 2011 consent decree; the FTC admitted they took more money from Facebook to keep Zuckerberg from testifying in the case. If Zuckerberg had been named in the 2011 consent decree, such an arrangement would have been nearly impossible. Perhaps Zuckerberg's personal exposure would have kept Facebook on a cleaner path; clearly the company is desperate\u2014and willing to pay a fortune\u2014to protect its founder and CEO. The larger point is that the FTC appears in these documents as practically an adjunct of Big Tech. Staffers are in constant contact with lobbyists, accommodations are made for their interests, and advice is sought from them on how to best protect the industry from scrutiny. If you think this same agency is going to do a 180 and become a strict regulator bringing down the most powerful actors in our economy, you are far more optimistic than I.

The battle tactics practiced by Silicon Valley's lobby groups have been reprehensible, and the strategy of squeezing artists shortsighted. Behind it all, of course, is a powerful force: Google, which aggressively deploys its vast wealth to make sure that creators get a raw deal, and Googlegets a good one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An application for costs before the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in respect of the \"FairPlay Canada\" initiative is a perfect case in point. FairPlay is an attempt by more than 25 Canadian media companies, including Telus, Rogers, Shaw and Bell, to get the CRTC to set up a process to block websites that exist for the purpose of pirating television shows and other video content. But the CRTC declined to help on jurisdictional grounds, determining that it lacked power under the Telecommunications Act, but that FairPlay could pursue other legal avenues.</p><p>Among the groups contributing to the fight for piracy and against FairPlay were Vancouver-based OpenMedia and the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic at the University of Ottawa. Open Media and CIPPIC now seek to collect from FairPlay its costs for fighting FairPlay's request to the CRTC - a grand total of $16,144.50. It's not much, but consider the principle: Open Media says it should get the money for defending the public interest. By protecting pirates? By spreading misinformation about FairPlay? That's rich.</p><p>Ignore the naysayers. The new USMCA deal is great for Canadian innovators( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/ignore-the-naysayers-the-new-usmca-deal-is-great-for-canadian-innovators\">https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/ignore-the-naysayers-the-new-usmca-deal-is-great-for-canadian-innovators</url> )</p><p>Why tech giants like Googlewant to make sure Canadians can keep stealing entertainment( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/why-facebook-and-google-want-to-make-sure-canadians-can-keep-stealing-entertainment\">https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/why-facebook-and-google-want-to-make-sure-canadians-can-keep-stealing-entertainment</url> )</p><p>Take notice copyright infringers: Canadian courts still think intellectual-property laws matter( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/take-notice-copyright-infringers-canadian-courts-still-think-intellectual-property-laws-matter\">https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/take-notice-copyright-infringers-canadian-courts-still-think-intellectual-property-laws-matter</url> )</p><p>CIPPIC meanwhile, portrays itself as a public interest law clinic. Both it and OM receive money from Google. Of course, organizations don't necessarily toe the line of any particular sponsor. But it's curious how often their positions tend to overlap.</p><p>Open Media is the same organization that was behind a dodgy email campaign that recently targeted Canada's NAFTA negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland: Open Media created an online form letter that allowed a single person to spam the minister with a limitless number of emails. The ministry was hit with an avalanche of 22,000 emails from that web form, most of them likely bogus. Naturally they all claimed to be grassroots Canadians worried about losing \"digital rights\" - meaning rules that protect Big Tech corporations.</p><p>Open Media also played a huge role in delaying the recently passed European copyright directive, by using automated email forms and robocalls to deluge EU delegates with misinformation and create a false sense of grassroots opposition. All this to stop an EU directive that may finally help put artist's rights back into the balance.</p><p>American musician David Lowery, who has been fighting for artists' rights, has called out Open Media for underhanded tactics. Lowery, founder of alternative rock bands Camper Van Beethoven and Cracker, wrote( <url normalizedValue=\"https://thetrichordist.com/2018/09/04/canadian-government-funded-group-spamming-canadian-negotiators-on-nafta/\">https://thetrichordist.com/2018/09/04/canadian-government-funded-group-spamming-canadian-negotiators-on-nafta/</url> ): \"this sort of spamming activity by the likes of Open Media seems designed to overwhelm the channels through which ordinary constituents communicate with government officials. It drowns out the voices of ordinary citizens, and replaces them with robotic corporate and special interest crafted messages.\"</p><p>Similar tactics used by Open Media's commercial affiliate, NewMode.net, played a role in the defeat of the Trans-Pacific Partnership IP provisions as well as the stalling of the EU copyright directive. (Shockingly, the Canadian government, through its office of the Privacy Commissioner, has actually provided funding to Open Media.)</p><p>If Google's interests seem to benefit a lot from its financial support for Open Media, it doesn't stop there. The scent of Google's paid influence is finally being picked up in all kinds of important places. In a recent court case in the United States, a judge required intervenors claiming to represent the public interest to disclose whether they had been funded by Google. They had. And the GoogleTransparency Project( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.googletransparencyproject.org\">https://www.googletransparencyproject.org</url>/ ), run by the non-profit Campaign for Accountability, and The Wall Street Journal have publicized the extravagant number of intellectual property law academics funded by Googlein Europe and the Americas. According to the Journal's reporting(       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/paying-professors-inside-googles-academic-influence-campaign-1499785286\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/paying-professors-inside-googles-academic-influence-campaign-1499785286</url> ), for instance, Googlehas provided financing for hundreds of research papers defending it from regulatory incursion or other costs.</p><p>So this is the alarming situation we face now. Google's power and money are being deployed to promote views and sometimes even misinformation that benefit Googlethrough a wide network of academics, lawyers and advocacy groups. Yet Googleis an organization that does nothing so much as broker information. Is it wise or proper to allow any company to purchase its own terms for the integrity with which it treats others' information?</p><p>Google's interests with regard to its \"digital rights\" efforts are most neatly viewed through the activities of its YouTube arm. YouTube is the largest online distributor of music and other content, legitimate and pirated, but notoriously pays a pittance to the artists from whose work it benefits. Meanwhile, YouTube remains open for stream-ripping software that can pirate music directly from the site.</p><p>Googleand other social media companies have grown fat and powerful under shelter provided by unjustly favourable laws. It now uses its power to try to enlarge that shelter rather than meeting the needs of the artists and creators on whose efforts its platform depends. (The latest favour from policy-makers to Big Tech was a provision in the new NAFTA deal that granted internet companies immunity from legal action on user-posted content; how did that get in there?)</p><p>At least now the tide is beginning to turn. Open Media's efforts were defeated in Europe and legislators there said that they were particularly influenced by disgust at the tactics of the technology industry.</p><p>The University of Ottawa's Michael Geist has attacked me for my criticisms of Open Media. He claims, without any basis, that I am a lobbyist for somebody or other. In fact, I am independent and I truly am only interested in representing the public interest.</p><p>Meanwhile, other groups out there are taking Google's money while also claiming to represent the public interest. More and more decision-makers and legislators are starting to realize that it just isn't possible to do both.</p><p>Richard C.

Also fearing impacts of the move: some San Diego health care businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Federal Communications Commission in December voted to eliminate net neutrality rules, which make it illegal for internet service providers (ISPs) to block or slow down content, or create \"fast lanes\" for companies willing to pay extra to speed up content delivery.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Critics say this will hurt the sharing of health records, as well as telemedicine, while backers, including the head of the FCC, say the opposite.</p><p>Vishal Verma is the CEO of NucleusHealth, a San Diego-based company that provides cloud medical image management and teleradiology services to 2,800 facilities across the United States. He assumes the company would have fast lane access to ensure the smooth delivery of records, loosely estimating this could run an additional $10,000 or more monthly, due to serving so many health facilities and having 60 radiologists working remotely.</p><p>\"Are ISPs going to go to health care companies like ours and say, 'you're streaming medical images and that has a premium.' And the question is whether we're going to be approached by every ISP out there,\" Verma said.</p><p>If the company was denied faster service and even slowed down, increased imaging turnaround times could have huge ramifications. Every second is critical for emergency rooms, for instance.</p><p>\"Which would jeopardize our contracts and could result in significant losses, potentially millions if delays were severe,\" Verma said.</p><p>A Worry for Smaller Companies</p><p>The FCC vote could also threaten lowcost telehealth services, putting smaller companies in the field at a disadvantage compared to larger ones, critics of the FCC vote say.</p><p>\"The repeal allows internet service providers to apply tiered pricing and throttle online access for those who would not be able to afford the increased cost of opting into faster internet lanes,\" David Lortscher , CEO and founder of Curology , wrote in an email.</p><p>The San Diego company provides acne treatment prescriptions after an online diagnosis. Curology was formed to quicken diagnosis and delivery, especially in rural areas.</p><p>\"With only 10,000 dermatologists in the US, access to expert care continues to be a problem, especially in rural areas. Prohibitively high internet costs could burden digital health services and further exacerbate the health disparities between high- and low-income as well as urban and rural individuals,\" Lortscher wrote.</p><p>Telehealth demands high levels of bandwidth for voice and data transmission. So, steeper internet costs or throttled speed would mean fewer could access Curology's services. In addition, Lortscher stated concerns over service providers restricting reliable access of patient data stored in the cloud.</p><p>Advocates of net neutrality say the recent FCC vote could give internet providers too much control over content. Opponents say such fears are unwarranted.</p><p>Prioritization a Benefit</p><p>\"We do not block websites, nor censor online content, nor throttle or degrade traffic based on the content, nor unfairly discriminate in our treatment of internet traffic,\" AT&amp;T said in a statement after the FCC vote.</p><p>In remarks on Nov. 30, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the \"light-touch regulatory framework\" would benefit telehealth providers.</p><p>\"One aspect of this proposal I think is worth highlighting here is the flexibility it would give for prioritizing services that could make meaningful differences in the delivery of health care,\" he said. \"By ending the outright ban on paid prioritization, we hope to make it easier for consumers to benefit from services that need prioritization- such as latency-sensitive telemedicine.\"</p><p>The worry is that small telemedicine companies will struggle to afford faster service, making it more difficult for them to compete, said Mark Gaynor , a professor of health management and policy at Saint Louis University in Missouri. He added it could even be tough for some hospitals, which deal in large amounts of data, to absorb increased costs for fast lane access.</p><p>\"Hospitals that are serving underserved populations are not making a lot of money,\" Gaynor said.</p><p>A spokesman for Palomar Health , which serves Escondido, Poway and additional communities, said it's still too early to say what net neutrality will do. Christopher Longhurst, chief information officer with UC San Diego Health , declined to comment.</p><p>Gaynor said the FCC's ruling will cast a long shadow, as telemedicine continues to play a bigger role in health care. He cited a recently released study showing that a telestroke program streamlined care at 21 hospitals operated by Oakland, California-based Kaiser Permanente .</p><p>\"In the next four or five years you're going to see a lot more data going back and forth,\" Gaynor said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDBUSJ-1987348147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDBUSJ2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RDT-K021-JBHT-D0PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">312604</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 San Diego Business Journal Jan 8-Jan 14, 2018</copyright><publicationName>San Diego Business Journal</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 87506890</issn><volume>Vol 39</volume><issueNumber>No. 2</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 8, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The deal pits some of the sharpest minds in global mergers and acquisitions against each other, with the three sides represented by some of the biggest names on Wall Street and in the City of London.Blair Effron. Jennifer Nason. </p><p>John Waldron. Simon Robey. Roger Altman. They're some of the biggest names in global mergers and acquisitions \u2014 individuals who've made their name on both sides of the Atlantic by working on trillions of dollars worth of deals.

US entertainment giantComcast[3]entered the fray for Sky on Wednesday, makinga 22 billion ($30.7 billion) bid forSky[4], gate-crashing Rupert Murdoch's takeover attempt for the British and European broadcaster. The bid represents a 16% premium on the latest offer from Murdoch's21st Century Fox[5]. Comcast's deal values Sky at 22.1 billion ($30.9 billion). Sky's board responded by withdrawing its recommendation for investors to approve Fox's December 2016 bid, which has been repeatedly hit by regulatory hurdles.

Well, venture capitalist Ben Horowitz argues that many companies miss the mark when developing their culture. It`s part of his new book, \"What You Do Is Who You Are: How to Create Your Business Culture.\" Horowitz was an investor in transformative startups like Airbnb, Instagram, Lyft and Pinterest. And he joins us now. Ben, good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BEN HOROWITZ (Author, \"What You Do Is Who You Are\"/Venture Capitalist/Andreessen Horowitz Co-Founder and General Partner): Good morning. Thanks for having me.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TONY DOKOUPIL: So I think-- I think we should define culture because you have an interesting way of saying, look, it`s not dogs at work, it`s not casual Friday--</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes. Yeah.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: --it`s not a bunch of slogans on the wall.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Yeah.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: So, then what is it?</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Yeah. Well, and it`s not a set of beliefs; it`s a set of actions. And so it`s what people do when you`re not looking and you`re not there. So do they go home at five, or do they go home at eight? Do they return that phone call that day or in a week? You know, when they do a partnership, do they focus on the partnership itself or on the price? And these kinds of things are your culture, and they are very hard to measure. And you can`t just put them in a performance review because you don`t even know if they did them.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yeah.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.</p><p>GAYLE KING: And you said there is a difference between culture and perks at work. And sometimes--</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Yes.</p><p>GAYLE KING: --people get it confused and you have to have big buy-in from the CEO, whoever she is, you say.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Yes. Yeah.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I like that note. Yeah.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Yeah. Yes. Well, absolutely. And it-- but they won`t just behave like the CEO.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Like when you all come to work, you just don`t say, oh, what would the CEO of CBS do?</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yes.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Right? Like the culture has to be programmed, it has to be systematic. So as a leader, you can`t just expect that people are going to do what you do.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Mm-Hm.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: That doesn`t happen.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: In the book, you remind us about Facebook`s early motto, which was--</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Yeah.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: --move fast and break things.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Yes. Which was very good at the time.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: At the time.</p><p>GAYLE KING: At the time.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Yeah.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Well, that`s one thing that happens. Companies grow and affects-- you have to change in a way.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Yeah, absolutely. You have to change because, one, the world changes, as it has changed for Facebook. And then, like, your business needs change and what you have to do changes. And because your culture is how you behave, your behavior needs to change and your culture has to evolve. And often, you know when you start a company you can`t anticipate all the things that you`re going to need.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yeah. I-- I like too when you talk about-- Ben, about hiring practices.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Mm-Hm.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I found this very interesting. If people in-- in power positions only hire people that look like them--</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Yeah.</p><p>GAYLE KING: --that really does hurt the culture. And you had a really graphic example about one of your-- one of your managers told you.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Yeah. And it`s not just-- so, like, when you`re hiring people, you-- generally your default is you hire you.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yes.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: You`re like, I know what I`m good at value (INDISTINCT) highly.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: I can test for it in an interview. It`s great.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: But then you don`t see people have talent that you don`t have. And the-- the thing that really drove this home for me is I had an organization with all women in it. And I asked the manager, I`m like, what is it about your job criteria where no men can get the job? I was just trying to understand it. And she said helpfulness. And I was like, snap.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yeah.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: You know, I don`t know any helpful men.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yeah.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: That`s crazy. But we were a services firm.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: And like being able to anticipate some of these needs, being able to be helpful, it`s like a really critical thing we needed in the firm. But I can even see that I was blind to that talent.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Mm-Hm.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: So it actually takes work to see talent that you yourself don`t have. But it`s a huge competitive advantage if you can do it.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: And I think people default to when they get into diversity and inclusion, they go, well, I`ll just look at the ex-- oh, that`s women, that`s like a--</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes, yes.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: --an African-American. That`s--</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: But that doesn`t get what you want, and it also corrupts the culture because now you`re making race and gender the criteria as opposed to seeing the talent.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Mm-Hm.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: There are-- there are big questions right now and criticisms and calls for big tech overall to be regulated. Elizabeth Warren is calling for a breakup of many of the big-name tech companies. Is changing culture a way of, kind of, regulating from the inside?</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Well, I think so. I mean, you know, it gets into more complex things. But I think people often misinterpret kind of-- and-- and you all see this a lot, kind of good versus evil. Like that`s a good person, that`s--</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Yeah.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: --versus, you know, like humans against the gods. It`s a systems problem. We`re all battling the system that we`ve created. And it`s very complicated, and it`s hard to understand what the consequences are. And so it takes work to reprogram it and correct it. And that`s a lot of what culture is about. How do you get the system to where it does what you want it to do? So it`s a good system, not an evil system.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Right.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: But, like, if you go to, like, the intent of Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, you`ve had them on, like, none of these people have bad intent.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Intentions, yeah.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: They all have very good intentions.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Right.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: It`s in the execution.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: But it`s complex to get it right in the end, particularly, when you talk about, like, something with billions of people on it.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: All right. Ben Horowitz--</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yeah. But-- but it`s good. It`s good.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: --thank you very much.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Your book is good because it gives--</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Oh, thank you.</p><p>GAYLE KING: --three different examples of Genghis Khan, Shaka Senghor, who was a gang leader in prison, and then Toussaint Louverture, cultures that worked.</p><p>BEN HOROWITZ: Yes, yes.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: All right. Ben, thank you.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Maybe you`ll come back and do a podcast with me, Ben. Thrown it out there.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: His new book is \"What You Do Is Who You Are.\" It goes on sale tomorrow.</p><p>We`ll be right back.</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Before We Go, here`s one thing you can do today to live a happier and healthier and more productive life. It`s part of our partnership with Gretchen Rubin and her award-winning podcast Happier. Researchers find Americans feel overwhelmed when chores pile up at home. A Power Hour is an effective way to finish the annoying tasks on your to-do list. Every week, dedicate just one hour to the important chores you keep putting off. For example, donate unwanted clothes, organize your home office, or clean out the fridge. It also helps to make a list of your Power Hour tasks. Studies show we feel less stressed and more productive when we write down our plans.</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: All right.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Makes a lot of sense. We`re going to do--</p><p>TONY DOKOUPIL: I`m going to do the pots and pans. You know that cabinet in your kitchen, you open it up and everything falls out. I got to stuff it back in orderly.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: I get overwhelmed to just trying to pick which chore I`m going to do.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yeah. That`s me, too.</p><p>That will do it for us. We`ll see you tomorrow on CBS THIS MORNING.</p><p>ANTHONY MASON: Bye-bye.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Take it easy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CBSNEW-2019102811cb410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CBSNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDH-K8M1-JB20-G47N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">166768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1375\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 CBS Worldwide Inc.

At least four Wall Street firms are not bullish on the new sector, which is one of the market's worst performers this year. The new communication-services sector[1] implemented on Friday is already getting sour reviews from some analysts at major Wall Street firms. S...ow Jones Indices and MSCI first announced last November that they would discard the old telecom sector for a new one that melds communication and media companies. </p><p>This was to catch up with the dealmaking that had created companies like Verizon which provide both. Many investors who make sector-level decisions had already incorporated these business-model changes into their strategies. Also, many exchange-traded funds already allowed investors to buy into some of the themes that the reorganization aimed to capture.  But for anyone still making adjustments, analysts at major firmsare urging caution.Here's what they're saying:Morgan Stanley: Equal-weightThe new sector is cheaper than the market average, as defined by its forward price-to-earnings ratio divided by the S...00's, according toMike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist. However, this relatively attractive valuation still does not create a buying opportunity, he said. That's because investors cheapened stocks in the sector to reflect the disruption that was taking place. \"We would not classify this as a value sector though and think the message being sentis one of industry change as existing Media and Telco models shift, transform, andincreasingly overlap in ever more congruent end markets,\" Wilson said in a client note on Monday. \"As secular champions like Netflix, Facebook, and Alphabet continue to grow into their multiples and structural changescontinue, we are reluctant to rely on history to find the right multiple for this sector.\" Wilson also said the sector's forward earnings growth relative to the broader market peaked in late-2016, and that helps explain its underperformance this year versus the S...00; it's down 3.6% and the 10th-worst performer out of 11 sectors.Those are not the only reasons for caution: Wilson also pointed out the high concentration within the sector. Google[2] and Facebook[3] make up nearly half of its market cap, raising concerns about how effectively smaller companies can compete for advertising revenue. \"We think secular growers engender secular losers, particularly in an environment where overall spend is likely to decelerate with broader economic growth,\" Wilson said.RBC Capital: UnderweightLori Calvasina, RBC's head of US equity strategy, is even more bearish on the communication-services sector. Calvasina noted a weak earnings profile, in that the momentum of earnings-per-share revisions has been negative and revenue beats slipped in the second quarter. Like Wilson, she flagged the handful of tech stocks that dominate the sector. However, her concern is that some of these names like Facebook and Alphabet also have the most hedge fund dollars[4]invested in them. They're also prominent on the list of companies with the largest overweights among large-cap-growth mutual funds. The concern with crowding is that traders could experience painful losses if the majority view changes. And with all the big-tech names in the sector, the threat of greater regulation also came up as a negative. Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch: UnderweightSavita Subramanian urged investors to hold fewer stocks in this sector relative to the S...00, Bloomberg reported. She added that if US economic growth broadens, investors could rotate out of crowded growth sectors and into less-populated areas that benefit from stronger gross domestic product[5].  She also cited regulation as a potential setback. On Friday, Facebook announced that a hacker gained access[6] to nearly 50 million user accounts in one of the company's most significant cyber attacks. The hack drew attention to Facebook's data-collection and privacy[7]practices because the breach exposed multiple other services that users log into with Facebook. Besides regulation, Subramanian said companies with high dividend yields could come under pressure as interest rates rise.Wells Fargo: Unfavorable\"We have initiated guidance on the new communication services sector with an unfavorable rating,\" Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist, said in a client note on Monday. \"As for the other two sectors involved in the GICS restructuring[8], we continue to rate the consumer discretionary sector as favorable and the IT sector as neutral.\" The firm believes US stocks will continue rising on strong fundamentals, but advised clients to look for \"attractive opportunities that lie outside the US.\" \"Furthermore, because market downturns are often unexpected, we suggest holding asset classes that tend to do well when equity markets correct, such as high-quality bonds and hedge funds for qualified investors, consistent with an investor's risk tolerance.\" NOW WATCH: Apple might introduce three new iPhones this year \u2014 here's what we

The subtitle was more insightful, and revealed the authors\u2019 intentions: \u201cmarket developments and potential financial stability implications.\u201d<br/><br/>The report\u2019s premise is straightforward. The arrival of established technology giants, or Big Tech, on the financial scene could \u201caffect the degree of concentration and contestability in financial services, with both potential benefits and risks for financial stability.\u201d<br/><br/>The focus is on companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Ant Financial, rather than the myriad fintech startups in Silicon Valley, Israel, or clustered round the Old Street roundabout in London. Central banks and finance ministries are beginning to ask whether the activities of the tech behemoths, whose market capitalizations now dwarf those of even the biggest banks, will be wholly benign.</p><p><br/><br/>In a way, it might be thought surprising that the questions are being raised only now. Phrases like \u201cbolting stable doors\u201d come to mind. In Europe, regulatory changes like the Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) have been crucial in opening up the banking system, and regulators like the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority have for some time been running regulatory sandboxes to smooth the way for new entrants by helping them to structure themselves to comply with standards. PSD2, often described as \u201copen banking,\u201d requires banks to offer their customer data to non-bank providers of payment and account information services. Aggregators can then present the customer with an integrated view of their finances, and offer add-on services.<br/><br/>Maybe the time to assess the financial-stability risks of open banking was in the consultation period before the directive was passed. Even now, the list of contributors to the FSB work shows that the European Commission, and the key regulators in Europe and North America, were not involved.<br/><br/>So what did the FSB conclude?<br/><br/>The authors begin, tactfully, with a series of bows to Big Tech. They say, correctly, that \u201cthe greater efficiency of new players may enhance the efficiency of financial services in the longer term.\u201d Certainly, the absence of the cost drag of legacy IT systems and underused branch networks (which have been seen as a kind of public service and are therefore hard to rationalize) allow for cheaper digital delivery mechanisms which banks can only envy.<br/><br/>It is also entirely fair to argue, as the authors do, that increased competition in the supply of financial services may benefit consumers by expanding choice, stimulating innovation, and driving down transaction costs. The pressure on traditional providers is generating strong incentives to reduce costs and improve service. Incumbents can no longer afford to sit back and allow inertia to be their friend, as they did in the past when account switching was rare. But the FSB also warns that cross-subsidization may allow Big Tech firms to gain market share rapidly and knock out existing providers. As a result, \u201ctheir participation may not result in a more competitive market over the longer term.\u201d<br/><br/>Fintech startups<br/><br/>That is a warning policymakers should heed. But the FSB is supposed to be primarily interested in stability. And here the report points in both directions at once. <br/><br/>On the one hand, the authors argue that greater competition can create a more resilient financial system, with a wider range of companies managing the essential plumbing. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the ability of new entrants to undercut banks significantly could make the latter \u201cpotentially more vulnerable to losses.\u201d The accompanying reduction in \u201cretained earnings as a source of internal capital,\u201d the report argues, \u201ccould have an impact on financial sector resilience and risk-taking.\u201d<br/><br/>The reader is largely left to decide which of these two scenarios is most likely to play out. But while the report is unambiguously positive about the impact of fintech startups, whether they remain standalone entities, or join exiting banks to create complementary offerings, the authors\u2019 conclusions about Big Tech are far more nuanced. Whereas previous analyses have suggested that the financial stability implications of fintech are either benign or small, the FSB believes that \u201cthis could change quickly with deeper involvement of the large technology providers.\u201d<br/><br/>One possible route to financial instability identified in the report is that banks may loosen lending standards unwisely. I would assess that risk as low. Banks have been there before, in recent living memory, and are not keen to go back. But the threat to profitability is real, particularly if \u201closs-leader\u201d pricing strategies are adopted, as the FSB believes is possible. They refer explicitly to the risk of cross-subsidization. Banks in Europe are not much in favor with investors today, trading well below book value in most cases, and a significant loss of market share in payment services would threaten their viability further.<br/><br/>In response, the FSB, unsurprisingly, argues for \u201cvigilance\u201d on the part of banking supervisors. But I wonder if the answer lies with banking supervisors at all. Had a broader range of authorities contributed to the work, they might have more pertinently recommended vigilance by conduct and competition regulators, too. <br/><br/>Following the FSB\u2019s own logic, it is in these authorities\u2019 territories where the biggest risks are most likely to emerge.<br/><br/>Howard Davies is Chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

(He initially tried to avoid it this time.)</p><p>  The challenge for the subcommittee will be in establishing whether these tech companies -- which have amassed immeasurable power -- operate as illegal monopolies in certain domains, such as online search (Google), online marketplaces (Amazon), mobile phone app stores (Apple), the dissemination of information (Facebook), advertising sales (Google and Facebook) and mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>  It's not against the law to be the largest search engine, online marketplace or social media network. But antitrust laws, meant to protect against outsize market power, do not allow companies to suppress competition -- a practice known as exclusionary conduct -- by, for instance, quashing or gobbling up potential rivals. Freed from competition, companies may also cross the line by squeezing suppliers or imposing higher prices on consumers.</p><p>  Wednesday's hearing will be the culmination of a roughly yearlong investigation into the businesses' operations and is likely to be the final public forum before the subcommittee releases its findings, expected in the fall.</p><p>  Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and the subcommittee's chairman, has indicated the tech companies may not like the results, this month calling the companies' power ''terrifying.''</p><p>  It's up to the subcommittee to help the public understand the breadth of the companies' power and, potentially, to recommend that regulators break them up or take other action. Also at issue is determining if existing rules are sufficient given the tech companies' market power and whether the laws should be updated because the companies behave in ways that should be illegal.Here are some questions subcommittee members ought to consider:</p><p>Amazon</p><p>  The subcommittee will probably focus on the company's relationship with third-party merchants that use the site to sell directly to consumers. Such merchants represent about 60 percent of Amazon's sales. The company also operates an enormous shipping network, an advertising sales business and a cloud computing service that may raise alarms among regulators. Amazon's trove of sales data gives it incredibly detailed insights into both customers and merchants.</p><p>  After an investigation by German regulators, Amazon vowed last year to overhaul its contracts with third-party merchants. Did the company adequately do so? Does Amazon have contracts that require lower prices than other retailers'? Does it require exclusivity, meaning merchants cannot offer their goods on other sellers' websites?</p><p>  An Amazon lawyer told the panel, ''We don't use individual seller data directly to compete'' with other businesses on Amazon's site. But a Wall Street Journal report showed evidence that Amazon does just that, helping it create tailored private-label products that undercut competitors. What is the extent of Amazon's use of seller data?</p><p>Amazon offers its sellers warehousing and shipping services worldwide. What does it seek in return, beyond a commission? Does Amazon use sales data from small merchants to source new products or to help larger sellers succeed, forcing out smaller ones?</p><p>  In 2010, Amazon dropped diaper prices well below profitability, in a successful effort to force a competitor, Diapers.com, into acquisition talks. Amazon has since shuttered that site. Does Amazon view such actions as exclusionary? And is the company engaged in other such pricing wars in order to force a competitor to sell?</p><p>  A Washington Post investigation showed that Amazon pushes consumers toward its private-label products even when they appear to want to buy name brands. Does Amazon favor its own products in consumers' searches? Does it require fees or advertising purchases from merchants or brands to ensure their products rise to the top of searches?</p><p>Apple</p><p>  While Apple is best known for its iPhones and laptops, it also has healthy competition from companies like Samsung and Lenovo in hardware sales. As a result, Mr. Cook is most likely to be asked about the structure of Apple's App Store, where millions of software developers offer their apps for download.</p><p>  Why does Apple permit only its own app store on iPhones?</p><p>  Developers are generally required to offer their in-app purchases and paid subscriptions through Apple's App Store, rather than on their own websites, where they may avoid Apple's commissions. Apple has threatened to remove apps that don't abide. How is this in the best interest of consumers and app developers?</p><p>  Some app developers have alleged that Apple uses the detailed data it collects about app downloads to copy their ideas and that the company favors its own apps in searches. Is this true? If so, how does the company defend such practices?</p><p>Facebook</p><p>Facebook's aggressive acquisition strategy -- including the giants Instagram and WhatsApp -- makes it vulnerable to a breakup if regulators find that it was trying to rid the market of real competition.</p><p>  Reportedly, the Federal Trade Commission had documents demonstrating Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 in an explicit bid to stifle a competitor. Were those documents mischaracterized? How did Facebook's buying Instagram benefit consumers, and how did it determine the $1 billion price?</p><p>  British lawmakers released emails showing Facebook used an analytics app to collect detailed data about competitors in order to snuff them out. That helped Facebook decide to buy WhatsApp for $19 billion, the emails show. Couldn't that be called an abuse of market power? Does Facebook still cull proprietary data on rivals in order to protect its market leadership?</p><p>  Advertisers can target customers on Facebook with incredible accuracy, in part because of the platform's ability to track users' internet browsing activity across the web. Shouldn't users consider those terms onerous? Also, has Facebook made assurances about the privacy of customer data that it later reneged on? What assurances do consumers have that their data will remain private and not be repurposed for Facebook's benefit?</p><p>  According to The Wall Street Journal, Facebook quashed efforts to make its site less politically divisive because partisan content drives more use of the site, which is beneficial to its advertising business. How can suppressing opposing views for users be viewed as anything but an abuse of power?</p><p>  Alphabet</p><p>  Alphabet's signature product, Google, is central to nearly every activity on the web -- and increasingly, many activities off the web as well. It is the dominant search engine by far and operates sprawling advertising and cloud computing businesses. Subcommittee members are likely to home in on how Google's search business potentially stifles competition by favoring its own services and how YouTube, a Google subsidiary, pushes content to users.</p><p>  Frequently, answers to common Google search questions can be found in so-called answer boxes at the top of a results page. Google culls that information from other websites, eliminating the need for users to visit those sites. Doesn't that starve other websites of valuable traffic? Don't answer boxes simply buttress Google's market leadership by stifling competitors?</p><p>Google has paid Apple billions of dollars to be the default search engine on the Safari web browser on iPhones and iPads. How does Google expect rivals to compete on an even playing field if it has cornered such a significant share of the market?</p><p>Google controls multiple levers in the process of placing advertisements on the web, including analytics. The company also requires some businesses to use its ad technology if they want to use Google services. How does Google's ad sales technology benefit advertisers? Why doesn't Google allow marketers to see what prices others pay to place ads? Doesn't that stifle bargaining power?</p><p>  Critics say YouTube pushes videos that are politically slanted, based on data about its users, meaning viewers aren't likely to see competing viewpoints. Is it correct that YouTube's software is designed to reinforce biases? Other than keeping users on YouTube longer, what is the purpose of that system?</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

China, for example, they have their own social media platforms. Do you think that would be a problem in any other setting for their expansion? Do you think they would just buy those companies?</p><p>Dylan Lewis: No, I think that's a legitimate risk. One of the things that, in addition to these regional upstarts that we have, the idea of demographic shifts maybe pushing people out of Facebook, or having them not come in to Facebook, is something that I'm a little worried about. I think about how, Facebook has been in the U.S. for 10 years at this point. In the tech world, that's an eternity. That's a long time. You think about how you might have looked at Myspace or something back in the day and been like, \"Ah, I'm not a part of that,\" and instead gone to Facebook. I think there's the risk not only internationally of their being more entrenched platforms that are specific to certain countries, maybe, and have really great traction there, but I'm a little bit more worried about people that are coming onto the internet now, younger folks, maybe early teens, looking at the offerings that are out there in the social networking world and instead deciding to go with maybe Snapchat, rather than going to Facebook, because they see Facebook as this old, dowdy --</p><p>Lapera: It's an old person thing.</p><p>Lewis: -- internet relic. Like, \"Oh, my parents are on Facebook, I don't want to be on Facebook.\"</p><p>Lapera: My grandma is on Facebook. [laughs]</p><p>Lewis: Both my parents are on Facebook. I'm not friends with my dad. Interesting. [laughs] But one of the things I'm really excited about with that is, Snap will be going public. So, we will be getting some color on their business and customer acquisitions, hopefully. You can watch those two track each other. To mitigate some of that, Facebook has been pretty good recently about bringing in Snapchat-style functionality.</p><p>Lapera: Like Facebook Live, right?</p><p>Lewis: Kind of.</p><p>Lapera: Is that a thing?</p><p>Lewis: Facebook Live is a thing.</p><p>Lapera: I've seen that advertise on bus shelters.</p><p>Lewis: Yes. They are pushing that like crazy. But the Snapchat-style functionality of stories and little posts and things like that that are disappearing, that is...</p><p>Sarah Priestley: [laughs] Who does that remind us of? I don't know...</p><p>Lewis: [laughs] Yeah, right? That is being brought to the Instagram and Facebook Messenger platforms. So, I think they're seeing what resonates with people and bringing it there as a point to attract them to these platforms. That was a roundabout way of answering your question.</p><p>Lapera: No, that was a really good answer. That made me think about things that I hadn't thought about before, so I really appreciate that. My last question is actually about internet regulation. This is for whoever wants to answer it, I guess, but you made me think of it when you were talking about the 10-year plan to get more people on the internet. In the past and likely again, there have been bills that talked about internet throttling and stuff. That could be a problem for online businesses. What do you see? Do you see potential future regulations as a problem? Do you think we're moving away from that as a society? This is a touchy-feely question, I know, but I'm interested in hearing your opinions on this.</p><p>Lewis: When I think about regulation and Facebook's 10 year plan, I tend to focus on the net neutrality side of the internet.org offering.</p><p>Lapera: Do you want to explain net neutrality really quick? It's complicated.</p><p>Lewis: Absolutely. Net neutrality is basically a free and open internet, and the idea that people are not getting restricted versions of the internet, or censored versions of the internet. Some of the push back that Facebook has met with in India when they were trying to roll out internet.org there and build out connectivity is, the suite that is part of internet.org is basically, you have access to these at the time, it was like 30 or 40 platforms, and they were a mix of messaging, social networking, job hunting, news, that kind of stuff. But it was a curated package of all these different internet properties. And the regulatory push back they got was, \"Well, that's not the internet. That is a hand-picked version of the internet. If people come online and see that, they might confuse Facebook for the internet, and that's it. And they might not realize that there's all of this indexed world out there that they can explore, and it might lend itself to some monopolistic forces.\" I think, with the big tech pushes from Facebook, andAlphabet\u00a0is getting into this as well, the benefits from having more of the world connected probably outweigh the competitive risks of having it being pushed by major tech titans that have an interest in staying entrenched in that space. I think those will probably win out. They might have to do it in a watered-down way that gives people more access generally. But I'm more worried about the net neutrality side of stuff than internet throttling, if that makes sense.</p><p>Lapera: No, that's totally fine. It's an interesting thing. And every time it has come up recently, it has been defeated. But there's a new administration, we'll see what happens.</p><p>Lewis: And the domestic side of that is a whole nother host of issues. We could spend a whole episode on that. [laughs]</p><p>Lapera: There you go. Do you have anything you'd like to say about that?</p><p>Priestley: No, I completely agree. It's interesting because back home in the U.K., there's a lot of companies threatening to leave because the actual internet infrastructure isn't as good as they would like. So, you have those issues, too, which I realize is separate from that big macro issue. But, I would say the U.S. is in a particularly good place with the wireless and online infrastructure.</p><p>Lapera: Yeah, it was wild, I studied abroad in Australia for a few months, and this was many years ago, many many moons. It was wild because here, there was wifi on campus everywhere, and you paid one set amount and you had access to the internet. And sure, you could pay more for faster speeds. But there, you literally paid for how much data you used. The more data you wanted to use, the more you had to pay. Here, it's the faster, the more you pay, but they don't put a cap on your data, in theory, for your computer internet. It's interesting.</p><p>Lewis: And not to plug Facebook again in this conversation --</p><p>Priestley: You know, I feel like you're getting a lot more airtime. [laughs]</p><p>Lewis: Speak up, then. [laughs] But with the focus on mobile, and that being where a lot of their revenue is coming from, most people first come online, in a lot of developing areas, via mobile devices and not desktop.</p><p>Lapera: Which do have data caps.</p><p>Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Cicconi's charm was frequently on display in his blog posts whining about things like the FCC increasing the speed definition of \"broadband\"[2], or in the company's astroturfing efforts to undermine most if not all consumer protections[3] governing the telecom sector (though it's worth noting he wasn't particularly, personally keen on Donald Trump[4]). Cicconi retired a few years back, but his successor Bob Quinn didn't have an easy go of it. Quinn was fired[5] after reports emerged that the company had paid former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen $600,000 (using the same shell company used to pay hush money to Trump's alleged former partner Stormy Daniels) to gain additional access to the President, something AT...alled a \"serious misjudgement.\" As a result, AT... entire External ...gislative Affairs (E... group instead began reporting to AT...eneral Counsel David McAtee to, one would assume, keep the unit on a more legal trajectory. </p><p>But this week AT...uietly brought Cicconi back from retirement to tackle something that has apparently spooked the telecom giant:\"Jim Cicconi, AT... long-time top policy exec who retired in September 2018, is back, at least temporarily, according to an internal AT...ote confirmed by a sources. AT...aid that move was made \"given the pressing legislative and regulatory agenda we face in Washington D.C. and elsewhere.\" Cicconi Monday (Sept. 16) returned to AT...ashington on an interim basis as senior executive VP or external and legislative affairs, reporting to AT...hairman and CEO Randall Stephenson.Plenty of things may have spooked AT...nough to warrant bringing their former top lobbyist out of retirement, even if AT...as been a historic beneficiary[6] of (unearned) tax breaks and regulatory favors in the Trump era. One, the company is facing a growing investor revolt[7] due to ongoing TV subscriber losses and the growing sense that just maybe spending $150 billion on mergers (making AT...he most indebted company in the world) may not have been the best choice. AT...addled itself with debt to dominate the streaming space, only to find subscribers running to the exits in the wake of company decisions to raise rates to pay off said debt. AT... problems are compounded on that front by an array of new, overcomplicated brand offerings that have even confused AT...]. There's several other issues that could be making AT...ervous, not least of which is growing calls for more meaningful privacy legislation in the wake of endless hack and location data[9] scandals. AT...obbyists successfully convinced Congress to kill modest FCC rules on that front a few years ago[10]. They've also been hugely successful in convincing lawmakers that \"big tech\" should be the exclusive focus[11] of Congressional, regulatory, and antitrust scrutiny while telecom gets a free pass. But efforts in California[12] to pass tougher privacy rules (despite the flawed and rushed nature of some of the language) may be making AT...rass nervous. AT...xecs are also likely nervous about a looming decision in the 23 AG lawsuit against the FCC (for repealing net neutrality without basing said decision on, you know, actual facts[13]). Should the FCC lose that lawsuit (a ruling in which is expected to drop any day now), some or all of the FCC's 2015 net neutrality rules (and corresponding authority) would be restored, and Cicconi is likely the perfect candidate to complain endlessly about the terrible unfairness of AT...ot getting its way in press and policy venues.Permalink[14] | Comments[15] | Email This Story[16] [ 1]: <url

INTRODUCTION</p><p>The ubiquitous use of the Internet has increased law enforcement agents' reliance on data stored by information and communications technology (ICT) companies. Since many of the major ICT companies are located in the U.S., (1) courts and law enforcement agents around the globe have to seek the U.S. government's assistance in obtaining necessary digital evidence. (2) For instance, in an investigation regarding French citizens who reside in Paris, French law enforcement agents might have to request assistance from the U.S. Department of Justice if the suspects in question were using a U.S.-based email service. (3) Unfortunately, the available methods to obtain evidence in the U.S. are slow and opaque. (4) This prolonged cross-border data access process frustrates foreign countries, as it is hard, if not impossible, for them to access evidence about even their own citizens related to a crime occurring in their own territory. (5)</p><p>The emergence of cloud computing has exacerbated this frustration. Cloud computing refers to \"storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive.\" (6) Accordingly, the cloud prevents the loss of data due to computer crashes, is less vulnerable to theft, and provides an easy medium to share files. (7) To achieve these benefits, cloud service providers move an individual's data from one jurisdiction to another or \"shard\" the data and store it on servers in different jurisdictions. (8) Thus, though the user and the cloud service provider stay in a single jurisdiction, the data might travel through several jurisdictions, often unbeknownst to the user and the law enforcement agent. (9) This means that, to obtain a few emails, the law enforcement agent may have to initiate cross-border data access procedures in several countries, which would significantly prolong the prosecution or adjudication. As cloud computing becomes more prevalent, data travel, and thus burdensome cross-border data access procedures, may soon become the rule rather than the exception. (10)</p><p>Against this backdrop arose United States v. Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft Ireland), (11) where Microsoft refused to comply with a U.S. warrant because the requested data was stored in Ireland. (12) On March 23, 2018, while this case was pending before the Supreme Court, the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act) was signed into law. (13) Though the Microsoft Ireland case was mooted by the CLOUD Act, it remains relevant as it revealed countervailing opinions regarding the impact of cross-border data access on privacy and foreign relations. (14)</p><p>This Note will primarily focus on the privacy implications of the Microsoft Ireland case and the CLOUD Act, especially for non-U.S. citizens. Part II of this Note provides a background of the current legal system by explaining the Fourth Amendment privacy framework, the Stored Communications Act, and how Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) work. Part III outlines the facts, procedural history, and holdings of the Southern District of New York and the Second Circuit in the Microsoft Ireland case. Part IV examines the implications of the newly enacted CLOUD Act on the digital privacy of cloud users around the world and concludes that the digital privacy of users both inside and outside of the U.S. will diminish. While many commentators have focused on the privacy implications of the CLOUD Act on U.S. citizens, (15) this Note argues that the privacy ramifications of the CLOUD Act will be more severe for foreign citizens since their own countries, the U.S., and qualifying foreign governments will all have virtually unlimited access to their data with minimal safeguards. With these problems in mind, Part V proposes an alternative framework that would incorporate various stakeholders' interests more aptly than both MLATs and the CLOUD Act. Finally, Part VI concludes.</p><p>II. FOURTH AMENDMENT, STORED COMMUNICATIONS ACT, AND MLATS: OLD LAWS FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES</p><p>Concerned with undue privacy interference by press journalists and photographers, Samuel Warren and future Justice Louis Brandeis conceived the idea of a right to privacy in their seminal article The Right to Privacy. (16) As the case law and doctrine evolved, five dominant species of privacy emerged: tort, Fourth Amendment, First Amendment, fundamental-decision, and state-constitutional privacy. (17) This Note is concerned with the Fourth Amendment's conception of privacy rights.</p><p>A. The Fourth Amendment</p><p>The Fourth Amendment protects individuals against \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" by the government. (18) Pursuant to Katz v. United States, (19) the Fourth Amendment applies when a person exhibits an \"actual or subjective expectation of privacy\" which society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. (20) However, throughout the 1980s, the Supreme Court significantly pared back this Fourth Amendment protection. (21)</p><p>The development of the third-party doctrine in cases such as United States v. Miller (22) was particularly significant in this process. (23) Under the third-party doctrine, which is still applicable today, individuals do not enjoy a reasonable expectation of privacy in information that they have voluntarily disclosed to third parties. (24) Though the Supreme Court recently ruled in Carpenter v. United States (25) that access to a person's historical cell-site records constitutes an exception to this doctrine, (26) and hence amounts to a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, Carpenter's impact beyond cell-site records is unclear. (27) Chief Justice Roberts, who penned the opinion, declared \"[o]ur decision today is a narrow one.\" (28) If Carpenter only applies to cell-site records, the Fourth Amendment may not protect wire or electronic communications since these communications are necessarily disclosed to a third party. (29) Thus, in a networked environment, the Fourth Amendment provides little to no privacy protection. (30) The real protection for electronic communications comes from the Stored Communications Act (SCA).</p><p>B. The Stored Communications Act</p><p>To address this privacy gap that the third-party doctrine created, Congress enacted the SCA. (31) The SCA forms Title II of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) and limits access to stored communications and records held by service providers. (32) Title I of the ECPA, the Wiretap Act, is devoted to regulating the interception of realtime communications, (33) and Title III, the Pen Register Act, regulates pen registers and trap and trace devices. (34)</p><p>The SCA was designed by taking into account the prominent functions computers performed when the act was enacted in 19 8 6. (39) For instance, the SCA regulates only two types of service providers--Electronic Communication Service (ECS) providers and Remote Computing Service (RCS) providers--because those were the primary services used by computers in 1980s. (40) ECS is defined as \"any service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic communications.\" (41) For example, \"telephone companies and electronic mail companies\" are ECSs since they allow people to send and receive wire or electronic communications. (42) RCS, on the other hand, \"is the provision to the public of computer storage or processing services by means of an electronic communications system.\" (43) For instance, Google Drive and other cloud storage services are RCSs. (44) To compel an ECS provider to disclose contents in storage for more than 180 days or to compel a RCS provider to disclose contents, the government has three options: warrant, subpoena plus notice, or a [section] 2703(d) order (\"super search warrant\") plus notice. (45)</p><p>With such requirements, the SCA limits both the government's ability to compel internet service providers (\"ISPs\") to disclose information in their possession about their customers and subscribers as well as ISPs' ability to voluntarily disclose information to the government. Thus, the SCA \"extend[s] to electronic records privacy protections analogous to those provided by the Fourth Amendment.\" (46)</p><p>However, today, most providers undertake both functions. (47) Thus, technological developments complicated the implementation of the SCA. (48) For the purposes of the Microsoft Ireland case, the focal question was whether a [section] 2703(d) order is a type of warrant, a subpoena, or a hybrid form because depending on the answer, the Supreme Court could have come to different conclusions as to the extraterritorial application of the SCA. (49) As I will discuss later, the CLOUD Act answered this question by amending the SCA (50) and specifically authorizing a government entity to compel a U.S.-based provider to turn over data stored in another country. (51)</p><p>C. Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties</p><p>Currently, the U.S. has two types of treaties that govern obtaining evidence abroad: Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs) for criminal investigations and the Hague Convention on Taking Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters (\"Hague Convention\"). (52) While the Hague Convention is a multilateral treaty, MLATs are bilateral due to the United States' insistence. (53) The bilateral nature of MLATs means that \"progress in mutual assistance in criminal matters can fairly be said to be half a century behind.\" (54)</p><p>To request data access in the absence of an existing MLAT with the U.S., a foreign court must write a \"letter rogatory\" to the proper U.S. court through diplomatic channels. (55) However, the U.S. court is not under any obligation to assist the requesting court. (56) As the name suggests, MLATs were designed to solve this problem and create international law obligations for the parties to assist each other in criminal investigations. (57)</p><p>Under the MLAT process, to request data access, a foreign country contacts the Office of International Affairs (\"OIA\") of the U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"). (58) If the DOJ deems the request appropriate and in line with U.S. standards, the Department sends the request to a local U.S. magistrate judge. (59) The court then reviews the foreign agency's request in light of all \"relevant U.S. law, notably including the Fourth Amendment's probable cause standard, rules of privilege, and the Fifth Amendment.\" (60) If the court is satisfied, it issues a warrant addressed to the relevant ISP. (61) The ISP then submits the relevant data to OIA. (62) After the office reviews it under \"data minimization and human rights standards,\" OIA sends the data to the requesting country. (63) Accordingly, OIA and magistrate judges have robust gatekeeping powers concerning the incoming data access request. However, these gatekeeping powers significantly prolong the process. (64)</p><p>The rise of cloud computing has highlighted additional problems with digital evidence access through the MLAT process. Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the Internet. (65) Cloud computing complicates cross-border data access in three ways. First, when data is shared and stored across multiple data servers, there may be more than one home state of the requested piece of evidence. Theoretically, email providers like Google or Microsoft could shard email messages of an account and store the resulting \"slices of data\" in servers in California, Ireland, and Japan. (66) Thus, with cloud computing, a law enforcement agent in the U.K. attempting to access several email messages might have to initiate several MLAT processes to access a single piece of evidence. This assumes that the law enforcement agent can first successfully predict where the data might be stored, not an easy task due to the vast number of global servers. (67) Assume, for instance, an Indian prosecutor begins an MLAT process with the U.S. to obtain a defendant's emails from his Gmail account. However, unbeknownst to the prosecutor, Gmail's data dispersal algorithm sliced the requested mailbox and stored some of the emails in Thailand. In this hypothetical, the data access process is likely to be both time-consuming and fruitless since the requested data is not on the U.S. servers.</p><p>The second and related problem is the fact that data dispersal algorithms, a key part of cloud computing, may move data from one server to another based on users' locations, available bandwidth, or even legal constraints. (68) When data is sharded and on the go, \"neither the requesting country's authorities nor the [Multinational Cloud Service Provider] itself can tell where the data being requested is physically stored until it is retrieved.\" (69)</p><p>The last problem is the nature of digital evidence. Legal scholar Vivek Krishnamurthy notes that \"[u]nlike physical places and things--whose ownership is comparatively easy to determine up front--the ownership of an electronic account often can't be identified without first rifling through its contents.\" (70) Indeed, when creating a Microsoft email account, a U.S. citizen might declare herself as an Irish citizen, which will lead Microsoft to store her data in Ireland. (71) Mere retrieval of the data would not help the authorities or Microsoft in understanding the user's actual citizenship. As the next part analyzes in more detail, this was a prominent concern for the government and the Supreme Court.</p><p>III. SOMETHING OLD, SOMETHING NEW, AND SOMETHING MOOT: UNITED STATES V. MICROSOFT CORPORATION</p><p>The Microsoft Ireland saga began when a magistrate judge of the Southern District of New York issued a warrant to Microsoft, directing the company to seize and produce the contents of a customer email account. (72) Microsoft moved to quash the warrant as the requested data was stored in Ireland. (73) The Southern District of New York denied Microsoft's motion to quash a warrant issued under [section] 2703 of the Stored Communications Act (\"SCA warrant\"), and held Microsoft in contempt for refusing to execute the warrant. (74) Arguing that the SCA warrant was subject to territorial limits, Microsoft appealed. (75) The Second Circuit ruled in favor of Microsoft and quashed the warrant. (76) Subsequently, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. (77)</p><p>Before the introduction of the CLOUD Act, the parties' perception of cross-border data access was diametrically opposite. On one hand, the U.S. government was deeply concerned about data evasion. Chief Justice Roberts seemed to share this concern, as he asked whether Microsoft was arguing:</p><p>there is nothing... that prevents Microsoft from storing United States communications, every one of them, either in Canada or Mexico or anywhere else, and then telling their customers: Don't worry if the government wants to get access to your communications; they won't be able to, unless they go through this MLAT procedure, which--which is costly and time-consuming. (78)</p><p>Microsoft, however, downplayed the likelihood of such evasion, claiming that only 54 of 60,000 requests related to information stored abroad. (79) Microsoft's counsel also argued that those seeking to prevent the U.S. government from seizing their emails do not use Microsoft, but opt for ISPs that specifically promise that the data is outside the U.S. government's reach. (80)</p><p>In his concurring opinion, Judge Lynch of the Second Circuit also showed concern about data evasion. (81) He stated that if the SCA lacks extraterritorial reach, Microsoft could thwart the government's demand for the emails simply by choosing to store them on a server in another country. (82) Therefore, privacy protection would not depend on traditional safeguards of judicial oversight, but rather on \"business decisions\" by private corporations. (83) Accordingly, he noted that \"Congress would do well to take the occasion to address thoughtfully and dispassionately the suitability of many of the statute's provisions to serving contemporary needs.\" (84) Congress accepted this invitation and enacted the CLOUD Act.</p><p>Passed only two months before the end of the Court's term, the CLOUD Act revised portions of the SCA to explicitly permit the use of a warrant to obtain electronic communications stored by a U.S. company on foreign servers. (85) Upon the introduction of the CLOUD Act, the Department of Justice issued a new warrant for the requested Microsoft data. (86) Microsoft agreed that the new warrant replaced the old one. (87) Subsequently, the Supreme Court ruled that the case had become moot. (88)</p><p>IV. The CLOUD Act</p><p>The CLOUD Act introduces two novelties to cross-border data access. First, it carves out an exception for \"qualifying foreign governments,\" allowing them to bypass the MLAT process. (90) Qualifying foreign governments are those that have an executive agreement with the United States and have enacted laws that provide \"substantive and procedural opportunities\" specified in the CLOUD Act to electronic communication service providers and remote computer providers. (91) While the U.S. has not signed any such executive agreements as of December 2018, negotiations with the U.K. are currently underway. (92) If the countries come to terms and execute the agreement, there will be three types of foreign governmental access to the data stored in the U.S. One, qualifying foreign governments will be able to directly retrieve data from U.S. companies. Two, countries with an MLAT in place with the U.S. (but that do not have an executive agreement) will be able to initiate the MLAT process. Lastly, those with neither an MLAT nor an executive agreement will have to seek data through letters rogatory.</p><p>Second, the CLOUD Act resolves the central question in the Microsoft Ireland case by creating [section] 2713 of the SCA. (93) Under [section] 2713, ECS and RCS providers must \"comply with the obligations of [the SCA]... regardless of whether such communication, record, or other information is located within or outside of the United States.\" (94) Thus, the CLOUD Act clarifies the ambiguity in federal law and affirms the extraterritorial reach of the SCA.</p><p>However, the CLOUD Act does not change the MLAT system. Countries with an existing MLAT but no executive agreement will continue to follow the MLAT process. If the U.S. signs an executive agreement with a foreign country, the country will have both the MLAT and the executive agreement at its disposal. Since executive agreements offer direct and virtually unlimited access, countries with an executive agreement are likely to rely solely on the agreement. However, in a scenario in which the U.S. rescinds an executive agreement, the foreign country would still be able to initiate cross-border data access under the MLAT system.</p><p>Overall, the new scheme created by the CLOUD Act raises three major privacy concerns. First, it gives unlimited access to qualifying foreign governments. Second, by excluding non-qualifying foreign governments while allowing the U.S. to access data everywhere, it creates an unwelcoming U.S. exceptionalism to foreign governments, which will likely lead to an increase in other countries' efforts to enact data localization laws--that is, mandating that data is stored on servers physically located within the country where the data was created. (95) As I will explain in Section IV.C, these laws will also threaten the digital privacy of foreign citizens. Third, by giving global access to the U.S. government, the Act frustrates efforts by other countries to protect their citizens' data from surveillance by the U.S. Thus, the CLOUD Act is not the resolution of the Microsoft Ireland case, but only the beginning of a future privacy crisis, especially for foreign citizens.</p><p>A. Privacy Problems with Respect to Qualifying Foreign Governments</p><p>Pursuant to the CLOUD Act, a country becomes a qualifying foreign government if it has entered into an executive agreement with the U.S. that would \"allow each government to acquire users' data stored in the other country, without following each other's privacy laws.\" (96) A prerequisite for such a bilateral agreement is a written certification by the Attorney General finding that \"the domestic law of the foreign government, including the implementation of that law, affords robust substantive and procedural protections for privacy and civil liberties.\" (97) If Congress fails to act within 90 days after receiving notice about the executive agreement, the agreement automatically enters into force. That is, once the executive branch enters into an executive agreement, Congress may stop such an agreement only if both the Senate and the House enact a joint resolution disapproving the agreement. (98) Even then, the executive agreement would remain valid if the president vetoes the joint resolution. (99)</p><p>Aside from sidelining Congress, the CLOUD Act also bestows virtually unchecked powers to the Attorney General since it merely lists \"factors to be considered\" rather than imposing mandatory standards. (100) Though [section] 2523(b)(1)(B) lists several factors that the Attorney General must consider before such certification, the non-binding nature of these factors led many commentators to state that the Executive can enter into an agreement with any country--even those without high human rights standards. (101)</p><p>For instance, the Attorney General must consider the \"domestic law of the foreign government\" and whether it \"affords robust substantive and procedural protections for privacy and civil liberties in light of the data collection.\" (102) However, since the CLOUD Act neither adopts U.S. legal standards nor refers to international human rights treaties, the meaning of the words \"robust,\" \"protection,\" and \"privacy\" is left entirely to the discretion of the Attorney General. Moreover, a determination or certification by the Attorney General is not subject to judicial or administrative review. (103) As the dearth of checks on the Attorney General shows, this bilateral agreement scheme puts overly broad discretion in the hands of the executive branch. (104)</p><p>Admittedly, the CLOUD Act puts several procedural and substantive protections in place. (105) However, each safeguard falls short of the protection offered by the MLATs. Under the MLAT system, the probable cause standard applies to foreign requests. (106) Each request is scrutinized individually, ensuring that the probable cause standard will be applied by a U.S. magistrate judge. (107) The CLOUD Act, on the other hand, lacks an individualized review mechanism. The following three examples aim to illustrate the possible protection gaps caused by the lack of an individualized review mechanism under the CLOUD Act.</p><p>First, the Act prohibits targeting of U.S. citizen and resident data. (108) However, it is difficult to identify the citizenship of a user without first examining the content of the requested information, especially when the requesting government only provides an account name. (109) Even if the account profile includes citizenship information, the user might intentionally or unintentionally provide false information as to their citizenship. By the time the requesting government realizes that data belongs to a U.S. citizen, it might be too late for the U.S. citizen's privacy. (110) That is, without accurate citizenship information prior to data collection, electronic communications of U.S. citizens could be collected not under U.S. standards, but by standards used by the qualifying foreign government.</p><p>Second, the CLOUD Act generally prohibits the foreign government from sharing the obtained data with the U.S. (111) The foreign government may only share data with the U.S. government if the foreign government believes that the collected communication \"relates to significant harm or the threat of such harm to the United States or United States persons.\" (112) Since the CLOUD Act does not provide a definition of \"significant harm,\" the ambiguity of this term might cause substantial damage to U.S. citizens' digital privacy. (113) As the Snowden revelations illustrated, the U.S. government has historically engaged in extensive surveillance techniques to prevent or preempt terrorism. (114) In the future, the U.S. government may determine that terrorism concerns trump privacy interests once again and may begin relying on the data obtained by a qualifying foreign government. Electronic surveillance by the U.S. government in domestic security matters must comply with the Fourth Amendment or ECPA. (115) A qualifying foreign government, on the other hand, does not have to follow U.S. standards of probable cause or limitations on the Wiretap Act when requesting data from U.S. companies. (116) Thus, rather than the super warrant requirement of the Wiretap Act (117) or the notice requirement of the SCA, the more relaxed standards of a foreign country may govern the U.S. government's access. (118) For instance, the United Kingdom, which is likely the first country to become a qualified foreign government, has a concerning state surveillance law that allows the police to read texts, online instant messages and emails, and listen in on calls en masse, without requiring suspicion of criminal activity. (119) The law also prohibits notification of an interception of communications to the data subjects and forbids the introduction of evidence that an interception occurred to be used in court. (120) Thus, thanks to the CLOUD Act, \"Big Brother\" will watch both the U.K. and the U.S. citizens.</p><p>Third, under the CLOUD Act, requests from a qualifying foreign government must be particularized, based on \"articulable and credible facts,\" and be subject to \"review or oversight by a court, judge, magistrate, or other independent authority.\" (121) However, \"oversight\" does not offer the protection of judicial review since \"[s]uch 'oversight' might be generalized (as opposed to case by case), and might occur after the seizure (as opposed to before it).\" (122) Thus, such an oversight mechanism may not protect all of the requested data.</p><p>Protection gaps within the existing safeguards are just one part of the problem. Another issue is the CLOUD Act's failure to require qualifying foreign governments to adhere to the safeguards put in place by the Fourth Amendment and relevant privacy statutes. For instance, the CLOUD Act does not impose a notice mechanism on qualifying foreign governments. Even after the fact, the target of a data request, whether a U.S. or foreign citizen, will not receive notice and thus will not have an opportunity to ask a court to vindicate her rights and seek redress where abuses occur. (123)</p><p>As for live intercepting, the CLOUD Act merely requires orders to be for a \"fixed, limited duration,\" \"not last any longer than is reasonably necessary to accomplish the approved purposes,\" and be issued only if no alternative reasonable and less intrusive means exists for obtaining the information. (124) This protection falls short of that offered by the Wiretap Act, Title I of the ECPA governing prospective surveillance, which requires the government to obtain a \"super warrant\" to intercept contents of wire communications. (125) For many, live interception is more intrusive than interception of stored communications as it allows the government to obtain both relevant and irrelevant communications. (126) This is why, unlike a regular warrant, the Wiretap Act's super warrant requires the government to exhaust all other means of obtaining the necessary information and demand a special authorization. (127) In case the government fails to follow the super warrant process, the Wiretap Act also provides a suppression remedy. (128) The qualifying foreign governments that collect live communications of their targets, on the other hand, would not need to exhaust other remedies, require a special authorization process, or suppress the communications that were intercepted in violation of the CLOUD Act. (129)</p><p>Moreover, the CLOUD Act obligates the qualifying foreign government not to use the data obtained to infringe on freedom of speech. (130) Ostensibly, this clause aims to prevent censorship in the name of criminal investigation. However, it will most likely fail to achieve its goal for lack of specificity. Protections under freedom of speech vary in different jurisdictions. For instance, while Germany prohibits the use of Nazi symbols and hate speech, Turkey prohibits defamation of the president. (131) The CLOUD Act does not require the qualifying foreign government to follow U.S. free speech standards, does not define \"freedom of speech,\" and does not provide an international law source for this right. Importantly, the CLOUD Act allows data requests for \"serious crimes\" and does not involve a \"double criminality\" requirement. (132) Thus, \"serious crimes\" might effectively mean any crime under the qualifying foreign government's domestic legislation, even one with a severe chilling effect on freedom of speech. Thus, the CLOUD Act contains yet another nebulous provision that may be abused in the wrong hands.</p><p>To make matters worse, the CLOUD Act does not regulate the ways the qualifying foreign government can convince U.S. companies to store data locally or to provide encryption backdoors. (133) As Sharon Bradford Franklin wrote, \"as part of their data demands, countries could seek to require tech companies to provide 'technical assistance' that would include guaranteeing access to encrypted communications--an encryption backdoor.\" (134) Thus, if the qualifying foreign government wishes to expand its access, under the CLOUD Act, it can. (135)</p><p>One might argue that all the problems foreseen above might be overcome by the periodic compliance review. Adopting this view, Jennifer Daskal defines the review process as \"a remarkable and novel development that, for the first time, would enable the United States to track how data obtained by foreign governments is used and thereby protect against abuse.\" (136) However, even if this system works efficiently, it aims to prevent systemic abuses rather than individual mishaps. (137) Those mishaps, however, might mean violation of the most intimate communications of individuals.</p><p>Even if the U.S. government enters into executive agreements only with nations that respect privacy rights, a country's protection of privacy rights can be fleeting--and sometimes those protections flee too quickly. (138) The last decade has seen quasi-democratic countries sliding into authoritarianism and many democratic states taking drastic measures to fight terrorism. (139) This raises many questions regarding the implementation of the executive agreements. The Snowden revelations showed how drastic those measures were in the U.S. (140) The U.S. allegedly no longer engages in such surveillance efforts, but what is to stop other nations from enacting similar measures in the face of national emergencies? In such a case, would the DOJ be able to respond quickly and adequately? Moreover, would the DOJ even be aware of such measures if the qualifying foreign government engages in a clandestine surveillance program like PRISM? (141) That is, how could the CLOUD Act's oversight mechanism work if the U.K. or other countries with an executive agreement begin to engage in undisclosed surveillance efforts? (142) More importantly, would international politics allow the U.S. government to respond? Given the frustration of many countries with the current MLAT system, (143) rescinding the executive agreement and forcing a country to reutilize the MLAT process would be a severe punishment and a major signal that the U.S. lacks trust in the other country's human rights standards. Given the possible political repercussions, would the U.S. be able to take such drastic measures against an ally? (144)</p><p>The following scenario aims to illustrate a potential conflict between privacy and politics. In the aftermath of the Paris attacks in 2015, France entered into a nationwide state of emergency, which was extended until October 2017. (145) On October 3, 2017, the French Parliament enacted a new anti-terrorism law that allows the police to conduct house raids and searches without a warrant or judicial oversight, even at night. (146) According to some human rights advocates, this new law will harm the rights to liberty, security, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion across the country. (147) Imagine that after the U.S.-U.K. executive agreement, the U.S. enters into another executive agreement with France, and then the French government amends the anti-terrorism law to add a provision allowing the French government to wiretap every foreign citizen that visits France with mere suspicion. Would the U.S. government suspend the executive agreement in light of this new law? If the U.S. suspends the agreement, it might deteriorate U.S.-French relations. On the other hand, the continuation of the agreement would make many U.S. citizens' communications accessible to the French government. Worryingly, this delicate decision would be made solely by the executive branch, which may have a strong interest in continuing the agreement so as to ensure France's support in its own counter terrorism measures. (148)</p><p>B. Privacy Problems with Respect to Non-Qualifying Foreign Governments</p><p>In order to obtain data stored in the U.S., those countries that do not enjoy the privileged status of a \"qualifying foreign government\" would have to either initiate the MLAT process or send a letter rogatory. Unfortunately, both options are slow and cumbersome. (149) Legal scholars Jennifer Daskal and Peter Swire denounce the current MLAT structure and praise the CLOUD Act by noting:</p><p>Foreign governments have become increasingly frustrated by the MLA[T] system, which they see as an imperialist attempt to insist that foreign governments obtain a warrant issued by a U.S. judge even for data needed in the investigation of local crimes. As a result, these governments are actively seeking ways to bypass the MLA[T] system. (150)</p><p>These authors note a very valid concern. However, the CLOUD Act system does not solve the slowness or cumbersomeness of the MLAT process for many foreign countries. (151) If the Attorney General actually considers the factors stated in [section] 2523(b)(1)(B), only few countries will \"qualify\". (152) Thus, the CLOUD Act will likely privilege Western democracies and leave the majority of countries in the MLAT world. As Daskal and Swire acknowledge, countries with poor human rights records will have to look for their own paths to access data stored by U.S. based companies. (153) For example, such countries might attempt to adopt data localization laws to convince or coerce ICT companies. (154) Once data is local, the only limit on a government's access will be its own domestic law. Given that the CLOUD Act is silent as to the MLAT world, it would leave countries with poor human rights records on their own.</p><p>The CLOUD Act does not include any provision preventing data localization or encryption requirement laws. (155) Therefore once operating in a country, the ICT company must comply with the domestic laws therein, even if they conflict with the U.S. standards. Even if the ICT company values the users' privacy, it might still succumb to the foreign governments' measures that are not in line with human rights standards due to business needs. One example of such submission is Apple's recent concessions to the Chinese government to avoid exclusion from the Chinese market. In 2018, Apple formally transferred its Chinese iCloud operations to a local firm in southern China called Guizhou Cloud Big Data (GCBD), which is known for its close ties to the Chinese government and the Communist Party. (156) Apple began hosting its iCloud encryption keys in China and gave access to GCBD so as to obey the Chinese government's data access requests. (157) This decision was in stark contrast to Apple's actions in 2016 when it refused to build a decryption system requested by the FBI that would help unlock an iPhone by stating:</p><p>Once created, the [backdoor] technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices. In the physical world, it would be the equivalent of a master key, capable of opening hundreds of millions of locks--from restaurants and banks to stores and homes. No reasonable person would find that acceptable. (158)</p><p>Despite its earlier stance, Apple chose to hand over the keys to the Chinese government. As legal scholar Vivek Krishnamurthy wrote, data localization efforts \"threaten to fragment cloud computing services--and the global Internet more generally--along national lines, with serious implications for the free exchange of ideas and information, the efficient operation of the Internet, and for human rights, too--especially when the governments doing the localizing are not all that rights-respecting.\" (159)</p><p>Thus, the CLOUD Act seems to offer only two bad scenarios for data privacy. In the first scenario, the Attorney General will certify countries with both good and bad human rights records. (160) China, Turkey, Russia, and the members of the European Union, including Poland and Hungary, would thus all have direct and unlimited access to their citizens' data stored by U.S.-based technology giants. In this scenario, the U.S. would potentially be enabling some countries to persecute political dissidents. In the second scenario, the Attorney General only certifies countries with strong human rights records, such as those ranked as \"Free\" in the Freedom House Index. This means most Western democracies and some Commonwealth countries would enjoy the privilege of being a qualified foreign government, while countries like China, Russia, and Turkey would turn to forcing U.S.-based ICTs to localize data. As discussed above, once data is localized, these countries will enjoy direct and unlimited access to their citizen's data. In this scenario, the U.S., the champion of the free Internet and freedom of speech, stands idle while U.S.-based companies succumb to data localization requirements and many people are persecuted for their political opinions.</p><p>C. Privacy Problems from Foreign Countries' Perspectives</p><p>In the oral arguments of the Microsoft Ireland case, Justice Ginsburg asked Microsoft's counsel why Microsoft filed a motion to quash the warrant for this particular case although it was complying with similar orders before 2013. (161) Mr. Rosenkranz, Microsoft's lawyer, argued that their objection was delayed due to the novelty of cloud computing. Allegedly, Microsoft only started using cloud computing in 2010, and it took them a while to understand that there was an extraterritorial component of retrieving data from the cloud. (162) Coincidentally, however, the Snowden revelations took place in 2013, and many U.S. companies faced pressure from foreign governments to limit U.S. access to the data the companies hold. (163)</p><p>In the post-Snowden world, U.S. technology companies have been trying various ways to ensure data privacy abroad. For example, Microsoft created a data trustee system, and Apple strengthened its encryption efforts. (164) Many others signed privacy contracts with \"foreign customers[,] promising not to share data with other governments.\" (165) The CLOUD Act not only moots Microsoft Ireland but also moots these efforts. Regardless of where data is located, as long as a U.S.-based company owns it, the U.S. government will be able to access it. (166) However, due to post-Snowden global politics, \"[t]rust--in both American firms and the U.S. government--is simply too low.\" (167)</p><p>By enacting the CLOUD Act, the U.S. government signaled its disregard for this trust problem. The advantage of the CLOUD Act for the U.S. government is clear: the Act prevents ISPs from hiding data from the U.S. government. This advantage actualizes at the expense of foreign citizens' data privacy and the U.S.'s soft-power in cyber-regulation.</p><p>By undermining the bilateral nature of the MLATs and creating U.S. exceptionalism, the CLOUD Act will take away the U.S.'s leverage in setting a global standard for cross-border data access. Given that the U.S. hosts the majority of the big ICT companies, it had important leverage in leading the world in cross-border data access. However, instead of seizing this opportunity, the U.S. has pursued isolation and exceptionalism. That is, unless the U.S. enters into an executive agreement with them, those countries with existing MLATs will be forced to go through the slow and burdensome MLAT process. The U.S., on the other hand, will be able to access any data held by U.S.-based companies, even when the data is stored within an MLAT country, without going through the MLAT process. If the U.S. is not following the MLAT procedure for data stored in Country X, Country X will not want to follow the MLAT procedure to obtain data stored in the U.S. and will be skeptical towards new U.S. efforts in cross-border data access as well. Consequently, data localization efforts will ensue.</p><p>Data localization may compromise data privacy of foreign citizens for two reasons. First, pooling of data creates an easy target for hackers. (168) Thus, data localization makes user data more accessible not only to the government but also to other individuals using illegal means. Second, as legal scholar Tatevik Sargsyan argues, with data localization, a government's ability to \"manipulate and control\" citizens' communications via legal means increases. (169) Sargsyan explains the disadvantages of such \"stronger legal claim[s] over data\" by noting:</p><p>Overall, centralized management of data will also increase human rights risks, especially in countries that lack strong legal systems. Without data storage and data transfer restrictions, information intermediaries are able to provide important platforms for free expression. However, having local operations will make these companies more vulnerable to censorship and surveillance demands, and will make information accessible to authorities for illegitimate reasons, risking the safety and privacy of minority groups, journalists, and activists. (170)</p><p>In addition, the U.S. will have virtually unlimited access to foreign citizens' data. Foreign citizens do not enjoy Fourth Amendment and SCA protections. (171) The CLOUD Act, however, grants the U.S. government access to data held by U.S.-based ICT companies. That is, the U.S. could obtain the emails of two foreign citizens without establishing probable cause or going through the MLAT process.</p><p>Following the Snowden revelations, many countries enacted data localization laws in order to prevent this access. (172) However, to the frustration of foreign governments, even data localization will not suffice in keeping their citizens' data from the U.S. government's reach. Thus, as long as U.S. companies dominate Internet services, there is no way for a country to keep its citizens' data from the U.S. government.</p><p>Qualifying foreign governments will also have virtually unlimited access to the data stored by the U.S. government. While the CLOUD Act prohibits access to the data of U.S. citizens, it is silent on other citizenships. Thus, qualifying foreign governments can retrieve data regarding citizens of other countries. As stated before, the only limitation on this access would be the country's own domestic law, which may not amount to much protection. (173)</p><p>Not only will the CLOUD Act significantly undermine the digital privacy of foreign citizens, it might also damage the global economy through pressuring the use of cloud computing. Frustration with the MLAT process will most likely accelerate data localization efforts, which have two main negative impacts on global economy. First, data localization prevents companies from reaping the benefits of cloud computing. (174) Data security is much less expensive with cloud computing since data is stored on the cloud rather than the computer's hard-drive. (175)</p><p>Moreover, since data is dispersed among several data centers in cloud computing, \"if a data center is breached or destroyed in a natural disaster, the information itself is not compromised.\" (176) Cloud computing also adds an additional layer of data security by \"obfuscating\" data such that it is impossible to read data. (177) Data localization laws, however, require storing all data within the legislating country. This prevents companies from taking \"advantage of the Internet's distributed infrastructure and [using] sharding and obfuscation on a global scale.\" (178)</p><p>Scholars such as Thomas F. Brier, Jr. argue that data localization may be detrimental to technological innovation as well. (179) For instance, according to Brier, technologies that rely on cloud computing, such as internet of things devices, would have to utilize \"expensive and cumbersome national infrastructures,\" a dependence that may \"erode[] the promise\" of the internet of things. (180) That is, when companies cannot utilize cloud computing due to data localization laws, all other areas that rely on cloud computing to flourish will similarly be harmed.</p><p>V. AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE FOR PRIVACY AND DATA ACCESS: A MULTILATERAL TREATY</p><p>The MLAT process is under immense pressure due to the increased number of governmental requests. (181) The CLOUD Act does not solve this problem. Instead, it simply carves out an exception for the U.S. government and potentially a few Western democracies. Moreover, it significantly undermines the privacy of citizens all around the world. While data localization efforts by foreign governments will solve the slowness of the MLAT process, they will create their own privacy problems.</p><p>Thus, in the aftermath of the CLOUD Act, the global arena is in dire need of a new framework that would ensure both a quicker process than an MLAT and a less intrusive system than the CLOUD Act. Accordingly, a true global standard that would incorporate not just the U.S.'s, but multiple stakeholders' interests can only be reached through a multilateral treaty.</p><p>A multilateral treaty has certain advantages that neither MLATs nor the CLOUD Act offer. By providing a public multi-stakeholder dialogue, a treaty would ensure that data privacy of citizens from different countries will be taken into consideration. (182) Moreover, a multilateral treaty would solve possible conflicts of laws regarding the production of data to foreign governments. ICT companies have to maneuver around a \"growing, international patchwork of conflicting legal prohibitions and compulsions relating to surveillance.\" (183) The CLOUD Act will similarly conflict with foreign domestic legislation that prohibits ICT companies from sharing data with the U.S. In such a scenario, an ICT company finds itself between a rock and a hard place: sharing data with the U.S. might lead to sanctions within the foreign country, while not sharing data with the U.S. will lead to sanctions at home. Thus, a multilateral treaty would ensure that countries overcome these conflicts of laws by adopting a single streamlined process. Another advantage of a treaty for U.S.-based ICT companies would be an increase in their perceived trustworthiness in foreign countries. If all countries, including the U.S., have to go through the same international process to obtain data, foreign customers all around the world would not have to fear that their data is under the U.S. government's surveillance. (184)</p><p>A multilateral treaty might also better distribute the burden of processing data requests. The majority of government requests are processed by a few countries, and mostly by the U.S. (185) While foreign countries would benefit from a better-resourced DOJ, which would shorten the MLAT process, the U.S. would bear the cost. However, a treaty could create an efficient system to alleviate the burden on the U.S. by requiring member states to contribute to a common fund. This common fund would be an additional resource for those countries that are most burdened by MLAT requests. Outsourcing the cost of processing MLAT requests would benefit the U.S., while a more efficient DOJ that processes requests in a shorter time period would benefit other countries.</p><p>Although a treaty would protect and promote the interests of all parties within the MLAT system, treaty-making is costly and time consuming. (186) Moreover, some countries are content with the status quo. If a country is not concerned about the U.S. government's access to its citizens' data, the CLOUD Act does not pose a great concern to them. In fact, data localization might be easier for many countries since these governments would not have to abide by international standards or respond to global criticism. Thus, many countries will not show the political will to enter into a treaty that would require them to create and abide by an international standard. (187) Yet, when the need for a streamlined process is dire, countries with divergent interests have successfully drafted and implemented treaties. (188)</p><p>With these caveats in mind, by setting a uniform procedural and/or substantive system, a multilateral treaty is the best alternative to solve the current cross-border data access crisis without undermining citizens' digital privacy. Importantly, such a treaty might require certain countries to expand their working force for processing data requests and divide the resulting cost for such expansion. Doubling up the number of workers and resources of the DOJ's Office of International Affairs, the body responsible for processing data access requests, would certainly expedite the cross-border data access process and simplify the process by setting a uniform request process applicable to all member states. (189) Due to the gatekeeping functions of the judges, such a treaty would also protect the privacy of both U.S. and foreign citizens.</p><p>In this regard, the Council of Europe's Cybercrime Convention is both a success story and a cautionary tale. The Convention on Cybercrime (also referred as the Budapest Convention) is a multilateral treaty with 61 states parties, including the United States, Canada, and Japan. (190) Among other provisions, the Convention requires states parties to criminalize certain conducts such as illegal access and interception, data and system interference, misuse of devices, forgery, fraud, child pornography, and intellectual property offenses and adopt laws that would facilitate international cooperation on cybercrime and electronic evidence. (191) However, the vague terms of the Convention and the lack of limitations on states parties' reservation allowed some states parties not to take on new obligations under the treaty. (192) Moreover, despite a few exceptions, the Convention is predominantly European. (193) Yet, many commentators also praise the Convention, as it is a functioning treaty with increasing membership and a common international framework. (194)</p><p>Aspiring to further this success, the parties to the Budapest Convention agreed to adopt a protocol to \"help law enforcement secure evidence on servers in foreign, multiple or unknown jurisdictions.\" (195) However, the fact that the Council of Europe is considering adopting a protocol that would bypass the existing MLATs and grant greater direct access to the countries party to the Convention of Cybercrime is worrisome. (196) This would not solve but rather exacerbate problems that would result from the CLOUD Act. Moreover, despite the increasing membership to the Convention, only half of those states agreed to adopt the first Additional Protocol to the Convention. (197) Thus, it is unclear whether the new Additional Protocol could rise to become an internationally accepted treaty. However, the contents and exact contours of a multilateral treaty that can achieve this goal are beyond the scope of this Note.</p><p>VI. CONCLUSION</p><p>The U.S. has always championed the ideas of \"Internet freedom\" and free speech. The CLOUD Act threatens both. This system not only risks the privacy of U.S. citizens by allowing unlimited access to qualifying foreign governments, but also threatens the privacy of foreign citizens since the U.S., their own country, and qualifying foreign governments will gain access to their data. As long as the data is stored by a U.S.-based company, the U.S. government can obtain the data through a [section] 2703(d) order or a warrant. However, the U.S. government loses its negotiating power in the international arena and lets other states reign free. This system thus puts national barriers on the Internet and free speech. Put differently, the U.S. gains access to data held by U.S.-based companies but loses a great deal of soft power and risks the privacy of many. To prevent such a gloomy scenario, governments around the world should enter into negotiations regarding a multilateral treaty that sets a global standard for cross-border data access. This new multilateral treaty would not only overcome the slowness of the MLAT system, but would also limit the overbroad access of the CLOUD Act.</p><p>(1.)

One might wonder how a piece of U.S. legislation could prevent such foreign data localization efforts. This would be through the requirements of the CLOUD Act for an executive agreement. The CLOUD Act sets out the fundamental principles that the executive agreements will incorporate. Executive agreements, thus, would incur obligations for the foreign governments to follow. For instance, under the CLOUD Act, executive agreements cannot create an obligation for a company that receives a surveillance request to be capable of decrypting data. 18 U.S.C. [section] 2523(b)(3) (2018). That is, a prerequisite for any executive agreement is that the Attorney General determines that the negotiated executive agreement does not include such decrypting obligation. In a similar manner, the CLOUD Act could have imposed a comparable prerequisite for encryption backdoors or data localization efforts. That is, in a rather quid pro quo fashion, if a foreign government wished to enjoy the benefits of an executive agreements, it would have to give up on pursuing data localization laws.</p><p>(136.)

One might argue that the CLOUD Act will not increase the U.S. government's access to data stored abroad because the U.S. government will not be able to enforce the law in the first place. One might point to the Securities and Exchange Commission's inability to enforce disclosure rules on foreign companies. However, the CLOUD Act is strikingly different from this example, since it targets U.S.-based companies. With virtually all of their assets in the U.S., it is hard to imagine that U.S. companies will refuse to abide by requests by the U.S. government. Thus, I disagree with the structural criticism that the CLOUD Act will not grant more data access to the U.S. In fact, Microsoft's jubilant support for the CLOUD Act shows how willing the tech giant is to perform its duties under the new law.

His attentions tend to face outward, with informed discussion about the ethical negligence of the world's big tech companies, for instance, or how insular politics among nations will hasten the worst consequences of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Refreshingly, he considers questions carefully, avoiding prepared responses. But he remains rough enough around the edges to still be personable. \"Sorry, I have to try not to swear in interviews,\" he says at one moment, when the conversation turns to Tory party arts policies. \"I've been told not to swear.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That personality - approachable, curious and widely admired - is evident in the unusual path that brought him to lead the National, not as a Cambridge-educated professional director, like almost all of his predecessors, but as a former actor who trained first at RADA before gravitating towards directing. Shortly before we met, Norris made an unscheduled appearance on one of his own stages, filling in last minute for an injured actor. By all accounts, he acquitted himself well. The son of an overseas civil servant, who grew up in Ethiopia, Nigeria and Malaysia, and later worked frequently in Palestine, he seems alert, serious, ready for anything.</p><p>But with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Macbeth</emphasis>, his large-scale production of Shakespeare, and only the second time he has directed the playwright's work in 25 years, Norris can resemble someone struggling to understand what went wrong.</p><p>Conceived in 2016, the year of the Brexit referendum, and delivered in 2018, when its consequences were becoming bitterly apparent within a deeply divided nation, this <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Macbeth</emphasis> takes place against a post-apocalyptic landscape strewn with detritus, torn apart by civil war. To an outsider, that might look like a globalist's fears writ large.</p><p>\"Certainly, that wasn't what was at the front of my mind,\" Norris says, hunching over a coffee in Dublin on so foul and fair a day. \"But inevitably these things don't have to be at the front of your mind to dictate how you make decisions. I grew up all over the world. I think there is a movement - and certainly Brexit was an expression of it - to deny our interdependence internationally, to deny our colonial history and the relationships and responsibility we have as a result, that is inevitably going to lead us to a bad place.\" </p><p>Characteristically, he reaches for a wider lens, involving Donald Trump's roll back on even symbolic climate commitments, the worrying election of far-right strongman Jair Bolsonaro as Brazil's new president, and the violent protests of Paris's \"gilet jaunes\", rioting over fuel tax. Like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Macbeth</emphasis>, a tragedy of expedience and isolation, actions taken in narrow self-interest amount to some awful consequences.</p><h>It's a post-apocalyptic world, </h><p>Norris never mentioned Brexit in his discussions with the acclaimed designer Rae Smith, however, referring instead to sights they had both witnessed elsewhere: in the Balkans, the West Bank, Africa and Asia, the miserable conditions brought about by conflagration and deprivation. \"It's a post-apocalyptic world,\" Norris says of his imagined Scotland for Macbeth, \"but the apocalypse is not nuclear war, it's largely ecological devastation.\" That, he says wryly, is a threat far more grave than the disorder of leaving the EU. \"I just don't think we're important enough for that to be the end of the world.\"  </p><p>Still, Brexit forced Norris to reckon with the question of what nation the National Theatre hoped to represent. Shortly after the results, he commissioned a rapid-reaction play called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">My Country: A Work in Progress</emphasis>, for which writers scoured the UK, from Derry to Newcastle, Glasgow to Cymru, gathering opinions that reflected current sentiments. \"There was no agenda other than to listen,\" Norris says. \"It's very easy for people in urban centres to say, 'I know better than you' - that kind of patronisation which people had clearly kicked back against. What emerged for me very strongly were two things: people were protesting against the breakdown of community and the inequality of opportunity.\"</p><p>As Norris puts it, that applies to culture too. Last year, in response, the National Theatre toured 10 productions, more than any other time in its history, while also staging community projects on its vast Olivier stage and beginning long-term programmes in regional centres. \"The theatre has a real role to play,\" Norris says, \"because a theatre is a community centre.\"</p><p>That's a suprisingly earthy way to describe the National Theatre. This is, after all, a theatre currently hosting Ralph Fiennes on its stage in a celebrated production of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Anthony and Cleopatra</emphasis>, while awaiting Cate Blanchett's appearance later this month in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">When We Have Tortured Each Other Sufficiently</emphasis> (which, it seems necessary to say, is not a Brexit drama). It is also enjoying several West End transfers, including <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nine Night</emphasis> by Natasha Gordon, a Norris discovery, which is the first ever West End production of a play by a black British female playwright.</p><p>In the meantime, hot on the heels of a celebrated New York transfer of<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Angels in America</emphasis>, the National's production of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Network</emphasis>, directed by Ivo van Hove and starring Bryan Cranston, is currently the toast of Broadway. If this is a community centre, that's quite an outreach programme.</p><p>\"It's sort of what the job is,\" Norris says of programming box-office smashes with artistic credibility. \"It's a balance between excellence and mission.\" In 2018, the third year of Norris's tenure, the National operated at more than 90 per cent capacity for a third straight year. \"And we need to be,\" he says. \"Our subsidy is falling. We have to look at how we keep the financial health of the organisation in good nick through whatever comes. We're a national theatre. We're supposed to be there for everyone.\"</p><p>One of the National Theatre's occasional visitors is Theresa May, whom Norris has met several times. If <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Macbeth</emphasis> asks us to empathise with a leader laid low by his ambition to rule, following malign influence towards chaos and self-destruction, one wonders what May would have made of the show.</p><p>\"In the end, what's theatre about?\" asks Norris. \"It's about inviting an audience to stand in the shoes of other people; to take the imaginative leap to go, what would it be like if I were you?\" Has he been able to empathise with Theresa May, to put himself in her shoes? </p><p>\"I think in many ways part of her survival is to be armoured. She's very closed. So, no, I don't feel like [I know her at all].\" Norris may have little political affinity with the prime minister, but he was impressed nonetheless by her competence at a recent Downing Street event for Britain's Creative Industries. Norris used the occasion to doorstep her with a particularly esoteric question. May finished his sentence - \"You want to talk about lighting\" - before reeling off a multi-point plan to deal with new EU lighting regulations. (There was no mention of a backstop.)</p><h>Fascinatingly even-handed </h><p>For his part, Norris is fascinatingly even-handed about his own criticism, accepting it while still standing over his work, where his predecessor, Hytner, used to be enjoyably combative. This might be just as well, though, because his production of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Macbeth</emphasis> received some especially scathing reviews when it opened last year, with a sneering focus on Norris's relative inexperience with directing Shakespeare.  </p><p>With curious consensus, London critics rubbished its aesthetic (\"ugly-to-behold\" said the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Telegraph</emphasis>; \"harsh to look at\", complained the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Guardian</emphasis>; \"aggressively ugly\" chimed in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stage</emphasis>), bemoaning that an intimate drama had been spread across a cavernous space, while taking issue, more predictably, with cuts to the text. Much of this reminds you how much latitude British theatre affords Shakespeare's international interpreters, from the celebrated work of the Toneelgroep's Van Hove (which is harsh to look at) to Thomas Ostermeier's brilliant and radical interpretations for the Schaubuhne (which are aggressively ugly).</p><p>\"Well, look, I'm human,\" Norris says of the panning. \"That hurt. There's no two ways about it.\" He discussed the experience with Hytner and Richard Eyre, which came after a series of poorly received shows at the Olivier. \"In terms of my personal response, I think almost inevitably when you feel like kicking out against criticism it's because you're personally hurt. And that's the game that we're in.\" Still, there's more than a little truth in his suggestion that people tend to shy from ecological warnings, partly because our own helplessness is too much to bear.</p><p>The word Norris uses most to discuss his interpretation of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Macbeth</emphasis>, moreover, is \"survival\", a term as familiar to environmentalists as it is to politicians, or, for that matter, directors of the National Theatre.</p><p>Norris describes the chaos of 11th century Scotland, Shakespeare's setting, where \"everybody's rebelling, you've got invaders coming in, and it's much more akin to the end of a long civil war, like something we can see in our contemporary world \u00a0 It's about what human beings are prepared to do to survive.\"</p><p>It's hard to say if <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Macbeth</emphasis>, a play so steeped in blood that it is marked by invisible daggers and indelible blood stains, is a profoundly pessimistic work or a slyly optimistic one. After all, Shakespeare concocted it as an entertainment for his patron, King James, himself an authority on witches, who could here watch divine order restored and the eventual triumph of his ancestors. Does Norris see cause for hope - in the theatre, in the world - or, as his dystopian production suggests, should we prepare for the worst?</p><p>\"I'm a natural optimist,\" he says, summoning all the insouciance of an overworked undertaker. Of the theatre, he says, touching all wood within reach, \"we're doing ok. A lot of the more outward-looking mission that we're driving is being embraced.\"</p><p>And what about that bigger stage, all the world? \"In terms of where the world is going, I'm not optimistic at all,\" he says. \"I think we're heading into a s**t storm.\" That may count as swearing in an interview. But ugly times call for harsh truths.</p><p>n</p><h>The Royal National Theatre's production of </h><h>Macbeth</h><h>, directed by Rufus Norris, runs at the Bord Gais Energy Theatre from January 15th-19th</h></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.3748347</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V48-7FW1-JC8Y-833T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 5, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp;

The number gets the attention, but it's worth looking at the underlying details here. This was the result of a two year investigation[2], specifically into certain bundling practices that Google used concerning Android and some of its apps. When Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager first announced the investigation in April of 2016, she more or less explained where they were headed:The Commission's preliminary view is that Google has implemented a strategy on mobile devices to preserve and strengthen its dominance in general internet search. </p><p>First, the practices mean that Google Search is pre-installed and set as the default, or exclusive, search service on most Android devices sold in Europe. Second, the practices appear to close off ways for rival search engines to access the market, via competing mobile browsers and operating systems. In addition, they also seem to harm consumers by stifling competition and restricting innovation in the wider mobile space.And... that's more or less exactly what the Commission found in today's announcement.Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: \"Today, mobile internet makes up more than half of global internet traffic. It has changed the lives of millions of Europeans. Our case is about three types of restrictions that Google has imposed on Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. In this way, Google has used Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine. These practices have denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete on the merits. They have denied European consumers the benefits of effective competition in the important mobile sphere. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules.\" In particular, Google: has required manufacturers to pre-install the Google Search app and browser app (Chrome), as a condition for licensing Google's app store (the Play Store); made payments to certain large manufacturers and mobile network operators on condition that they exclusively pre-installed the Google Search app on their devices; and has prevented manufacturers wishing to pre-install Google apps from selling even a single smart mobile device running on alternative versions of Android that were not approved by Google (so-called \"Android forks\").I've been critical of some antitrust activity and supportive of others over the years, and I think it's important to take a step back and look at whether or not this actually will likely lead to greater innovation -- no matter what the reasoning is (and, it should be noted, many European officials have made it clear they think EU antitrust activities should be used to harm American companies[3] because they're big and American, rather than for any principled reason concerning competition or innovation). And, of course, there are some people who simply hate big tech companies and will cheer on any attack on them whether it's for good or bad reasons. Just to set some signposts for the discussion: I believe, and have argued strongly over the years, that competition is the key to innovation and innovation is an important component of making everyone's lives better. You are free to disagree with those claims, but then we're having a very different discussion. This is the lens through which I view this entire discussion. Based on that, antitrust activities are useful when they are used to stop truly harmful monopolistic practices that hold back competition and innovation. But, antitrust activities for other reasons, or which don't seem likely to result in greater competition and innovation tend to be wasteful and silly. So... where does this latest fine from the EU come down? As I noted when the investigation was first announced, it seemed that only one of the three \"prongs\" of the investigation really seemed like a big issue: the preventing manufacturers from selling phones with alternative versions of Android. There is a non-nefarious reason why Google might want this -- because if those non-Google Android versions are poorly done, it could confuse people and reflect poorly on Google... but this condition could clearly be used to stifle competition and innovation in the space. There's a reasonable argument that this was always a step too far, and Google never should have gone down that path in the first place. The other reasons given for the fine remain... a lot less compelling. First, there's the issue of tying Google search and Chrome to offering Google Play as a pre-installed app. First off, the EU admits (oddly) that this is unfair because everyone expects the Google Play store to be pre-installed:As part of the Commission investigation, device manufacturers confirmed that the Play Store is a \"must-have\" app, as users expect to find it pre-installed on their devices (not least because they cannot lawfully download it themselves).Okay, fair enough. But you know what that very same Play Store lets you do? Download other browsers and search apps. I don't use Chrome on my phone (I use Firefox, Firefox Focus -- which is fantastic, or Brave). I've even used alternative app stores in the past, but eventually shifted back to the Play Store, mainly because Google seemed to do a much better job of stopping dangerous or crappy apps from getting on my phone. And, as Google has suggested, part of the reason for requiring Chrome to be installed is that tons of other apps actually use Chrome components as part of how they work. So not installing Chrome with the Play Store would actually lead to a lot of apps not working properly. The other issue for which Google was dinged was the payments to device manufacturers to make Google search the \"exclusive\" pre-installed search on those devices. Now, I could totally see a valid antitrust complaint on this point if Google were forcing manufacturers into this agreement against their will, and were able to force them to do so. But... here it's about Google doing a business deal to pay manufacturers to be the exclusive. As we pointed out at the beginning of the investigation, how is that different than when Google paid Mozilla to be the default search engine in Firefox? Then Microsoft outbid Google and Bing became the default. Either way, on this issue, Google stopped doing this practice entirely in 2014. Google says it's going to appeal this decision, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai is hinting[4] that if the ruling is upheld, Google may no longer be able to offer Android for free in the EU. Google also argues that the way its designed its Android business has created a tremendous amount of choice -- including providing smart phone / tablet / other devices that are available at price points and in markets where Google's main competitor in this space, Apple, refuses to make any real offerings. And that's a fairly compelling point. The bigger question, again, though is what will be the real impact on innovation for end users of all of this. I'm not convinced (should this hold up) that it will have much of an impact either way. I doubt making any of the required changes will really harm Google that much (as noted, in at least one case, it already gave up the practice four years ago). But I also don't see how any of the required changes really helps competitors or app developers in any significant way. It doesn't make any of them more likely to get more users, or provide a better way for them to get their services out there. One of the issues with anything having to do with innovation is that it's impossible to envision the \"innovation that would have occurred\" in the counterfactual scenario in which the supposed antitrust violations never occurred. But looking over these issues, I'm hard pressed to think of how anything would have developed all that differently if Google hadn't done these things in the first place. Perhaps Amazon's Fire devices would have a larger market? Perhaps we'd have seen more innovation with other third parties building out their own versions of Android with their own playstores. But it seems unlikely that it would have materially changed how the search market and browser market developed. Of course, it should be noted that there is some amount of karma here. Back during the Microsoft antitrust fight, Google stepped up in 2006 to complain to the EU Commission[5] about Microsoft's bundling and default practices. Specifically, Microsoft's browser at the time included a built in search box that defaulted to Microsoft's own search (at the time, called MSN search). And Google didn't like that.\"The market favors open choice for search, and companies should compete for users based on the quality of their search services,\" said Marissa Mayer, the vice president for search products at Google. \"We don't think it's right for Microsoft to just set the default to MSN. We believe users should choose.\"And, amusingly, Microsoft's own response to that criticism was nearly identical to Google's today, saying that \"the user is in control\" and it's easy to change the defaults. So there's absolutely some hypocrisy in how Google has acted through this whole thing. However, in the end, I'm still hard pressed to see how today's fine will actually change anything in a way that improves innovation and what the public gets to do. Google is competing with lots of companies on a variety of different fronts these days. Earlier this year we had a podcast exploring how companies might disrupt Google[6], and I don't see how these moves make any of what we discussed any easier at all. Instead, it seems to be fighting the last fight, over mobile UI, rather than the next real competitive and innovative fights on different kinds of services.Permalink[7] | Comments[8] | Email This Story[9] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4581_en.htm\">http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4581_en.htm</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160420/10225434223/eu-officially-goes-after-googles-android-antitrust-grounds.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160420/10225434223/eu-officially-goes-after-googles-android-antitrust-grounds.shtml</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150414/13235130658/eu-official-says-time-to-harm-american-internet-companies-via-regulations-hours-later-antitrust-charges-against-google-announced.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150414/13235130658/eu-official-says-time-to-harm-american-internet-companies-via-regulations-hours-later-antitrust-charges-against-google-announced.shtml</url> [ 4]: https://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/android-has-created-more-choice-not-less/ [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/01/technology/01google.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/01/technology/01google.html</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180227/11155739320/techdirt-podcast-episode-156-disrupting-google.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180227/11155739320/techdirt-podcast-episode-156-disrupting-google.shtml</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180718/12472340264/some-thoughts-eus-latest-5-billion-google-antitrust-fine.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180718/12472340264/some-thoughts-eus-latest-5-billion-google-antitrust-fine.shtml</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180718/12472340264/some-thoughts-eus-latest-5-billion-google-antitrust-fine.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180718/12472340264/some-thoughts-eus-latest-5-billion-google-antitrust-fine.shtml#comments</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180718/12472340264/some-thoughts-eus-latest-5-billion-google-antitrust-fine.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180718/12472340264/some-thoughts-eus-latest-5-billion-google-antitrust-fine.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT1023051531958776648251765300017</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SV1-BPC1-F03R-N4PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1859\"/><timeReceived>12:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 19, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It strikes me that from a consumer perspective, in many ways we've never had it so good, but at the same time there are new threats and concerns which are also unprecedented. We will therefore be tempted to seek regulatory remedies and limits on the power of tech companies and technology, and while some of these may be worth pursuing, there's also a danger that we politicize technology and undermine progress even as we seek to protect consumers and startups.We've Never Had it so GoodFirst off, I'd argue that as consumers of personal technology we've never had it so good \u00e2euro;ldquo; the devices we have access to are unprecedented in both their raw power and in their specific capabilities, from cameras to connectivity to displays and audio. And the key thing here is that no single manufacturer either dominates sales or has far and away the best devices: one of the best things about the current state of the market is that consumers have a number of great options in key categories from smartphones to PCs to tablets and TVs. </p><p>On the smartphone front, Apple and Samsung make the most and arguably the best premium smartphones, but new players like Google and Essential are creating promising new entrants, while the old guard including LG and others continue to produce interesting devices too. On key features like cameras, Apple, Samsung, Google and others all have great performance and it's mostly a matter of personal preference rather than objectivity which is best. In the smartphone market in particular, it's also notable that consumers don't have to spend the $700-plus that's now required to buy a top-of-the-line smartphone in order to have a great experience. There are less powerful but still serviceable smartphones available at nearly every price point from $50 to $800, making this technology available to consumers throughout the world and thereby transforming lives and economies. All of this is also true in other categories like tablets and PCs, though low-end PCs still tend to prove the maxim that you get what you pay for more than other categories of consumer hardware.Technology is an Enormous Force for GoodThat last point is worth expanding upon: not only is our technology great, but it has done great good in the world, connecting people with each other and other resources as never before, opening up a world of information and content to anyone, anywhere, on the device of their choosing. The Internet has both allowed even the smallest publisher to reach massive audiences and allowed tiny interest groups to find comradeship across the globe. Technology is connecting families, giving opportunity to poor and otherwise marginalized populations, including the disabled and ethnic minorities.But It Has Also Created Worrying Side EffectsNone of that is to say that technology has created unalloyed good in the world. Many of the same enablers that have permitted innovation, positive communication, community building, and more to flourish have also fed conspirators of various stripes, trolls, and other bad actors and their ability to do nefarious work. Platforms designed to allow people to connect in positive ways have also enabled the spread of misinformation, harassment and abuse, and more recently even meddling in elections. It's clear that we're only beginning to discover the scope and potential of some of the negative effects of technology in our lives. Meanwhile, tech as an industry is characterized by other unpleasant characteristics, notably a lack of diversity and a tendency to downplay or ignore the potential of new technologies for evil as well as good. Too often Silicon Valley demonstrates its lack of diversity in its lack of understanding of how its inventions will impact marginalized populations[1] or even the population as a whole. Its self belief is one of its greatest strengths but also one of its greatest weaknesses. I've also pointed out that, with few exceptions[2], the largest companies in the industry are dominant and threaten to continue to squeeze out innovators[3].Regulation is a Tempting SolutionIn light of all this, voices from both sides of the political spectrum in the US and beyond are calling more loudly for regulation of big tech companies, whether on antitrust, content, advertising transparency, or other grounds. Some of these calls have obvious merit, and would bring the tech industry in line with older industries that provide similar functions. But my biggest worries with tech regulation are always that those writing the laws have an imperfect understanding of the market and that the process is so slow as to be ineffective in dealing with real problems while often creating unintended consequences. I'm also increasingly aware that in some of these debates a key constituency \u00e2euro;ldquo; media \u00e2euro;ldquo; has an inherent conflict of interest because it's threatened by some of the very platforms it covers. I'm hoping that we don't see knee-jerk, often politically-motivated calls for regulation resulting in laws that would limit the ability of companies to innovate while not really solving the underlying problems. I have little faith that the current US political leadership will get anything meaningful done here without screwing it up, while the bigger threat to US tech currently comes from the EU and its efforts to punish big US tech companies for underpaying taxes and squeezing out local competitors.A Promising FutureI'm inherently an optimist, and that optimism extends to the tech industry and the role of technology in our lives. I'm not naive enough to think that all the issues will merely go away, but on balance I think the positive benefits will be greater than the drawbacks, and humanity as a whole will continue to benefit enormously from the advances that will be made, especially in areas like healthcare, where consumer tech companies are just starting to scratch the surface of what's possible. AI and machine learning bring their own threats and downsides, but I tend to think the more apocalyptic voices here are off the mark, while there could be significant benefits from smarter technology in our lives too.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, November 13th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New China trade uncertainty this morning, President Trump saying phase one of a deal could happen soon. But he also threatened that tariff hikes will be there if no deal is reached.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The push for impeachment -- public hearings kick off today on Capitol Hill. We're taking a look at what to expect, what it could mean for the trade deals that are still awaiting approval.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elsewhere on the Hill, the future of the U.S. economy in focus, investors are waiting on Fed chair Jay Powell's testimony this morning. He will speak with Congress this morning and we will take it live.</p><p>Futures are under pressure this morning. Take a look at markets and we will see the Dow Industrials down 112 points, the S&amp;P futures down 11, and the Nasdaq futures lower by 39.</p><p>The Nasdaq, by the way, closed at a record high yesterday. The S&amp;P 500 hit an historic intraday high but it closed about a quarter point shy of a record close. The Dow Industrials exactly where it started the day, unchanged -- first time that's happened since April of 2014.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mostly lower. Take a look at European indices down across the board. FT 100 down 37, half percent. CAC 40 in Paris down 25. DAX index in Germany down 98.</p><p>Overnight in Asia, continued protests in Hong Kong and concerns that the U.S. could be imposing more tariffs on Chinese goods, as that uncertainty pushing markets lower in Asia. Hang Seng index down almost 2 percent.</p><p>Then this -- Google's push into finance. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting that Google will offer checking accounts. This as it faces a federal inquiry into its gathering of health records which \"The Journal\" broke yesterday and we brought you the story on this program.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning. And joining me to break it all down -- the president of Payne Capital Management Ryan Payne is here; PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle; and the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman. Lots to talk about this morning, guys.</p><p>RYAN PAYNE, PRESIDENT, PAYNE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Oh, yes.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Yes. The investors I think hoping for some news on China tariffs yesterday didn't get it. Unchanged in the U.S., but down in Asia on the threat of maybe more tariffs.</p><p>So this question of does it hurt China more than it hurts us and how much does it hurt either side suggests once again it hurts them more than us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And how much pain can the Chinese take in terms of their economy, in terms of what's going on in Hong Kong?</p><p>Look, the President was very confident yesterday at the New York Economic Club and I think the markets traded down because he didn't make any new news, right. I mean he basically reiterated all of his economic plans but what he did say was we think we're close with the China deal but if not, I'll be putting more tariffs out there.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: The \"but\" is the thing that the market tilted on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And listen, there's been no new news. We know that there's a phase one, part one -- whatever it is. We don't have any details. And I think the market baked that in.</p><p>But if we don't see any details (INAUDIBLE), the market's going to evaporate their confidence.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Which is why we've got some pressure on stocks this morning. We're going to take a look at that coming up.</p><p>But our top story this hour is the first public impeachment hearing happening in just hours. Ambassador Bill Taylor and foreign service officer George Kent will be testifying on Capitol Hill for the first of the public hearings for the impeachment inquiry.</p><p>House Intel Committee chairman Adam Schiff firing off a warning to Republicans to keep the hearings solely focused on the Ukraine controversy and not the Bidens.</p><p>But Congress has a big to-do list. And the impeachment inquiry maybe distracting Democrats from getting it done. President Trump sounded off on that yesterday as well. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We've got the prescription drugs down -- first time in 53 years that prescription drug prices have gone down and if we had help from the Democrats, which we do not have -- you possibly have noticed that -- we would have -- we would be able to cut prescription drugs by 30, 40 and 50 percent.</p><p>The USMCA will create up to half a million American jobs and add at least 1.2 percent more to our total GDP and it should be much higher than that. Yet Democrats in Washington would rather pursue outrageous hoaxes and delusional witch hunts which are going absolutely nowhere. Don't worry about it.</p><p>To pass the USMCA and deliver real stuff for the American workers. Our border is so -- our laws are so bad. Our immigration laws. It's so sad.</p><p>We have what's called loopholes, many loopholes. I could fix them in 15 minutes but the Democrats don't want to fix them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Arizona Congressman, Judiciary Committee member Andy Biggs. Congressman -- it's a pleasure to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ): Good to be with you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So first, I want to get to the impeachment inquiry and what you're expecting from these public hearings. But first, let me get your take on what the president just said in terms of loopholes, in terms of the Democrats not wanting to do the work for the American people.</p><p>You've got a lot of things hanging in the balance right now, don't you?</p><p>BIGGS: Yes, we sure do. I mean there's a lot of bills. He's talked about the drug pricing bill, USMCA, all the things along the border -- amnesty and immigration -- they're not touching those. They're not touching the budget.</p><p>We're going to do another short-term CR here next week. which will be for about a 30-day push. That's a spending bill, you know, just a short-term spending bill, so we don't ever get to the budget.</p><p>So there's a whole lot of things on our plate that we're not touching.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So the government needs to be funded by November 21.</p><p>BIGGS: That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just a couple of weeks away.</p><p>BIGGS: That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's unbelievable.</p><p>BIGGS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. What are you expecting this morning from these first public hearings for this inquiry?</p><p>BIGGS: Well, for the Democrats, they believe Taylor's their home run, and they really hang their hat on the idea that he felt that the president's conversation was outside the policy line. The problem for Taylor, of course, is that he's not a firsthand witness. He has no information himself.</p><p>He's getting -- it sounds like an old double play ball, Evers to Tinkers to Chance -- he doesn't have any information himself. He's getting it from someone else, who got it from someone else, who got it from someone else.</p><p>And so we're going to continue to see that they don't have any firsthand fact witnesses. It's all going to be hearsay. Both Taylor and Kent today have no information other than what they were told, and then they're going to offer their opinions and opine on that.</p><p>FREEMAN: Congressman, James Freeman here at \"The Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>You know, one thing that George Kent does have knowledge of is his concerns during the Obama administration about the Hunter Biden deal in Ukraine. That came up in his deposition.</p><p>Would you expect that Republicans would be asking him about the extent of concerns expressed within the Obama administration about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? And will you be able to get answers?</p><p>Adam Schiff's suggesting this somehow is out-of-bounds to discuss.</p><p>BIGGS: Yes. That should be on the table. It should be everything from Hunter Biden and his relationship with Burisma, the oil and gas company in the Ukraine -- and that dovetails right into the entire Ukraine corruption and how pervasive it is and President Zelensky's promise to change that.</p><p>But Mr. Schiff, as you said, is exactly - exactly what you said. He is indicating that he's going to basically try to confine that and constrain it.</p><p>And don't forget, he's acting kind of as -- he's a witness, but he's also the trier of fact here. He's going to try to object and try to limit the Republicans' direction of questions, is my understanding.</p><p>So this isn't going to be an open and transparent hearing to get to the bottom of all this stuff. This is going to be a way to try to find a post to hang an impeachment hat on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Adam Schiff was very clear. He said look, we don't want the Republicans bringing in any information about the Bidens, asking any questions about the Bidens. We also don't want any questions about the debunked interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>Congressman, I'd like to know what he's referring to when he says debunked, given the fact that we are looking right now at an active criminal investigation ongoing in John Durham's office, and an investigation at the highest levels at the Attorney General.</p><p>So what exactly is he referring to that was debunked?</p><p>BIGGS: Well, who knows what he's referring to. I mean you're exactly right. You've got ongoing investigations with Durham, and I'm just telling you, I've urged the president, I've urged the attorney general -- they've got to start declassifying some of these -- this information and evidence that's laying out there, it would actually totally emasculate this thing.</p><p>I don't know what he thinks is debunked except for this is the same guy who said there was collusion. He still actually believes there was evidence of collusion that Mueller just since missed somehow. And that's -</p><p>BARTIROMO: So -- he believes it or he's just putting smoke out there to muddy the waters. I mean does he actually -- he said for two years, Mitch, that it was in plain sight.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: In plain sight.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How does the chairman of the Intel Committee get away with that?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes. Millions of documents, thousands of interviews and it was in plain sight. Yes. Exactly.</p><p>One of the things I'm interested about, just to go back, Congressman, something you said earlier, which is the cross-examination process. And do you have a sense of how that will go? Because if you have a witness that has second or thirdhand knowledge, but articulates it under direct as about, you know, how they came to understand this. In cross-examination logically you would ferret out that it was secondhand knowledge.</p><p>Do you think there'll be an opportunity for your colleagues to do that in the hearing today?</p><p>BIGGS: Yes, I think so. I mean, that's probably the one area that Mr. Schiff is not going to be able to constrain, is that Taylor himself admitted to Brit Hume that, you know, everything he has is hearsay from other people.</p><p>So that's going to come out in this hearing and it should actually undermine because it's just not fair. American people understand that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Here's the cover of the \"New York Post\" today, guilty, now for the trial.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>So it's like they have their guy, now they just need to find the crime. All right. And I think the \"Post\" did that well.</p><p>Look, the president touted the economy yesterday as well, Congressman -- as advisers to the president reportedly are considering a 15% tax cut for middle class Americans.</p><p>Democrats are not going to be onboard with this. \"The Wall Street Journal\" Editorial Board out with a piece this morning, saying the tax increases to come. It reads in part the following. \"Democrats these days are also proposing to raise the regular income tax rate, the corporate tax rate, the capital gains tax rate, the dividend tax rate, the death tax and the payroll tax rates while creating a new wealth tax, a new financial transactions tax, a new carbon tax and a new pharmaceutical tax even as, they would repeal 100 percent business expensing and the 20 percent income exclusion for so-called pass-through firms. We probably missed a few others.</p><p>But as usual the questions Democrats will not answer: should the top 1% pay half of all income taxes? Two-thirds? Three-quarters? Where does fair share end? If Democrats sweep the 2020 election, we're sure to find out, writes the Editorial Board this morning.</p><p>You talk about a strong economy now, what happens when all those taxes come into play, if a Democrat gets in the White House?</p><p>BIGGS: Well Maria -- you thought the Democrats weren't busy. They are busy. It's just --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.</p><p>BIGGS: Just not where you want them to be busy.</p><p>They will emasculate the economy. The economy -- President Trump's economy has got a solid foundation now for future growth and increasing growth. They don't want that. They have something else in mind.</p><p>And it's the authoritarian nature of socialism that you see in this taxing, because you have to coerce people to transfer their wealth. And that's why they have just -- I don't know how many dozens of taxes you just listed.</p><p>But I mean, they're going after the heart of our economy by taxing. And Reagan used to say it, if you want less of something, go ahead and tax it or regulate it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BIGGS: And that's what they want to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So real quick. Ryan -- you're a markets guy. You look at markets and obviously try to find out where they're going.</p><p>If we were to see Elizabeth Warren as the contender, and if she were to win, what happens with markets?</p><p>PAYNE: I mean, I don't know if it's as big a deal as everyone is making it out to be. Look, let's face it, on Capitol Hill -- all due respect, Congressman -- there's a lot of bureaucracy there.</p><p>Things don't change overnight. And if you look at statistically, markets have done just as well when you've had a Republican in power or a Democrat in power.</p><p>So I think it's kind of noise you need to avoid and look more at the economy, which is just extremely strong right now, and can continue to be strong so -- as the election cycle picks up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So then you look at the backdrop, do all of these taxes -- I just read a litany of tax increases that they're proposing -- does that impact the economy, James?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, because I think it should be noted, when we look at these recent historical periods where, for example, economy had a pretty good run during the Clinton administration -- Bill Clinton and a Republican Congress together ended up restraining taxation, cutting -- actually cutting capital gains rates.</p><p>So I think this would not be -- if it's an Elizabeth Warren, this would not be a Democratic administration like we've seen in a very long time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>FREEMAN: So the -- I think it's a big question. When does that start getting priced in? I mean if you're seeking to avoid a Warren or Sanders presidency, betting markets would say it's a little less likely than it was a few months ago, so that's maybe cause for hope on the investor side.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think you make a good point, because Bill Clinton went to the middle after the first term.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But it's also the combination, Warren and Sanders both talk about more regulation. So it's not just taxation. It's taxation and regulation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point. There is that, too.</p><p>Congressman -- before you go, final word here on the impeachment inquiry. What's the one takeaway we should be watching today when we're watching these hearings?</p><p>BIGGS: Well, you're going to see just a continuation of what we've seen where Mr. Schiff -- everything runs through Mr. Schiff -- and that's not really the due process way. And you're going to see missing at this open hearing, you're going to see missing the president's counsel which is a normal process -- a normal part of the process.</p><p>So this is not a normal impeachment inquiry at all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there.</p><p>Sir, it's good to see you this morning, Congressman. Thank you so much.</p><p>BIGGS: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Andy Biggs.</p><p>Coming up investigating Google. The technology giant faces a legal battle over its collection of personal medical data. This as it enters the world of banking as well.</p><p>Then major regrets -- a new survey takes a look at college graduates and whether they feel their degree was worth it. Wait until you hear this. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Now this, two people in China have been treated for the plague.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK, CORRESPONDENT: Yes, the plague -- Maria. The two cases prompting China's government to warn their citizens to start taking some precautions. The sometimes fatal disease is highly contagious.</p><p>These two patients were from inner Mongolia. And they're currently being treated in a Beijing hospital. Authorities are now taking steps to prevent the plague from spreading there.</p><p>Well, Nike is parting ways with Amazon. The company's ending a pilot program to sell clothing and sneakers on Amazon's site. This as Nike is revamping its retail strategy to boost sales on its own website.</p><p>All of this is coming ahead of the holiday shopping season. Nike partnered with Amazon nearly two years ago in an effort to gain more control over third party sellers and counterfeit products -- a lot of them coming from China, by the way.</p><p>And then there is this. College English majors, you might be kicking yourself this morning. According to a survey by Zip Recruiter, English was listed as the most regretted college major. Respondents described the major as impractical and offering limited job opportunities.</p><p>Other regretted majors -- physical science, because it often requires an advanced degree; education because of low pay; social sciences and communications because they were, quote, too general.</p><p>Now, some of the least regretted majors -- here we go -- computer sciences -- shocker -- business, engineering and health administration and health sciences -- Maria.</p><p>Ok, I'm just going to put this out there. I studied under the school of communications at NAU in Arizona. I think it worked out ok but I don't know, here we go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I majored in economics but then I switched to journalism. Major --</p><p>CASONE: That worked out ok.</p><p>FREEMAN: History.</p><p>BARTIROMO: History.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Accounting and finance.</p><p>PAYNE: Poly Sci -- nothing worked (ph)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>We'll take a break. When we come back, Google is under pressure this morning. The federal of government is looking into the healthcare data collection. Inside that case which the \"Wall Street Journal\" broke.</p><p>Then Hollywood eats healthy, A-list celebrity investing delivering in an organic food service delivering meals right to your front door. We've got the CEO on set later this hour.</p><p>Stay with us for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are drilling down on Google, the technology giant under fire by the federal government this morning over its \"Project: Nightingale\" which we told you about yesterday. This is a partnership with a healthcare company Ascension (ph), that led to personal health data being collected affecting millions of Americans. Lawmakers are concerned over how the information will be used and if it's protected.</p><p>Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge -- good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>So look, everybody -- with Google's history, everybody is concerned about the level of privacy protection. But the statute, the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, expressly permits the healthcare provider to share information with a computer services company for the purpose of characterizing the information and they didn't use A.I. at the time, but it basically is for A.I. purposes.</p><p>Though stated differently, on its face as much as I don't trust Google and I don't want them to have my or anybody else's intimate medical information, on its face it's lawful.</p><p>It's a little ironic to hear the federal government complaining about violations of privacy when of course it is the greatest violator of privacy in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: On the other hand, the senators who complained yesterday raise a legitimate concern. With Google's track record of failing to keep information private, they recently paid $175 million for flailing to keep children's Gmail private.</p><p>One wonders where this is going to go. But yet the very people doing the complaining voted for the act, the law that authorizes this transfer of data.</p><p>So we'll see where it goes. There's no criminal allegation here. The evidence of the violations of privacy are anecdotal, not systemic. But we'll see what happens.</p><p>I'm glad we know about this. Would you use a healthcare provider that you knew was sharing your information with Google?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't think so.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Probably not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't think so, no.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Great.</p><p>FREEMAN: So as you mentioned, the healthcare system is going to use probably some vendor in this space to manage data. I guess a question I did have, reading this story though, and kudos to my colleague's very good reporting, is why did the names, the patient names have to go to Google?</p><p>I would have thought that all the patient information, history, but maybe with anonymized process. They know you as a number but not your name.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right. That is really a good point. There's no reason for Google to have the names. Point. But the fault here is with Ascension. Ascension should go through the time and cost of removing the names from the information they give to Google. Google is the recipient. I suppose Google could go through the expense of blocking out the names.</p><p>But they don't need the names. They'll need ages and they'll need geographic locations in order to plug it into their (INAUDIBLE) -- but they don't need to know who these people are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They want to create new software with all this data.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. But I mean there could be an upside. If it's not abused in terms of them -- if the computer spots a trend in my health or in some test that the doctor didn't, there could be a benefit.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Probably are getting ahead of disease as a result of technology.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You probably don't mind if somebody in your doctor's office looks up your records. You would mind if somebody at Google looked up your records.</p><p>The guy that runs the \"Wall Street Journal\", I heard him on Maria this morning, let me see what's in here about him. They shouldn't have that kind of access.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, they should not have that signed up.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Or they should not have that kind of access.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, they should not have that kind of access.</p><p>PAYNE: Or they shared it with a vendor who shared it with a vendor, who shared next it with a vendor.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They next you know, you're getting ads for a blood pressure machine and everything else.</p><p>PAYNE: It's coming.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And everything else.</p><p>PAYNE: It's coming -- that's absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ads about an MRI that they're selling.</p><p>All right. Let me switch gears and ask you about the Supreme Court hearing a case this week, about the Obama era dreamer immigration policy, this is DACA.</p><p>Despite a sharp divide on the panel, reports say that the justices are leaning towards letting President Trump dismantle the DACA program. Judge -- your thoughts.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, letting President Trump dismantle the DAC program is letting President Trump be President Trump and enforce the laws as they were written.</p><p>Remember the origins of this. President Obama asked the Congress to enact into law permanent protection for DACA. That may be a very good thing to do out of the goodness of his heart and even for economic reasons.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it was an executive order. Congress wasn't doing it.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Congress said no. So he wrote an executive order anyway. The question before the Supreme Court is who writes the laws. Under the constitution, the Congress does not the President. And can a subsequent president invalidate an executive officer (SIC) of his predecessor. It's certain that he can do so.</p><p>Except because this involves 700,000 to 800,000 innocent human beings, the courts have enjoined the President. Some of the courts enjoined the President because they wanted it to go to the Supreme Court. Some of the courts enjoined the President because they thought he was doing the wrong thing.</p><p>But under our system, and I think this is the way the case is going to go from reading the transcript of the oral argument yesterday, Congress writes the laws, not the chief executive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President had tweeted about this recently saying look, we want to undo something that was an executive order that should not have been.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: He is absolutely right to say that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But we're going to come up with a plan, Congress is going to write the law to allow these people to stay.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's what he tweeted the other day.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Great you said that question. Does the President -- if the President wins this case he'd have the authority to begin the deportation proceedings of 800,000. Is he going to do had that? Of course not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: But he's going to use that as a means with which to negotiate to bring the Democrats to the negotiating table on immigration.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. All right. Judge -- great insights as always. Thank you so much.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Pleasure -- guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge Andrew Napolitano there.</p><p>Quick break and then Disney glitches, the company's response after Disney Plus' bumpy launch. What it means for the streaming wars. We're getting into the media next.</p><p>And then Facebook's new way to pay. The social media giant makes possible to send money across its apps. How you can do it. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, November 13th. Your top stories right now, 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>There is some new China trade uncertainty this morning. President Trump says the phase one of a deal could happen soon but he also said that he would put tariff increases in place if no deal is reached.</p><p>The push for impeachment, public hearings are kicking off today. We are taking a look at what to expect, what it could mean for the trade deals that are still waiting for approval.</p><p>Elsewhere on the Hill this morning, the future of the U.S. economy is in focus, investors are awaiting Fed Chair Jay Powell's testimony. We'll take that live for you this morning.</p><p>Futures are under pressure. We are expecting a lower opening for the broader averages as the market pulls back from record highs. Dow Industrials today down 117 points, S&amp;P Futures down 12, the NASDAQ Futures lower by 41.</p><p>The NASDAQ posted its 15th record close of the year yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 hit an historic intraday high but it closed 1-1/4 point shy of a record high. And the Dow finished unchanged, the first time that's happened since April 2014. But all of the indices are hanging out in record territory right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices down across the board. FT-100 down 30 points, CAC Quarante in Paris down 24 and the DAX Index in Germany down 99.</p><p>Continued protests in Hong Kong and concerns that the U.S. could be imposing more tariffs on Chinese goods pushed markets lower in Asia overnight. Worst performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng down 1.8 percent.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, the streaming wars. A bumpy debut for Disney's long awaited streaming service yesterday, Disney Plus. The platform experiencing some glitches during the rollout yesterday. Some users encountering Disney themed error messages, unable to stream movies or T.V. shows. Most issues were resolved however by the end of the day.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Founder and CEO of Activate, Michael Wolf, an expert on all of this. Michael, it's great to see you.</p><p>MICHAEL WOLF, FOUNDER AND CEO, ACTIVATE: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. And I've got with me the Activate Technology and Media Outlook for 2020, a very important must-read in the space. Thank you for that.</p><p>First, let me get your take on the Disney Plus situation yesterday.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, so they had a bump the first day. I think the real issue is that people wanted to watch \"The Mandalorian\", which is the new \"Star Wars\" series, but they'll have everything fixed.</p><p>I mean, the bigger -- the bigger issue is people are asking will Disney unseat Netflix, will people take one -- more than one service. Actually, our forecasts show that today on average Americans have a little over two services, and within three years we expect that the average American is going to be subscribing to five video streaming services.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, five video streams. That's an expense. I mean, I know, what, Disney is $6.99.</p><p>WOLF: Disney is $6.99.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Netflix is $12.99.</p><p>WOLF: $12.99 but what's interesting is Disney is now selling a package which is -- which is Disney Plus, ESPN Plus as well as Hulu and that's $13.00 for the package together. If you were to buy them separately, they're -- it's $18.00.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. So you think people are going to have five different subscriptions?</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's interesting. Tell me more about what you're expecting in terms of going forward. You've got competition rising in the streaming space, Apple T.V. facing mixed reviews as well and your report looks about significant -- looks at significant growth ahead, you write, in terms of this entire space.</p><p>WOLF: Yes. So we expect in the next three years that the overall space is going to add another -- globally is going to add another $300 billion in revenue. So these are going to continue to be very, very -- these are going to be businesses that are going to grow at a fast clip. The -- a lot of the revenue going forward is going to be from end user pay, its going to be from subscriptions, it's not just going to be from advertising.</p><p>Coming back to the streaming services, there are lots of new streaming services out there, so NBC has launched an ad supported one called Peacock. You've got Fox Nation from Fox which is -- which is going to grow very fast. And so, it's not just going to be the biggest streaming services because people want to watch other stuff versus just old shows.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true. Now, Apple reportedly in talks with former HBO Chairman Richard Plepler to sign an exclusive production deal, according to the Wall Street Journal. Plepler oversaw HBO during this really successful days, projects like \"Game of Thrones\", \"Veep\". What do you think about that?</p><p>WOLF: It's a great moment to be a producer of television, because all of these companies are trying to line up originals. Interestingly, the top shows on Netflix, they're -- most of the -- if you look at the top 10, they're shows like \"The Office\" and \"NCIS\". It's not the newest stuff that people are watching. Maybe over time they will but each of these companies is going to spend billions of dollars on producing as well as licensing old shows.</p><p>BARTIROMO: On social media you write that 41 percent on average video captures the largest share of attention of the daily 12 hours of internet and media consumption. You've said that for a long time. Video is where people -- that attracts most users.</p><p>WOLF: The average person in this country is watching five hours a day of video. And the what's -- and a lot of that is continues to be television. It's sports, it's news, it's programs. But the fastest growing portion of that is going to be digital video and it's going to be online.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And tell me about the super fans, who's using the most and where those numbers go.</p><p>WOLF: When you look at each of the major businesses and entertainment and media, you find that a small number of people are counting for most of the viewership, most of the usership. And so -- and video games, it's about 15 percent of all users that account for all the usage and all the money that's spent and you can see this in every single one of the major businesses.</p><p>So what we're going to see is these companies not going after just everybody but also going after those biggest super fans.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've said that the number of sites will grow. I mean, tell me about the growth and where does -- you said that people are looking at selective places, leaving Facebook behind, the amount of time spent on Facebook each month down 26 percent since 2017. You're projecting by 2023 the average number of social media accounts each person will have will double.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: From five to 10? Wow.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, because there's a lot of -- there are a lot of very, very narrow social networks. So there's one, Ravelry, it has 25 million users, it's just people knitting. There's 80 million people are used by a so -- using a social network called Wattpad which is all around fan fiction. There are million people using a social network called High There which is just for people who are smoking cannabis.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>WOLF: So they're going to add these social networks and they're going to stick with Facebook but they're just going to spend less time on the biggest ones.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How interesting. Tell me more about the 2020 Media and Technology Outlook and what you think is going to be happening. You also find major growth in e-sports, in sports betting which we've already seen real growth there.</p><p>WOLF: Sports betting is going to be a huge phenomenon. It's going to real -- what's going to look like, it's going to look more like financial trading markets. Because we're going to see people, it's not just individuals. It's we're going to see financial institutions really consolidating bets. It requires a lot of real-time information and it's likely to transform -- we expect that sports betting is going to be within four years about $150 billion business, up from just a couple billion in this last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And will that mean consolidation in this space? Are you expecting a lots of deals as media gets further into sports betting?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, we're already seeing some of -- some of the deals happen, so you're seeing the major U.K. companies buying in. We see major media companies, so Fox has got Fox Bet. I think we're going to expect to see every major technology and media company one way or the other into the sports betting business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And also video games.</p><p>WOLF: Video games growing unbelievably fast, the fastest growing business across all of these will be within four years, $150 billion in revenue and this is just in the U.S. and people are spending so much time.</p><p>An average video gamer can spend -- can spend up to 60 hours a month just playing one game. And a lot of that is also casual games which are on mobile where you can play -- you can play for five minutes at a time. But video games are taking up a greater part of people's time and we think it's not -- it's not going to necessarily replace video. It's going to be additive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me about the demographics of the -- of the user today that you're referring to. I know you mentioned super fans a lot in your report. But who is the person behind some of these growth stories?</p><p>WOLF: Well, certainly the super fans it doesn't necessarily mean that they really limit themselves to one age group. So everyone thinks about video games as being -- they think about it being millennials. It's not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's not. You're right.</p><p>WOLF: It's -- I mean, you look at a game like Red Dead Redemption which last year had an opening weekend of $750 million. This is -- this is a much broader group of people. And in a lot of cases they're still playing on a console.</p><p>The most important trend in video gaming is going to be cloud gaming. So instead of having to own a console or playing a game on one platform, you're going to play it on your phone, you're going to play it on your iPad and your T.V. as well as your console.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Interesting.</p><p>WOLF: And that's another thing that's going to make this business explode and at the same time it's going to mean a lot more usage of video games.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real quick before you go, beneficiaries of all of these -- of all of these trends, whether its video games, sports betting and obviously what's happening with social media.</p><p>WOLF: It's going to be the big entertainment companies, it's going to be people like Verizon who are going to carry, whether it's sports betting or video games. We're going to see the emergence of the Chinese companies; these companies like Tencent in China have huge lead in casual video games. And we're going to see a lot of new companies come out of nowhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot of new deals.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And perhaps spinouts.</p><p>WOLF: Oh, we're going to see spinouts. We should see a lot of deal activity in the next couple years. It's not just consolidation of companies. It's going to be new companies coming along that will merge into the biggest companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Michael, it's great to get your insight.</p><p>WOLF: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Michael Wolf is the Founder of Activate.</p><p>Coming up, Google and Facebook's new battle, the technology giants diving into the world of banking. We're going to take a look at the details of these new services when we come back.</p><p>And then, Gwyneth Paltrow's choice when she's hungry. The A-lister investing in a company that makes snacking healthy. The CEO is here on set and he'll join me.</p><p>And then don't forget to ask Maria. Be sure to send me your questions on Instagram and on Twitter. I'll be answering them this Friday and every Friday. We want to hear from you. So please send me your questions. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Facebook and Google diving into the world of banking now. Deirdre Bolton is covering the story this morning, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Yes, all about data, getting more of it. So tech companies certainly want it. They want to be able to grow in areas such as financial services, so Facebook has this new function called Facebook Pay and it's a new payment service. It lets users send and receive money across all the apps, so Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp.</p><p>So this is essentially Facebook's version of Venmo, Google Wallet, Apple Pay. You just transfer money directly from your bank account or your credit card.</p><p>So really important point here, it is still within the banking and credit card system. So you know, they accept most major credit cards. You can actually even connect to a PayPal account.</p><p>Facebook Pay now available in the U.S. on Facebook and Facebook Messenger, Insta, WhatsApp come at a later date. But one analyst that I was messaging with said earlier, this is Facebook's move forward while this new digital cryptocurrency project Libra is just mired in just a lot of scrutiny.</p><p>Also, Facebook is trying to just do this unifying thread at a time when some big voices are calling to break up the company. A little preemptive strike perhaps on Facebook's part.</p><p>Essentially, the one area that they could have a lot of pushback is if you buy a baseball glove on Facebook marketplace, you may actually see an ad for a baseball bat. So essentially Facebook is in still in some way going to figure out how to sell your data. As we know they've had a disastrous two years in protecting data.</p><p>Another sign that tech is coming for finance, you had the Wall Street Journal reporting that Google is going to be offering checking accounts. Project code named Cache, so it's in partnership with Citi and a Credit Union at Stanford University.</p><p>So, Maria, Google is going to leave the financial plumbing and compliance if you like to Citi and there's Credit Union because it doesn't have a banking license anyway. I guess I should (INAUDIBLE) and it's similar to what Apple did with Goldman Sachs. Regulators are obviously going to have a lot to say because everybody is fairly anxious, especially with what we talked about in the healthcare space.</p><p>But bottom line is, big tech is coming for every single industry, financial services is today's story.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Does Facebook have plans for a credit card?</p><p>BOLTON: Not that I know of -- not that I know of. But this is -- so I think this is the two routes, right. This first part is we're going to work with the credit card companies on this and therefore nobody can really freak out. And then the second lane is Libra and then we saw all those credit card partners actually drop out. I don't think the banking industry is just going to sit back and like, you know, and smoke cigarettes while Facebook takes all their business.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Because I'm thinking about the data side of this -- I'm thinking about the data side of this. And if you get the credit card piece of it tied in, now you know where they're shopping in addition to --</p><p>BOLTON: That's the point. This is all -- and it's -- and actually --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, it's a big data grab.</p><p>BOLTON: -- regulators are even though there's Google checking account is quite a small experiment, for regulators they're going to push back on that as well especially with Google's because Google as we know knows so much -- actually, Google know more about us than Facebook that's sort of a fact.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: But they say based on they know what we make, they know where we go, they know what even locations you're searching for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they know your inner most secrets because it's what you're Googling.</p><p>BOLTON: No, I mean, this is really -- we're in a new age. So we have to kind of decide, it's always the same argument, right? It's privacy versus convenience.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I'm skeptical. I don't know how you guys feel. I mean, how easy it is for some of these sites to get hacked and then your money's on the line.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, for Facebook, this is a huge -- I mean, it's been two years in this very ugly P.R. war, especially obviously starting with Cambridge Analytica, the fact that an unknown -- well, I shouldn't say unknown. An unauthorized third party got all of this data, so that is the concern.</p><p>McKinsey did this study and it found that people are more comfortable -- they're the most comfortable with Amazon and Apple than Google and Facebook. It's like a bunch of other companies you've never heard of and then Facebook.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then we've got healthcare info, money info, amazing. Deirdre, thank you. Really important story there. Deirdre Bolton. We will see you later.</p><p>Coming up, Serena approved, snacks good enough for one of the world's greatest athletes available for delivery to your door. Daily Harvest CEO is on set, next up. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Healthy food delivered right to your front door. Daily Harvest is a web based direct to consumer service offering just that, high quality organic foods like frozen smoothies, harvest bowls, soups. The startup raising more than $43 million during three rounds of funding with A-list celebrities investing in the company as well.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of Daily Harvest, Rachel Drori. And Rachel it's great to have you. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>RACHEL DRORI, FOUNDER AND CEO, DAILY HARVEST: Hi, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations first, how did you start? I mean, we've got -- our audience is full of entrepreneurs, small business owners. They want to really know how you did it. So how tough was it to start this company, first?</p><p>DRORI: I mean, any startup is a lot of work. I started the business, you know, very humbly in like my backyard in a commercial kitchen in New York City. Delivering everything in my car, made the website, created the packaging. And you know, just started to grow from there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How did you find money to do this?</p><p>DRORI: So I tried to raise money early on. I was unable to do that. So I boot strapped the business, it was incredibly capital efficient, employee number one, employee number two. And you know, made sure that I had an objective story from which to raise money and then I was able to raise money --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And plant based diets are getting more and more popular. Tell us about Daily Harvest.</p><p>DRORI: Yes, so we make the food that you know you should eat, that you want to eat but you've never had the time to eat. We deliver as you mentioned, frozen food, clean, organic and refined, unprocessed, deliver it directly to your door.</p><p>And you know, we think that everybody should be eating more fruits and vegetables. Hippocrates said, let food be thy medicine. We've stopped doing that. We've traded care for convenience. So we're trying to make whole unrefined vegetables, fruits convenient.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Love it.</p><p>PAYNE: You were talking a little bit about how like Beyond Meat has this - - it doesn't have the same health, you know, that your food does. It's a big difference.</p><p>DRORI: Yes, I mean, look, Beyond Meat, it serves a purpose. But it's hyper processed, it's hyper refined.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>DRORI: And you know, I just don't think the body knows how to process foods that are of that profile. So we really focus on the things that nature gives us. And just make them really convenient.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Rachel, we've had other women entrepreneurs on the show who started businesses. Is it a challenge as a woman to raise money when you're in the sea of venture capital types that generally are dealing with men?</p><p>DRORI: Yes, I mean, look, I don't -- I don't know if it's a male, female thing. What I really -- what I think is the issue is that nobody understood what I was trying to create because they weren't the target market.</p><p>So you know, it's more about like who is -- who is making those subjective decisions and how they're seeing it fit into their life. If they can't see something fitting into their life, they can't understand that they can't get behind it. And I certainly had that issue early on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And by the way, you got some heavy hitter investors, Serena Williams, Gwyneth Paltrow, Bobby Flay, all are investing in this company, James.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes and I'm wondering, so if I'm the user, this is a banana, cashew, vanilla bean, smoothie. So it comes frozen and then am I -- am I eating it like that or am I throwing it to the microwave for a few seconds?</p><p>DRORI: So everything is slightly different. But for our smoothies, you open it up; you see all the whole real ingredients. You add your milk of choice, it could be almond milk, you know, somebody else might like dairy, somebody else might like -- we don't judge. And then you pour it in a blender and then, you know, 10 seconds later, 20 seconds later you have an incredible smoothie. That one happens to tastes like chocolate -- mint chocolate chip ice cream.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh my God. I love it. Rachel, great to have you. Thanks so much.</p><p>DRORI: Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congrats to you, Rachel Drori.

Stakeholders and executives can only tell if they follow the yellow brick road of due diligence and encourage rainbow diversity throughout their organization, including the board. Join Sandy Erez in pulling back the curtain on theTheranosdebacle - before you set your sights on your next corporate wizard.Everybody loves a medical breakthrough. Our hearts race (especially if we need a cure for arrhythmia) as we imagine the best minds in health care technology clearing brambles on the winding road to better health. </p><p>Perhaps, this is the long-awaited miracle that will cure Auntie Em's and Uncle Henry's creaky ailments or curb the bizarre behavior of poor, demented Miss Gulch. The universal quest for health is red hot. So, it's a no-brainer and no wonder that investors would put their faith - and millions of dollars - into backing a medical technology 'drama' that was sure to appeal to a wide-eyed (and paying) audience. What could possibly go haywire in an ethical society of nerdy do-gooders? Everything! despite the edge-of-the-seat trailers, a sterling cast and more turns and twists than a flying monkey, this flick was a flop! Join me in examining why this fateful production that was slated to gross millions ended up in a heap like a farmhouse in a tornado. (Warning: spoilers ahead.)Plot Summary: Pay No Attention to the Man Behind the CurtainOur story begins in 2003 with our perky young heroine, Elizabeth Holmes, on a crusade to spawn an inexpensive medical testing device requiring just one drop of blood for accurate disease analysis. Spinning a heart-wrenching story involving a dead relative and an acute fear of needles, Holmes manages to tug at the heartstrings of investors and media alike. Enamored with the next big tech icon - a female one at that - they wave their money wands and fill her coffers with over $700 million. And just like that - voila! - Theranos, the upstart start-up, magically appears from the Wizard's black hat. In the next scene, potions are concocted in the Theranos castle and all seems to be well. But behind the scenes, employees in the dungeon are feverishly slaving to get a working prototype that would meet regulatory inspections deadlines and be ready for drug trial deals with pharmaceutical kings such as GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. As the endless monotonous scene drags on, the sands of time slip through the hourglass - with no working product either on site or in sight. As rumors of technological failures and cover-ups start to seep out to the press, blood chills in the veins of regulators, investors and even employees. Skies darken, and by 2015, the warmth of sunny valley media hype changes to whistleblowing thunder and whipping winds. Sadly, by the time the worst of the storm had passed, the lightning had illuminated Theranos as the outright fraud it was.The show closes with Holmes charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud, carrying a potential sentence of 20 years in prison. For Holmes, getting home over the rainbow looked to be a longer journey than ever (unless that home is San Quentin jail).Cast of Characters: Are You a Good Witch or a Bad Witch?The cast remained fairly loyal to the original characters, though with some quirky deviations. In this sequel, there was more than just one person without a brain (the venture capitalists, investors, the board,the public), a few without a heart (those who kept going while knowingly risking lives) and just a handful with courage enough to play the part of the whistleblowers. The plot takes a sudden surprising turn when Wall Street Journal investigative reporter John Carreyrou and former Theranos employees Erika Cheung andTyler Shultz take the stage and uncover the imposter. Spoiler warning: One ingenious casting shocker was that the part of the Wizard wasn't played by a human being. Technology got the role instead \u2014 and delivered an Oscar-worthy performance as an amorphous enigma that never stepped from behind the curtain because it never existed. And the grand, didn't-see-it-coming plot twist is when we understand that Dorothy from Kansas isn't an innocent wunderkind lost in the woods at all. She's the wicked witch herself! Oh, and about the dog: Holmes' dog, Balto, as Toto the dog just didn't cut it.Creative Aspects: I've Got a Feeling We're Not in Kansas AnymoreThe Wizard of Oz stunned and captivated its 1939 American audience with its magical flights of fancy, serving as a soothing panacea for post-depression ills in a brink-of-war era of discontent. And one single moment of cinematic genius stood out above them all: the moment the darling protagonist (Dorothy) steps out of her lackluster existence, effervescing into the vibrantly hued bubble called Oz. This seamless transition from black and white to full color within the same scene stunned moviegoers and cinema critics alike, appearing to be a technological breakthrough in filming technique. In fact, the producers capitalized on the element of surprise to create an unforgettably powerful illusion where dreams born in dry dust could miraculously come alive.This 'wow' effect led viewers to toss logic into the roaring winds of the tornado and fly over the rainbow with their heroine, forever invested in her happiness. Sound familiar? Regarding the Theranos sequel, just switch out the words 'the Land of Oz' for 'Silicon Valley' and 'Dorothy' for 'Elizabeth' with stock market IPO gold at the end of the rainbow.Production: Poppies, Poppies You're Getting SleepyOne of the reasons the Theranos saga dragged on so long is that supporting actors (the board, advisors and investors) stumbled with their lines and missed their cues. Maybe it had to do with the spell cast by U.S. diagnostic-lab industry crystal ball projections of $70 billion in annual sales. Apparently, the vision of unending green dollars, spread out before them like a field of narcotic poppies, lulled them into sleepy stupidity. In fact, the board (who had no knowledge of medical or any other technology), should have been fired from the actors' guild. They forgot their critical role in conducting financial audits or insisting on peer review research to validate the technology they were pushing out to the public. Shame on them for shirking their duties after being given such important roles in the production. Additionally, one must note the glaring absence of a board diversity policy (maybe that document had been eaten by Balto), as the board constituents were all the same color and age, with similar credentials. The producers should have learned a lesson from the original film: stick to munchkins, lollipop kids and horses of a different color. Then maybe there would have been a chance for differing opinions and a vast array of knowledge at the boardroom table.Critical Response: Surrender Elizabeth!Even with all the special effects, the Theranos remake was a crushing disappointment, both financially and critically. But let me give you a movie critic's insider tip: There wasn't actually a technological breakthrough in the original Oz, either. You see, unbeknownst to 1939 audiences, the 'revolutionary' color transition was nothing more than an illusion. Producers realized they could pull off the transition trick by painting half the set in sepia tones, the other half in color. When drab Dorothy's acting double opens the door to a brilliant Oz, there was no cinematic feat at all \u2014 just an extension of the color palette that fooled the eye and the audience. Technicolor was an emerging technique at the time, which made everyone easy to convince. So, if a dearth of 'real' technology wasn't the clincher, what's the reason for the success discrepancy between the two movies? The answer is as plain and simple as the fabric of Dorothy's gingham dress: Evil winning out over ethical good. The protagonist in the Theranos sequel duped an audience that believed with all their hearts that their heroine was in search of an ethics-based dream - be it love of family or better health. By the time the credits rolled, this darling of the media, formerly valued at $10 billion, had suffered a corporate meltdown as a dramatic as the demise of the Wicked Witch of the West - to the delight of the watching crowd. Ironically enough, if Elizabeth were both Dorothy and the Wicked Witch, she actually killed herself using the cinematic symbol of purity and life. You guessed it: Water. I guess one tiny drop DOES makes a difference (the Theranos slogan).Rating ...commendation: Never Having to Say Goodbye Too Soon (Another Theranos Slogan)The last scene in the original Oz production was poignant and tearful for me as a child. Imagine saying goodbye forever to the people you love - even if they are a scarecrow, a tin man and a lion. Luckily for us, this is 2019 and not 1939, when unicorns and crystal balls were figments of the imagination existing only on the silver screen. Today, we have biotech companies so innovative that we find ourselves falling for a sleight of hand or a trick of the eye rather than insisting on slow and plodding medical research. We find no need to doubt those wizards living in the valley, those purveyors of magic - they must be beyond reproach since they're working to save the people we love! Surely, we tell ourselves, the aggressive corporate marketing and media hype around the latest cure is more than just a passing viral marketing infection. I give this movie a big fat zero. If the prognosis for any health care startup promises a long and healthy life (and perhaps a fat bank account), shouldn't we all be flying down that yellow-brick road to buy a ticket to the premiere? I don't think so. I wouldn't see a movie like that again. Unless, of course, I got hit on the head by the flying window of opportunity. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-CCOI1297141562670362073251763700172</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CCOI-129714</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHT-G411-JCMN-Y513-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1655\"/><timeReceived>11:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Corporate Compliance Insights</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC00029XL</classCode><className>PFIZER A/S (NORWAY)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001QM1</classCode><className>GLAXOSMITHKLINE PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC5122 DRUGS, DRUG PROPRIETARIES, &amp;

The increase in their value, almost $2trn, exceeds the capitalisation of the entire German stockmarket. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are each worth more than $1trn each. So much for the consumer and regulatory 'techlash' that was supposed to lay them low. But our cover leader[1] argues that the threat to big tech firms has not gone away. </p><p>The bull run reflects investors' belief that the tech giants' opportunities are far from exhausted; our special report[2] points out that much of the economy is still to digitise. As upheaval disrupts the profitability of more non-tech firms and more workers' livelihoods, the eventual backlash is likely to be bigger. Recession, when it strikes,[3] will fuel new resentments, as the big tech firms\u2014by far the biggest investors in corporate America\u2014slash investment and squeeze suppliers.Not even mighty tech firms are immune to the economic effects of the coronavirus epidemic. On February 17th Apple warned investors that it would miss its revenue guidance for the quarter. Although daily numbers of confirmed new infections in China are falling, restrictions on movement remain strict[4]. The virus is hurting both Apple's manufacturing and its sales: many migrant workers[5] have not returned to their jobs with its Chinese contractors, and China is the second-biggest market for iPhones. In fact, Apple's troubles in China go beyond covid-19[6]. Its manufacturing base in China is exposed to the Sino-American conflict over trade and technology. Sales of iPhones in China have been falling. And in a country where the state desires control of information and data, Appls may struggle to make up the shortfall by selling services.Some people think Frankfurt is a dull city. How can that be, when it boasts not merely one central bank, but two? Worryingly, the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank have fallen out[7]. Before the euro was created, financial markets hung on the Buba's every act. The ECB was created in its image and was at first heavily influenced by German economic doctrine. But since the euro area's sovereign-debt crisis the Bundesbank's influence has drained away and relations have soured. Its austere anti-inflationary philosophy has come into conflict with the ECB's efforts to prop up growth by sending interest rates negative and buying bonds. German public opinion has turned against the ECB. (Germany's sluggish growth\u2014weaker than France's[8]\u2014doesn't help the national mood.) Our leader[9]argues that Christine Lagarde's arrival at the ECB, and her promised review of monetary policy, provides an opportunity for a fresh start. The Bundesbank, after all, represents the zone's biggest economy and remains a powerful intellectual and institutional force. Helpfully, the Bundesbank's boss, Jens Weidmann, is already sounding less uncompromising.Rodrigo Duterte was elected president of the Philippines in 2016 promising a war on drug dealers and other miscreants: 'If they resist, kill them all.' He has been true to his word. The country's human-rights commission estimates that 27,000 extra-judicial killings have taken place since he came to office. They have done nothing to dent Mr Duterte's popularity[10]; nor, among women, has his sexism; nor, in an overwhelmingly Catholic country, have his blasphemy or insults to the pope. Other aspects of his likely legacy (he is constitutionally bound to step down in 2022) are also troubling. Despite purporting to be an outsider, he has not brought the elite-uprooting change in Philippine politics that he promised. Indeed, his daughter is his successor as mayor of the southern city of Davao and potentially as president.Justin Trudeau was due to visit Barbados this week, to ask Caribbean leaders to support Canada's bid for a seat on the UN Security Council. Instead the Canadian prime minister was in Ottawa, for talks on how to halt protests against a gas pipeline[11]. The pipe, which is under construction, will go through land traditionally belonging to the Wet'suwet'en, a First Nations people. Demonstrators promising to 'shut down Canada' have blocked roads and railways, some far from the pipeline itself. Mr Trudeau is in a bind, having promised to promote reconciliation with indigenous people, protect the environment\u2014and promote economic growth.

The increase in their value, almost $2trn, exceeds the capitalisation of the entire German stockmarket. Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are each worth more than $1trn each. So much for the consumer and regulatory \"techlash\" that was supposed to lay them low. But our cover leader argues that the threat to big tech firms has not gone away. The bull run reflects investors' belief that the tech giants' opportunities are far from exhausted; our special report points out that much of the economy is still to digitise. As upheaval disrupts the profitability of more non-tech firms and more workers' livelihoods, the eventual backlash is likely to be bigger. Recession, when it strikes, will fuel new resentments, as the big tech firms--by far the biggest investors in corporate America--slash investment and squeeze suppliers.</p><p>Not even mighty tech firms are immune to the economic effects of the coronavirus epidemic. On February 17th Apple warned investors that it would miss its revenue guidance for the quarter. Although daily numbers of confirmed new infections in China are falling, restrictions on movement remain strict. The virus is hurting both Apple's manufacturing and its sales: many migrant workers have not returned to their jobs with its Chinese contractors, and China is the second-biggest market for iPhones. In fact, Apple's troubles in China go beyond covid-19. Its manufacturing base in China is exposed to the Sino-American conflict over trade and technology. Sales of iPhones in China have been falling. And in a country where the state desires control of information and data, Appls may struggle to make up the shortfall by selling services.</p><p>Some people think Frankfurt is a dull city. How can that be, when it boasts not merely one central bank, but two? Worryingly, the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank have fallen out. Before the euro was created, financial markets hung on the Buba's every act. The ECB was created in its image and was at first heavily influenced by German economic doctrine. But since the euro area's sovereign-debt crisis the Bundesbank's influence has drained away and relations have soured. Its austere anti-inflationary philosophy has come into conflict with the ECB's efforts to prop up growth by sending interest rates negative and buying bonds. German public opinion has turned against the ECB. (Germany's sluggish growth--weaker than France's--doesn't help the national mood.) Our leaderargues that Christine Lagarde's arrival at the ECB, and her promised review of monetary policy, provides an opportunity for a fresh start. The Bundesbank, after all, represents the zone's biggest economy and remains a powerful intellectual and institutional force. Helpfully, the Bundesbank's boss, Jens Weidmann, is already sounding less uncompromising.</p><p>Rodrigo Duterte was elected president of the Philippines in 2016 promising a war on drug dealers and other miscreants: \"If they resist, kill them all.\" He has been true to his word. The country's human-rights commission estimates that 27,000 extra-judicial killings have taken place since he came to office. They have done nothing to dent Mr Duterte's popularity; nor, among women, has his sexism; nor, in an overwhelmingly Catholic country, have his blasphemy or insults to the pope. Other aspects of his likely legacy (he is constitutionally bound to step down in 2022) are also troubling. Despite purporting to be an outsider, he has not brought the elite-uprooting change in Philippine politics that he promised. Indeed, his daughter is his successor as mayor of the southern city of Davao and potentially as president.</p><p>Justin Trudeau was due to visit Barbados this week, to ask Caribbean leaders to support Canada's bid for a seat on the UN Security Council. Instead the Canadian prime minister was in Ottawa, for talks on how to halt protests against a gas pipeline. The pipe, which is under construction, will go through land traditionally belonging to the Wet'suwet'en, a First Nations people. Demonstrators promising to \"shut down Canada\" have blocked roads and railways, some far from the pipeline itself. Mr Trudeau is in a bind, having promised to promote reconciliation with indigenous people, protect the environment--and promote economic growth.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y8F-0C41-F03B-T3NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">251202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"753\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Economist Newspapers, NA, Incorporated All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economist.Com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37727\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 21, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC00091PQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

They sounded less like customers and more like Uber supporters, like this was a football match between Uber and the government regulator.</p><p>Interesting. And potentially valuable.</p><p>How do you create the conditions necessary to convert dispassionate, price-comparing, review-reading customers to passionate supporters? Supporters who'll defend your brand against all threats, real and perceived? What a powerful force for customer growth and retention. My guess is the same narratives that define a sporting allegiance also work for startup brands.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Be different, from a long way off</emphasis></p><p>It helps if you're obviously externally different to your competitors, so much so that your customers can be separated from your competitor's customers at a distance.</p><p>If your customers can identify those not-like-them from a distance, they (like sports team supporters) can tell themselves apart from the 'enemy' in time to ensure they can maintain some separation. If you get too close to the enemy, you begin to realise how much you actually have in common, so prejudices are more easily maintained if you're keeping your distance.</p><p>If you're marketing one brand of smartphone against another, nobody can tell whether you're an Android fan or an iOS fan until you pull your smartphone out of your pocket. That's an issue.</p><p>Unless, of course, you're an Apple supporter wearing those easily-identifiable white Apple earbuds that have remained essentially the same through many generations of both earbud and in-ear product lines. The latest earbuds shipping with an iPhone 5s are easily identifiable as the progeny of the first earbuds that shipped with the very first iPod. Even when Apple introduced a colour range for iPods and then iPhones, the earbuds remained available only in one colour. Accidental? I think not.</p><p>Uber customers are potentially very different. When everyone else at the bar is glancing around wondering how hard it's going to be to hail a cab, and where they should start walking to, the Uber customer is still relaxed and casual at the bar\u200a-\u200athe iPhone app and push notification will let them know when the Uber car is approaching and they can waft out the door and straight in the town car.</p><p>Same at the destination\u200a-\u200aa taxi pulls over in a no-standing zone for what seems customer is futzing around with cash or credit card transactions. An Uber customer wafts out the door of their town car apparently without paying at all, safe in the knowledge the Uber platform will bill them a fair price when it notices customer and car have parted ways.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Uniform your supporters</emphasis></p><p>Fierce though their allegiances are (and even though Apple includes an Apple sticker with every product it sells) you don't see a lot of branding on customers or their cars in the technology industry.</p><p>You can be pretty certain most people wearing a tech brand either work for the company behind the brand or have just attended an event where the branded gear was handed out.</p><p>I think that's partly because in tech the product itself is often all the branding you need\u200a-\u200aany noob can tell the difference between an Apple MacBook and a Dell CrapBook.</p><p>But I think it's also because in tech we're pretty sure we'd be helping a massively profitable corporation become more massively profitable by wearing its branded tees. Football teams are amongst the most successful corporations in the world though, so why don't fans of Manchester United feel like they're being exploited for corporate profit?</p><p>I think it's because the central narrative of, say, Google is \"two smart nerdy guys get lucky with their first business out of school and are billionaires in a few years\" whereas the central narrative of all successful sporting teams is, \"This is a constant battle, we're on a razor's edge. We train ourselves to exhaustion, we devote our lives to the game, we give everything we have to every game we play, and if we don't we will be defeated.\"</p><p>That observation is supported by the higher frequency of supporter uniforms amongst underdog, challenger tech brands. The little team at Aussie startup Bugcrowd (disclosure: I'm an investor) sends out a few tees to their favourite customers and not only do people wear them, but they usually post pics to their social media or blog. Bugcrowd customers wear their Bugcrowd tees to big tech security conventions because they're in the minority; they're the outsiders; they're the marginalised, non-corporate misfits in tech security. They want to find each other and grow stronger through being together - like sports team supporters at an away game.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brand without logos</emphasis></p><p>A new Manchester United supporter is joining a worldwide community of millions with a heritage going back generations. They know what it means to be a supporter and who their community expects them to be. They'll wear the team's brand with confidence because the last thing a football team ever does is dramatically change what it stands for and who it represents. If a team moves to a new city, takes on a foreign owner, or moves upmarket, it's a really, really big issue and generally a last resort.</p><p>In tech, even where we have a decade of cultural history to draw upon, it's usually included several dramatic shifts in direction and character. More tech companies get acquired or fail in five years than IPO. Sometimes it's a last resort, but more often it's the nature of the industry to change rapidly to seek new opportunities and technologies.</p><p>That constant change means a supporter isn't so certain exactly which community they're joining. They're not so ready to wear your brand.</p><p>But they might be prepared to wear a t-shirt like Bugcrowd's, which mainly features a tech security in-joke (\"My other computer is your computer\"). If you can brand the merchandise with something that relates to the community they're part of, rather than the brand of your tech company, you're going to see better results.</p><p>They might be prepared to wear a tee or hoodie in a brand colour if you feel you can own that brand colour over time, and they may be prepared to wear the brand if it's small and subtle. They might be interested in something truly unique\u200a-\u200anot just branded but completely new-like a new take on scarves, or hats, or jackets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It's not a numbers game</emphasis></p><p>On the playing field of a sporting stadium, I'm sure it feels like the team with the most fans has an advantage. But remember, this is not about the team, it's about the supporters. When trying to turn your customers into fanatic supporters, it's not a numbers game, it's an allegiance game. In the stadium stands, it's the supporters of the underdog team who are most likely to shout louder, try harder, and band together in unity.</p><p>So when you're planning your supporter merchandise, don't be an economist\u200a-\u200adon't decide to produce the maximum amount of merchandise at the lowest cost. Don't keep it all in a warehouse, only bring it to trade shows, and then employ tradeshow trash to hand it out to every stranger to happens to wander by.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tradeshow trash</emphasis></p><p>Tradeshow trash don't represent your customer community. Lowest-cost scratchy Chinese cotton tees don't make any customer feel like you care about their support. And seeing them being handed out to people who are clearly not supporters is the last straw in supporter alienation.</p><p>Instead, produce a limited quantity of high-quality merchandise. Make customers earn the right to wear it\u200a-\u200anot by tweeting about how awesome your products are but by really relating to your community\u200a-\u200ahelping contribute to FAQs, helping other customers with a question, volunteering to host a customer meetup. Make other customers aspire to get one too.</p><p>Every team's supporter community has a small set of hard-core, diehard fans at its very centre, and when you begin creating a supporter base for your tech startup brand, the first people to recruit are a small group of time-rich, no-friend, slightly mad customers looking for a chance to be the hard-core, diehard fans at the centre of a new team.</p><p>Uber Melbourne, by the way, didn't give any of us tees at the party. Maybe they knew we hadn't earned it and hopefully it knows we're way too cool to wear it ... yet.</p><p>Alan Jones is an ex-Yahoo product guy, <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/startmate\">@startmate</url><url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/pollenizer\">@pollenizer</url>investor/mentor, and co-founder of <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/thenewagencyAU\">@thenewagencyAU</url>.</p><p>Image credit: Flickr/shimgray</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\"/><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SSMART2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CGC-NHB1-F0NT-H19M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388437</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1607\"/><timeReceived>2:31 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>StartUpSmart</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50626\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>June 20, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

(OTCQB: SSFT) is a leader in AI and data engineering. The following is a brief review of 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2019 marked the completion of Sonasoft's transformation into a world leader in AI and data engineering. The driving force for this transformation was a series of acquisitions. Together, these acquisitions ensure that Sonasoft can offer complete AI solutions for customers in any industry. Looking ahead to 2020, data engineering and AI will be key drivers of revenue expansion for Sonasoft. Central to this will be NuGene, one of the most powerful unified AI platforms in the world.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unified AI platforms</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recently, unified AI platforms have been in the news. eBay is the latest big tech company to announce that they have developed their own platform in-house. A unified AI platform allows you to apply AI on-demand to any business problem you might have. Previously, each problem required a specific model to be developed by a data scientist. This process can easily take months. These platforms cut this down to days and are able to tackle much more diverse problems.</p><p>Most unified AI platforms take pre-processed data and try to extract narrow features from it. They are inherently biased because a human has filtered the data they see. Furthermore, this data is simply a snapshot in time. The models produced by such a system are fine, but they aren't always as robust as they should be, and in complex scenarios, they can break down. Google DeepMind offers an alternative approach, relying on complex deep learning algorithms to allow it to outperform humans in many tasks. However, DeepMind requires massive computing power that is well beyond the reach of most companies. In contrast, NuGene allows companies of any size to get the benefits of a unified AI platform.</p><p>NuGene stands apart for three reasons. Firstly, it can take in data in any format and understands the importance of time series. This allows it to incorporate historical time trends along with current data. Secondly, it mimics how a human works to learn and solve problems. It looks for patterns in the data, forms hypotheses and then, uniquely, tests these for causation. Finally, it runs thousands of ML models to find the set that gives the most accurate outcome. This means NuGene can solve problems as diverse as planning marketing budgets to maximize ROI to augmenting customer support tools with autonomous intelligent agents or even slashing preventive maintenance costs for heavy industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data engineering</emphasis></p><p>Machine learning is a true disruptor in almost every area of business. As a result, we see companies large and small investing heavily in data science, hoping to see the transformative power of AI in their business. The traditional approach was to employ a data science team to solve a specific problem by analyzing the data, identifying possible patterns, and then finding a machine learning model that can spot those patterns in new data.\u00a0</p><p>One of the key challenges companies face is a shortage of data science expertise. This is where Sonasoft's data engineering consultancy comes into its own. Sonasoft employs a team of over 50 data scientists and engineers with significant industry experience covering data factories, cloud data processing, and data migration. Many companies have huge amounts of legacy data that would be a powerful resource for machine learning, but they are not in a suitable form. Sonasoft's expertise makes it trivial to migrate this data into the cloud, analyze it, and visualize the results in a meaningful way.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Market update for 2019</emphasis></p><p>Over the past year, Sonasoft has acquired 3 key companies:</p><p>Hotify Inc. created NuGene, the unified artificial intelligence (AI) platform, which now underpins much of Sonasoft's AI work. NuGene was developed by Ankur Garg, recently appointed Chief of AI at Sonasoft.</p><p>E-Connect Software Inc. is a data engineering and AI consultancy with expertise in data migration, cloud data management, and data integrations. This allows Sonasoft to offer full AI transformation services to their customers.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>OptimAIze is an innovative company focussed on AIOPs (AI operations for IT server management). AIOps is one of the biggest growth areas in enterprise IT, applying AI to improve efficiency and cut operating costs.</p><p>In 2019, the Company procured several significant contracts and POCs.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p> Awarded a contract with a major regional transit system ($350k) </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p> Won a contract with a major California School District ($100k) </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p> Won a contract with a Fortune 600 Tech Company ($270k) </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p> Received several contracts for AI professional consulting services ($650k) </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p> Won a key contract to provide AI solutions to Padmini NVA </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p> Won a proof of concept (POC) AI project with Delaware Electric Cooperative </p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Sonasoft has also entered into key strategic partnerships to enhance its existing data archiving and eDiscovery products.\u00a0</p><p>Predikly is a Silicon Valley-based data innovation and robotic process automation (RPA) company. The partnership agreement will enable the acceleration of intelligent process automation (IPA) technologies and solutions.</p><p>Trusted Data Solutions is a leader in legacy data management and transformation. The partnership and integration of TDS's Evolve email archive migration solutions provide a trusted and efficient email and data migration path.</p><p>Globanet is a leader in data source and application capture for archiving, compliance, and eDiscovery. The partnership enables Sonasoft to integrate Globanet's Merge1TM into SonaVault Archiving and eDiscovery Software Solution.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2020 and beyond</emphasis></p><p>Looking to the future, AI is clearly going to continue to transform business in significant ways. Currently, almost all applications of AI are based on so-called narrow intelligence. That means they rely on machine learning techniques that solve a very specific problem. The next big step is deep learning, where a computer seeks to mimic human-like intelligence using massive deep neural networks. Much research is being done on specialized computer chips that are optimized for this sort of learning. Google DeepMind is leading the pack here, but you can expect to see deep learning becoming far more prevalent over the coming years.\u00a0</p><p>AI is also expanding into areas that touch our very lives. Many companies are developing products that use AI to diagnose diseases, sometimes outperforming the best human specialists. Other companies are focusing on using AI to help with things like credit scoring, recruitment, and even criminal profiling. This is opening up some ethical conundrums that will probably require legislation to solve. GDPR (the general data protection regulation) already gives EU citizens the right to refuse to allow their data to be used for automated decision making, and companies must tell users if they are intending to do this. Google's parent company, Alphabet, is mired in controversy over the way its Streams App accessed the detailed health records of millions of British citizens. As a result, the chances are that companies will soon have to address the ethics of AI head-on.</p><p>Another related change is towards so-called white-box AI. By their very nature, most AI models are black-box    no one, not even the developer, can tell you exactly what is happening inside. As a result, it's hard to understand whether the system is fair or biased. This courted controversy for the Apple credit card last year when it appeared that men were receiving many times the credit limit available to their wives even when they had shared financial status. One of the biggest sources of bias is the original raw data. So, increasingly, we will see approaches that seek to identify and remove this bias. This is one place where NuGene is ahead of the curve since it can take completely raw data without the need for pre-processing (one of the biggest sources of bias). Whatever the future, Sonasoft will continue to lead the way in AI and data engineering and will ensure they keep up with the very latest trends and legislation.\u00a0</p><p>The Company plans to continue its aggressive acquisition strategy to grow it's AI and data engineering services and significantly expand its enterprise pipeline throughout 2020, in anticipation of becoming SEC-compliant, and subsequently uplisting to a senior exchange.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About Sonasoft</emphasis></p><p>Based in Silicon Valley since 2003, Sonasoft is a public company (SSFT) providing solutions that create significant competitive advantages from data, the most valuable corporate asset in the digital economy.

It is an early stage digital payments system called 'Libra', and it aims to be a 'Bitcoin Killer'. SonicX may have beat Facebook[1] into the marketplace, and its platform has some major advantages over whatever Facebook is cooking up in its crypto kitchen.SonicX[2] created a blockchain platform that is based on Tron's[3] architecture. In addition to all the great features that Tron has, SonicX boosted the number of transactions that the platform can handle and introduced a community structure that will give users a say in how things work.It is easy to see that there is substantial interest in blockchain technology. The monetary aspect of blockchain has become especially popular with larger companies. </p><p>Facebook may think that it can enter a growing marketplace and use its existing infrastructure for leverage.Unfortunately for tech majors like Facebook, smaller companies may have the upper hand in the world of blockchain payment systems. SonicX and The Big Tech Dilemma Massive tech companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook have become stock market sensations, but the business that backs up high valuations isn't going to help them in the FinTech space.In fact, success could be a big problem for any tech major that wants to enter the payments space.It took less than a month for Democrats in the US House of Representatives to officially ask Facebook to drop their plans for both the Libra cryptocurrency and its planned digital wallet, called 'Calibra'.Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), the chair of the House Financial Services Committee, wrote[4] that:'If products and services like these are left improperly regulated and without sufficient oversight, they could pose systemic risks that endanger U.S. and global financial stability,' and that, 'These vulnerabilities could be exploited and obscured by bad actors, as other cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and wallets have been in the past.'Any company that is worth hundreds of billions of US dollars is going to be taken seriously, which will likely elicit this kind of blowback from both the established banking system, and lawmakers.It is worth noting that Facebook's 'crypto' would be based on a very different idea than the one that drove Bitcoin into the mainstream.As Colin Harper points out in a recent piece[5] published in Venture Beat:'unlike Bitcoin, which is an open system, Libra is closed and will be highly gatekept. Facebook announced the currency in partnership with 27 other major corporations, firms, and non-profits, including Visa, Mastercard, Spotify, Lyft, Uber and Ebay. These Founding Members make up the Libra Association, which will be in charge of processing transactions for the network and maintaining its version of the blockchain.'SonicX created a system that is in-line with the foundational philosophy of Bitcoin and makes it a viable global payment system. Let's be honest, Bitcoin is an amazing piece of software, but it isn't going to topple Visa anytime soon.In order to give the established financial system a run for their money, a payments system has to be both secure, and able to handle loads of transactions every second. Bitcoin got the first part right, and now SonicX is working on the second challenge. Making the Jump to Cryptocurrencies SonicX is a fork of the Tron blockchain that addresses some of the bigger issues that cryptos face. One of the biggest problems that early cryptocurrencies have is that they can't be scaled up to the level that would allow them to be adopted for large scale transaction networks.The SonicX Consensus Mechanism (SXCM) digital governance system allows the Tron network to increase the number of transactions that are possible in a given timeframe, and it adds an architecture that allows for Supernodes.Supernodes on SXCM are chosen to produce new blocks, while ordinary nodes validate transactions. The net result is a network that can process around 5,000 transaction per second, which is probably adequate to compete with a platform like Visa.SonicX has been able to create its platform without any static from the established financial system, or any government. It also has a solid decentralized platform to work with, which Facebook might struggle to compete with. Bigger isn't Always Better Big tech firms like Microsoft and Facebook get a lot of money from investors, but their development teams are far from perfect.According to David B. Black, a software developer, and Forbes[6] contributor:'People who write code make mistakes. Lots of them. All the time. There are a host of methods in varying degrees of use to prevent or catch such mistakes, things ranging from test-driven-development to extensive code reviews. None of them work. No, they don't work for Facebook either.'Black is driving at the point that just because Facebook is a massive tech company, they aren't going to be able to roll out a new global payments network with a brand new body of code quickly.Companies like SonicX not only enjoy the advantage of flying under the radar of the government, they also have open-source code they can rely on. Facebook isn't into blockchain to further the goals of social change and decentralization, instead, they are probably looking to take an early-mover advantage in the retail blockchain payments space.SonicX appears to understand that when it comes to decentralization, community is key.The idea that a company like Facebook will be able to gain the same kind of widespread support that open-source cryptos did is highly questionable. Bitcoin and blockchain have been able to grow so quickly because of a dedicated community (especially on the development side), which Facebook will have a hard time matching.Then, there is the question of credibility.Companies like SonicX are founded on the idea of transparency, which is one of the most important things about cryptos. Public ledgers make sure that the transaction record is freely available, which is why so many people trust open-source blockchain platforms.Big tech takes the opposite development approach and hides its mistakes.Again, from Black's Forbes piece on the failings of Libra (italics mine):'the internet giants have an unbroken track record of releasing code that's riddled with errors. Yes, Facebook is partnering with lots of corporate giants - and those giants are equally accomplished at releasing an unbroken stream of software horror shows.'Facebook ignores the issue of its inability to produce software that works and satisfies users, much less have a solution for it that it will apply to Libra.'Facebook has a terrible history of violating the trust of its users, and selling highly personal information to shadowy parties. Financial information may be the most valuable information there is, which makes Facebook a very unlikely candidate for widespread public trust. SonicX is Worth Watching SonicX is sitting on some pretty impressive code that could have a big impact on how payments happen globally. The platform allows users to have a say in how it works and will process a huge number of transactions every second.Bitcoin was clearly the birth of something big.SonicX may be the next step in the movement away from centralized power structures, toward more transparency, and global financial unity.

A proposal by staff would have kept the limit in place for up to 22 months.</p><p>The limit also has some wiggle room, part of what Supervisor Lynda Hopkins called \"a very messy compromise,\" that could have the board revisit the cap if it is reached between now and the end of 2020.</p><p>Hopkins spurred the wider discussion, with support from Supervisor Susan Gorin, the board chair. The two represent opposite sides of the county, the west and east, with the highest concentration of vacation rentals outside of cities.</p><p>The measure is intended to prevent transformation of a wider share of existing housing into short-term rentals, ensuring more homes remain for residents.</p><p>Industry groups have generally bristled at such limits and the board has balked in previous years at setting a hard cap on vacation rentals, wary of their value for property owners and the tourism-dependent local economy.</p><p>The full board was split over a cap and eventually settled on a compromise crafted by Hopkins: a shorter-term limit and the option of revisiting it before December if necessary to accommodate new applicants.</p><p>County staff, however, have pointed to at least 400 idle permits that could potentially be purged to open up more slots. They said it was unlikely new applicants would be denied in the next three months due to any constraints imposed by the cap.</p><p>The short-term limits are the first step in a planning effort expected to take at least a year. Staff members also promised to come back with more data in March before being able to craft a comprehensive strategy in the fall of 2021 at the earliest.</p><p>Gore said he would not support extending the cap beyond the first of the year. Zane said the county should be welcoming tourists back into Sonoma County, and a cap sends the wrong message. Rabbitt questioned whether the new regulation would resolve any of the long-standing issues with housing.</p><p>\"I've never been a fan of moratoriums,\" Rabbitt said. \"I think they're the absolute last nuclear option when it comes to land use. It's the wrong way to go. I think the duty when a moratorium is brought forward is to move expeditiously forward to help solve the problem. But we haven't identified what the problem is.\"</p><p>For Hopkins and Gorin, the problem is two-fold: First, a dense concentration of vacation rentals along the lower Russian River and in the Sonoma Valley, leading to complaints of noise, traffic and general decline in quality of life; and second, their concerns about the proliferation of vacation rentals and the dwindling of affordable housing stock for residents.</p><p>The Russian River area has long existed as a summer-home destination, Hopkins acknowledged, but as those heydays faded, the region in recent decades became one of the most affordable places to live for Sonoma County residents.</p><p>A recent surge of interest and acquisitions in Sonoma County by Bay Area buyers, however, may mean that era on the river is over, too.</p><p>\"To me, it's about a tipping point,\" Hopkins said. \"If it becomes 50% to 60% vacation rentals, I'm sorry but that's commercial.\"</p><p>Public comment on the matter was nearly unanimous against a cap, even a temporary one. Residents who own second homes in Sonoma County and those in real estate who depend on that market said the regulation was short-sighted, financially burdensome for property owners and could result in a downward price spiral.</p><p>Mary Ann Bautista said she and her husband live in Alameda County, but bought \"our dream property\" in March just outside of Healdsburg with plans to retire there eventually.</p><p>\"We are just sort of normal people ? not big tech money people,\" Bautista said. \"We know we will need to partially rent it out in order to afford to make our lifelong dream of retiring in Sonoma County a reality...We had no idea these restrictions were going to come.\"</p><p>But others argued in favor of the ordinance.</p><p>\"This is not for the landlords and the gentrifiers ... the rest of us have regular jobs, and we're trying to afford decent places,\" said a man whose name wasn't immediately clear on the Board of Supervisors' Zoom-based meeting and could not be verified afterwards.</p><p>The county cap applies only to the unincorporated area and does not affect cities that allow vacation rentals.</p><p>Gore, who represents the north county, including Healdsburg, said he wouldn't support a moratorium for his district going forward. He floated other compromises, including allowing unlimited vacation rental permits for county residents or putting \"buyer beware\" notifications on permits issued in the interim.</p><p>He, Zane and Rabbitt ultimately endorsed the short-term compromise proposed by Hopkins.</p><p>\"To do any type of countywide cap is an overreach in my opinion,\" Zane said. \"The timing couldn't be more wrong.

But the speaker market is undergoing a major shift to smart speakers, and Sonos runs the risk of being relegated to being a secondary player \u2014 or being boxed out of the market.The company's sales growth has already slowed down and it has struggled with red ink.  Sonos has amassed a fervent fan base over the years. But that doesn't mean investors should get overly enthusiastic about the company's stock when it hits the public markets. </p><p>The consumer electronics company, which filed on Friday to go public[1], has carved out a nice niche for itself with its line of wifi connected speakers. But the company's sales growth has moderated from its heyday, and in recent years it's struggled to post a profit. Meanwhile, it's dependent on some of the biggest and most powerful companies in tech for a core new technology that's transforming the home audio market even as it faces growing competition from those same companies. In other words, I wouldn't bet the house on Sonos \u2014 no matter how much you may love its connected speakers. By some measures, Sonos has built up a respectable business. Since 2013, its sales have nearly doubled to almost $1 billion. Its gross margin \u2014 the portion of its sales it has left after accounting for the direct costs of producing its profits \u2014 has generally been in the 45% range or higher. That's a healthy figure for a hardware company, indicating that it's able to charge a premium price for its products. It also gives the company plenty of room to spend money on marketing and research-and-development.Sonos has some fanatical fansConsumers have been catching on. In the last 12 months, the company sold 4.6 million speakers, more than triple the number it sold in its 2013 fiscal year. And Sonos' fans really seem to love its products. Of the 6.9 million households that have a registered Sonos speaker, 61% have at least two of the company's products. Some 27% have four or more. The average customer who starts off with just one Sonos speaker will buy more than two more over time, according to the company. On average, customers who start off with more than one Sonos product initially buy about three at the start and then purchase another two over time. All that sounds great. But there are signs that Sonos has struggled to build a profitable business outside its niche of geeky audiophiles.Warning: The best days may be behind itMost of its sales growth over the last five years happened between Sonos' 2013 and 2014 fiscal years, when its revenue soared 75%. Since then, the company's revenue hasn't grown faster than about 10% on an annual basis. The bulk of the growth in Sonos' device sales happened in that same period, when they nearly doubled. Ever since, the growth in its product sales have been much more modest, rising just 11% in its last year. As Sonos' growth slowed, its bottom line deteriorated. The company went from posting a modest profit in fiscal 2014 to a big loss the following year. On an annual basis, it's been operating in the red ever since, although it's gradually improved its bottom line. Things improved for the company in the first half of its current fiscal year. Sales were up 18% over the same period a year earlier and the company posted a profit for the period. But that improvement could prove to be a chimera. Sonos' fiscal year ends around the end of September, meaning that its first half includes the all-important holiday season, where it almost certainly gets the bulk of its sales. The company posted a profit for the first half of its fiscal year last year too only to end up posting a full-year loss.The speaker market is being transformed by \"smarts\"Beyond just the numbers, there are bigger reasons to be concerned about Sonos' prospects. Even as the company is hitting the public market, the industry it competes in is changing dramatically. From when it debuted its first speaker in 2005 until the last year or so, Sonos had the connected speaker market pretty much to itself. If you wanted a whole-home audio system that allowed you to stream music from the internet that you could set up yourself without a custom installer, Sonos was generally the way to go. But that's no longer the case. Amazon's line of Echo smart speakers offers the same capability. So do Google's Home devices and now Apple's HomePod. The Echo and the Home weren't initially on par with Sonos' devices in terms of audio quality. But both Amazon and Google last year released new versions of their smart speakers with improved sound. And audio quality is the main selling point of Apple's HomePod. But all three companies offer something with their speakers that Sonos traditionally hasn't \u2014 a built-in intelligent agent. You can control Amazon, Google, and Apple's smart speakers with just your voice. And you can do a lot more with them that than. You can use them to turn on and off your lights, tell you the news and weather, answer trivia questions, and give you the latest sports scores. The smart speaker market has started to catch fire. In the first quarter of this year, unit sales grew a whopping 210% from the same period last year[2], according to market research firm Canalys, hitting 9 million worldwide. That's nearly twice as many speakers sold in one quarter as Sonos sold in the last year. Canalys expects worldwide sales of smart speakers to reach 56.3 million[3] this year, up from about 35 million last year and fewer than 10 million in 2016. That kind of growth obviously far outpaces what Sonos has been doing lately. It also illustrates how smart speakers are starting to dominate the speaker market, just as smartphones pushed aside dumb phones and nearly all televisions are now smart TVs.Sonos' smart speaker strategy is really riskySonos has recognized that market shift toward smart speakers. Last fall, it introduced its first one[4] and it has more in the works[5]. But there's a big flaw in Sonos' strategy \u2014 it doesn't have its own voice-assistant technology. Instead, for now, it's relying on Amazon's Alexa assistant, although it plans to add in Google's Assistant and Apple's Siri in the future. At best, that will relegate Sonos to being a second fiddle to the big players. When people think of an Amazon-powered smart speaker, they think of the company's Echo line. Sonos faces a huge marketing challenge to make consumers aware that one of its smart speakers can offer the same Alexa assistant that they'd get on an Echo. Even it's able to do so, it may find it tough convincing customers to pay up for one of its speakers, when they can get an entry-level Echo Dot for $50. That challenge could prove even more difficult when you consider that Amazon has full control over which smart speakers it promotes in its web store \u2014 and has taken full advantage of that control to promote its Echo line. Sonos' reliance on the big tech companies could become more problematic over time. Right now, as Sonos acknowledged in the document it filed to go public[6], it doesn't pay Amazon anything to use Alexa. But that could change if Amazon ever perceives Sonos' devices to be a competitive threat \u2014 or as a potential money-maker Worse yet for Sonos, Amazon and the other tech companies could just cut Sonos off[7], leaving it without any voice assistant for its smart speakers \u2014 both the ones it's already sold to its customers and any future devices. In fact, according to Sonos' regulatory filing, Amazon can sever ties with the company with only \"limited notice.\" \"If these partners disable the integration of their technology into our products, demand for our products may decrease and our sales may be harmed,\" Sonos warned investors. \"We cannot assure you that the resources we invest in research and development, existing or alternative technology partnerships, marketing and sales will be adequate for us to be successful in establishing and maintaining a large share of the voice-enabled speaker market. \"If we are not able to capture and sustain market share, our future revenue growth will be negatively impacted.\" For me, that's good reason to be cautious about Sonos. It may make great speakers. But in the smart-speaker era, it's much more important to have the technology to make them intelligent.NOW WATCH: I tried the newest BlackBerry phone for a week[8]See Also: Why this top LinkedIn

(market cap US$893 billion) and Alphabet Inc.'s Google (market cap US$793 billion.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have to go toe-to-toe with the giants every day. Sometimes you're sparring, sometimes you're dancing,\" Spence said during a talk at the Collision startup conference in Toronto this week.</p><p>Spence, who cut his teeth at Waterloo, Ont.-based BlackBerry Ltd., spoke about how upstart tech companies can survive in a world increasingly dominated by a few giants - Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Apple and Netflix in particular.</p><p>He said that despite all his advice for eking out success as an independent tech company, the landscape may be headed toward such intractable dominance that government regulators will need to break the giants up.</p><p>But in the meantime, some degree of co-operation with the major players is a must. Sonos speakers work with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant - despite the fact both companies make their own in-house smart speakers which compete directly with Sonos.</p><p>In an interview, Spence said the market dominance of both companies is probably part of why Sonos was able to negotiate partnership agreements.</p><p>\"Right now, the big tech companies are obviously under the microscope and I think they're going to be very thoughtful about the fact that there are theses services that they make available, and they're going to need to make them available to every company that asks, because if not, they're going to be held to account,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're an example they can point to in terms of saying, yes, we are putting our services on another company's platform.\"</p><p>Spence said negotiations with Amazon and Google were tough - he joked it felt like being a United Nations diplomat - and the main reason the companies were willing to play ball was because Sonos has been able to carve out a niche with high-quality multi-room speakers.</p><p>\"We have over eight million of the most desirable homes in the world. So I think the way Google and Amazon look at it, they want to be able to get their services - whether music or voice - into those homes,\" he said.</p><p>Spence wasn't the only tech executive at Collision thinking about how to navigate a world of increasingly monopolistic giants.</p><p>\"Kendrick Lamar has this great tattoo on his arm that says 'Hustle like you're broke.'And I actually have that on my laptop,\" said Stuart Lombard, the CEO of Toronto-based smart thermostat maker Ecobee.</p><p>\"I'd have it on my arm except my wife would kill me.\"</p><p>Ecobee has taken investment dollars from Amazon, and the temperature on their thermostats can be controlled through either Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands, but Lombard was quick to draw a contrast with tech's giants, without mentioning them by name.</p><p>\"Our model is not about monetizing you, the consumer,\" he said.</p><p>\"Privacy is so important for us, and making sure that we maintain that customer trust that we treat that customers data like it is our own.\"</p><p>Lombard said Ecobee tries to maintain its independence is by staying close to its customers, and making sure their products address complaints and blind spots that the bigger players might overlook.</p><p>\"I spend days and days just answering customer service calls, right?\" Lombard said. \"And you know it's unusual for a CEO to answer customer service calls, but it's all about understanding what your customers are saying.\"</p><p>Both Lombard and Spence raised the spectre that Google and Amazon will become too large, and too dominant, and the only path back to a healthy, competitive marketplace will be government intervention.</p><p>\"I think, you know, there certainly is a tendency to greater monopolization,\" Lombard said.</p><p>For Bryan Murphy, the chief executive at Montreal-based Breather Products Inc., a tech-focused flexible office space company, the question of monopoly also comes down to the exact nature of the business. Murphy is up against another giant in The We Company (formerly WeWork) which pioneered the idea of flexible co-working spaces.</p><p>Breather provides something similar, but whereas WeWork focuses on hip communal work spaces, Breather targets flexible private working spaces for slightly larger teams.</p><p>Murphy said that even if some kinds of markets might lend themselves to market concentration, monopolization in real estate just isn't something he can foresee.</p><p>\"In New York City there's about 450 million square feet of office. How you develop a monopoly on that is almost impossible,\" he said.</p><p>Like Ecobee and Sonos, Murphy said that Breather's path to success is about finding a specific niche and working it hard \"You have to create your own unique value proposition to the customer,\" he said.</p><p>\"We've identified a part of this market that's highly desired by customers.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

(market cap US$893 billion) and Alphabet Inc.'s Google (market cap US$793 billion.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have to go toe-to-toe with the giants every day. Sometimes you're sparring, sometimes you're dancing,\" Spence said during a talk at the Collision startup conference in Toronto this week.</p><p>Spence, who cut his teeth at Waterloo, Ont.-based BlackBerry Ltd., spoke about how upstart tech companies can survive in a world increasingly dominated by a few giants - Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Apple and Netflix in particular.</p><p>He said that despite all his advice for eking out success as an independent tech company, the landscape may be headed toward such intractable dominance that government regulators will need to break the giants up.</p><p>But in the meantime, some degree of co-operation with the major players is a must. Sonos speakers work with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant - despite the fact both companies make their own in-house smart speakers which compete directly with Sonos.</p><p>In an interview, Spence said the market dominance of both companies is probably part of why Sonos was able to negotiate partnership agreements.</p><p>\"Right now, the big tech companies are obviously under the microscope and I think they're going to be very thoughtful about the fact that there are theses services that they make available, and they're going to need to make them available to every company that asks, because if not, they're going to be held to account,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're an example they can point to in terms of saying, yes, we are putting our services on another company's platform.\"</p><p>Spence said negotiations with Amazon and Google were tough - he joked it felt like being a United Nations diplomat - and the main reason the companies were willing to play ball was because Sonos has been able to carve out a niche with high-quality multi-room speakers.</p><p>\"We have over eight million of the most desirable homes in the world. So I think the way Google and Amazon look at it, they want to be able to get their services - whether music or voice - into those homes,\" he said.</p><p>Spence wasn't the only tech executive at Collision thinking about how to navigate a world of increasingly monopolistic giants.</p><p>\"Kendrick Lamar has this great tattoo on his arm that says 'Hustle like you're broke.'And I actually have that on my laptop,\" said Stuart Lombard, the CEO of Toronto-based smart thermostat maker Ecobee.</p><p>\"I'd have it on my arm except my wife would kill me.\"</p><p>Ecobee has taken investment dollars from Amazon, and the temperature on their thermostats can be controlled through either Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands, but Lombard was quick to draw a contrast with tech's giants, without mentioning them by name.</p><p>\"Our model is not about monetizing you, the consumer,\" he said.</p><p>\"Privacy is so important for us, and making sure that we maintain that customer trust that we treat that customers data like it is our own.\"</p><p>Lombard said Ecobee tries to maintain its independence is by staying close to its customers, and making sure their products address complaints and blind spots that the bigger players might overlook.</p><p>\"I spend days and days just answering customer service calls, right?\" Lombard said. \"And you know it's unusual for a CEO to answer customer service calls, but it's all about understanding what your customers are saying.\"</p><p>Both Lombard and Spence raised the spectre that Google and Amazon will become too large, and too dominant, and the only path back to a healthy, competitive marketplace will be government intervention.</p><p>\"I think, you know, there certainly is a tendency to greater monopolization,\" Lombard said.</p><p>For Bryan Murphy, the chief executive at Montreal-based Breather Products Inc., a tech-focused flexible office space company, the question of monopoly also comes down to the exact nature of the business. Murphy is up against another giant in The We Company (formerly WeWork) which pioneered the idea of flexible co-working spaces.</p><p>Breather provides something similar, but whereas WeWork focuses on hip communal work spaces, Breather targets flexible private working spaces for slightly larger teams.</p><p>Murphy said that even if some kinds of markets might lend themselves to market concentration, monopolization in real estate just isn't something he can foresee.</p><p>\"In New York City there's about 450 million square feet of office. How you develop a monopoly on that is almost impossible,\" he said.</p><p>Like Ecobee and Sonos, Murphy said that Breather's path to success is about finding a specific niche and working it hard \"You have to create your own unique value proposition to the customer,\" he said.</p><p>\"We've identified a part of this market that's highly desired by customers.\" Financial Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

(market cap uS$893 billion) and Alphabet Inc.'s Google (market cap uS$793 billion.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We have to go toe-to-toe with the giants every day. Sometimes you're sparring, sometimes you're dancing,\" Spence said during a talk at the Collision startup conference in Toronto this week.</p><p>Spence, who cut his teeth at Waterloo, Ont.-based BlackBerry Ltd., spoke about how upstart tech companies can survive in a world increasingly dominated by a few giants - Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Apple and Netflix in particular.</p><p>He said that despite all his advice for eking out success as an independent tech company, the landscape may be headed toward such intractable dominance that government regulators will need to break the giants up.</p><p>But in the meantime, some degree of co-operation with the major players is a must. Sonos speakers work with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant - despite the fact both companies make their own in-house smart speakers which compete directly with Sonos.</p><p>In an interview, Spence said the market dominance of both companies is probably part of why Sonos was able to negotiate partnership agreements.</p><p>\"right now, the big tech companies are obviously under the microscope and I think they're going to be very thoughtful about the fact that there are these services that they make available, and they're going to need to make them available to every company that asks, because if not, they're going to be held to account,\" he said.</p><p>\"We're an example they can point to in terms of saying, yes, we are putting our services on another company's platform.\"</p><p>Spence said negotiations with Amazon and Google were tough - he joked it felt like being a united Nations diplomat - and the main reason the companies were willing to play ball was because Sonos has been able to carve out a niche with high-quality multi-room speakers.</p><p>\"We have over eight million of the most desirable homes in the world. So I think the way Google and Amazon look at it, they want to be able to get their services - whether music or voice - into those homes,\" he said.</p><p>Spence wasn't the only tech executive at Collision thinking about how to navigate a world of increasingly monopolistic giants.</p><p>\"Kendrick Lamar has this great tattoo on his arm that says 'Hustle like you're broke.'And I actually have that on my laptop,\" said Stuart Lombard, the CEO of Toronto-based smart thermostat maker Ecobee. \"I'd have it on my arm except my wife would kill me.\"</p><p>Ecobee has taken investment dollars from Amazon, and the temperature on their thermostats can be controlled through either Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands, but Lombard was quick to draw a contrast with tech's giants, without mentioning them by name.</p><p>\"Our model is not about monetizing you, the consumer,\" he said.</p><p>\"Privacy is so important for us, and making sure that we maintain that customer trust that we treat that customers data like it is our own.\"</p><p>Lombard said Ecobee tries to maintain its independence by staying close to its customers, and making sure their products address complaints and blind spots that the bigger players might overlook.</p><p>\"I spend days and days just answering customer service calls, right?\" Lombard said. \"And you know it's unusual for a CEO to answer customer service calls, but it's all about understanding what your customers are saying.\"</p><p>Both Lombard and Spence raised the spectre that Google and Amazon will become too large, and too dominant, and the only path back to a healthy, competitive marketplace will be government intervention.</p><p>\"I think, you know, there certainly is a tendency to greater monopolization,\" Lombard said.</p><p>For Bryan Murphy, the chief executive at Montreal-based Breather Products Inc., a tech-focused flexible office space company, the question of monopoly also comes down to the exact nature of the business. Murphy is up against another giant in The We Company (formerly WeWork) which pioneered the idea of flexible co-working spaces.</p><p>Breather provides something similar, but whereas WeWork focuses on hip communal work spaces, Breather targets flexible private working spaces for slightly larger teams.</p><p>Murphy said that even if some kinds of markets might lend themselves to market concentration, monopolization in real estate just isn't something he can foresee.</p><p>\"In New york City there's about 450 million square feet of office. How you develop a monopoly on that is almost impossible,\" he said.</p><p>Like Ecobee and Sonos, Murphy said that Breather's path to success is about finding a specific niche and working it hard \"you have to create your own unique value proposition to the customer,\" he said.</p><p>\"We've identified a part of this market that's highly desired by customers.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

In addition to Google, Apple and Samsung also did not join the alliance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CORRECTION APPENDED</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SANTA BARBARA, Calif. - In 2013, Sonos scored a coup when Google agreed to design its music service to work easily with Sonos's home speakers. For the project, Sonos handed over the effective blueprints to its speakers.</p><p>It felt like a harmless move, Sonos executives said. Google was an internet company and didn't make speakers. </p><p>The executives now say they were na\u00efve.</p><p>On Tuesday, Sonos sued Google in two federal court systems, seeking financial damages and a ban on the sale of Google's speakers, smartphones and laptops in the United States. Sonos accused Google of infringing on five of its patents, including technology that lets wireless speakers connect and synchronize with one another.</p><p>Sonos's complaints go beyond patents and Google. Its legal action is the culmination of years of growing dependence on both Google and Amazon, which then used their leverage to squeeze the smaller company, Sonos executives said. </p><p>Sonos advertises its speakers on Google and sells them on Amazon. It built their music services and talking virtual assistants directly into its products. Sonos workers correspond via Gmail, and run the business off Amazon's cloud-computing service. </p><p>Then Google and Amazon came out with their own speakers, undercutting Sonos's prices and, according to Sonos executives, stealing its technology. Google and Amazon each now sell as many speakers in a few months as Sonos sells in one year.</p><p>Like many companies under the thumb of Big Tech, Sonos groused privately for years. But over the past several months, Patrick Spence, Sonos's chief executive, decided he couldn't take it anymore. </p><p>\"Google has been blatantly and knowingly copying our patented technology,\" Mr. Spence said in a statement. \"Despite our repeated and extensive efforts over the last few years, Google has not shown any willingness to work with us on a mutually beneficial solution. We're left with no choice but to litigate.\"</p><p>Sonos executives said they had decided to sue only Google because they couldn't risk battling two tech giants in court at once. Yet Mr. Spence and congressional staff members have discussed his testifying to the House antitrust subcommittee soon about his company's issues with them. </p><p>Jose Castaneda, a Google spokesman, said Google and Sonos had discussed both companies' intellectual property for years, \"and we are disappointed that Sonos brought these lawsuits instead of continuing negotiations in good faith.\"</p><p>\"We dispute these claims and will defend them vigorously,\" he added.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Amazon, Natalie Hereth, said the company did not infringe on Sonos's technology. \"The Echo family of devices and our multiroom music technology were developed independently by Amazon,\" she said.</p><p>Sonos sued Google in Federal District Court in Los Angeles and in front of the United States International Trade Commission, a quasi-judicial body that decides trade cases and can block the import of goods that violate patents. Sonos sued Google over only five patents, but said it believed Google and Amazon had each violated roughly 100. Sonos did not say how much it sought in damages. </p><p>The evolving relationship between Sonos and the tech giants reflects an increasingly common complaint in the corporate world: As the biggest tech companies have become essential to reach customers and build businesses, they have exploited that leverage over smaller companies to steal their ideas and their customers.</p><p>After mostly keeping those grievances private for years because they feared retaliation, many smaller companies are now speaking out, emboldened in an age of growing scrutiny of America's largest tech firms. </p><p>Dozens of companies have complained to regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Europe. Spotify has accused Apple of punishing Spotify's iPhone app as it increasingly competes against it. Blix, a company that helps people create anonymous email addresses, recently sued Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of copying its technology and then kicking it off Apple's App Store. And Elastic, which builds software that runs on Amazon's cloud platform, sued Amazon for copying its branding to introduce a rival offering. Apple and Amazon deny the claims.</p><p>Mr. Spence and other Sonos executives said they had agonized over the decision to sue Google, largely because Google still underpins their business. Sonos executives suspect that their pressure on the patent issue has complicated other areas of the relationship, though they can't say for sure.</p><p>After Sonos intensified its demands that Google license its technology, Google pushed Sonos to comply with stricter rules for using Google's virtual assistant. Those proposed rules included a mandate to turn over the planned name, design and targeted start date of its future products - which Google would compete directly against - six months in advance, up from 45 days in the current deal, Sonos executives said.</p><p>\"The fear of retaliation is a real fear. Any of these companies could bury them tomorrow. Google could bury them in their search results. Amazon can bury them in their search results,\" said Sally Hubbard, a former assistant attorney general in New York's antitrust bureau who now works at Open Markets Institute, a think tank. \"It's really hard to find any industry where corporations are not dependent on one of the big tech giants.\"</p><p>Fifteen years ago, home sound systems typically meant a tangled network of wires and speakers and complicated instructions on how to make it all work. Then Sonos came along in 2005, promising wireless sound throughout a house, seamlessly controlled from a hand-held device. Its early ads boasted: \"Any song. Any room.\"</p><p>Sonos quickly began patenting its innovations, a stockpile of intellectual property it now proudly displays on its website. </p><p>Its devices made life a bit more comfortable for consumers who could afford them, and they made for a nice little business for Sonos, which is based a few miles from the Southern California coast in Santa Barbara. Sales of its devices took off after the advent of the smartphone and music streaming. Sonos now employs about 1,500 people and sells more than $1 billion in speakers a year. </p><p>When Sonos teamed up with Google in 2013, it gave Google engineers detailed diagrams on how its speakers interacted wirelessly with one another. At the time, Google was not a competitor. </p><p>Two years later, Google released a small device that could turn an old speaker into a wireless one, much like Sonos's original product. A year after that, Google released its own wireless speaker, the Google Home. The device, marketed around Google's talking virtual assistant, quickly began outselling Sonos's offerings. </p><p>Sonos bought the Google devices and used a technique called packet sniffing that monitored how the speakers were communicating. They discovered that Google's devices used Sonos's approach for solving a variety of technological challenges. Sonos executives said they had found that Amazon's Echo speakers also copied Sonos technology.</p><p>In August 2016, Sonos told Google that it was infringing. Google had little response. As Google released more products, it violated more patents, Sonos executives said. Over the next three years, Sonos told Google four more times, eventually handing over a list of 100 patents it believed Google had violated. Google responded that Sonos was also infringing on its patents, Sonos executives said, though it never provided much detail.</p><p>When Sonos delivered a proposed model for Google to pay licensing fees, Google returned its own model that resulted in its paying almost nothing, Sonos executives said.</p><p>Sonos executives said their complaints were hardly just about patents, however. They are concerned that Google and Amazon are flooding the market with cheap speakers that they subsidize because they are not merely conduits for music, like Sonos's devices, but rather another way to sell goods, show ads and collect data. </p><p>Sonos's entry-level speaker is about $200. Amazon and Google's cheapest speakers are $50, and they often offer them at much steeper discounts. </p><p>In the third quarter of 2019, Amazon shipped 10.5 million speakers and Google six million, according to Strategy Analytics. For the 12 months ending in September, Sonos said it had sold 6.1 million speakers.</p><p>\"Amazon and Google are making it a mass-market product at a price point that Sonos can't match,\" said Jack Narcotta, a Strategy Analytics analyst. </p><p>Amazon said that it was focused on creating the best experience for customers and that its virtual assistant had generated \"billions of dollars\" for developers and device makers.</p><p>To compete, Sonos has had to yield even more power to the companies. When consumers became hooked on Google's and Amazon's virtual assistants, Sonos also built them into its speakers.</p><p>But Sonos had a strategy to still stand out on store shelves.

For the project, Sonos handed over the effective blueprints to its speakers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It felt like a harmless move, Sonos executives said. Google was an internet company and didn\u2019t make speakers. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The executives now say they were na\u00efve.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Tuesday, Sonos sued Google in two federal court systems, seeking financial damages and a ban on the sale of Google\u2019s speakers, smartphones and laptops in the United States. Sonos accused Google of infringing on five of its patents, including technology that lets wireless speakers connect and synchronize with one another.</p><p>Sonos\u2019s complaints go beyond patents and Google. Its legal action is the culmination of years of growing dependence on both Google and Amazon, which then used their leverage to squeeze the smaller company, Sonos executives said. </p><p>Sonos advertises its speakers on Google and sells them on Amazon. It built their music services and talking virtual assistants directly into its products. Sonos workers correspond via Gmail, and run the business off Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing service. </p><p>Then Google and Amazon<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/04/google-play-music-sonos/\">came out with their own speakers</url>, undercutting Sonos\u2019s prices and, according to Sonos executives, stealing its technology. Google and Amazon each now sell as many speakers in a few months as Sonos sells in one year.</p><p>Like many companies under the thumb of Big Tech, Sonos groused privately for years. But over the past several months, Patrick Spence, Sonos\u2019s chief executive, decided he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. </p><p>\u201cGoogle has been blatantly and knowingly copying our patented technology,\u201d Mr. Spence said in a statement. \u201cDespite our repeated and extensive efforts over the last few years, Google has not shown any willingness to work with us on a mutually beneficial solution. We\u2019re left with no choice but to litigate.\u201d</p><p>Sonos executives said they had decided to sue only Google because they couldn\u2019t risk battling two tech giants in court at once. Yet Mr. Spence and congressional staff members have discussed his testifying to the House antitrust subcommittee soon about his company\u2019s issues with them. </p><p>Jose Castaneda, a Google spokesman, said Google and Sonos had discussed both companies\u2019 intellectual property for years, \u201cand we are disappointed that Sonos brought these lawsuits instead of continuing negotiations in good faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe dispute these claims and will defend them vigorously,\u201d he added.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Amazon, Natalie Hereth, said the company did not infringe on Sonos\u2019s technology. \u201cThe Echo family of devices and our multiroom music technology were developed independently by Amazon,\u201d she said.</p><p>Sonos sued Google in Federal District Court in Los Angeles and in front of the United States International Trade Commission, a quasi-judicial body that decides trade cases and can block the import of goods that violate patents. Sonos sued Google over only five patents, but said it believed Google and Amazon had each violated roughly 100. Sonos did not say how much it sought in damages. </p><p>The evolving relationship between Sonos and the tech giants reflects an increasingly common complaint in the corporate world: As the biggest tech companies have become essential to reach customers and build businesses, they have exploited that leverage over smaller companies to steal their ideas and their customers.</p><p>After mostly keeping those grievances private for years because they feared retaliation, many smaller companies are now speaking out, emboldened in an age of growing scrutiny of America\u2019s largest tech firms. </p><p>Dozens of companies <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/04/google-play-music-sonos/\">have complained to regulators and lawmakers</url> in the United States and Europe. Spotify has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/04/google-play-music-sonos/\">accused Apple of punishing Spotify\u2019s iPhone app</url> as it increasingly competes against it. Blix, a company that helps people create anonymous email addresses,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/04/google-play-music-sonos/\">recently sued Apple</url>, accusing the iPhone maker of copying its technology and then kicking it off Apple\u2019s App Store. And Elastic, which builds software that runs on Amazon\u2019s cloud platform,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/04/google-play-music-sonos/\">sued Amazon for copying its branding</url> to introduce a rival offering. Apple and Amazon deny the claims.</p><p>Mr. Spence and other Sonos executives said they had agonized over the decision to sue Google, largely because Google still underpins their business. Sonos executives suspect that their pressure on the patent issue has complicated other areas of the relationship, though they can\u2019t say for sure.</p><p>After Sonos intensified its demands that Google license its technology, Google pushed Sonos to comply with stricter rules for using Google\u2019s virtual assistant. Those proposed rules included a mandate to turn over the planned name, design and targeted start date of its future products \u2014 which Google would compete directly against \u2014 six months in advance, up from 45 days in the current deal, Sonos executives said.</p><p>\u201cThe fear of retaliation is a real fear. Any of these companies could bury them tomorrow. Google could bury them in their search results. Amazon can bury them in their search results,\u201d said Sally Hubbard, a former assistant attorney general in New York\u2019s antitrust bureau who now works at Open Markets Institute, a think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to find any industry where corporations are not dependent on one of the big tech giants.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen years ago, home sound systems typically meant a tangled network of wires and speakers and complicated instructions on how to make it all work. Then <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/04/google-play-music-sonos/\">Sonos came along in 2005</url>, promising wireless sound throughout a house, seamlessly controlled from a hand-held device. Its early ads boasted: \u201c      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/04/google-play-music-sonos/\">Any song. Any room.</url>\u201d</p><p>Sonos quickly began patenting its innovations, a stockpile of intellectual property it now proudly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/04/google-play-music-sonos/\">displays on its website</url>. </p><p>Its devices made life a bit more comfortable for consumers who could afford them, and they made for a nice little business for Sonos, which is based a few miles from the Southern California coast in Santa Barbara. Sales of its devices took off after the advent of the smartphone and music streaming. Sonos now employs about 1,500 people and sells more than $1 billion in speakers a year. </p><p>When Sonos teamed up with Google in 2013, it gave Google engineers detailed diagrams on how its speakers interacted wirelessly with one another. At the time, Google was not a competitor. </p><p>Two years later, Google<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/04/google-play-music-sonos/\">released a small device</url> that could turn an old speaker into a wireless one, much like       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/04/google-play-music-sonos/\">Sonos\u2019s original product</url>. A year after that, Google released its own wireless speaker, the Google Home. The device, marketed around Google\u2019s talking virtual assistant, quickly began outselling Sonos\u2019s offerings. </p><p>Sonos bought the Google devices and used a technique called packet sniffing that monitored how the speakers were communicating. They discovered that Google\u2019s devices used Sonos\u2019s approach for solving a variety of technological challenges. Sonos executives said they had found that Amazon\u2019s Echo speakers also copied Sonos technology.</p><p>In August 2016, Sonos told Google that it was infringing. Google had little response. As Google released more products, it violated more patents, Sonos executives said. Over the next three years, Sonos told Google four more times, eventually handing over a list of 100 patents it believed Google had violated. Google responded that Sonos was also infringing on its patents, Sonos executives said, though it never provided much detail.</p><p>When Sonos delivered a proposed model for Google to pay licensing fees, Google returned its own model that resulted in its paying almost nothing, Sonos executives said.</p><p>Sonos executives said their complaints were hardly just about patents, however. They are concerned that Google and Amazon are flooding the market with cheap speakers that they subsidize because they are not merely conduits for music, like Sonos\u2019s devices, but rather another way to sell goods, show ads and collect data. </p><p>Sonos\u2019s entry-level speaker is about $200. Amazon and Google\u2019s cheapest speakers are $50, and they often offer them at much steeper discounts. </p><p>In the third quarter of 2019, Amazon shipped 10.5 million speakers and Google six million, according to Strategy Analytics. For the 12 months ending in September, Sonos said it had sold 6.1 million speakers.</p><p>\u201cAmazon and Google are making it a mass-market product at a price point that Sonos can\u2019t match,\u201d said Jack Narcotta, a Strategy Analytics analyst. </p><p>Amazon said that it was focused on creating the best experience for customers and that its virtual assistant had generated \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d for developers and device makers.</p><p>To compete, Sonos has had to yield even more power to the companies. When consumers became hooked on Google\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s virtual assistants, Sonos<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/04/google-play-music-sonos/\">also built them into its speakers</url>.</p><p>But Sonos had a strategy to still stand out on store shelves. Instead of being locked into using just one of the assistants, Sonos customers could use both simultaneously. Sonos engineers patented the technology to enable the assistants to work side by side, and executives lobbied Amazon and Google to let it happen.</p><p>At first, the companies hated the idea. Hours before a New York news conference in October 2017, Sonos was preparing to unveil its first speaker with virtual assistants when the Amazon product chief Dave Limp called Mr. Spence. Mr. Limp had just found out that Google would also be onstage, and he said Amazon was now pulling out of the event as a result, according to two people familiar with the conversation.

For the project, Sonos handed over the effective blueprints to its speakers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It felt like a harmless move, Sonos executives said. Google was an internet company and didn't make speakers.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The executives now say they were na\u00efve.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  On Tuesday, Sonos sued Google in two federal court systems, seeking financial damages and a ban on the sale of Google's speakers, smartphones and laptops in the United States. Sonos accused Google of infringing on five of its patents, including technology that lets wireless speakers connect and synchronize with one another.</p><p>  Sonos's complaints go beyond patents and Google. Its legal action is the culmination of years of growing dependence on both Google and Amazon, which then used their leverage to squeeze the smaller company, Sonos executives said. </p><p>  Sonos advertises its speakers on Google and sells them on Amazon. It built their music services and talking virtual assistants directly into its products. Sonos workers correspond via Gmail, and run the business off Amazon's cloud-computing service. </p><p>  Then Google and Amazon came out with their own speakers, undercutting Sonos's prices and, according to Sonos executives, stealing its technology. Google and Amazon each now sell as many speakers in a few months as Sonos sells in one year.</p><p>  Like many companies under the thumb of Big Tech, Sonos groused privately for years. But over the past several months, Patrick Spence, Sonos's chief executive, decided he couldn't take it anymore. </p><p>  ''Google has been blatantly and knowingly copying our patented technology,'' Mr. Spence said in a statement. ''Despite our repeated and extensive efforts over the last few years, Google has not shown any willingness to work with us on a mutually beneficial solution. We're left with no choice but to litigate.''</p><p>  Sonos executives said they had decided to sue only Google because they couldn't risk battling two tech giants in court at once. Yet Mr. Spence and congressional staff members have discussed his testifying to the House antitrust subcommittee soon about his company's issues with them. </p><p>  Jose Castaneda, a Google spokesman, said Google and Sonos had discussed both companies' intellectual property for years, ''and we are disappointed that Sonos brought these lawsuits instead of continuing negotiations in good faith.''</p><p>  ''We dispute these claims and will defend them vigorously,'' he added.</p><p>  A spokeswoman for Amazon, Natalie Hereth, said the company did not infringe on Sonos's technology. ''The Echo family of devices and our multiroom music technology were developed independently by Amazon,'' she said.</p><p>  Sonos sued Google in Federal District Court in Los Angeles and in front of the United States International Trade Commission, a quasi-judicial body that decides trade cases and can block the import of goods that violate patents. Sonos sued Google over only five patents, but said it believed Google and Amazon had each violated roughly 100. Sonos did not say how much it sought in damages. </p><p>  The evolving relationship between Sonos and the tech giants reflects an increasingly common complaint in the corporate world: As the biggest tech companies have become essential to reach customers and build businesses, they have exploited that leverage over smaller companies to steal their ideas and their customers.</p><p>  After mostly keeping those grievances private for years because they feared retaliation, many smaller companies are now speaking out, emboldened in an age of growing scrutiny of America's largest tech firms. </p><p>  Dozens of companies have complained to regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Europe. Spotify has accused Apple of punishing Spotify's iPhone app as it increasingly competes against it. Blix, a company that helps people create anonymous email addresses, recently sued Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of copying its technology and then kicking it off Apple's App Store. And Elastic, which builds software that runs on Amazon's cloud platform, sued Amazon for copying its branding to introduce a rival offering. Apple and Amazon deny the claims.</p><p>  Mr. Spence and other Sonos executives said they had agonized over the decision to sue Google, largely because Google still underpins their business. Sonos executives suspect that their pressure on the patent issue has complicated other areas of the relationship, though they can't say for sure.</p><p>  After Sonos intensified its demands that Google license its technology, Google pushed Sonos to comply with stricter rules for using Google's virtual assistant. Those proposed rules included a mandate to turn over the planned name, design and targeted start date of its future products -- which Google would compete directly against -- six months in advance, up from 45 days in the current deal, Sonos executives said.</p><p>  ''The fear of retaliation is a real fear. Any of these companies could bury them tomorrow. Google could bury them in their search results. Amazon can bury them in their search results,'' said Sally Hubbard, a former assistant attorney general in New York's antitrust bureau who now works at Open Markets Institute, a think tank. ''It's really hard to find any industry where corporations are not dependent on one of the big tech giants.''</p><p>  Fifteen years ago, home sound systems typically meant a tangled network of wires and speakers and complicated instructions on how to make it all work. Then Sonos came along in 2005, promising wireless sound throughout a house, seamlessly controlled from a hand-held device. Its early ads boasted: ''Any song. Any room.''</p><p>  Sonos quickly began patenting its innovations, a stockpile of intellectual property it now proudly displays on its website. </p><p>  Its devices made life a bit more comfortable for consumers who could afford them, and they made for a nice little business for Sonos, which is based a few miles from the Southern California coast in Santa Barbara. Sales of its devices took off after the advent of the smartphone and music streaming. Sonos now employs about 1,500 people and sells more than $1 billion in speakers a year. </p><p>  When Sonos teamed up with Google in 2013, it gave Google engineers detailed diagrams on how its speakers interacted wirelessly with one another. At the time, Google was not a competitor. </p><p>  Two years later, Google released a small device that could turn an old speaker into a wireless one, much like Sonos's original product. A year after that, Google released its own wireless speaker, the Google Home. The device, marketed around Google's talking virtual assistant, quickly began outselling Sonos's offerings. </p><p>  Sonos bought the Google devices and used a technique called packet sniffing that monitored how the speakers were communicating. They discovered that Google's devices used Sonos's approach for solving a variety of technological challenges. Sonos executives said they had found that Amazon's Echo speakers also copied Sonos technology.</p><p>  In August 2016, Sonos told Google that it was infringing. Google had little response. As Google released more products, it violated more patents, Sonos executives said. Over the next three years, Sonos told Google four more times, eventually handing over a list of 100 patents it believed Google had violated. Google responded that Sonos was also infringing on its patents, Sonos executives said, though it never provided much detail.</p><p>  When Sonos delivered a proposed model for Google to pay licensing fees, Google returned its own model that resulted in its paying almost nothing, Sonos executives said.</p><p>  Sonos executives said their complaints were hardly just about patents, however. They are concerned that Google and Amazon are flooding the market with cheap speakers that they subsidize because they are not merely conduits for music, like Sonos's devices, but rather another way to sell goods, show ads and collect data. </p><p>  Sonos's entry-level speaker is about $200. Amazon and Google's cheapest speakers are $50, and they often offer them at much steeper discounts. </p><p>  In the third quarter of 2019, Amazon shipped 10.5 million speakers and Google six million, according to Strategy Analytics. For the 12 months ending in September, Sonos said it had sold 6.1 million speakers.</p><p>  ''Amazon and Google are making it a mass-market product at a price point that Sonos can't match,'' said Jack Narcotta, a Strategy Analytics analyst. </p><p>Amazon said that it was focused on creating the best experience for customers and that its virtual assistant had generated ''billions of dollars'' for developers and device makers.</p><p>  To compete, Sonos has had to yield even more power to the companies. When consumers became hooked on Google's and Amazon's virtual assistants, Sonos also built them into its speakers.</p><p>  But Sonos had a strategy to still stand out on store shelves. Instead of being locked into using just one of the assistants, Sonos customers could use both simultaneously. Sonos engineers patented the technology to enable the assistants to work side by side, and executives lobbied Amazon and Google to let it happen.</p><p>  At first, the companies hated the idea. Hours before a New York news conference in October 2017, Sonos was preparing to unveil its first speaker with virtual assistants when the Amazon product chief Dave Limp called Mr. Spence. Mr. Limp had just found out that Google would also be onstage, and he said Amazon was now pulling out of the event as a result, according to two people familiar with the conversation. After negotiations, Amazon relented.</p><p>  Sonos executives said Google and Amazon had ultimately forced them to make users select one assistant when setting up their speaker. Amazon said it had never asked Sonos to force users to choose its assistant or Google's version.</p><p>Amazon later changed its position and joined an alliance with Sonos and other companies to make virtual assistants like Alexa function together. Google, along with Apple and Samsung, did not join the alliance.</p><p>Google has maintained, Sonos executives said, that it will pull its assistant from Sonos's speakers if it works alongside any assistant from Amazon, Apple, Microsoft or Baidu, the Chinese internet company. Sonos has followed Google's orders.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY ADAM AMENGUAL FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (B1)</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>''Google has been blatantly and knowingly copying our patented technology,'' Patrick Spence, the Sonos chief executive, said in a statement.

Sonos filed its actions in two venues \u2014 in federal court as well as with the International Trade Commission, the latter being where Sonos is asking for a sales ban on key Google hardware like phones, speakers, and laptops as a result of the alleged patent infringement. The New York Times[2] reported details of the lawsuit on Tuesday, which covers five Sonos wireless speaker design patents and which Sony says stems from a partnership with Google from back in 2013. A partnership the audio company says involved letting Google into the tent so that Sonos speakers could include Google Play Music support \u2014 before Google, the suit alleges, turned around and started using Sonos' technology in its Google Home smart speaker lineup as well as in Pixel phones. </p><p>At the same time, the suit continues, Google was basically subsidizing the sale of its own hardware, hurting Sonos even more.'The harm produced by Google's infringementhas been profoundly compounded by Google's business strategy to use itsmulti-room audio products to vacuum up invaluable consumer data from users and, thus, further entrench theGoogle platform among its users and ultimately fuel its dominant advertising and search platforms,' the suit reads.  'In furtherance of this strategy, Google has not merely copied Sonos's patented technology, it has also subsidized the prices of its patent-infringing products, including at the entry-level, and flooded the market. These actions have caused significant damage to Sonos.' One reason this is particularly bad timing for Google: The tech industry at a high level finds itself in the regulatory crosshairs at the moment, with lawmakers seemingly eager to over-correct for all of the perceived knock-on effects of Big Tech's growth-at-all-cost mantra of prior years. Lawmakers have been especially eager to fine and possibly break up companies like Facebook and Google, for which this new action is but the latest in a growing pile of state and federal investigations into the company's myriad practices that have raised eyebrows. Sonos, in the suit, alluded to the fact that it's had discussions with Google to try and resolve this dispute, but to no avail. 'Over the years, we have had numerous ongoing conversations with Sonos about both companies' IP rights and we are disappointed that Sonos brought these lawsuits instead of continuing negotiations in good faith,' Google spokesman Jose Castaneda, per Axios[3]. 'We dispute these claims and will defend them vigorously.'

A partnership the audio company says involved letting Google into the tent so that Sonos speakers could include Google Play Music support - before Google, the suit alleges, turned around and started using Sonos' technology in its Google Home smart speaker lineup as well as in Pixel phones.</p><p>At the same time, the suit continues, Google was basically subsidizing the sale of its own hardware, hurting Sonos even more.\u00a0\"The harm produced by Google's infringement\u00a0has been profoundly compounded by Google's business strategy to use its\u00a0multi-room audio products to vacuum up invaluable consumer data from users and, thus, further entrench the\u00a0Google platform among its users and ultimately fuel its dominant advertising and search platforms,\" the suit reads. </p><p>\"In furtherance of this strategy, Google has not merely copied Sonos's patented technology, it has also subsidized the prices of its patent-infringing products, including at the entry-level, and flooded the market. These actions have caused significant damage to Sonos.\"</p><p>One reason this is particularly bad timing for Google: The tech industry at a high level finds itself in the regulatory crosshairs at the moment, with lawmakers seemingly eager to over-correct for all of the perceived knock-on effects of Big Tech's growth-at-all-cost mantra of prior years.

For the project, Sonos handed over the effective blueprints to its speakers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It felt like a harmless move, Sonos executives said. Google was an internet company and didn't make speakers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The executives now say they were naive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On Tuesday, Sonos sued Google in two federal court systems, seeking financial damages and a ban on the sale of Google's speakers, smartphones and laptops in the United States. Sonos accused Google of infringing on five of its patents, including technology that lets wireless speakers connect and synchronize with one another.</p><p> The complaints go beyond patents and Google. The legal action is the culmination of years of growing dependence on both Google and Amazon, which then used their leverage to squeeze the smaller company, Sonos executives said.</p><p>Sonos advertises its speakers on Google and sells them on Amazon. It built their music services and talking virtual assistants directly into its products. Sonos workers correspond via Gmail and run the business on Amazon's cloud-computing service.</p><p> Then Google and Amazon came out with their own speakers, undercutting the price of Sonos products and, according to Sonos executives, stealing its technology. Google and Amazon each now sell as many speakers in a few months as Sonos sells in one year.</p><p>Sonos groused privately for years. But during the past several months, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence decided he couldn't take it anymore.</p><p> \"Google has been blatantly and knowingly copying our patented technology,\" Spence said in a statement. \"Despite our repeated and extensive efforts over the last few years, Google has not shown any willingness to work with us on a mutually beneficial solution. We're left with no choice but to litigate.\"</p><p>Sonos executives said they decided to sue only Google because they couldn't risk battling two tech giants in court at once. Yet Spence and congressional staff members have discussed him testifying to a House subcommittee about the issues.</p><p> Jose Castaneda, a Google spokesman, said Google and Sonos have discussed both companies' intellectual property for years, \"and we are disappointed that Sonos brought these lawsuits instead of continuing negotiations in good faith. We dispute these claims and will defend them vigorously.\"</p><p> A spokeswoman for Amazon, Natalie Hereth, said the company did not infringe on Sonos' technology.</p><p> \"The Echo family of devices and our multiroom music technology were developed independently by Amazon,\" she said.</p><p>Sonos sued Google in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and in front of the U.S. International Trade Commission, a quasi-judicial body that decides trade cases and can block the import of goods that violate patents. Sonos sued Google over only five patents but said it believes that Google and Amazon each violated roughly 100. The suits do not specify damages.</p><p> The evolving relationship between Sonos and the tech giants reflects an increasingly common complaint in the corporate world: As the biggest tech companies have become essential to reach customers and build businesses, they have exploited that leverage over smaller companies to steal their ideas and their customers.</p><p> After mostly keeping those grievances private for years because they feared retaliation, many smaller companies are now speaking out, emboldened as America's largest tech firms come under scrutiny.</p><p> Dozens of companies have complained to regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Europe. Spotify has accused Apple of punishing Spotify's iPhone app as it increasingly competes against it. A company called Blix that helps people create anonymous email addresses recently sued Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of copying its technology and then kicking it off Apple's App Store. And Elastic, which builds software that runs on Amazon's cloud service, sued Amazon for copying its branding to introduce a rival offering. Apple and Amazon deny the claims.</p><p> Spence and other Sonos executives said they agonized over the decision to sue Mountain View's Google, largely because Google still underpins their business. Sonos executives suspect that their pressure on the patent issue has complicated other areas of the relationship, though they can't say for sure.</p><p> After Sonos intensified its demands that Google license its technology, Google pushed Sonos to comply with stricter rules for using Google's virtual assistant. Those proposed rules included a mandate to turn over the planned name, design and release date of any products that Google would compete with directly six months in advance, up from 45 days in the current deal, Sonos executives said.</p><p> \"The fear of retaliation is a real fear. Any of these companies could bury them tomorrow. Google could bury them in their search results. Amazon can bury them in their search results,\" said Sally Hubbard, a former assistant attorney general in New York's antitrust bureau who now works at Open Markets Institute, a think tank. \"It's really hard to find any industry where corporations are not dependent on one of the big tech giants.\"</p><p> Fifteen years ago, home sound systems typically meant a tangled network of wires and speakers and complicated instructions on how to make it all work. Then Sonos came along in 2005, promising wireless sound throughout a house, seamlessly controlled from a hand-held device. Its early ads boasted: \"Any song. Any room.\"</p><p>Sonos quickly began patenting its innovations, a stockpile of intellectual property that it now proudly displays on its website.</p><p> Its devices made life a bit more comfortable for people who could afford them, and they were good business for Sonos, based in Santa Barbara. Sales of its devices took off after the advent of the smartphone and music streaming. Sonos now employs about 1,500 people and sells more than $1 billion worth of speakers a year.</p><p> When Sonos teamed up with Google in 2013, it gave Google engineers detailed diagrams on how its speakers interacted wirelessly with one another. At the time, Google was not a competitor.</p><p> Two years later, Google released a small device that could turn an old speaker into a wireless one, much like Sonos' original product. A year after that, Google released the Google Home, marketed around its talking virtual assistant, which quickly began outselling Sonos' offerings.</p><p>Sonos bought the Google devices and used a technique called packet sniffing that monitored the speakers' communications. It discovered that Google's devices used Sonos' approach for solving a variety of technological challenges. Sonos executives said they found Amazon's Echo speakers had also copied Sonos technology.</p><p> In August 2016, Sonos told Google it was infringing. Google had little response. As Google released more products, it violated more patents, Sonos executives said. Over the next three years, Sonos told Google four more times, eventually handing over a list of 100 patents it believed Google had violated. Google responded that Sonos was also infringing on its patents, Sonos executives said, though it never provided much detail.</p><p>Sonos executives said their complaints were hardly just about patents, however. They are concerned that Google and Amazon are flooding the market with cheap speakers that they subsidize because they are not merely conduits for music, like Sonos' devices, but rather another way to sell goods, show ads and collect data.</p><p> An entry-level Sonos speaker costs about $200. Amazon and Google's cheapest speakers are $50, and they often offer them at much steeper discounts.</p><p> In the third quarter of 2019, Amazon sold 10.5 million speakers, and Google 6 million, according to Strategy Analytics. For the 12 months that ended in September, Sonos said it had sold 6.1 million speakers.</p><p> \"Amazon and Google are making it a mass-market product at a price point that Sonos can't match,\" said Jack Narcotta, a Strategy Analytics analyst.</p><p>Amazon said it is focused on creating the best experience for customers and that its virtual assistant had generated \"billions of dollars\" for developers and device-makers.</p><p> To compete, Sonos has had to yield even more power to the companies. When people became hooked on Google and Amazon's virtual assistants, Sonos built them into its speakers.</p><p> But Sonos had a strategy to still stand out, allowing customers to use both assistants simultaneously. Sonos engineers patented the technology to enable them to work side by side, and executives lobbied Amazon and Google to let it happen.</p><p> Hours before a news conference in October 2017, Sonos was preparing to unveil its first speaker with virtual assistants when Amazon product chief Dave Limp called Spence. Limp had just found out Google would also be onstage, and he said Amazon wanted to pull out of the event as a result, according to two people familiar with the conversation.

For the project, Sonos handed over the effective blueprints to its speakers.<br/>It felt like a harmless move, Sonos executives said. Google was an internet company and didn't make speakers.</p><p><br/>The executives now say they were naive.<br/>On Tuesday, Sonos sued Google in two federal court systems, seeking financial damages and a ban on the sale of Google's speakers, smartphones and laptops in the United States. Sonos accused Google of infringing on five of its patents, including technology that lets wireless speakers connect and synchronize with one another.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Sonos' complaints go beyond patents and Google. Its legal action is the culmination of years of growing dependence on both Google and Amazon, which then used their leverage to squeeze the smaller company, Sonos executives said.<br/>Sonos advertises its speakers on Google and sells them on Amazon. It built their music services and talking virtual assistants directly into its products. Sonos workers correspond via Gmail and run the business off Amazon's cloud-computing service.<br/>Then Google and Amazon came out with their own speakers, undercutting Sonos' prices, and according to Sonos executives, stealing its technology. Google and Amazon each now sell as many speakers in a few months as Sonos sells in one year.<br/>Like many companies under the thumb of Big Tech, Sonos groused privately for years. But over the past several months, Patrick Spence, Sonos' chief executive, decided he couldn't take it anymore.<br/>\"Google has been blatantly and knowingly copying our patented technology,\" Spence said in a statement. \"Despite our repeated and extensive efforts over the last few years, Google has not shown any willingness to work with us on a mutually beneficial solution. We're left with no choice but to litigate.\"<br/>Sonos executives said they had decided to sue only Google because they couldn't risk battling two tech giants in court at once. Yet Spence and congressional staff members have discussed his testifying to the House antitrust subcommittee soon about his company's issues with them.<br/>Jose Castaneda, a Google spokesman, said Google and Sonos had discussed both companies' intellectual property for years, \"and we are disappointed that Sonos brought these lawsuits instead of continuing negotiations in good faith.\"<br/>\"We dispute these claims and will defend them vigorously,\" he added<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>A spokeswoman for Amazon, Natalie Hereth, said the company did not infringe on Sonos' technology. \"The Echo family of devices and our multiroom music technology were developed independently by Amazon,\" she said.<br/>Sonos sued Google in US District Court in Los Angeles and in front of the US International Trade Commission, a quasi-judicial body that decides trade cases and can block the import of goods that violate patents. Sonos sued Google over only five patents but said it believed Google and Amazon had each violated roughly 100. Sonos did not say how much it sought in damages.<br/>The evolving relationship between Sonos and the tech giants reflects an increasingly common complaint in the corporate world: As the biggest tech companies have become essential to reach customers and build businesses, they have exploited that leverage over smaller companies to steal their ideas and their customers.<br/>After mostly keeping those grievances private for years because they feared retaliation, many smaller companies are now speaking out, emboldened in an age of growing scrutiny of America's largest tech firms.<br/>Dozens of companies have complained to regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Europe. Spotify has accused Apple of punishing Spotify's iPhone app as it increasingly competes against it. Blix, a company that helps people create anonymous email addresses recently sued Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of copying its technology and then kicking it off Apple's App Store. And Elastic, which builds software that runs on Amazon's cloud platform, sued Amazon for copying its branding to introduce a rival offering. Apple and Amazon deny the claims.<br/>Spence and other Sonos executives said they had agonized over the decision to sue Google, largely because Google still underpins their business. Sonos executives suspect that their pressure on the patent issue has complicated other areas of the relationship, though they can't say for sure.<br/>After Sonos intensified its demands that Google license its technology, Google pushed Sonos to comply with stricter rules for using Google's virtual assistant. Those proposed rules included a mandate to turn over the planned name, design and targeted start date of its future products - which Google would compete directly against - six months in advance, up from 45 days in the current deal, Sonos executives said.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>\"The fear of retaliation is a real fear. Any of these companies could bury them tomorrow. Google could bury them in their search results. Amazon can bury them in their search results,\" said Sally Hubbard, a former assistant attorney general in New York's antitrust bureau who now works at Open Markets Institute, a think tank. \"It's really hard to find any industry where corporations are not dependent on one of the big tech giants.\"<br/>Fifteen years ago, home sound systems typically meant a tangled network of wires and speakers and complicated instructions on how to make it all work. Then Sonos came along in 2005, promising wireless sound throughout a house, seamlessly controlled from a hand-held device. Its early ads boasted: \"Any song. Any room.\"<br/>Sonos quickly began patenting its innovations, a stockpile of intellectual property it now proudly displays on its website.<br/>Its devices made life a bit more comfortable for consumers who could afford them, and they made for a nice little business for Sonos, which is based a few miles from the Southern California coast in Santa Barbara. Sales of its devices took off after the advent of the smartphone and music streaming. Sonos now employs about 1,500 people and sells more than $1 billion in speakers a year.<br/>When Sonos teamed up with Google in 2013, it gave Google engineers detailed diagrams on how its speakers interacted wirelessly with one another. At the time, Google was not a competitor.<br/>Two years later, Google released a small device that could turn an old speaker into a wireless one, much like Sonos' original product. A year after that, Google released its own wireless speaker, the Google Home. The device, marketed around Google's talking virtual assistant, quickly began outselling Sonos' offerings.<br/>Sonos bought the Google devices and used a technique called packet sniffing that monitored how the speakers were communicating. They discovered that Google's devices used Sonos' approach for solving a variety of technological challenges. Sonos executives said they had found Amazon's Echo speakers also copied Sonos technology.<br/>In August 2016, Sonos told Google it was infringing. Google had little response. As Google released more products, it violated more patents, Sonos executives said. Over the next three years, Sonos told Google four more times, eventually handing over a list of 100 patents it believed Google had violated. Google responded that Sonos was also infringing on its patents, Sonos executives said, though it never provided much detail.<br/>When Sonos delivered a proposed model for Google to pay licensing fees, Google returned its own model that resulted in its paying almost nothing, Sonos executives said.<br/>Sonos executives said their complaints were hardly just about patents, however. They are concerned that Google and Amazon are flooding the market with cheap speakers that they subsidize because they are not merely conduits for music, like Sonos' devices, but rather another way to sell goods, show ads and collect data.<br/>Sonos' entry-level speaker is about $200. Amazon and Google's cheapest speakers are $50, and they often offer them at much steeper discounts.<br/>In the third quarter of 2019, Amazon shipped 10.5 million speakers, and Google 6 million, according to Strategy Analytics. For the 12 months ending in September, Sonos said it had sold 6.1 million speakers.<br/>\"Amazon and Google are making it a mass-market product at a price point that Sonos can't match,\" said Jack Narcotta, a Strategy Analytics analyst.<br/>Amazon said it was focused on creating the best experience for customers and that its virtual assistant had generated \"billions of dollars\" for developers and device-makers.<br/>To compete, Sonos has had to yield even more power to the companies. When consumers became hooked on Google and Amazon's virtual assistants, Sonos also built them into its speakers.<br/>But Sonos had a strategy to still stand out on store shelves. Instead of being locked into using just one of the assistants, Sonos customers could use both simultaneously. Sonos engineers patented the technology to enable the assistants to work side by side, and executives lobbied Amazon and Google to let it happen.<br/>At first, the companies hated the idea. Hours before a New York news conference in October 2017, Sonos was preparing to unveil its first speaker with virtual assistants when Amazon product chief Dave Limp called Spence. Limp had just found out Google would also be onstage, and he said Amazon was now pulling out of the event as a result, according to two people familiar with the conversation. After negotiations, Amazon relented.<br/>Sonos executives said Google and Amazon had ultimately forced them to make users select one assistant when setting up their speaker. Amazon said it had never asked Sonos to force users to choose its assistant or Google's version.<br/>Amazon later changed its position and joined an alliance with Sonos and other companies to make virtual assistants like Alexa function together. Google, along with Apple and Samsung, did not join the alliance.<br/>Google has maintained, Sonos executives said, that it will pull its assistant from Sonos' speakers if it worked alongside any assistant from Amazon, Apple, Microsoft or Baidu, the Chinese internet company. Sonos has followed Google's orders.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-486313</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXS-C1H1-JBYT-H0SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1687\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Earnest's parents said they raised him and his five siblings in a family, faith and community that rejected hate.</p><p>\"Our son's actions were informed by people we do not know, and ideas we do not hold,\" the parents said in a statement, which didn't include their names.</p><p>A gunman on Saturday burst into the Chabad of Poway near San Diego on the last day of Passover, a major Jewish holiday that celebrates freedom, and opened fire with an assault-style rifle, killing a woman and wounding a rabbi and two others.</p><p>\"How our son was attracted to such darkness is a terrifying mystery to us, though we are confident that law enforcement will uncover many details of the path that he took to this evil and despicable act,\" the statement said.</p><p>Earnest's parents, who are cooperating with investigators, said their sadness \"pales in comparison to the grief and anguish our son has caused for so many innocent people.\"</p><p>Earll Pott, a family attorney who issued the statement, said the parents will not provide a legal defense for their son, who will likely be represented by a public defender. </p><p>About five minutes before the attack, the FBI said it received tips about a threatening  post.</p><p>The tips to an FBI website and hotline included a link to the anonymous post but did not offer specific information about its author or the location of the threat. The bureau said Monday that employees immediately tried to determine who wrote the post, but the shooting occurred before they could establish his identity.</p><p>One of the tipsters told The Associated Press that he called the FBI tip line at 11:15 a.m. Saturday because the post linked to a manifesto that said the author was responsible for a mosque arson in  Escondido last month. He says he found out online that  the mosque attack had happened and feared the new threat was real.</p><p>The tipster, who refused to provide his name because of security concerns, said the call with the FBI lasted four or five minutes and the shooting happened soon after. He described the FBI as quick and professional and said he doesn't know what the bureau could have done.</p><p>The shooting happened around 11:30 a.m., and Earnest surrendered moments afterward. He is being held on suspicion of murder and attempted murder.</p><p>The anti-Jewish online manifesto written by a person identifying himself as John Earnest was posted just hours before the attack on a fringe social network called 8chan where users on the anonymous message board - which the Anti-Defamation League has compared to \"round-the-clock digital white supremacist rallies\" - cheered on the gunman. 8chan is the same service that the alleged gunman in the New Zealand attacks used to blast his message of hate.</p><p>The pair of manifestos that appeared to preview real-world violence is rekindling calls for policymakers to look beyond  Facebook, YouTube and Twitter to curtail the spread of harmful content. Tech experts and civil rights advocates say there's far less awareness of the role extremist enclaves such as 8chan - which does not appear in Google searches  and is blocked by many corporate firewalls - play in stoking hate. </p><p>\"The consequences of such a concentrated echo chamber of hate has played out multiple times around the world,\" Oren Segal, the director of the ADL's Center on Extremism, said. \"At this point, we believe that if certain companies can't take responsibility to regulate themselves, to protect their users, to protect others, then perhaps it's time for policymakers to step in and to regulate them.\"</p><p>In a tweet over the weekend, 8chan said it took swift action to remove the post that appeared connected with the attack. But in the aftermath of the New Zealand attack, experts in online extremism said white supremacists' discussions on the forum appeared similar to online activity typically tied to Islamic militants. </p><p>Some experts are calling for the website - which describes itself as the \"darkest reaches of the Internet\" - to be monitored like a terrorist recruiting website, so law enforcement would intervene more when chatter becomes violent.</p><p>While the House held a hearing on white nationalism last month, experts said there wasn't nearly enough attention paid to these fringe sites. </p><p>But it may not just be up to policymakers or law enforcement: There could be a role to play for Big Tech to stop the spread of hateful content even from fringe sites.</p><p>Alex Stamos, the former chief security officer at Facebook, tweeted that technology platforms should ban content from services like 8chan and other sites known as hotbeds for white supremacist terrorism. \"While they work on improving the quality of moderation using their current standards, I would also propose a much more extreme step: a blockade of the small number of sites responsible for the majority of WST community and recruiting,\" he tweeted. </p><p>The Washington Post contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ORSENT-OS0094287771</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ORSENT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0V-68B1-JBM5-R4RB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11974</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sentinel Communications Co.
