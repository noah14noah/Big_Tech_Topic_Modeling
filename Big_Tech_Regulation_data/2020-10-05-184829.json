Josh Hawley of Missouri asked Apple CEO Tim Cook Tuesday to implement his 'Do Not Track' option as the big tech giant faces scrutiny over how much data it obtains through its application store. Hawley, a Republican, sent a letter [1]to Cook imploring him to do a better job of protecting customer's private data. </p><p>The letter comes a few days after Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference, in which the company introduced new features protecting consumer's data. 'But you can still do better,' he wrote in the letter after noting the new features. Apple announced Monday that it will restrict apps from tracking users' geo-location and tapping into data at random moments without explicit permission.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Hawley announced legislation in May that creates a program[2] giving people the power to prevent online companies from collecting any more data than what is otherwise necessary for the companies' services. It also prohibits entities like Google from profiling Americans who activate the so-called Do Not Track program. The bill only has one-sponsor but received bipartisan support when Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, a Democrat, voiced her support for the measure. Hawley impressed upon Cook the importance of taking up a 'No Track' program \u2014 his letter takes up particular importance as lawmakers signal their intent to open antitrust probes against big tech. 'My bill takes a giant leap toward ending the greedy data-grabbing practices of bad-actor companies,' Hawley wrote. 'But this effort should not be led by Congress alone. You have it in your power to make good on your promise to be an industry leader. You should do so by implementing the principles behind my Do Not Track bill immediately.' Hawley has made a name for himself recently as a Republican who is lending some intellectual might to concerns about the nature of big tech. He hasintroduced several pieces [3]of legislation aimed at cracking down on what conservatives believe is Google's misuse of consumers' private data.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) One bill, introduced May 14,requires[4]President Donald Trump to restrict any technology to China that would contribute to the communist country's military. That legislation, if it passes, places heavy restrictions on technology that influences artificial intelligence, semiconductors and robots. It also restricts any kind of tech China might use to violate human rights. Another piece oflegislation bans[5]'pay-to-win' apps targeted at children, which pay for upgrades and other rewards even though the applications are initially provided for free. Hawley cited Candy Crush as one of the biggest culprits of leveraging children's willingness to learn for profit. His flurry of parliamentary procedure comes as conservatives haggle over how to approach regulating Facebook and Twitter. Hawley's letter Tuesday also comes as news reports[6] describe the extent of Apple's ability to gather enormous troves of data on iPhone users, oftentimes without their knowledge or consent. Apple has traditionally touted itself as more privacy-oriented than other tech giants, including Facebook and Google, both of which rely on collecting user data as a central part of their business model.

They were playing us like a bunch of colonial supplicants and suckers.\u201d</p><p>The story of how Toronto walked back the Google plan is in part a tale of locals taking on a big company. But it also reflects a growing pushback around the world against big tech that has accelerated since Sidewalk Labs unveiled its proposal.</p><p>In the United States, several of the Democratic presidential hopefuls have described Google, Facebook and other <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sidewalklabs.com/\">tech giants as monopolies</url> that should be scrutinized for antitrust violations. Europe has seen a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sidewalklabs.com/\">flurry of new laws around online content</url>and Britain has floated the idea of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sidewalklabs.com/\">an internet regulator.</url></p><p>In Canada, even Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government, which has actively pursued investments by multinational tech giants, is proposing to<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sidewalklabs.com/\">follow the lead of France and tax digital services</url>.</p><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s been a significant shift in attitudes and public understanding of what\u2019s at stake and the issues with these tech giants,\u201d said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sidewalklabs.com/\">Andrew Clement</url>, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto\u2019s faculty of information who studies digital surveillance and infrastructure.</p><p>\u201cTo let in an enormous company that I would say has not shown much respect for governmental institutions even in the United States, one that has a rather expansive vision of its role as a political and economic actor, strikes me as a kind of Faustian bargain,\u201d he said.</p><p>The message of Mr. Balsillie and other prominent critics is blunt: They argue that foreign tech investment in Canada ultimately sucks knowledge out of the country, creating a net drain on the economy. Mr. Balsillie described Sidewalk\u2019s Toronto plan as a move by Google to use data from people\u2019s lives in the physical world in the same way it now exploits their online lives \u2014 an assertion that Sidewalk vigorously denies.</p><p>\u201cThis is the mother lode,\u201d Mr. Balsillie said. \u201cYour offline data is way more valuable than your online data \u2014 and your online data is really valuable.\u201d</p><p>The project, known as Quayside, came about when Waterfront Toronto <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sidewalklabs.com/\">set up a competition in 2017</url>to redevelop a 12-acre parcel of Toronto\u2019s formerly industrial shoreline along Lake Ontario.</p><p>Long abandoned, the land features an old grain elevator, a gravel parking lot and an emergency shelter for the homeless. But it sits beside a potentially enormous development prize: 800 acres mostly owned by the federal government, and the largest undeveloped tract in downtown Toronto.</p><p>Sidewalk, founded by Google in 2015 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sidewalklabs.com/\">to develop technologies to improve urban life</url>, won the first round of the contest. Its idea was to create a so-called city of the future that would marry technological innovation to shape urban planning and design.</p><p>High-rises made from engineered wood would replace weed lots and underused warehouses along streets. Bike paths would melt snow. Giant awnings would shelter pedestrians from rain or blazing summer sun. Sensors would track residents\u2019 every movement to optimize everything from traffic signals to underground armies of robots delivering parcels and discarding trash.</p><p>And all of it would meet ambitious environmental standards.</p><p>Critics pounced. How would Sidewalk use the data it gathered from the streets, washrooms and even the garbage bins, they asked. Who would own the data? How would it be stored?</p><p>Several people, including Mr. Balsillie, rejected Sidewalk\u2019s fundamental premise that algorithms, rather than politics, are the best way to design and run a city. And some argued that the project appeared to be a means of promoting concepts such as self-driving cars and other interests of Google, which, like Sidewalk, is a subsidiary of Alphabet.</p><p>\u201cThis is about corporate capture of governance and privatizing governments,\u201d said Bianca Wylie, who has long pushed for citizen access to data and who co-founded Block Sidewalk, the largest group opposing the plan.</p><p>Sidewalk, she said, has \u201cwonderfully intelligent people working there, and they care about cities.\u201d</p><p>But, Ms. Wylie added, \u201cThe problem is that nobody gets to buy democracy and governance.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Balsillie took an unlikely leading role in the opposition, appearing regularly on television and radio, writing newspaper op-eds and consulting with the Canadian government on the project.</p><p>Dan Doctoroff, Sidewalk\u2019s chief executive, makes little effort to hide his irritation when presented with Mr. Balsillie\u2019s oft-repeated argument that the project was a back door for Google to use data from the physical world in the way it uses online data.</p><p>\u201cThat is completely untrue,\u201d Mr. Doctoroff said. \u201cHe has never uncovered a shred of evidence of that being the case. And so I think that allegation is irresponsible. We have always said that there is no connection to Google.\u201d</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sidewalklabs.com/\">low point for Sidewalk came last June</url> when it released thousands of pages of its master development plan, blindsiding many people in Toronto with a more expansive vision than originally proposed.</p><p>Instead of a 12-acre project, the master plan covered the full 800 acres adjacent to the original parcel. Sidewalk proposed receiving a cut of future property taxes from the neighborhood in exchange for building a rail transit line there. That funding idea was ultimately withdrawn.</p><p>While Mr. Doctoroff said Waterfront Toronto had requested a broader vision, he acknowledged that Sidewalk had overreached.</p><p>\u201cIt was just too big certainly until we have proven ourselves at a smaller scale,\u201d he said. \u201cBut while we still have negotiations to come, we believe that a large percentage of what we hoped to do will still be possible.\u201d</p><p>But after strong public blowback, the plan is back to 12 acres. The super awnings are gone. The self-heating paving stones that were to be used to create snow-melting bike lanes may also be abandoned, a spokeswoman acknowledged, given that any route will run only for a couple of blocks.</p><p>The trash robots? They may not be possible with the smaller scale. The huge engineered wood beams will still be used, but originally they were to come from a factory that Sidewalk would help establish, an investment that the scaled-down project cannot justify on its own.</p><p>After negotiations, Sidewalk <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sidewalklabs.com/\">proposed that Waterfront Toronto itself set the rules</url>covering data use and that the information be stored in an open \u201cdata trust\u201d managed by the agency.</p><p>But the company has yet to persuade a variety of critics that the revised proposal imposes acceptable limits on the use of the information, or even the need to gather it.</p><p>Last month a panel of technology experts assembled by Waterfront Toronto, including Professor Clement, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sidewalklabs.com/\">released a report</url> on Sidewalk\u2019s proposal questioning \u201cwhether sufficient benefits had been identified to justify the proposed collection or use of data.\u201d</p><p>The group also raised concerns about the rules surrounding data ownership and use, and about \u201cthe accountability\u201d of Sidewalk, given that it has Alphabet\u2019s resources behind it.</p><p>Still, Sidewalk does have many boosters, including Richard Florida, an urban studies professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Rotman School of Management.</p><p>\u201cI think they made the project better,\u201d said Professor Florida, who acknowledged that he had done some work for a company that is advising Sidewalk. \u201cWhen I go to American cities people go crazy on me and say, \u2018Please bring it here, can we please have it here?\u2019\u201d</p><p>But Mr. Balsillie hopes the city rejects even the mini-version of Sidewalk\u2019s urban future.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a mangled and failing project, it\u2019s 90 percent dead,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve called for is to restart it and do it right.\u201d</p><p>PHOTOS: Google\u2019s offices in Kitchener, Ontario, are its largest in Canada. The company\u2019s plan to create a Sidewalk Labs development in Toronto has been met with considerable opposition. Jim Balsillie, left, has been a prominent critic. \u201cThey were playing us like a bunch of colonial supplicants and suckers,\u201d he said.

It is the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management, not Rotman School of Business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CORRECTION APPENDED</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Faced with an array of opponents for its sensor-laden city of tomorrow in Toronto, a Google sibling has drastically dialed back plans. The critics now want the tech giant to quit altogether.</p><p>TORONTO - The announcement was big enough for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fly down to Toronto and deliver. A corporate sibling of Google had been selected to transform a largely abandoned port area in Toronto into an innovative, sensor-laden, tech-centric city of tomorrow.</p><p>But almost from the time of its unveiling, the project - which combined environmentally advanced construction with a plan for sensors to track residents' movements and actions - was hit by formidable opposition. Critics cast it as a recipe for a surveillance-driven, corporate-controlled urban dystopia and objected to turning over public spaces to one of the world's wealthiest companies.</p><p>Now, nearly two and a half years later, the opponents have shown that even if you can't fight city hall, you can take on Google and succeed.</p><p>After admitting that it had underestimated privacy worries with its original plan, the Google sibling, Sidewalk Labs, has retreated. A couple of weeks ago, it unveiled details of a much watered-down plan along with new privacy protections. But some critics remain unconvinced. Waterfront Toronto, a government agency, will announce in May if the project will proceed.</p><p>\"This thing has blown up on them,\" said one of the plan's leading critics, Jim Balsillie, who as a co-chief executive of Research in Motion helped make the BlackBerry the world's first successful smartphone and himself into one of Canada's biggest names in tech. \"I smoked them out. They were playing us like a bunch of colonial supplicants and suckers.\"</p><p>The story of how Toronto walked back the Google plan is in part a tale of locals taking on a big company. But it also reflects a growing pushback around the world against big tech that has accelerated since Sidewalk Labs unveiled its proposal.</p><p>In the United States, several of the Democratic presidential hopefuls have described Google, Facebook and other tech giants as monopolies that should be scrutinized for antitrust violations. Europe has seen a flurry of new laws around online content and Britain has floated the idea of an internet regulator.</p><p>In Canada, even Mr. Trudeau's government, which has actively pursued investments by multinational tech giants, is proposing to follow the lead of France and tax digital services.</p><p>\"I think there's been a significant shift in attitudes and public understanding of what's at stake and the issues with these tech giants,\" said Andrew Clement, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto's faculty of information who studies digital surveillance and infrastructure.</p><p>\"To let in an enormous company that I would say has not shown much respect for governmental institutions even in the United States, one that has a rather expansive vision of its role as a political and economic actor, strikes me as a kind of Faustian bargain,\" he said.</p><p>The message of Mr. Balsillie and other prominent critics is blunt: They argue that foreign tech investment in Canada ultimately sucks knowledge out of the country, creating a net drain on the economy. Mr. Balsillie described Sidewalk's Toronto plan as a move by Google to use data from people's lives in the physical world in the same way it now exploits their online lives - an assertion that Sidewalk vigorously denies.</p><p>\"This is the mother lode,\" Mr. Balsillie said. \"Your offline data is way more valuable than your online data - and your online data is really valuable.\"</p><p>The project, known as Quayside, came about when Waterfront Toronto set up a competition in 2017 to redevelop a 12-acre parcel of Toronto's formerly industrial shoreline along Lake Ontario.</p><p>Long abandoned, the land features an old grain elevator, a gravel parking lot and an emergency shelter for the homeless. But it sits beside a potentially enormous development prize: 800 acres mostly owned by the federal government, and the largest undeveloped tract in downtown Toronto.</p><p>Sidewalk, founded by Google in 2015 to develop technologies to improve urban life, won the first round of the contest. Its idea was to create a so-called city of the future that would marry technological innovation to shape urban planning and design.</p><p>High-rises made from engineered wood would replace weed lots and underused warehouses along streets. Bike paths would melt snow. Giant awnings would shelter pedestrians from rain or blazing summer sun. Sensors would track residents' every movement to optimize everything from traffic signals to underground armies of robots delivering parcels and discarding trash.</p><p>And all of it would meet ambitious environmental standards.</p><p>Critics pounced. How would Sidewalk use the data it gathered from the streets, washrooms and even the garbage bins, they asked. Who would own the data? How would it be stored?</p><p>Several people, including Mr. Balsillie, rejected Sidewalk's fundamental premise that algorithms, rather than politics, are the best way to design and run a city. And some argued that the project appeared to be a means of promoting concepts such as self-driving cars and other interests of Google, which, like Sidewalk, is a subsidiary of Alphabet.</p><p>\"This is about corporate capture of governance and privatizing governments,\" said Bianca Wylie, who has long pushed for citizen access to data and who co-founded Block Sidewalk, the largest group opposing the plan.</p><p>Sidewalk, she said, has \"wonderfully intelligent people working there, and they care about cities.\"</p><p>But, Ms. Wylie added, \"The problem is that nobody gets to buy democracy and governance.\"</p><p>Mr. Balsillie took an unlikely leading role in the opposition, appearing regularly on television and radio, writing newspaper op-eds and consulting with the Canadian government on the project.</p><p>Dan Doctoroff, Sidewalk's chief executive, makes little effort to hide his irritation when presented with Mr. Balsillie's oft-repeated argument that the project was a back door for Google to use data from the physical world in the way it uses online data.</p><p>\"That is completely untrue,\" Mr. Doctoroff said. \"He has never uncovered a shred of evidence of that being the case. And so I think that allegation is irresponsible. We have always said that there is no connection to Google.\"</p><p>The low point for Sidewalk came last June when it released thousands of pages of its master development plan, blindsiding many people in Toronto with a more expansive vision than originally proposed.</p><p>Instead of a 12-acre project, the master plan covered the full 800 acres adjacent to the original parcel. Sidewalk proposed receiving a cut of future property taxes from the neighborhood in exchange for building a rail transit line there. That funding idea was ultimately withdrawn.</p><p>While Mr. Doctoroff said Waterfront Toronto had requested a broader vision, he acknowledged that Sidewalk had overreached.</p><p>\"It was just too big certainly until we have proven ourselves at a smaller scale,\" he said. \"But while we still have negotiations to come, we believe that a large percentage of what we hoped to do will still be possible.\"</p><p>But after strong public blowback, the plan is back to 12 acres. The super awnings are gone. The self-heating paving stones that were to be used to create snow-melting bike lanes may also be abandoned, a spokeswoman acknowledged, given that any route will run only for a couple of blocks.</p><p>The trash robots? They may not be possible with the smaller scale. The huge engineered wood beams will still be used, but originally they were to come from a factory that Sidewalk would help establish, an investment that the scaled-down project cannot justify on its own.</p><p>After negotiations, Sidewalk proposed that Waterfront Toronto itself set the rules covering data use and that the information be stored in an open \"data trust\" managed by the agency.</p><p>But the company has yet to persuade a variety of critics that the revised proposal imposes acceptable limits on the use of the information, or even the need to gather it.</p><p>Last month a panel of technology experts assembled by Waterfront Toronto, including Professor Clement, released a report on Sidewalk's proposal questioning \"whether sufficient benefits had been identified to justify the proposed collection or use of data.\"</p><p>The group also raised concerns about the rules surrounding data ownership and use, and about \"the accountability\" of Sidewalk, given that it has Alphabet's resources behind it.</p><p>Still, Sidewalk does have many boosters, including Richard Florida, an urban studies professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.</p><p>\"I think they made the project better,\" said Professor Florida, who acknowledged that he had done some work for a company that is advising Sidewalk. \"When I go to American cities people go crazy on me and say, 'Please bring it here, can we please have it here?'\"</p><p>But Mr. Balsillie hopes the city rejects even the mini-version of Sidewalk's urban future.</p><p>\"It's a mangled and failing project, it's 90 percent dead,\" he said. \"What I've called for is to restart it and do it right.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006978159</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD8-FP31-DYR7-C18J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1643\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 12, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001W7E</classCode><className>BLACKBERRY LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The service being provided is that of a matchmaker, finding two people who could profitably trade or communicate but haven't done so yet because transaction costs were too high without a trusted intermediary.</p><p><br/>The platform business model also leverages one of the more powerful forces in the economy - network effects - to scale quickly and maintain momentum behind the entire ecosystem. Network effects mean the product or service increases in value with the total number of customers. The classic example is the telephone: The more people who have one, the more useful each phone is.<br/>Platforms that serve multiple customer groups can also have indirect network effects, meaning that when one user group grows, the platform becomes more valuable to a complementary user group. Operating systems are a case in point: Developers' demand for adopting a particular operating system depends on the number of users, and users' demand depends on the number of developers creating applications.<br/>If an operating system can reach critical mass - the point at which the value of the platform exceeds its cost for a large number of customers - it can engage a powerful flywheel effect where more users create more value for developers and vice versa. Research has shown that the social benefit from someone buying a new computer can exceed the private benefit due to these indirect network effects.<br/>A successful platform can decrease search costs and reduce deadweight loss by brokering exchanges that never would have happened without it. But before a platform reaches that point, it must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem caused by the interdependence of demand between the customer groups. Who wants to join a two-sided market with no one on the other side? One way to solve this problem is for the platform operator to subsidize one side (usually the one with the higher elasticity of demand or the one that creates more value for the platform) by raising prices on what's known as the \"money side.\"<br/>Where the Network Effects Are: A Taxonomy<br/>The charts below map the digital and analog markets with significant network effects. The vertical axis measures how strong their indirect network effects are, and the horizontal axis measures how strong their direct network effects are.<br/>Communications networks have the strongest direct network effects - in which each user benefits when a similar user joins - of any platforms. Their raison d'\u00eatre is to enable people to interact with others. WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Slack, iMessage, and Snapchat all serve this purpose, and collectively they have billions of users. In the pre-Internet age, the phone and fax machines were communications networks that also grew in value with their size.<br/>Marketplaces facilitate transactions between two or more distinct groups and help minimize transaction costs, which results in more exchanges and an increase in social welfare. From the analog era, we have shopping malls that match retailers and shoppers; flea markets that match buyers and sellers; and nightclubs that match singles (n.b.: ladies' night means that women are the subsidy side of the market and men are the money side). In the digital economy, there are eBay, Craigslist, and Amazon Marketplace for matching merchants and customers; Uber and Lyft for matching drivers and riders; Postmates and GrubHub for restaurants and eaters; and Airbnb for hosts and guests.<br/>Social media networks like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, Reddit, YouTube, and LinkedIn combine the direct network effects of communications networks (the \"social\" part of the name) with the matchmaking of marketplaces. Social media networks aggregate attention and then sell pieces of it to advertisers for targeted campaigns. Newspapers, magazines, television, and radio used to be the primary platforms for this latter function in the pre-Digital Era.<br/>Platforms, such as operating systems and video game consoles, are ecosystems of users and developers and demonstrate both strong direct network effects (many apps that involve communication and collaboration become more useful with more users) and indirect network effects (app developers want more users and users want more apps), with the result that these markets tend toward oligopoly. Today, there are only three big personal computing platforms: Windows, which leads the desktop OS market with more than 88 percent market share, and Android and iOS, which together have almost 97 percent of the mobile and tablet OS market. \u00a0\u00a0Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo control almost the entire video game console market.<br/>Data networks are a new type of network that did not exist before the Internet made collecting, analyzing, and applying large datasets economical. Waze uses a driver's speed and location to improve routing and navigation for other users of the app. Yelp and Netflix collect data and ratings to improve recommendations for users. AncestryDNA and 23andMe create databases of their customers' genetic data, which are then used to improve genetic analysis for those same customers. All of these data networks have direct network effects, i.e., after each user's data is added to the network, the value of the service provided by the network increases to every user.<br/>Network Effects Aren't What They Used To Be<br/>Last century, all the action revolved around the desktop computer. This century, the multiplicity of devices and ease of direct communication means platforms can quickly find themselves cut out or replaced. Here are a few reasons why network effects may not be as strong in the 21st century as they were in the 20th century:<br/>The proliferation of physical devices and digital platforms lowers switching costs.<br/>Network effects have become highly localized, diminishing the advantage large networks have over small networks.<br/>Network effects can be negative due to congestion, competition, advertising, and spam.<br/>Users have an incentive to go off-platform for repeat business or high-value transactions.<br/>In light of the empirical evidence, antitrust regulators should proceed on a case-by-case basis in markets with platform business models, identifying negative and positive network effects and determining if they are diminishing, increasing, or constant before making conclusions about market power.<br/>Read the full comment we submitted to the FTC here.<br/>The post You Can't Understand Big Tech Without Understanding Network Effects.

The above quote[1] is not about Democrat-nominee hopeful Elizabeth Warren's policy views on sport. It is in fact an analogy to her proposal of splitting Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple ('GAFA') apart from their respective ancillary lines of business, a solution to one of the current hot topics in antitrust law, namely the alleged practice of GAFA exploiting the popularity of their platforms to gain competitive advantages in neighboring markets. Can a 'referee' favor its own 'players' in the digital platform game?</p><p> Can we blame the 'referee' if one 'player' knocks out another? Should the 'referee' be forced to intervene to protect said 'player'? The analogy reflects a growing concern that platform owners' entry into adjacent markets that are, or theoretically could be, served by independent firms creates an irreconcilable misalignment between the interests of users, independent companies and platform owners. As Margrethe Vestager, European Competition Commissioner and Vice-President of the European Commission ('EC'), has said[2]:[O]ne of the biggest issues we face is with platform businesses that also compete in other markets, with companies that depend on the platform. That means that the very same business becomes both player and referee, competing with others that rely on the platform, but also setting the rules that govern that competition.Whether and to what extent successful firms in digital markets can enter and compete in neighboring markets, utilizing their existing expertise, has matured into an existential question that plagues and polarizes the antitrust community. Perhaps the most famous and debated case is the EC's 2017 decision[3] in Google Shopping, where it concluded that Google's preferential placement of its comparison shopping results in a special box at the top of its search pages constituted an abuse of a dominant position under Article 102 TFEU. The EC found that such prominent placement, coupled with the denial of access to the box for rival price comparison websites, had the effect of driving traffic to Google's own shopping site, depriving Google's rivals of user-traffic. Google is strongly contesting both the facts and theory underpinning this decision in its appeal, the hearing for which took place in February. Meanwhile, complaints in relation to Google's similar treatment of its other ancillary services, such as vacation rentals, have followed suit[4]. Similar allegations have been made against Apple (see e.g. here[5]), Amazon (see e.g. here[6]) and Facebook (see e.g. here[7]) for the way they design their platforms and organize their search results.[KS1][8]What links these cases, investigations and accusations is the doctrine of leverage, i.e. the practice of exploiting one's market power in one market in order to extend that power to an adjacent market. Importantly, leveraging is not a standalone theory of harm in antitrust law: it is more appropriately regarded as a category of conduct where competitive effects are felt in a neighboring market (think tying, refusals to deal, margin squeeze, etc.). Examples of such conduct in the platform context could include platform owners: promoting their own adjacent products/services in search result pages; bundling, tying or pre-installing their adjacent products/services with platform software code; shutting off access to Application Programming Interfaces or data to third parties to decrease the relative interoperability of their rivals' products/services; or generally reducing the compatibility of third-party products/services with the platform as a means of distribution. This post examines various proposals that have been put forward to solve the alleged prevalence of anticompetitive leveraging in digital platform markets, namely:  blocking platform owners from also owning adjacent products/services;prohibiting 'favoring' or 'self-preferencing' behavior (i.e. enforcing a non-discrimination standard); and reversing the burden of proof so that dominant platform firms bear the burden of showing that such conduct does not harm competition.  Each of these proposals would abrogate the 'consumer welfare standard' baked into antitrust law, which permits exclusionary behavior as long as it constitutes 'competition on the merits', i.e. that the conduct ultimately benefits consumers. As Judge Frank Easterbrook has mercilessly held[9], 'injuries to rivals are byproducts of vigorous competition, and the antitrust laws are not balm for rivals' wounds.' Antitrust law maintains a distinction between pro- and anti-competitive leveraging because consumers frequently benefit from the conduct outlined above. Conversely, implementing any of the above proposals would decrease or negate entirely the ability of platform owners to show that such conduct benefits consumers. This post then examines whether protecting competition in adjacent markets is important enough to sacrifice the consumer benefits that flow from pro-competitive leveraging. Empirical criteria that have been present in comparable instances of such intervention, such as bottleneck power over distribution, evidence of widespread harm to competition in neighboring markets, static product boundaries, and a lack or unimportance of integrative efficiencies, are not satisfied in the current context. Absent some proof that they are, the consumer welfare framework under antitrust law should prevail without recourse to more intrusive intervention. Proposals to regulate the activities of digital platform owners in neighboring markets 1. Structural separation Some scholars, such as Lina Khan, propose[10] to implement '[s]tructural remedies and prophylactic bans [to] limit the ability of dominant platforms to enter certain distinct lines of business.' Senator Warren has echoed this proposal, calling for[11] 'large tech platforms to be designated as 'Platform Utilities' and broken apart from any participant on that platform.' Under this proposal, Amazon would be unable to act both as an online marketplace and a seller on its own marketplace, Google would be unable to act as both a search engine and a mapping provider, and Apple and Google would be unable to act as both producers of mobile operating systems and apps that run on those operating systems. Meanwhile, Facebook would be unable to operate both its core social media platform and separate services, such as dating, local buy-and-sell, and other businesses like Instagram and WhatsApp. Khan posits that such separation is the primary method of 'prevent[ing] leveraging and eliminat[ing] a core conflict of interest currently embedded in the business model of dominant platforms.'A rule that prohibits entry into neighboring markets will certainly catch all instances of harmful leveraging, but it will inevitably also condemn all instances of leveraging that are in fact beneficial to consumers (see below for examples). Moreover, structural separation would also condemn efficiencies stemming from vertical integration that do not depend on leveraging behavior, e.g. elimination of double marginalization. As Bruce Owen sums up[12], such intervention 'is not necessary, and may well reduce welfare by deterring efficient investments,' in circumstances where '[e]mpirical evidence that vertical integration or vertical restraints are harmful is weak, compared to evidence that vertical integration is beneficial.' 2. Non-discrimination principles Other scholars seek[13] a prohibition on leveraging, i.e. a 'non-discrimination' or 'platform neutrality' standard whereby platform owners cannot treat third-party products/services differently to how they treat their own. Though framed as a regulatory regime operating in parallel to antitrust law, such regulation would have the effect of supplanting antitrust in favor of a standard that blocks all leveraging behavior, whether pro- or anti-competitive. For example, Apple and Google could still produce both apps and software platforms, but they would be unable to bundle them together, even if doing so improves the user experience (or benefits app developers). This proposal also disregards the distinction between pro- and anti-competitive leveraging (albeit in a less intrusive manner than structural separation). It would, however, appear to maintain efficiencies stemming solely from vertical integration, as long as said benefits do not result in preferential treatment of the platform owner's products/services. 3. Reversing the burden of proof Though not regulatory in nature, it is also worth including the proposal in the EC's expert report[14] on 'competition in the digital era' of recalibrating the legal analysis of leveraging conduct by 'err[ing] on the side of disallowing potentially anti-competitive conducts, and impos[ing] on the incumbent the burden of proof for showing the pro-competitiveness of its conduct.' Under this proposal, once a plaintiff establishes that leveraging conduct exists (without having to establish that it satisfies pre-existing legal criteria), the defendant would bear the burden of showing that its conduct did not have long-run anti-competitive effects or that the conduct had an overriding efficiency rationale. As Dolmans and Pesch point out[15], proving that conduct does not have a long-term impact on competition may be nigh on impossible, as it involves proving a negative. This proposal would therefore bring non-discrimination in by the back door and return antitrust law to form-based rules that neglect the actual effects of conduct on competition or consumers. Moreover, making it unduly difficult for dominant firms to show that their conduct is in fact pro-competitive, despite any exclusionary effects, would similarly collapse an effects-based model for leveraging conduct into blanket non-discrimination. The report's authors admit as much, citing for their proposal a report[16] by the French telecoms regulator which advocates 'a principle of 'net neutrality' for smartphones, tablets and voice assistants' (i.e. a non-discrimination standard). Consumer vs. small-business welfare: which should prevail in digital markets? Each of the above proposals would, to varying degrees, dissolve the distinctions between pro- and anti-competitive leveraging and (in the case of structural separation) pro- and anti-competitive vertical integration, significantly curtailing the ability of firms to legitimately out-compete their rivals in neighboring markets. All leveraging would be presumptively harmful to competition and, by extension, consumers. The question then becomes whether we should ignore the incentive to innovate and compete in platform markets and turn our societal interests to competition within platforms. It has long been the case[17] that 'the primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect interbrand competition.' However, in certain circumstances, it can be preferable to shift the focus from inter- to intra-brand competition (often through legislation). Take, for example, must-carry provisions imposed on cable operators in the US or net neutrality regulation (repealed in the US, but prevailing in the EU). In circumstances such as these, society willingly foregoes benefits of continued innovation and competition in the inter-brand market because it has concluded, for one reason or another, that bolstering competition in the intra-brand market is more important. This can entail tolerating counterfactually higher prices or reduced quality as a byproduct of protecting interests deemed to be more important, such as maintaining a pluralistic downstream market. In line with the above proposals, there is a growing belief that such an inversion of the goals of competition policy is exactly what is needed in digital markets. This section examines the empirical criteria that one would expect to be verified before shifting the focal point of competition policy from inter-platform competition to intra-platform competition. 1. Strategic bottleneck power over distribution In past instances of 'access regulation' or structural separation of vertically integrated firms, there have been concerns that the targeted firms had strategic 'bottleneck' power over the distribution of some downstream product or service, i.e. the firms sat between a set of suppliers and consumers and, through the control of some vital input or method of distribution, controlled access between the two. Strategic bottleneck power was present in the must-carry provisions imposed on cable operators in the US, the non-discrimination principles enshrined in  616 of the US Communications Act, and net neutrality regulation. The same applies to structural separation: when the District Court approved[18] the consent decree structurally separating AT... long-distance arm from its local operating companies, it was motivated by the fact that 'the principal means by which AT...as maintained monopoly power in telecommunications has been its control of the Operating Companies with their strategic bottleneck position.'Do GAFA possess strategic bottleneck power? Take Google Search, for example. In the EC's decision[19] in Google Shopping, it found that referrals from Google Search accounted for a large proportion of traffic to rival comparison shopping websites and that traffic could not be effectively replaced by other sources. However, firms operating in neighboring markets have many more routes to consumers that flout discovery through a search engine. As John Temple Lang observes[20], they can access consumers through 'direct navigation, specialized search services, social networks such as Facebook and Pinterest, partnerships with PC and mobile device markets, agreements with other publishers to refer traffic to each other, and so on.' Apple's iOS and Google's Android, on the other hand, compete against each other[21] and thus neither firm, by definition, can possess the degree of strategic bottleneck power required to consider abandoning their respective incentives to innovate. As for Amazon: in 2019 it was estimated that Amazon accounted[22] for 38% of all online sales in the US. This may seem like a staggering volume, but it in fact shows that distributors can - and do - bypass Amazon's platform to reach consumers, with great success.Insofar as GAFA possess strategic bottleneck power over particular categories of goods (i.e. in particular neighboring markets), this would not justify shifting the focus to intra-platform competition across all product categories. The market power element of traditional antitrust analyses serves to guard competition in these circumstances by carving a remedy around conduct that illegitimately hampers the ability of competitors in neighboring markets to compete. 2. Widespread harm in adjacent markets To ban platform owners from leveraging anti- and pro-competitively, one would expect there to be cogent evidence of harm to competition across a multitude of adjacent markets that depend on the platforms for access to consumers. However, as Feng Zhu and Qihong Liu note[23], there is a dearth of empirical evidence on the effects of platform owners' entry into complementary markets. Even studies that support the proposition that such entry dampens or skews innovation incentives of firms in adjacent markets conclude that the welfare effects are ambiguous, and that consumers may actually be better off (see e.g. here[24] and here[25]). Other studies show that third-party producers can benefit from platform entry into adjacent markets (see e.g. here[26] and here[27]). It is therefore clear that this criterion, which should also be a prerequisite to imposing blanket regulation to control the behavior of platform owners, has not been satisfied. 3. Discernible and static product boundaries In prior cases of access regulation, the input that firms in neighboring markets have depended on to access consumers has been clearly distinguishable from their own products. Although antitrust literature commonly refers to 'platforms' and 'applications' as if these are perceptibly different products, the reality is much different: both platforms and their complementary applications are composed of individual components and, as Carl Shapiro notes[28], 'the boundary between the 'platform' and services running on that platform can be fuzzy and can change over time.' Any attempt to freeze the definitional boundary of a platform would negate platform owners' incentive to build upon and improve their platforms, to the detriment of consumers and (in the case of software platforms) app developers. If Apple were prevented from vertically integrating, what would iOS look like? Could it even have a voice-call function? Alternatively, under non-discrimination regulation, what would a new iOS device look like? Would it just be a blank screen where the user is then forced to choose between various alternatives? The problem with proposing to separate platforms from adjacent products is that any platform component can theoretically be modularized and opened to competition from third-parties. Because integration of complementary components is an essential part of inter-platform competition, imposing the proposed interventions could destroy the very ecosystems that the competitors that critics seek to protect depend on, and prevent the next popular digital platform from emerging. 4. Lack or unimportance of integrative efficiencies Critics may counter that efficiencies stemming from leveraging are unimportant or non-existent, or do not depend on conduct that has exclusionary effects, and thus nothing is lost by shifting antitrust's focus to the protection of competitors in adjacent markets. However, any iPhone user will testify to the consumer benefits flowing from technically integrating multiple platform components and features into a single package (e.g. voice-assistant technology and mapping functionality). In a similar vein, the UK CMA, in approving [29]Google's acquisition of mapping software company Waze, was prompted in part by the fact that '[i]ntegration of a map application into the operating system creates opportunities for operating system developers to use their own or affiliated services (for example search engines and social networks) to improve the experience of users.' Integrating Product A (the platform) and Product B (a component or the software code of an ancillary product/service) can facilitate the creation some new functionality or feature in the form of Product C that users value and, crucially, could not achieve by combining Products A and B themselves (from one or multiple firms). Another potential consumer benefit flowing from leveraging is a reduction in consumer search costs i.e. providing users with the functionality or end results that they seek more quickly and efficiently. Even though anti-competitive concerns can theoretically arise, it remains the case that, empirically, integration of software code is predominantly motivated by efficiency justifications and occurs in both competitive and concentrated markets.  Conclusion Much of the impetus to enact the above proposals stems from the perception that antitrust law in its current form does not act quickly enough to restore competition in the market. Indeed, it can take over a decade for the dust to settle in big ticket antitrust cases, by which time antitrust remedies may be too little too late in those cases where the authorities get it right. To the extent that authorities can think of innovative ways to enforce existing standards more quickly and accurately, this would be met with widespread enthusiasm (but may be idealistic). However, introducing more intrusive measures to protect competition in neighboring markets, and undermining the consumer welfare standard that protects the ability of dominant firms to legitimately enter neighboring markets and compete on the merits, is not warranted. Intervention should remain targeted and evidence-based. If a complainant can adduce evidence that a platform owner is leveraging into a neighboring market and raising the complainant's cost of doing business, and if the platform owner cannot show a pro-competitive justification for the behavior, antitrust law will intervene to restore competition under existing standards.

But it identifies the Conservative MP, Zac Goldsmith, as being in particular danger, as well as the shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, and the shadow Scotland secretary, Lesley Laird.</p><p>While the poll suggests Boris Johnson could comfortably retain his seat if the election were held right now, the margin of error identified by YouGov allows for an extremely narrow Labour victory in the same scenario.</p><p>It suggests similar of other cabinet ministers, including the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, and the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, as well as the international development secretary, Alok Sharma. </p><p>None of them is predicted to be in any serious danger. Like Johnson, YouGov rates each of them as \"likely\" to hold their seat. But, were the results out by the most extreme margins of error YouGov has allowed for, election night could be less comfortable than each would hope.</p><p>The poll predicts that the environment secretary, Theresa Villers, could have an even greater fight on her hands, were the vote held right now.  YouGov projects the race in her constituency to be one of the closest, rating it a \"tossup\".</p><p>block-time published-time 11.29pm GMT </p><p>The result of YouGov's constituency by constituency model makes seductive reading for the Conservatives and grim reading for Labour. </p><p>Can you believe it?</p><p>What YouGov has in its favour was its success last time: Nine days before the last election, the firm predicted Theresa May's Conservatives would lose their majority and end up with just 310 seats.</p><p>In fact, the party got 317 but it came at a time when few other pollsters were predicting anything other than a May win.</p><p>What YouGov has against it is that it has been polling people over the past week, when regular polling firms would aim for the last couple of days. And, during an election campaign, every day matters.</p><p>A week ago, neither party manifesto was out, the leaders debate hadn't happened and the antisemitism row hadn't surfaced. More importantly, while the Conservative squeeze of the Brexit party has come early in this campaign, the Labour squeeze of the Lib Dems is perhaps not yet complete.</p><p>There are some things in the forecast that look curious. Labour is not forecast to gain any seats at all, which will surprise party workers in some targets where it has dozens on the ground, such as Southampton Itchen (Con maj 31), Hastings and Rye (Con maj 346) and Chingford and Woodford Green (Con maj 2438).</p><p>But it will hit home in the critical \"red wall\" band that runs very roughly from north Wales to the Humber, where Labour insiders are already deeply concerned, with some party workers reporting a sharp fall in those willing to say they will back the party.</p><p>The modelling suggests the Conservatives will gain seat after seat in Britain's smaller cities and large towns: Wrexham (Lab maj 1,832), Derby North (Lab maj 2,015), Great Grimsby (2,565), despite the residual presence of the Brexit party.</p><p>Even West Bromwich East, previously held for Labour by Tom Watson with a majority of 7,713, is projected to change hands, and interestingly most of the seats projected to switch are straight Conservative versus Labour battles. In only a handful, such as Kensington in London, does a Lib Dem revival split the anti-Tory vote.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 11.41pm GMT</p><p>block-time published-time 10.33pm GMT </p><p> Jeremy Corbyn is set to unveil more proposals in the Labour's \"Green manifesto\" tomorrow, telling supporters at a packed rally in Cornwall this evening: \"I'll let you into little secret, it's brilliant\". </p><p>Speaking at the event in Falmouth to promote the party's \"Green Industrial Revolution\", the Labour leader said the 2016 Paris climate agreement did not go far enough. He told hundreds of cheering supporters:</p><p>I want to lead a Labour government that next year will host the next climate change conference, and which will be much stronger than Paris.</p><p>Our government will be one that will be very environmentally conscious, it will bring about a net zero emissions. Our government will work on the world stage to achieve that as well.</p><p>Labour's \"Green Industrial Revolution\" includes a 10-year Green transformation fund, costing \u00a325bn a year, and dedicated to renewable and low carbon energy, transport, biodiversity, and environmental restoration.</p><p>It promises to create 1m green jobs in the energy sector and through nationwide home refurbishments.</p><p>The idea is to tackle climate change while creating jobs through insulation upgrades, offshore wind and carbon capture. The jobs will also come from hydrogen and tidal energy expansion, port infrastructure, tree-planting, flood defences and plastics recycling.</p><p>With just two weeks until the election, Corbyn warned supporters:</p><p>Everything is going to be thrown at us in the next two weeks. Every bit of abuse that the right wing press can find. Every bit of abuse that the wealthiest in our society can throw at people that want to bring about real change.</p><p>block-time published-time 10.22pm GMT </p><p> Chris Curtis, YouGov's political research manager, said the pollster's election MRP model suggests the Tories' projected gains could come at the expense of Labour in northern England and the Midlands.</p><p>As expected, the key thing deciding the extent to which each of these seats is moving against Labour are how that seat voted in the European Union referendum. In the seats that voted most strongly to Leave in 2016 (60% or more in favour of departing the EU), the swing to the Conservatives is over 6%.</p><p>This is allowing the Tories to overturn quite substantial majorities in places like West Bromwich East, the seat held until recently by Tom Watson, and Don Valley, the seat currently held by Caroline Flint.</p><p>The only silver lining for Labour is that there are still 30 seats where it is currently 5% or less behind the Tories. If it can manage to squeeze the gap over the coming fortnight it may be able to paste over the cracks in their so-called red wall. But, with just two weeks to go, time is running out for Labour.</p><p>block-time published-time 10.08pm GMT </p><p> Poll predicts Conservative majority  </p><p>The Tories could be on track for a majority of 68 seats, according to one poll published this evening.</p><p>The YouGov poll for the Times suggests that, were the election to be held right now, the Conservatives could win 359 seats, against 211 for Labour, 43 for the SNP 43 and 13 for the Lib Dems 13.</p><p>Those results would see the Tories up 42 seats on 2017 and Labour down 51.</p><p>The paper reports that the seat-by-seat analysis was based on more than 100,000 interviews conducted over seven days and produced using a polling model that accurately predicted the outcome of the 2017 election.</p><p>However, the Times reports, at least 30 seats have relatively small projected margins of victory for the Conservatives.

Brake had written to the Cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, seeking clarification on Cummings's status, citing \"media reports Dominic Cummings has been in more regular communication with campaign staff over the last week\".</p><p>The Cabinet Office's response read:</p><p>As with the significant majority of special advisers, Mr Cummings resigned from his role following the dissolution of parliament.</p><p>During the government's response to flooding, some special advisers, including Mr Cummings, were reinstated on a temporary basis to provide support to the prime minister and he and others have since left.

Asked by the Press Association if he would apologise for such incidents, as well as his handling of the issue, the Labour leader said:</p><p>The degree of antisemitic activity in the Labour party is very, very small.

I don't want anyone to go through the hurt that Jewish women went through on the trains a few weeks ago, that Muslim women go through on our streets.</p><p>I have made it very clear that our party will not tolerate racism in any form or antisemitism in any form and our party obviously deplores it and regrets what happened to those people who received that abuse and they have received the appropriate sanctions within the party, some of whom have been expelled.</p><p>block-time published-time 7.18pm GMT </p><p>The prime minister's senior aide, Dominic Cummings, has resigned as a special adviser, according to a Cabinet Office source.</p><p>Cummings, who was a senior figure in the Vote Leave campaign before starting as an adviser to Boris Johnson in July. His appointment at No 10 came only four months after he was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear before MPs investigating false news stories during the EU referendum campaign.</p><p>Earlier today, he published a blog post warning pro-Brexit voters that a Conservative victory is not yet in the bag (see <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/andrew-sparrows-election-briefing-the-nhs-dossier\">5.16pm</url> ).</p><p>Responding to a query about whether or not the publication of the post constituted a breach of the general election purdah rules imposed on special advisers, a Cabinet Office source confirmed Cummings had \"resigned following the dissolution of parliament... along with the majority of special advisers\", on 6 November.</p><p>While his resignation is understood to be a formality, it had been reported that Cummings intended to stay on as Johnson's adviser, with the Tory election campaign being run by Isaac Levido.</p><p>It is unclear what role, if any, Cummings will play if Johnson is returned to Downing Street after the election.</p><p>    Dominic Cummings arrives in Downing Street prior to the dissolution of parliament Photograph: Mark Thomas/REX/Shutterstock    </p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.56pm GMT</p><p>block-time published-time 6.34pm GMT </p><p> Boris Johnson  is \"scared\" of facing up to an interview with Andrew Neil, Labour has claimed, after its own leader's bruising encounter with the BBC journalist on Tuesday.</p><p>The broadcaster clarified earlier today that it had not secured an agreement with the prime minister for him to take part in its series of interviews with party leaders, as many had expected (see: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/andrew-sparrows-election-briefing-the-nhs-dossier\">3.37pm</url> ) he would.

At a dramatic press conference in London, where journalists were presented with copies of the document without warning, Corbyn said this was the evidence that left Boris Johnson's claim the NHS was not under threat from a Trump trade deal \"in tatters\". Corbyn explained:</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>We've now got evidence that under <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/andrew-sparrows-election-briefing-the-nhs-dossier\">Boris Johnson</url> the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale. He tried to cover it up in a secret agenda but today it's been exposed.</p><p>Labour campaigners say the claim that a Tory Brexit would pose a threat to the NHS is one that resonates with voters and, with the polls suggesting that Johnson's double-digit lead is holding up, Corbyn will have been hoping that this would be the bombshell that might (in the jargon) \"move the dial\". Eight hours later, now that journalists have had time to study the contents of the documents (which it turns out were leaked and published in an obscure corner of the internet some weeks ago), it turns out that the material is not quite as incriminating as Corbyn implied. The documents, which set out what has been said in talks between UK and US officials over the last two years scoping out the parameters for a trade deal, do not show that the government has agreed to anything that would let American corporations take over the NHS, or that would result in the NHS having to pay higher prices for drugs. But what the documents do confirm is that the Americans do have ambitions in these areas and that, despite ministers claiming that the NHS is \"not on the table\", the healthcare sector has been discussed (albeit not extensively) in these preliminary trade talks. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, accused Corbyn of lying about the document. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/andrew-sparrows-election-briefing-the-nhs-dossier\">In a statement</url> she said:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/andrew-sparrows-election-briefing-the-nhs-dossier\">Jeremy Corbyn</url> is getting desperate and is out-and-out lying to the public about what these documents contain. He has always believed in conspiracy theories - which is why he has failed to crack down on the scourge of antisemitism in his party. This is the man that has caused huge offence by blaming an imaginary 'Zionist lobby' for society's ills and now he has decided to smear UK officials too.</p><p>It is telling that Truss, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/andrew-sparrows-election-briefing-the-nhs-dossier\">Johnson himself in his own response</url>, seemed anxious to turn change the subject as quickly as possible (to antisemitism and Brexit respectively) and that strongly suggests that the Conservatives realise this is damaging, regardless of whether or not Corbyn may have over-sold the contents of his dossier. That is because in the end what would be decided in a UK-US trade deal would depend on the political dynamics at the end of the talks (not on anything in this 451-page bundle) and any judgement that voters make at this point will be a matter of trust. Any government would think twice before signing a trade deal that would imperil the NHS, because that would be politically toxic. But voters who keep hearing Johnson say that he would not put the NHS on the table in a trade deal may remember       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/andrew-sparrows-election-briefing-the-nhs-dossier\">that he also made assurances to the DUP about not accepting a customs border down the Irish Sea</url> that he merrily abandoned 12 months later.

Plus: Kate Proctor calls in from the Labour campaign trail and Peter Walker explains why the Lib Dem campaign is struggling.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 6.27pm GMT</p><p>block-time published-time 5.42pm GMT </p><p> Factcheck: Is SNP proposing more spending on health than other parties?  </p><p> Factcheck </p><p>Claim:  Nicola Sturgeon has said a key SNP demand in any post-election coalition talks with Labour is that the next UK government must raise NHS spending in England to Scottish levels, which are currently \u00a3136 a head higher. The SNP says that would mean \u00a335bn extra in day to day NHS spending in England by 2023/24 compared to this year - more than any other party proposes.</p><p>Background:  Every party boasts it will increase NHS spending but this is an audacious policy. Health policy in Scotland is totally devolved to Holyrood and the SNP has no remit over the NHS in England. Historically, Scotland has spent more on health than the rest of the UK because it has a far more dispersed rural population, many islands to service and higher rates of ill-health.</p><p>Sturgeon argues this extra English spending is justified to rectify the impacts of past austerity policies and, because Scottish funding is derived in part by how much is spent on the NHS in England, her government will get \u00a34bn more from the Treasury in 2023/24.</p><p>Reality: Ben Zaranko, an analyst at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says Labour plans to raise day to day NHS spending in England by \u00a331.2bn by 2023/24; the Tories by \u00a328.6bn and the Lib Dems by \u00a330.5bn.</p><p>The SNP claims its plans would mean total English day-to-day NHS spending of \u00a3159.2bn in 2023/24.

Under this scenario, Labour would win 199 seats, Lib Dems would win 17 seats, SNP would win 44 seats, Plaid would win 4 seats and the Greens would win 1 seat.</p><p>A result like this would translate into a majority of around 82. The press notice goes on:</p><p>However, if 4,000 or less pro-EU voters use their vote tactically in Best for Britain's 57 target seats, the Conservatives would be reduced to 309 seats - a dozen short of a majority. Labour would win 244 seats, SNP would win 52 seats, Lib Dems would win 21 seats, Plaid would win 4 seats and the Greens would win 1 seat...</p><p>Despite the boost received by the Conservatives from the Brexit party, there is still a substantial number of seats where tactical voting could be decisive. There are 165 seats where fewer than 5,000 tactical votes would be enough to prevent the Conservative party winning the seat (compared to 131 at the beginning of the election campaign). In 27 of these it would take fewer than 2,000 tactical votes.</p><p>Best for Britain is encouraging people to vote tactically in accordance with the recommendations on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/andrew-sparrows-election-briefing-the-nhs-dossier\">its tactical voting website.</url></p><p>However, as I reported in a post on Monday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/27/andrew-sparrows-election-briefing-the-nhs-dossier\">there are at least four other tactical voting websites which in some cases make different recommendations.</url></p><p>block-time published-time 4.43pm GMT </p><p>     Lord Heseltine (centre) alongside Liberal Democrat candidates Chuka Umunna (left) and Monica Harding (right) at a Lib Dem event in London this afternoon.

While only 15% of the younger group would vote Tory, support doubled to 30% among the older group.</p><p>The polling was carried out by Deltapoll last week as the parties unveiled their manifestos and education pledges. The NHS was named as an important election issue by 55% while education was mentioned by 28%, close to the 29% who named Brexit as a key issue.

Education is cutting through, with parents now ranking it almost as important as Brexit.</p><p>The poll showed one surprising result: Labour was the most popular party among parents with children at private schools, despite its manifesto policy of adding VAT to school fees. Some 42% backed Labour while 30% backed the Tories, although the poll appears to significantly over-represent the proportion of parents with children at private schools.</p><p>block-time published-time 4.31pm GMT </p><p> Charles Clarke, who was home secretary when Tony Blair was prime minister, told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live earlier that, if there were a hung parliament, Labour could ditch Jeremy Corbyn as leader.

I believe the Liberal Democrats and the DUP have been very clear they couldn't accept Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of a hung parliament.</p><p> Clarke also said he thought Corbyn's refusal to apologise to the Jewish community in last night's interview with Andrew Neil was \"disgraceful\". </p><p>block-time published-time 4.22pm GMT </p><p>These are from the Financial Times' Sebastian Payne </p><p>enltr??

They even threaten that if the UK continued to push certain EU positions in international forums - something the UK is still bound to do - it could undermine negotiations on a US trade deal.</p><p>Papers from the time of Theresa May's 'Chequers plan' are illuminating because the administration is clearly furious at May's promise of long-term alignment with EU standards, which would prevent the dilution of British food regulations which US agribusiness hopes to benefit from. US negotiators saw this as a \"worst case scenario\" and threatened to raise it with Trump ahead of his UK visit.</p><p>One of the most significant changes which Johnson made to May's Brexit deal was a weakening of the alignment to EU standards, suggesting US bullying worked.

Tom Bacon, freelance journalist in the entertainment sector, Ormskirk</p><p>Hi Tom. So Jeremy Corbyn was right when he told my colleague Kate Proctor earlier this week that his plans wouldn't put the UK significantly out of line with other European countries, in terms of tax and spending and the size of the state.</p><p>But it's the speed of the transformation that is so striking: the manifesto envisages a radical transformation of the economy and the role of government, in just five years. As director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson put it, \"this would be the biggest set of spending increases, and the biggest set of tax increases, and the biggest set of borrowing increases we've seen in peacetime history\".</p><p>Q: What does the nationalisation of Openreach mean for the thousands of people currently working for Openreach's competitors? There seems to have been no mention of this, with the implication being that given there will be no need for competitors of British Broadband, that their job losses will be the price to pay for 'free' broadband. Sam, West Midlands</p><p>Good question, Sam. My colleague Peter Walker actually asked about the fate of those companies at the launch event for the broadband policy. The answer he was given was that they could continue to provide add-on services, such as subscription TV packages. But you're right, the expectation would be that their broadband operations would wither away (while BT Openreach - renamed British Broadband - would expand its operations significantly, presumably).</p><p>Q: I'm aware that Labour are planning to decriminalise abortion - which I am wholly supportive of. However, I'm not clear on whether this also changes the law on the latest a woman can legally terminate?

I do not believe this to be true but struggling to find the details on the changes labour intend to make to abortion law and would like clarification. Nicole, Hertfordshire</p><p>Hi Nicole. I'm really interested (and concerned) to hear that that's out there, because it's not true. The only reference to abortion policy in the manifesto says: \"We will uphold women's reproductive rights and decriminalise abortions.\" There is no reference to any plan to review the current policy.

Health inequalities presumably need to be a focus. Joel, 30, working in the charity sector, Essex</p><p>Hi Joel. So yes: the manifesto says a Labour government would make reducing health inequalities a clear target of public policy. </p><p>The \u00a31bn planned increase in public health funding is part of that, and they say they would recruit 4,500 more health visitors and school nurses - and take a series of other steps on everything from increasing breastfeeding support for new mums, to widening the scope of the sugar tax to tackle obesity.</p><p>To try and make the target stick, they also say they would introduce a new Future Generations Wellbeing Act: a law aimed at forcing the government to check the impact of all new policy on health inequality; and a new obligation on NHS agencies to cooperate with directors of public health.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.51pm GMT</p><p>block-time published-time 1.14pm GMT </p><p> Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish National party would have \"no great objection\" if Jeremy Corbyn was replaced as Labour leader, and hinted strongly she would support that if it helped form an anti-Tory coalition at Westminster.</p><p>The SNP leader said she \"didn't get to choose who leads the Labour party\" but repeated several times at the launch of her party's election manifesto she was no fan of Corbyn's.</p><p>Asked whether the SNP would support replacing Corbyn as party leader if there were moves to do so at Westminster, to build a cross-party coalition with Labour, she said:</p><p>I don't choose the leader of the Labour party.

Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has repeatedly stated her party would never do deals with a Corbyn-led government.</p><p>At the SNP manifesto launch this morning, Sturgeon was asked by Channel 4 News about the attacks on Corbyn's suitability as prime minister by Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, and whether that gave her pause for thought about propping up a minority Labour government. She replied: </p><p>I deplore Jeremy Corbyn's lack of leadership on the issue of antisemitism and I don't condone in any way, shape or form that failure on the part of him and of the Labour party to eradicate that from their ranks.</p><p>But she said the SNP would exercise its duties at Westminster responsibly, pressing for its policy goals to be adopted by the next UK government. \"We will not be signing any blank cheque to Jeremy Corbyn or to any leader of the Labour party.\" </p><p>    Nicola Sturgeon at the SNP general election manifesto launch in Glasgow.

Is there any commitment to scrapping the first past the post system for general elections? Daniel, 46, geologist, Leamington Spa</p><p>I'm afraid, not, Daniel. Labour's manifesto says it will \"take urgent steps to refresh our democracy\", and commits to a series of specific changes, including abolishing the hereditary principle in the House of Lords and lowering the voting age to 16; but there is no mention of voting reform.</p><p>It does say the reboot of democracy will be guided by a UK-wide constitutional convention, led by a citizens' assembly. Its appears to be mainly focused on the balance of power between Westminster and the rest of the UK; but perhaps voting reform might emerge as a recommendation? That's as close as the manifesto comes to the issue.</p><p>Q: Has Labour made any indication that they would have a gender balanced cabinet? Eric Ekong, 28, software engineer, London</p><p>So I haven't seen Jeremy Corbyn make that commitment explicitly, Eric, but he has repeatedly highlighted the gender balance in his shadow cabinet, and contrasted that with the Conservatives' more male-dominated top team.

Where would the money to back up the abolition of tuition fees for undergraduate and postgraduate courses come from? And how would that affect the economy given the astronomical fees that students currently pay/get a loan from? Carina Nicu, 27 years old, research technician at the University of Manchester, Manchester</p><p>Hi Carina, you're right that abolishing tuition fees and restoring maintenance grants is the single most costly measure in the manifesto, at \u00a313.6bn a year by the end of the parliament. </p><p>Labour says almost half of that, \u00a36.4bn, will be offset by the savings from getting rid of the current system (it's costly to administer, and many students have their fees written off anyway). They would also argue that ensuring kids from lower-income households are not deterred from going to university would have wider social/economic benefits - though of course it wouldn't just be these students who would benefit.</p><p>Labour haven't earmarked specific taxes to pay for each spending measure - but their biggest money-raiser is increasing corporation tax, which is expected to bring in a whopping \u00a323.7bn a year within five years. The impact of that on the wider economy is contested: Labour say they're just taking it back to 2010 levels, and the 26% rate still won't be high by international standards.</p><p>Critics say it will deter foreign investment - and that part of the cost will ultimately be passed on to customers and workers, as well as wealthy executives and shareholders.</p><p>Q: Are there any concrete measures for EU nationals living in the UK (in the context of Brexit) in the Labour manifesto? Sabrina </p><p>Hi Sabrina. Yes: the Labour manifesto reiterates the party's longstanding commitment to uphold the rights of EU citizens already in the UK to remain here. </p><p>And it goes a bit further, saying a Labour government would get rid of the legal requirement to register under the EU settlement scheme. It would instead become a \"declaratory system\", under which EU citizens could register if they wished, but it wouldn't be a requirement for continuing to live and work here, the manifesto says. (It doesn't say how that would work for employers wondering if a particular individual has the right to be here). Labour would also expand the right of all migrants to bring their families to the UK.</p><p>As for freedom of movement, that would depend on what happens with Brexit.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 1.55pm GMT</p><p>block-time published-time 12.30pm GMT </p><p>I'm Heather Stewart, political editor of the Guardian, and will be answering your questions about the Labour manifesto today.

But despite the poster's belief that \"this publication will make some noise\", the post attracted just a hundred or so \"upvotes\", and 23 comments, in the month since it was made. The cache did slowly begin to be shared more widely, however, with Labour MEP Jude Kirton-Darling posting it on her Twitter account five days ago. Shortly before they posted the documents to Reddit, the original leaker, a user called gregoratior, set up a new subforum on the site: \"ukwhistleblower\".

We have had surprise announcements from the parties about policy, and about strategy (eg, the Brexit party standing down in Tory-held seats), but this is a proper news story about stuff that has happened, not stuff that might happen in the future. </p><p>Labour will be hoping that this has the potential to be a game-changer. (The charge that the NHS would be \"up for sale\" in a UK-US trade deal is one that resonates with voters, and alarms them, in a way that many Westminster policy/process stories don't.) In reality, very few things that happen in election campaigns turn out to be game-changer, but this may turn out to have enough heft to make the grade.</p><p>This is what Jeremy Corbyn  said about the documents in his opening speech.</p><p>Voters need to ask themselves some very serious questions: is the NHS safe in Boris Johnson's hands?</p><p>We've now got evidence that under Boris Johnson the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale. He tried to cover it up in a secret agenda but today it's been exposed.</p><p>Now we know the truth, when Johnson says, 'get Brexit done', it's a fraud on the British people. This is the reality. Years of bogged down negotiations and our NHS is up for sale.</p><p>This election is now a fight for the survival of our National Health Service. As a public service free for all at the point of need.</p><p>And here are some of the specific points he made about what the documents show.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Corbyn said the documents showed that UK and US officials have discussed lengthening the time during which medicine patents apply. He explained:</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>In fact, negotiations have advanced even further than we feared they had. The US and UK have already finished initial discussion on lengthening patents for medicines.</p><p>Longer patents mean only one thing - more expensive drugs. Lives will be put at risk as a result of this.</p><p>Many out-of-patent medicines available cheaply here are vastly more expensive under patent law in the US.</p><p>The drug Humira for Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis costs our NHS \u00a31,409 a packet. In the US, the same packet costs \u00a38,115. Get the difference - \u00a31,409 in our NHS, \u00a38,115 in the USA.</p><p>One of the reasons for US drug prices being on average 250% of those here is a patent regime rigged for the big pharmaceutical companies...</p><p>If you look at the readout of the second meeting, on page 51, UK officials report that \"patent issues\" around \"NHS access to generic drugs will be a key consideration\" in talks.</p><p>US officials have \"pushed hard,\" the reports says, for longer patents for US drug companies.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Corbyn said the documents showed that the two sides were closer to a deal than people expected. He said:</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>You can also see on page 132 of the report of the fourth meeting, where drug patents are being discussed, that officials are ready to \"exchange text\" which is trade-negotiator-speak for it being at a very advanced stage. And they say they are ready to, I quote, \"really take significant further steps.\"</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>He said the documents showed the US wanted \"total market access\" in a trade deal - implying health would be included.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>The new breed of trade deals are not only - or even mainly - about tariffs on goods at the border.</p><p>They are also about services - including our health service.</p><p>And these documents make clear that for the US, to quote page 41 of the third meeting report, \"everything is included unless something is specifically excluded.\"</p><p>They want, I quote: \"Total market access\" as the \"baseline assumption of the trade negotiations.\"</p><p>\"Total market access.\"</p><p>Corbyn also said there was no evidence in the documents that the UK had pushed back against this. He went on:</p><p>But surely you can't believe that British officials would demand the NHS be excluded? Apparently not.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>He said the documents showed that British officials said they would be a \"liberalising influence\".</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>In fact, on behalf of the Conservative government, officials reassured their counterparts that \"the US should expect the UK to be a liberalising influence\" and that together they could \"fly the good flag for services liberalisation.\"</p><p>That's a green light for breaking open Britain's public services so corporations can profit from.</p><p>This is not surprising because the Tories have always said they would like free trade deals to cover services as well as good.</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>He said the documents showed that a UK-US trade deal could provide protections for corporations, allowing them to sue governments in some circumstances for losses suffered.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Officials have discussed a system to give corporations the power to sue our country.

Thanks for reading and commenting. As ever, my colleague Andrew Sparrow has put together a detailed summary of the day's events: Since he wrote it, a poll predicted that - were the election held today - the Tories could be on course for a significant Commons majority. The YouGov poll for the Times projected a possible 68-seat majority for the Conservatives, though it comes with significant caveats and with two weeks of campaigning still ahead. If you'd like to read yet more, my colleagues Jamie Grierson, Denis Campbell and Frances Perraudin have tonight's man story: Some significantly more minor, though still interesting, points from this evening's poll: YouGov says few \"big beasts\" would be likely to lose their seats if the vote were held today. But it identifies the Conservative MP, Zac Goldsmith, as being in particular danger, as well as the shadow environment secretary, Sue Hayman, and the shadow Scotland secretary, Lesley Laird. While the poll suggests Boris Johnson could comfortably retain his seat if the election were held right now, the margin of error identified by YouGov allows for an extremely narrow Labour victory in the same scenario. It suggests similar of other cabinet ministers, including the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, and the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, as well as the international development secretary, Alok Sharma. None of them is predicted to be in any serious danger. Like Johnson, YouGov rates each of them as \"likely\" to hold their seat. But, were the results out by the most extreme margins of error YouGov has allowed for, election night could be less comfortable than each would hope. The poll predicts that the environment secretary, Theresa Villers, could have an even greater fight on her hands, were the vote held right now. YouGov projects the race in her constituency to be one of the closest, rating it a \"tossup\". The result of YouGov's constituency by constituency model makes seductive reading for the Conservatives and grim reading for Labour. Can you believe it? What YouGov has in its favour was its success last time: Nine days before the last election, the firm predicted Theresa May's Conservatives would lose their majority and end up with just 310 seats. In fact, the party got 317 but it came at a time when few other pollsters were predicting anything other than a May win. What YouGov has against it is that it has been polling people over the past week, when regular polling firms would aim for the last couple of days. And, during an election campaign, every day matters. A week ago, neither party manifesto was out, the leaders debate hadn't happened and the antisemitism row hadn't surfaced. More importantly, while the Conservative squeeze of the Brexit party has come early in this campaign, the Labour squeeze of the Lib Dems is perhaps not yet complete. There are some things in the forecast that look curious. Labour is not forecast to gain any seats at all, which will surprise party workers in some targets where it has dozens on the ground, such as Southampton Itchen (Con maj 31), Hastings and Rye (Con maj 346) and Chingford and Woodford Green (Con maj 2438). But it will hit home in the critical \"red wall\" band that runs very roughly from north Wales to the Humber, where Labour insiders are already deeply concerned, with some party workers reporting a sharp fall in those willing to say they will back the party. The modelling suggests the Conservatives will gain seat after seat in Britain's smaller cities and large towns: Wrexham (Lab maj 1,832), Derby North (Lab maj 2,015), Great Grimsby (2,565), despite the residual presence of the Brexit party. Even West Bromwich East, previously held for Labour by Tom Watson with a majority of 7,713, is projected to change hands, and interestingly most of the seats projected to switch are straight Conservative versus Labour battles. In only a handful, such as Kensington in London, does a Lib Dem revival split the anti-Tory vote. Jeremy Corbyn is set to unveil more proposals in the Labour's \"Green manifesto\" tomorrow, telling supporters at a packed rally in Cornwall this evening: \"I'll let you into little secret, it's brilliant\". Speaking at the event in Falmouth to promote the party's \"Green Industrial Revolution\", the Labour leader said the 2016 Paris climate agreement did not go far enough. He told hundreds of cheering supporters: I want to lead a Labour government that next year will host the next climate change conference, and which will be much stronger than Paris. Our government will be one that will be very environmentally conscious, it will bring about a net zero emissions. Our government will work on the world stage to achieve that as well. Labour's \"Green Industrial Revolution\" includes a 10-year Green transformation fund, costing \u00a325bn a year, and dedicated to renewable and low carbon energy, transport, biodiversity, and environmental restoration. It promises to create 1m green jobs in the energy sector and through nationwide home refurbishments. The idea is to tackle climate change while creating jobs through insulation upgrades, offshore wind and carbon capture. The jobs will also come from hydrogen and tidal energy expansion, port infrastructure, tree-planting, flood defences and plastics recycling. With just two weeks until the election, Corbyn warned supporters: Everything is going to be thrown at us in the next two weeks. Every bit of abuse that the right wing press can find. Every bit of abuse that the wealthiest in our society can throw at people that want to bring about real change. Chris Curtis, YouGov's political research manager, said the pollster's election MRP model suggests the Tories' projected gains could come at the expense of Labour in northern England and the Midlands. As expected, the key thing deciding the extent to which each of these seats is moving against Labour are how that seat voted in the European Union referendum. In the seats that voted most strongly to Leave in 2016 (60% or more in favour of departing the EU), the swing to the Conservatives is over 6%. This is allowing the Tories to overturn quite substantial majorities in places like West Bromwich East, the seat held until recently by Tom Watson, and Don Valley, the seat currently held by Caroline Flint. The only silver lining for Labour is that there are still 30 seats where it is currently 5% or less behind the Tories. If it can manage to squeeze the gap over the coming fortnight it may be able to paste over the cracks in their so-called red wall. But, with just two weeks to go, time is running out for Labour. The Tories could be on track for a majority of 68 seats, according to one poll published this evening. The YouGov poll for the Times suggests that, were the election to be held right now, the Conservatives could win 359 seats, against 211 for Labour, 43 for the SNP 43 and 13 for the Lib Dems 13. Those results would see the Tories up 42 seats on 2017 and Labour down 51. The paper reports that the seat-by-seat analysis was based on more than 100,000 interviews conducted over seven days and produced using a polling model that accurately predicted the outcome of the 2017 election. However, the Times reports, at least 30 seats have relatively small projected margins of victory for the Conservatives. And the pollster warned that a relatively small fall in Tory support could deny the party's suggested majority. There are also two weeks of campaigning to go. The prime minister has faced an awkward encounter with a group of nurses in Cornwall as they grilled him over his promise to boost NHS nursing numbers: Having stood down at the dissolution of parliament, Dominic Cummings was briefly reinstated to help the prime minister on the government's response to the flooding that hit the Midlands and northern England earlier this month. The Cabinet Office revealed the move to the Lib Dems' Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, in a letter dated Friday 22 November. Brake had written to the Cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, seeking clarification on Cummings's status, citing \"media reports Dominic Cummings has been in more regular communication with campaign staff over the last week\". The Cabinet Office's response read: As with the significant majority of special advisers, Mr Cummings resigned from his role following the dissolution of parliament. During the government's response to flooding, some special advisers, including Mr Cummings, were reinstated on a temporary basis to provide support to the prime minister and he and others have since left. This is routine practice in such circumstances. A number of other special advisers have, in line with the code of conduct for special advisers and with the agreement of the prime minister, remained in their roles, for example, where there is an ongoing need for their support in government work. As set out in paragraph 18 of the code of conduct for special advisers, however, those who remain in post to work on government business must ensure that they do not use official resources for party political purposes and that any participation in the campaign is in a special adviser's own time and outside office hours. All special advisers are aware of the requirements in the code of conduct. Jeremy Corbyn has again stopped short of apologising to the UK's Jewish community for antisemitism within Labour's ranks. Asked by the Press Association if he would apologise for such incidents, as well as his handling of the issue, the Labour leader said: The degree of antisemitic activity in the Labour party is very, very small. Anybody committing antisemitic acts is breaking party rules and they are appropriately disciplined and sanctioned. All those rules came in since I became leader and indeed the latest regulations came specifically on my own request. Jennie Formby, our general secretary, has written a substantial article in the Jewish News today making clear the party deeply regrets and is very sorry for what happened before the new rules came in and obviously I support everything that she has said on that. Pressed on whether that was as good as a personal apology, Corbyn said: I have spent my life fighting racism in every conceivable form in our society. I don't want anyone to go through the hurt that Jewish women went through on the trains a few weeks ago, that Muslim women go through on our streets. I have made it very clear that our party will not tolerate racism in any form or antisemitism in any form and our party obviously deplores it and regrets what happened to those people who received that abuse and they have received the appropriate sanctions within the party, some of whom have been expelled. The prime minister's senior aide, Dominic Cummings, has resigned as a special adviser, according to a Cabinet Office source. Cummings, who was a senior figure in the Vote Leave campaign before starting as an adviser to Boris Johnson in July. His appointment at No 10 came only four months after he was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear before MPs investigating false news stories during the EU referendum campaign. Earlier today, he published a blog post warning pro-Brexit voters that a Conservative victory is not yet in the bag (see 5.16pm). Responding to a query about whether or not the publication of the post constituted a breach of the general election purdah rules imposed on special advisers, a Cabinet Office source confirmed Cummings had \"resigned following the dissolution of parliament... along with the majority of special advisers\", on 6 November. While his resignation is understood to be a formality, it had been reported that Cummings intended to stay on as Johnson's adviser, with the Tory election campaign being run by Isaac Levido. It is unclear what role, if any, Cummings will play if Johnson is returned to Downing Street after the election. Boris Johnson is \"scared\" of facing up to an interview with Andrew Neil, Labour has claimed, after its own leader's bruising encounter with the BBC journalist on Tuesday. The broadcaster clarified earlier today that it had not secured an agreement with the prime minister for him to take part in its series of interviews with party leaders, as many had expected (see: 3.37pm) he would. Ian Lavery, the Labour chair, has said: Boris Johnson backed out of a head-to-head debate with Jeremy Corbyn on Sunday, he is refusing to take part in the party leaders' climate crisis debate tomorrow and now this. He's running scared because every time he is confronted with the impact of nine years of austerity, the cost of living crisis and over his plans to sell out our NHS, the more he is exposed. A Labour source has indicated this evening that the party was led to believe Johnson was to face Neil next week. Jeremy Corbyn has sought to firm up the credibility of one of Labour's most potent attack lines against the Conservatives by releasing a 451-page dossier giving details of what has been discussed in preliminary talks on a UK-US trade deal. At a dramatic press conference in London, where journalists were presented with copies of the document without warning, Corbyn said this was the evidence that left Boris Johnson's claim the NHS was not under threat from a Trump trade deal \"in tatters\". Corbyn explained: We've now got evidence that under Boris Johnson the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale. He tried to cover it up in a secret agenda but today it's been exposed. Labour campaigners say the claim that a Tory Brexit would pose a threat to the NHS is one that resonates with voters and, with the polls suggesting that Johnson's double-digit lead is holding up, Corbyn will have been hoping that this would be the bombshell that might (in the jargon) \"move the dial\". Eight hours later, now that journalists have had time to study the contents of the documents (which it turns out were leaked and published in an obscure corner of the internet some weeks ago), it turns out that the material is not quite as incriminating as Corbyn implied. The documents, which set out what has been said in talks between UK and US officials over the last two years scoping out the parameters for a trade deal, do not show that the government has agreed to anything that would let American corporations take over the NHS, or that would result in the NHS having to pay higher prices for drugs. But what the documents do confirm is that the Americans do have ambitions in these areas and that, despite ministers claiming that the NHS is \"not on the table\", the healthcare sector has been discussed (albeit not extensively) in these preliminary trade talks. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, accused Corbyn of lying about the document. In a statement she said: Jeremy Corbyn is getting desperate and is out-and-out lying to the public about what these documents contain. He has always believed in conspiracy theories - which is why he has failed to crack down on the scourge of antisemitism in his party. This is the man that has caused huge offence by blaming an imaginary 'Zionist lobby' for society's ills and now he has decided to smear UK officials too. It is telling that Truss, and Johnson himself in his own response, seemed anxious to turn change the subject as quickly as possible (to antisemitism and Brexit respectively) and that strongly suggests that the Conservatives realise this is damaging, regardless of whether or not Corbyn may have over-sold the contents of his dossier. That is because in the end what would be decided in a UK-US trade deal would depend on the political dynamics at the end of the talks (not on anything in this 451-page bundle) and any judgement that voters make at this point will be a matter of trust. Any government would think twice before signing a trade deal that would imperil the NHS, because that would be politically toxic. But voters who keep hearing Johnson say that he would not put the NHS on the table in a trade deal may remember that he also made assurances to the DUP about not accepting a customs border down the Irish Sea that he merrily abandoned 12 months later. If ultimately this is a matter of trust, Johnson and the Tories are vulnerable. Boris Johnson has apologised for Islamophobia within the Conservative party as a Tory candidate accused the prime minister of fanning the flames of anti-Muslim prejudice. Johnson is willing to apologise for the actions of others in this regard. However, as viewers of Question Time witnessed on Friday, he is not so keen to apologise for what he has done himself. Nicola Sturgeon will put ending austerity, the removal of nuclear weapons from Scotland and a second independence referendum in 2020 at the heart of her party's post-election negotiations with Labour if there is a hung parliament. The BBC has revealed that Boris Johnson has yet to agree a date for an interview with Andrew Neil, prompting speculation that he might try to get through the campaign without submitting himself to scrutiny from the most aggressive and formidable interviewer on TV. Tory sources will just say discussions about a date are \"ongoing\". Sadly, if Johnson were to duck the Neil challenge, that would be a constitutional outrage that even the supreme court couldn't overturn. Jim O'Neill, a former Conservative minister who was one of the key architects of the \"northern powerhouse\", has questioned whether either of the main parties are genuinely committed to devolving powers out of Whitehall. Boris Johnson's admiration for Donald Trump will lead to workers' rights being ripped up if the Conservatives win the general election next month, the leader of Britain's trade unionists has warned. Labour's Richard Burgon has said his party is committed to paying \u00a358bn in compensation to the Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women because they were the victims of \"theft\". Jeremy Corbyn has said that he can guarantee he will protect public libraries if Labour gets into power. That's all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is writing the blog now. The latest edition of the Guardian's Politics Weekly podcast has gone out. You can listen here: This week, Heather Stewart is joined by Polly Mackenzie, James Morris, and Andrew Gimson. Plus: Kate Proctor calls in from the Labour campaign trail and Peter Walker explains why the Lib Dem campaign is struggling. Factcheck Claim: Nicola Sturgeon has said a key SNP demand in any post-election coalition talks with Labour is that the next UK government must raise NHS spending in England to Scottish levels, which are currently \u00a3136 a head higher. The SNP says that would mean \u00a335bn extra in day to day NHS spending in England by 2023/24 compared to this year - more than any other party proposes. Background: Every party boasts it will increase NHS spending but this is an audacious policy. Health policy in Scotland is totally devolved to Holyrood and the SNP has no remit over the NHS in England. Historically, Scotland has spent more on health than the rest of the UK because it has a far more dispersed rural population, many islands to service and higher rates of ill-health. Sturgeon argues this extra English spending is justified to rectify the impacts of past austerity policies and, because Scottish funding is derived in part by how much is spent on the NHS in England, her government will get \u00a34bn more from the Treasury in 2023/24. Reality: Ben Zaranko, an analyst at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says Labour plans to raise day to day NHS spending in England by \u00a331.2bn by 2023/24; the Tories by \u00a328.6bn and the Lib Dems by \u00a330.5bn. The SNP claims its plans would mean total English day-to-day NHS spending of \u00a3159.2bn in 2023/24. The IFS has different calculations. It says that Labour plans means the English NHS will have \u00a3154.9bn to spend in 2023/24 compared to \u00a3158.7bn under the SNP's plans. That \u00a33.8bn is a relatively small increase of 2.45%. Verdict: Sturgeon is right that the SNP's proposals means higher NHS spending than the other parties propose. But the effects are not as great as the headline figure suggests and by 2023/24, NHS spending targets are almost certain to change as time goes on. There have been a lot of polls now suggesting the Conservatives are on course for at least a decent majority. This is not necessarily helpful - if supporters think victory is in the bag, they might not turn out - and that probably explains why Dominic Cummings, the PM's most influential policy adviser, has written a post on his blog with advice to Vote Leave reporters. Here is the key extract. You will see many polls in the coming days. Some will say Boris will win. Trust me, as someone who has worked on lots of campaigns, things are much tighter than they seem and there is a very real possibility of a hung parliament. Without a majority, the nightmare continues. All other MPs will gang together to stop Brexit and give EU citizens the vote. It's that simple. Talking of MRP models (see 4.05pm), Best for Britain, the anti-Brexit group, has also commissioned its own MRP analysis, from Focaldata, and it suggests that the Conservatives could be on course for a majority of more than 80. But Best for Britain is using the data to encourage tactical voting and it says that if 117,314 or more pro-EU voters were to vote tactically, then the Tories could be denied a majority. Here is an extract from the Best for Britain news release. Our data predicts that the Conservatives could win up to 366 seats, having been boosted by roughly three-quarters of the Brexit party's vote share where the Brexit party have not fielded a candidate. Under this scenario, Labour would win 199 seats, Lib Dems would win 17 seats, SNP would win 44 seats, Plaid would win 4 seats and the Greens would win 1 seat. A result like this would translate into a majority of around 82. The press notice goes on: However, if 4,000 or less pro-EU voters use their vote tactically in Best for Britain's 57 target seats, the Conservatives would be reduced to 309 seats - a dozen short of a majority. Labour would win 244 seats, SNP would win 52 seats, Lib Dems would win 21 seats, Plaid would win 4 seats and the Greens would win 1 seat... Despite the boost received by the Conservatives from the Brexit party, there is still a substantial number of seats where tactical voting could be decisive. There are 165 seats where fewer than 5,000 tactical votes would be enough to prevent the Conservative party winning the seat (compared to 131 at the beginning of the election campaign). In 27 of these it would take fewer than 2,000 tactical votes. Best for Britain is encouraging people to vote tactically in accordance with the recommendations on its tactical voting website. However, as I reported in a post on Monday, there are at least four other tactical voting websites which in some cases make different recommendations. The National Education Union - the merged NUT and ATL teachers' unions - has released polling it commissioned of 1,000 voters with school-aged children in England, showing that 38% of parents plan to back Labour, compared with 33% for the Conservatives, 11% for Lib Dems, 9% for the Brexit party, and 4% for the Green party (excluding don't knows). The polling breakdown showed a sharp division by age: 41% of those aged 18-34 backed Labour but just 27% of those aged 35-54. While only 15% of the younger group would vote Tory, support doubled to 30% among the older group. The polling was carried out by Deltapoll last week as the parties unveiled their manifestos and education pledges. The NHS was named as an important election issue by 55% while education was mentioned by 28%, close to the 29% who named Brexit as a key issue. Some 54% of parents agreed funding for their local schools was insufficient. Mary Bousted, the NEU's joint general secretary, said: This election is about much more than Brexit, as demonstrated by this poll of parents. Education is cutting through, with parents now ranking it almost as important as Brexit. The poll showed one surprising result: Labour was the most popular party among parents with children at private schools, despite its manifesto policy of adding VAT to school fees. Some 42% backed Labour while 30% backed the Tories, although the poll appears to significantly over-represent the proportion of parents with children at private schools. Charles Clarke, who was home secretary when Tony Blair was prime minister, told Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live earlier that, if there were a hung parliament, Labour could ditch Jeremy Corbyn as leader. He explained: There are only two alternative outcomes of this election - one is a Conservative overall majority which for various reasons I think would be disastrous for the country, and the other would be a hung parliament in which you have to construct a government between Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, whoever is involved in that hung parliament. And as one of Labour's current advisors Bob Kerslake said the other day, in such a negotiation about a hung parliament, not only the policy programmes and so on are up for discussion, as they are in any such debate, but also the personnel issues - the leadership of the government, the prime minister and the key offices of government too. I believe the Liberal Democrats and the DUP have been very clear they couldn't accept Jeremy Corbyn as the leader of a hung parliament. Clarke also said he thought Corbyn's refusal to apologise to the Jewish community in last night's interview with Andrew Neil was \"disgraceful\". These are from the Financial Times' Sebastian Payne The Scottish Conservatives have suspended their general election candidate for Glasgow Central following complaints about Islamophobic language. Flora Scarabello will have support for her campaign withdrawn, following the submission of a complaint to the party's central office about the alleged use of \"anti-Muslim language\". It is being reported that the details emerged in a private phone call, which was recorded and sent to party officials. While the complaint is being investigated, Scarabello will have her party membership suspended. The deadline for removing her as a general election candidate has passed, meaning there is no option but for her name to still appear on the ballot paper. A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: We take allegations like this extremely seriously. There is no place in the Scottish Conservatives for anti-Muslim language, or any other form of racial or religious discrimination. As such, we have immediately suspended the candidate and the complaint will be thoroughly investigated. Alison Thewliss won Glasgow Central for the SNP in 2017, with a 2,267 majority over Labour. The Tories were a long way behind in third place. Jeremy Corbyn has posted this from the train taking him to Cornwall for an election rally tonight. From the LBC's Theo Usherwood More from my colleague Peter Walker on Michael Heseltine's speech. Here is the latest election polling from YouGov. As usual, it is worth stressing that conventional polling badly underestimated the Labour vote at the 2017 election. But there was one polling exercise that did very well two years ago. YouGov produced a model for the election using multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP), a technique that involves trying to work out how Britain will vote on a constituency by constituency basis, using data about the demographic composition of each constituency and polling information about how particular demographics are likely to vote. The model predicted a hung parliament. When it was published, in the middle of the 2017 campaign, this was seen as so unlikely that it was widely dismissed, but it turned out to be the best polling guide to the final result. We will find out what the YouGov MRP model is saying about the 2019 result tonight, when the figures are published in the Times. Michael Heseltine, the former Conservative deputy prime minister and pro-European who is backing the Liberal Democrats at this election, is speaking now at a Lib Dem event, my colleague Peter Walker reports. Nick Dearden, director of the campaigning group Global Justice Now, has written an article for Open Democracy about what we'e learned from the leaked dossier about the UK-US trade talks. Here's an excerpt. The papers show US officials pushing Britain to an ever-harder Brexit position, clear that they don't want Britain to be a \"satellite of the EU\" in the way Switzerland is. They even threaten that if the UK continued to push certain EU positions in international forums - something the UK is still bound to do - it could undermine negotiations on a US trade deal. Papers from the time of Theresa May's 'Chequers plan' are illuminating because the administration is clearly furious at May's promise of long-term alignment with EU standards, which would prevent the dilution of British food regulations which US agribusiness hopes to benefit from. US negotiators saw this as a \"worst case scenario\" and threatened to raise it with Trump ahead of his UK visit. One of the most significant changes which Johnson made to May's Brexit deal was a weakening of the alignment to EU standards, suggesting US bullying worked. But it's particularly worrying that economic modelling seen by the trade officials showed this was likely to be good for the US, but much less so for \"UK welfare and GDP gains\". And here is the line-up for the BBC seven-party debate on Friday night. We knew that Boris Johnson would not be turning up. But Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage are also giving it a miss too, and so it does not really count as a leaders' debate. (Caroline Lucas isn't a party leader either, but she is an ex-leader, and arguably she has a higher profile than the two Green co-leaders, S\u00eean Berry and Jonathan Bartley.) The BBC has said that Boris Johnson has yet to agree a date for an interview with Andrew Neil, as part of the leader interviews series that Neil is doing. It is not hard to guess why Johnson's team might be having second thoughts. Neil is the most aggressive and forensic interviewer on TV, and Nicola Sturgeon and Jeremy Corbyn were both left looking diminished after their encounters with him this week. Is it conceivable that Johnson might just refuse point-blank to show up? In a healthy political culture, that would be unthinkable. But sadly there is no law yet saying someone cannot be appointed PM without having given a lengthy interview to Andrew Neil, and Johnson did try to suspend parliament for five weeks for his own political convenience. So it doesn't seem impossible that he might pull out entirely... Obviousl From the BBC's Nick Eardley This is what Boris Johnson said in the Q&amp;A about the leaked dossier about the UK-US trade talks. It is a total nonsense, and it is endlessly repeated by the Labour party, that the NHS is somehow up for sale, or going to be negotiated in a trade deal. Nothing could be further from the truth. That will not happen under this government or any Conservative government. What you have heard from me today is our commitment to the NHS. And there's only one reason why the Labour party continues bring this up, which is a total invention. It is because they seek to distract from the great void at the heart of their principle policy at this election, which is about Brexit. Q: You say the Labour allegations about the NHS and a UK-US trade deal are nonsense. So why was the NHS being discussed at all? Johnson says it is nonsense to say the NHS would be part of a trade deal. He says Labour is trying to distract attention from the problems with its Brexit policy. He says Labour is showing a vacuum of leadership on antisemitism and on Brexit. That's it. The event is over. A questioner says hello to Johnson in Cornish. He replies with a word of what sounds like Cornish - to applause from the audience. Q: Cornwall council has lost \u00a3370m since 2010. Is it right, then, to be putting \u00a32bn into a pot hole fund? Johnson says he thinks some of that pot hole money will go to councils. Q: Are you sorry for the state of the NHS in Cornwall? Johnson says he has seen the pressure the NHS is under. People do an incredible job, but they are under huge pressure. He says Truro is getting a new maternity unit. He says Labour's plan for a four-day week would be \"catastrophic\" for the management of all public services, including the NHS. Boris Johnson is now taking questions. Q: You said you would fix the crisis in social care when you became PM. But there is not much detail about this in your manifesto. Don't you think voters deserve a bit more detail? Johnson says he visited a hospital this morning, and heard about the pressures on the social care system. He says the government has put \u00a31.5bn into the system to meet immediate needs. There will be another \u00a31bn a year for the life of this parliament. And he says he wants to establish cross-party consensus on this. It should be based on two principles: dignity for people in old age, and no one having to sell their home to pay for care. Johnson says his party backs his Brexit deal. He goes on: There has never been such an outbreak of harmony in the Conservative party. That gets a round of applause. Johnson jokes about Michel Barnier asking Jeremy Corbyn whether anyone in Labour would back the Brexit deal that Corbyn proposes to negotiate with the EU. Johnson says Jeremy Corbyn made it clear in his Andrew Neil interview yesterday that taxation would go up for everone. He also claims that, under Labour, the UK's credit rating would go down. As a result borrowing would cost more, he says. Johnson says the Tories see a \"balance and a symmetry\" between having fantastic public services and having a market economy. The Tories are the only party in that believes in the market economy, he says. Johnson refers to his photocall at Goonhilly Earth Station earlier today. He jokes about wondering whether those satellite dishes could detect the missing element in Labour's Brexit policy - ie, Jeremy Corbyn's stance. (Actually, there isn't a mystery about Corbyn's stance any more. He has confirmed he would be neutral.) Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says it is great to be in Cornwall. He went for a run on the beach in St Ives this morning, he says. He is now on to the standard stump speech - starting with why there must be an election, to get Brexit done etc etc. Boris Johnson is doing a campaign event in Cornwall. There will be a live feed at the top of the blog shortly. These are from David Henig, a former UK civil servant specialising in trade policy who now runs the UK trade policy project for the European Centre for International Political Economy thinktank, on the leaked dossier about the UK-US trade talks. These are from some journalists who have had a chance to look at the leaked documents about UK-US trade talks released by Labour this morning. Generally, they think they are not quite as incriminating as Jeremy Corbyn implied. From Sky's Ed Conway From ITV's Robert Peston From the BBC's Faisal Islam From the Independent's Benjamin Kentish This is what Boris Johnson said in response to the Labour claims about the leaked documents from the UK-US trade deal talks. He said: The NHS is in no way on the table [in trade talks with the US], in no aspect whatever. This is continually brought up by the Labour party as a diversionary tactic from the difficulties they are encountering, particularly the problem about leadership on antisemitism, and then the great vacuity about their policy on Brexit. Next up will be the Guardian's defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh. He will be answering any questions you may have about polling at 12.30pm on Friday. You can ask your question via our form here. Boris Johnson has apologised for the \"hurt and offence\" that has been caused by Islamophobia within the Conservative party ranks. Speaking on a campaign visit in Cornwall, Johnson said: Obviously whenever we have an incident of antisemitism or Islamophobia or whatever in the Conservative party we take a zero tolerance approach... We have a one bounce and we deal with it approach to this. We are going to have an independent inquiry into Islamophobia, antisemitism, every manner of prejudice and discrimination and it will start before Christmas. Asked whether he apologised for the Islamophobia that has taken place in the Tory party, he replied: Of course and for all the hurt and offence that has been caused - of course we do. And all that is intolerable and it's so important as a country that we don't allow that kind of thing and that's why we're going to have the independent inquiry. Johnson's decision to apologise may have been intended to mark a contrast with Jeremy Corbyn, who refused to for his handling of antisemitism in the Labour party in his Andrew Neil interview last night - even though he had apologised about it in the past. (See 7.43am.) But there is also a contrast with the approach taken by Johnson himself in the BBC Question Time debate on Friday last week. Johnson was asked to apologise for a column he wrote last year describing Muslim women wearing burqas as looking like letterboxes. This was condemned as Islamophobic, and blamed for a 375% rise in incidents of Islamophobia, but Johnson refused to apologise. Q: Just how radical is the Labour party manifesto - when compared to both traditional British politics, and to other European countries? Tom Bacon, freelance journalist in the entertainment sector, Ormskirk Hi Tom. So Jeremy Corbyn was right when he told my colleague Kate Proctor earlier this week that his plans wouldn't put the UK significantly out of line with other European countries, in terms of tax and spending and the size of the state. But it's the speed of the transformation that is so striking: the manifesto envisages a radical transformation of the economy and the role of government, in just five years. As director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson put it, \"this would be the biggest set of spending increases, and the biggest set of tax increases, and the biggest set of borrowing increases we've seen in peacetime history\". Q: What does the nationalisation of Openreach mean for the thousands of people currently working for Openreach's competitors? There seems to have been no mention of this, with the implication being that given there will be no need for competitors of British Broadband, that their job losses will be the price to pay for 'free' broadband. Sam, West Midlands Good question, Sam. My colleague Peter Walker actually asked about the fate of those companies at the launch event for the broadband policy. The answer he was given was that they could continue to provide add-on services, such as subscription TV packages. But you're right, the expectation would be that their broadband operations would wither away (while BT Openreach - renamed British Broadband - would expand its operations significantly, presumably). Q: I'm aware that Labour are planning to decriminalise abortion - which I am wholly supportive of. However, I'm not clear on whether this also changes the law on the latest a woman can legally terminate? Many Tory supporters I know are posting pro-life website claims that abortion will be made legal at any point during pregnancy even when the baby is fully developed. I do not believe this to be true but struggling to find the details on the changes labour intend to make to abortion law and would like clarification. Nicole, Hertfordshire Hi Nicole. I'm really interested (and concerned) to hear that that's out there, because it's not true. The only reference to abortion policy in the manifesto says: \"We will uphold women's reproductive rights and decriminalise abortions.\" There is no reference to any plan to review the current policy. Thanks for asking that one. Just under 15 minutes left to ask any questions you may have on the Labour manifesto. Send them in to us here. Q: I have teenage grandchildren, one hoping to start higher education next year. Please can you clarify the Labour position on student grants - both for maintenance and tuition fees. Will there be means testing? If Labour takes over government after the election when would any new arrangements for student finances be introduced? Muriel, Preston Hello Muriel. Labour has said it will abolish tuition fees for all students - beginning immediately, so for those starting university in autumn 2020 - and bring back maintenance grants for the children of families on lower incomes. Q: Have Labour published any deeper details on what the \u00a31bn public health investment might break down into? Health inequalities presumably need to be a focus. Joel, 30, working in the charity sector, Essex Hi Joel. So yes: the manifesto says a Labour government would make reducing health inequalities a clear target of public policy. The \u00a31bn planned increase in public health funding is part of that, and they say they would recruit 4,500 more health visitors and school nurses - and take a series of other steps on everything from increasing breastfeeding support for new mums, to widening the scope of the sugar tax to tackle obesity. To try and make the target stick, they also say they would introduce a new Future Generations Wellbeing Act: a law aimed at forcing the government to check the impact of all new policy on health inequality; and a new obligation on NHS agencies to cooperate with directors of public health. Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish National party would have \"no great objection\" if Jeremy Corbyn was replaced as Labour leader, and hinted strongly she would support that if it helped form an anti-Tory coalition at Westminster. The SNP leader said she \"didn't get to choose who leads the Labour party\" but repeated several times at the launch of her party's election manifesto she was no fan of Corbyn's. Asked whether the SNP would support replacing Corbyn as party leader if there were moves to do so at Westminster, to build a cross-party coalition with Labour, she said: I don't choose the leader of the Labour party. I have said if I did choose the leader of Labour party I wouldn't choose Jeremy Corbyn, so that probably gives you the answer to that question. If Labour wanted to change its leader, I wouldn't have any great objection to that [but] I'm not in charge of that decision. The Labour adviser Lord Kerslake suggested earlier this week that Corbyn's resignation as leader and a deal on staging a second independence referendum could be the price exacted by the Lib Dems and SNP for forming a post-election coalition. Opinion polling suggests Labour is well short of winning enough seats to form a majority government, increasing speculation that Corbyn will have to strike deals with other opposition parties to block Boris Johnson from forming the next government. Even so, Corbyn has repeatedly ruled out any pacts or deals, rejecting Sturgeon's demands that he empower Holyrood to stage a fresh independence vote in late 2020. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, has repeatedly stated her party would never do deals with a Corbyn-led government. At the SNP manifesto launch this morning, Sturgeon was asked by Channel 4 News about the attacks on Corbyn's suitability as prime minister by Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi, and whether that gave her pause for thought about propping up a minority Labour government. She replied: I deplore Jeremy Corbyn's lack of leadership on the issue of antisemitism and I don't condone in any way, shape or form that failure on the part of him and of the Labour party to eradicate that from their ranks. But she said the SNP would exercise its duties at Westminster responsibly, pressing for its policy goals to be adopted by the next UK government. \"We will not be signing any blank cheque to Jeremy Corbyn or to any leader of the Labour party.\" Some of you have been sending in your questions about the Labour manifesto which I will be answering until 1.30pm. You can share your questions with us via our form here. Q: Labour has often hinted at electoral reform. Is there any commitment to scrapping the first past the post system for general elections? Daniel, 46, geologist, Leamington Spa I'm afraid, not, Daniel. Labour's manifesto says it will \"take urgent steps to refresh our democracy\", and commits to a series of specific changes, including abolishing the hereditary principle in the House of Lords and lowering the voting age to 16; but there is no mention of voting reform. It does say the reboot of democracy will be guided by a UK-wide constitutional convention, led by a citizens' assembly. Its appears to be mainly focused on the balance of power between Westminster and the rest of the UK; but perhaps voting reform might emerge as a recommendation? That's as close as the manifesto comes to the issue. Q: Has Labour made any indication that they would have a gender balanced cabinet? Eric Ekong, 28, software engineer, London So I haven't seen Jeremy Corbyn make that commitment explicitly, Eric, but he has repeatedly highlighted the gender balance in his shadow cabinet, and contrasted that with the Conservatives' more male-dominated top team. So while he hasn't committed to keeping everyone in the same jobs if he got into Downing Street, I think it's highly likely he would maintain a balance. Here are the main points from the Conservative rebuttal released in response to the leaked UK-US trade talks dossier, and what Jeremy Corbyn was saying about it. (See 12.20pm.) The Tories claim Corbyn deliberately misrepresented what the documents say about the UK being willing to consider lengthening the time during which medicine patents apply. Corbyn argued that this meant drug prices could rise for the UK under a UK-US trade deal. (See 11.37am.) But the Tories accuse Corbyn of lying. They say: In his press conference, Jeremy Corbyn highlighted the following quote: 'The impact of some patent issues raised on NHS access to generic drugs (i.e. cheaper drugs) will be a key consideration going forward' (13-14 November 2017, p.51) and suggested that this meant that the Government would allow drug prices to rise. This is a lie. Corbyn has quoted this section out of context. This was officials flagging a potential issue that the UK has to avoid in the future trade talks. The conversation that the paper reports on was a preliminary conversation in which the 'US focus was on explaining their legislation and approach in FTAs [free trade agreements]'. The paper also notes that there was only a 'limited discussion on pharmaceutical protection'. The reason this was only a limited conversation was 'given sensitivities in this area related to the NAFTA negotiations' (13-14 November 2017, p.44). The Tories say the documents show the Americans accept that the UK does not want to include the NHS in a deal. They say (bold in original): The notes make clear that, at the very start of the discussions, that the US team are aware that the UK won't accept any attempt to put the NHS on the table: 'Nursing was the other profession that the US was interested in... The US were interested to know if it would be really problematic for the UK to act in this area - they were sensitive to the particular sensitivities with the health sector in the UK.' (24-25 July 2017, p.24) Subsequent papers also state that 'we do not currently believe the US has a major offensive interest in this [health] space' (March 2018, p.53). The Tories say the documents show that, although the US \"probed\" the UK position, the British stressed that they did not want to include the health service in a deal. They say (bold in original): The papers only show that USTR [US trade representative] 'probed UK position on our \"health insurance\" system' (21-22 March 2018). The same document shows that the UK response made clear that 'Wouldn't want to discuss particular health care entities... we need to protect our needs; this would be something to discuss further down the line when we come to consider what entities would count as 'enterprises''. This reflects our clear position that the NHS is not for sale and that any trade deal should only include commercial enterprises. The Tories say the government has not accepted a negative listing approach to services in a trade deal (ie, the assumption that services are included unless the deal says specifically that they are not). Corbyn implied the opposite at the news conference this morning. The Tories says Corbyn was wrong to say trade negotiations have reached an advance stage with the US because formally they have not started. The UK cannot negotiate trade deals while it remains a member of the EU. They say the documents have been online for two months. (My colleague Alex Hern has more on this at 12.28pm.) The Tories say that, under Labour's plan for a customs union with the EU, the UK could be bound by an EU-US trade deal over which it would have no say. Many of your questions so far have been about how Labour will pay for free education and how EU citizens will be affected by Brexit. Q: One of the most popular ideas in the Labour manifesto is free education for all. Where would the money to back up the abolition of tuition fees for undergraduate and postgraduate courses come from? And how would that affect the economy given the astronomical fees that students currently pay/get a loan from? Carina Nicu, 27 years old, research technician at the University of Manchester, Manchester Hi Carina, you're right that abolishing tuition fees and restoring maintenance grants is the single most costly measure in the manifesto, at \u00a313.6bn a year by the end of the parliament. Labour says almost half of that, \u00a36.4bn, will be offset by the savings from getting rid of the current system (it's costly to administer, and many students have their fees written off anyway). They would also argue that ensuring kids from lower-income households are not deterred from going to university would have wider social/economic benefits - though of course it wouldn't just be these students who would benefit. Labour haven't earmarked specific taxes to pay for each spending measure - but their biggest money-raiser is increasing corporation tax, which is expected to bring in a whopping \u00a323.7bn a year within five years. The impact of that on the wider economy is contested: Labour say they're just taking it back to 2010 levels, and the 26% rate still won't be high by international standards. Critics say it will deter foreign investment - and that part of the cost will ultimately be passed on to customers and workers, as well as wealthy executives and shareholders. Q: Are there any concrete measures for EU nationals living in the UK (in the context of Brexit) in the Labour manifesto? Sabrina Hi Sabrina. Yes: the Labour manifesto reiterates the party's longstanding commitment to uphold the rights of EU citizens already in the UK to remain here. And it goes a bit further, saying a Labour government would get rid of the legal requirement to register under the EU settlement scheme. It would instead become a \"declaratory system\", under which EU citizens could register if they wished, but it wouldn't be a requirement for continuing to live and work here, the manifesto says. (It doesn't say how that would work for employers wondering if a particular individual has the right to be here). Labour would also expand the right of all migrants to bring their families to the UK. As for freedom of movement, that would depend on what happens with Brexit. I'm Heather Stewart, political editor of the Guardian, and will be answering your questions about the Labour manifesto today. I covered economics at the Guardian and Observer for 15 years before transferring to Westminster in 2016 - initially in a job share with Anushka Asthana. Since then I have covered a referendum and now two general elections. If you have a question you can send it to us by filling in the form here. The 451-page cache of US/UK trade negotiations shared by Jeremy Corbyn was published before today - by an unknown whistleblower to the social news website Reddit. In a post titled \"OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE: Great Britain is practically standing on her knees working on a trade agreement with the US\", the whistleblower shared a link to the documents, which they said \"sometimes give the impression that the second side of the process is not Great Britain, but a third world country\". But despite the poster's belief that \"this publication will make some noise\", the post attracted just a hundred or so \"upvotes\", and 23 comments, in the month since it was made. The cache did slowly begin to be shared more widely, however, with Labour MEP Jude Kirton-Darling posting it on her Twitter account five days ago. Shortly before they posted the documents to Reddit, the original leaker, a user called gregoratior, set up a new subforum on the site: \"ukwhistleblower\". But the subforum has not yet had anything posted in it, and had just five members before the news broke today. The Conservatives have released a four-page statement rebutting what was said by Jeremy Corbyn at his news conference this morning about the documents he has obtained about the UK-US trade talks. I will post full details of what the Tory rebuttal says shortly, but the gist of it is that Corbyn has deliberately misrepresented what they say. In a statement Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, has also sought to link Corbyn's handling of this story to his approach to antisemitism. She said: Jeremy Corbyn is getting desperate and is out-and-out lying to the public about what these documents contain. He has always believed in conspiracy theories - which is why he has failed to crack down on the scourge of antisemitism in his party. This is the man that has caused huge offence by blaming an imaginary 'Zionist lobby' for society's ills and now he has decided to smear UK officials too. People should not believe a word that he says - this stunt is simply a smokescreen for the fact that he has no plan for Brexit and that he has been forced to admit that he wants to increase taxes for millions of families. As we have consistently made clear: the NHS will not be on the table in any future trade deal and the price that the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table. This sort of conspiracy theory fuelled nonsense is not befitting of the leader of a major political party. Truss was referring to this article when she talked about Corbyn using the phrase \"Zionist lobby\". The Guido Fawkes website has published what it says are full versions of the documents released by Labour today. The campaigning group Global Justice Now has welcomed the release of what it is describing as leaked documents. The organisation released the original, heavily redacted version of these papers that were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. These were the papers Jeremy Corbyn was brandishing during the ITV debate last week. In a news release, Global Justice Now also offered its own summary of what these documents show. Here it is in full. The US pushing lower food standards on Britain post Brexit, including allowing imports of chlorine-washed chickens, less nutritional labelling on foods, and less protection for regional food like stilton cheese. The US offered to help the UK government 'sell' chlorine chicken to a sceptical British public and stated that parliamentary scrutiny of food standards is 'unhelpful'. The US banning any mention of climate change in a US-UK trade deal. US officials threatening UK civil servants that they would undermine US trade talks if they supported certain EU positions in international forums. The US suggesting a 'corporate court system' in a US-UK deal, which would allow big business to sue the British government, in secret and without appeal, for anything they regard as 'unfair'. Recent similar cases have included suing governments for trying to phase out use of coal. US officials pushing a far reaching proposals on the digital economy, giving big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon sweeping freedoms to move and use our online data, which would make taxation and regulation of these companies more difficult and prohibit Labour proposals for a public broadband service. Threats to public services like the NHS, via sweeping services liberalisation. The British government would need to exclude everything not subject to liberalisation in order to protect public services, while bringing formerly public services like the mail, or rail companies back into public ownership would be much harder. US officials making a further threat to NHS in terms of medicine pricing policy, with special concern about Brits paying more for cancer medicines which the US feels Britain doesn't pay enough for. Trade negotiators have received special lobbying from pharmaceutical corporations as part of the trade talks. US officials demanding US experts and multinational corporations are able to participate in standard-setting in Britain post Brexit. A promise by both sides to keep talks secret from the public. As part of a new series you can ask our political team any questions you have about the general election, and they will post their responses on the politics live blog between 12.30pm and 1.30pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until polling week. Today, the Guardian's political editor, Heather Stewart, will answer your questions about the Labour manifesto, campaign and policies, just how realistic the pledges are and what they might mean for you. You can ask your question via our form here. It is hard at this point to know quite how significant the Labour NHS trade talks document will turn out to be, but it is easily the most significant leak of the campaign so far. We have had surprise announcements from the parties about policy, and about strategy (eg, the Brexit party standing down in Tory-held seats), but this is a proper news story about stuff that has happened, not stuff that might happen in the future. Labour will be hoping that this has the potential to be a game-changer. (The charge that the NHS would be \"up for sale\" in a UK-US trade deal is one that resonates with voters, and alarms them, in a way that many Westminster policy/process stories don't.) In reality, very few things that happen in election campaigns turn out to be game-changer, but this may turn out to have enough heft to make the grade. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said about the documents in his opening speech. Voters need to ask themselves some very serious questions: is the NHS safe in Boris Johnson's hands? We've now got evidence that under Boris Johnson the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale. He tried to cover it up in a secret agenda but today it's been exposed. Now we know the truth, when Johnson says, 'get Brexit done', it's a fraud on the British people. This is the reality. Years of bogged down negotiations and our NHS is up for sale. This election is now a fight for the survival of our National Health Service. As a public service free for all at the point of need. And here are some of the specific points he made about what the documents show. Corbyn said the documents showed that UK and US officials have discussed lengthening the time during which medicine patents apply. He explained: In fact, negotiations have advanced even further than we feared they had. The US and UK have already finished initial discussion on lengthening patents for medicines. Longer patents mean only one thing - more expensive drugs. Lives will be put at risk as a result of this. Many out-of-patent medicines available cheaply here are vastly more expensive under patent law in the US. The drug Humira for Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis costs our NHS \u00a31,409 a packet. In the US, the same packet costs \u00a38,115. Get the difference - \u00a31,409 in our NHS, \u00a38,115 in the USA. One of the reasons for US drug prices being on average 250% of those here is a patent regime rigged for the big pharmaceutical companies... If you look at the readout of the second meeting, on page 51, UK officials report that \"patent issues\" around \"NHS access to generic drugs will be a key consideration\" in talks. US officials have \"pushed hard,\" the reports says, for longer patents for US drug companies. Corbyn said the documents showed that the two sides were closer to a deal than people expected. He said: You can also see on page 132 of the report of the fourth meeting, where drug patents are being discussed, that officials are ready to \"exchange text\" which is trade-negotiator-speak for it being at a very advanced stage. And they say they are ready to, I quote, \"really take significant further steps.\" He said the documents showed the US wanted \"total market access\" in a trade deal - implying health would be included. The new breed of trade deals are not only - or even mainly - about tariffs on goods at the border. They are also about services - including our health service. And these documents make clear that for the US, to quote page 41 of the third meeting report, \"everything is included unless something is specifically excluded.\" They want, I quote: \"Total market access\" as the \"baseline assumption of the trade negotiations.\" \"Total market access.\" Corbyn also said there was no evidence in the documents that the UK had pushed back against this. He went on: But surely you can't believe that British officials would demand the NHS be excluded? Apparently not. He said the documents showed that British officials said they would be a \"liberalising influence\". In fact, on behalf of the Conservative government, officials reassured their counterparts that \"the US should expect the UK to be a liberalising influence\" and that together they could \"fly the good flag for services liberalisation.\" That's a green light for breaking open Britain's public services so corporations can profit from. This is not surprising because the Tories have always said they would like free trade deals to cover services as well as good. He said the documents showed that a UK-US trade deal could provide protections for corporations, allowing them to sue governments in some circumstances for losses suffered. Officials have discussed a system to give corporations the power to sue our country. This is not only a plot against our NHS. It is a plot against the whole country. Again, this is not surprising. Provisions like this were included in the proposed US-EU trade deal. My colleague George Monbiot was one of those most critical of these provisions, but trade experts have defended them. Corbyn said the documents showed the Americans were offering to help the British persuade the public to accept the merits of chlorinated chicken. How about chlorine-washed chicken on our dinner tables? Have a look at the second meeting, on page 42 and 43, where the US even agrees to share its \"public lines\" to help our government with its \"media narratives.\" He said the documents showed the US favoured a no-deal Brexit. You might want to look at... page one of meeting six for the US advocating a no-deal Brexit saying that would mean there'd be \"all to play for\" in a deal with Trump. I will be focusing on the Labour revelations about the UK-US trade talks, and their implications for the NHS, for the next half an hour or more, and will pick up what was said at the SNP manifesto launch later. But if you want to watch it, there is a live feed here. This is what Boris Johnson posted on Twitter this morning, less than an hour before the Labour announcement. Here is the full text of Jeremy Corbyn's opening statement about the leaked documents that he says show the NHS is \"on the table\" in UK-US trade talks. The leaked documents obtained by Labour do not seem to be available online, or in a digital form. Here is some more about what they say from journalists at the press conference who have seen the hard copies. Q: Could you clarify if you have evidence that ministers knew the NHS would be up for sale? Gardiner holds up the documents again. He says it does not take six meetings and 500 pages to say the NHS is not for sale. This documentation shows that the answer has been yes. He says he does not think there is any doubt about this. George Hollingbery, the international trade minister, met with officials to discuss this, he says. Q: Would Labour reverse existing privatisations? And what would that cost? Corbyn says the Health and Social Care Act encourages more privatisation in the NHS. This has led to private sector companies suing the NHS for contracts they don't get. He says this is unbelievable. Every penny spent on this is taken away from patients' needs. He says he wants to reverse that. He says he wants to bring everyone working for the NHS back into the NHS family. He is determined to \"defend and rejuvenate\" the NHS. Q: It is clear from your interview last night that the claim that people earning less than \u00a380,000 won't pay higher tax under your plan is not true. Will you stop colleagues saying that? Corbyn says it is clear from Labour's grey book that people earning less than \u00a380,000 won't pay more in national insurance or tax. (He says tax, but may be referring to income tax.) The press conference is now over. Q: Was Lord Kerslake right to say, in the event of a hung parliament, your leadership would be on the agenda? Corbyn says there are no talks with other parties. He is fighting to win it. He is not fighting to form a coalition. Q: Isn't it the case that the Americans will always want to put everything on the table? Corbyn says these documents show that the two sides are starting to exchange treaty text. That suggests an agreement is close, he says. He says Labour would not accept investor protection provisions. Gardiner says Labour would not accept ISDS (investor state dispute settlement) provisions, or ICS (investment court system) provisions, a more modern alternative. He also says Labour would not accept a negative list procedure. This is an arrangement that would mean everything would be open to competition, unless otherwise specified. He says this system does not protect countries from competition in the event of new services coming into existence. Gardiner says other countries are adopting this approach to trade deals too. Q: Was yesterday the worst day of our campaign so far? Corbyn says he loves campaigning. Yesterday was another day when he went out to listen to people. He is horrified by what people tell him about inequality. Jeremy Corbyn is now taking questions. Q: [From Sky] Are you saying any trade deal with the US will be impossible without putting the NHS on the table? Q: [From ITV] Why would any British government do a deal that would make drugs more expensive in the UK? And do you accept President Trump's claim the NHS will not be on the table? Barry Gardiner, the shadow trade minister, answers on trade. He says there are four ways in which a trade deal can impact on the NHS: through the dispute settlement system; through what gets included; through changes to the patent regime; and through changes to the data regime. Q: [From the BBC] Do you have any evidence that ministers, as opposed to officials, agreed to the NHS being on the table in the talks? Corbyn says ministers sanctioned these talks, they were aware of the talks, and they declined to publish this information. Gardiner says George Hollingbery, a trade minister, was involved. Q: [From Sky] You did not apologise last night over antisemitism in the Labour party. Is that because you think you have not done anything wrong? Q: [From ITV] You say you are on the side of people. Does that include Jewish people? Q: [From the BBC] Do you accept the need to apologise to the Jewish community? Corbyn says antisemitism affects a tiny proportion of the party membership. But one is one too many. He says he accepts what the chief rabbi said yesterday. But there are many others in the Jewish community who do support Labour, he says. He says he is committed to getting rid of the scourge of racism in our society. He says the government he will lead would be the most anti-racist you have ever seen. At the news conference copies of the documents are now being handed out to journalists. Corbyn says it is now up to Boris Johnson to justify his decision to dismiss the Labour claim that the NHS would be on the table as an \"invention\". Labour will not let this rest, he says. Corbyn raises some specific points from the UK-US trade talks. He says page 43 shows how the Americans offered to give the British their lines to use to defend chlorinated chicken. And he says page 17 shows how the Americans refused to allow a mention of climate change in the deal. Jeremy Corbyn is speaking now. He says, although only redacted documents of the talks between UK and US officials were released in response to a freedom of information request, Labour has now obtained 451 pages of documents about what was discussed. A Channel 4 Dispatches investigation first revealed these talks. Corbyn brandishes the new documents. He says they leave \"Boris Johnson's denials in absolute tatters\". He says these papers show that \"the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale\" in a UK-US trade deal. There have been six rounds of talks, he says. But he says effectively it is all one negotiation. At the event Labour has just shown a short film featuring Jeremy Corbyn challenging Boris Johnson in the ITV debate last week over private meetings between UK and US officials about including health in a trade deal. Jeremy Corbyn is about to give a speech on the NHS at Westminster. There will be a live feed at the top of the blog soon. Labour has not briefed any of it in advance, and so we don't know what Corbyn is planning to say. Adam Price had more to say about growing up gay in Wales in this BBC Breakfast interview. Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, has urged Boris Johnson to apologise for referring to gay men as \"bum boys\" in newspaper column in the past. Price has been taking part in a BBC phone-in on BBC News and Radio 5 Live, and he was asked who he would rather have a pint with, Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn. Price, who is gay, replied: Not Boris Johnson... It has to be Jeremy Corbyn. Jeremy Corbyn has not called people like me a bum boy... Why can't people just say the most powerful word, sorry? Johnson was specifically asked about his use of the term \"bum boys\" in a newspaper column on Question Time on Friday night. Fiona Bruce put it to him that this was one of several examples of his having used racist or homophobic language. Johnson refused to apologise. Price said that he thought politicians should be willing to apologise, and he said Jeremy Corbyn should also have apologised in his Andrew Neil interview last night for his handling of the antisemitism issue. Price said: I think people respond well to politicians holding their hand up and saying I got it wrong. Johnson used the term \"bum boys\" in a 1998 column about the resignation of Peter Mandelson. In his Today interview Robert Jenrick was also asked about this specific complaint about Islamophobia in the Conservative party. A deputy chair of Stourbridge Conservative association resigned in protest at the attitude taken by fellow Tories when interviewing a Muslim who wanted to stand as a council candidate. In response to a question about this incident, Jenrick said: Well that's the first I've heard of that allegation, if that's correct, and it's extremely serious and deserves to be investigated and action deserves to be taken. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, told the Today programme this morning that the findings of the inquiry into racism in the Conservative party will be published. He said: We want to be a party that has no tolerance whatsoever of racism, prejudice or discrimination of any kind. I want to see by the end of this year, as the prime minister's promised, a thorough review of prejudice and racism and discrimination within the party. This will be a very thorough investigation led by independent individuals and the findings of it will be put into the public domain. So yes, I hope it will lay out the facts with regard to the Conservative party's record on discrimination of any kind and we will take the steps that are required. The Conservatives have said they will launch the inquiry before Christmas. But they don't seem very keen on launching it before polling day - perhaps because they are worried that the terms of reference will provoke complaints, either from party members who feel they go too far, or from non-members who feel they do not go far enough. Kirsty Blackman, the SNP's deputy Westminster leader, has suggested that a change of Labour leader could be one of the demands made by her party in exchange for post-election support for a minority government, as Jewish leaders in Scotland warned Nicola Sturgeon against making any post-election pact with Jeremy Corbyn. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, Blackman was asked if the SNP would demand a change of leader if it were to work with Labour, having been so critical of the party's handling of antisemitism charges. She replied: We'll look at all of the possible demands there are. There are massive problems with Jeremy Corbyn, he has not dealt with the antisemitism properly and he should have done. Asked about the chief rabbi's comments yesterday, she said: I believe that there's problems with antisemitism in the Labour party, absolutely, and that they have not dealt appropriately with them. And also that [Corbyn] should have apologised when he was on the news yesterday. Asked if she it was appropriate to support a leader who has acted that way, she said that the choice for English voters was \"between the devil and the deep blue sea\". We don't have a say over how the Labour party chooses their leader. I don't think it's a brilliant process and Jeremy Corbyn is not the leader we would choose. Pressed on how Scotland could \"escape Brexit\" by voting SNP, Blackman also resurrected the idea of an \"all-nations lock\" on a second EU referendum, proposed by Labour, meaning that if Scotland voted to remain as it did in 2016 this would act as a veto on Brexit. This morning, Paul Edlin, president of the Glasgow Jewish Representative Council, warned Nicola Sturgeon would be doing \"a deal with the devil\" if she were to help Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street. Good morning. I'm Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Damien Gayle. In his Today interview earlier (see 7.43am) Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, was also asked about Labour's plan to spend \u00a358bn compensation the Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) women - the women who have lost out from increases in the state pension age, which was not well advertised when it was decided in the 1990s. He defended the decision, saying these women were effectively the victims of \"theft\". He said: I make no apology, the Labour party makes no apology for taking the action necessary to right this wrong. These women had paid in, they expected this in their pensions, they were short-changed, that's wrong. This amounts to theft or robbery of money that these women paid into, money that they are entitled to. It's a wrong that needs righting. About 660,000 people registered to vote yesterday, the deadline for the 12 December election, of whom almost 460,000 were under 35, according to official statistics. The numbers of last-minute registrations were even higher than in 2017, when 622,000 people registered to vote on 22 May, of which about 450,000 were under 35. Those numbers were cited at the time as partly responsible for the \"youthquake\" that gave Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party its highest share of the vote and first gain in seats since the 2001 election. Younger voters skew heavily towards Labour. As much as the party leaders want to pull the agenda away from allegations of prejudice, the news cycle is not allowing them. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary, was challenged over Nia Griffiths' call last night for a fresh apology to the Jewish community over the allegations of antisemitism within Labour. (See 6.50am.) He was asked should Jeremy Corbyn also have apologised when challenged over the issue by Andrew Neil during a BBC interview last night? Burgon said he already had. Jeremy has apologised on a number of occasions and said he's sorry for the very real hurt felt by people in the Jewish community. So on a number of occasions, last summer for example, he's made this statement, and it's right that he did. A Labour government, Burgon pointed out, would make antisemitism awareness a part of the curriculum for schools. Burgon was previously forced to apologise after calling zionism, the political ideology that calls for a Jewish state in the Middle East, an \"enemy of peace\". Nia Griffith, the shadow defence secretary, joined the ranks of Labour MPs calling for more action within the party for addressing antisemitism. Speaking during a BBC Wales Live debate last night, she said: I would say absolutely that we need to apologise to our colleagues within my own party who have been very upset but to the whole of the Jewish community as well that we have not been as effective as we should have been in dealing with this problem and it is a shame on us, it really is, and it is something that I am very, very ashamed of and it is something that we absolutely must put right. How the papers covered it Our full wrap of the newspapers' front pages is here. Jeremy Corbyn will make a statement on NHS in London at 10am, before heading to Falmouth to speak at a climate change rally tonight. Johnson will be in the south-west talking about boosting phone signal in rural areas. The SNP will launch its manifesto in Glasgow at 11am. Nigel Farage will be in Doncaster. Chuka Umunna, Sam Gyimah and Michael Heseltine will be giving a press conference in London. Good morning, politics-watchers. I hope you've all had better sleeps than the one I imagine Jeremy Corbyn had last night after a bruising day for the Labour leader. The antisemitism accusations - which came on the day Labour was seeking to brand itself as the party of equality and compassion through the launch of its race and faith manifesto - dogged the party all day, and look as if they will be difficult to shake, after Jeremy Corbyn's interview with Andrew Neil last night in which he repeatedly resisted calls to apologise to the Jewish community. The Guardian's religion correspondent, Harriet Sherwood, spoke to Jewish community leaders and heard that while plenty of Jews in the UK would say the chief rabbi does not speak for them, many, probably most, agree with the thrust of his unprecedented intervention in the election campaign. After a difficult day, the Labour leader will be aiming to steer the conversation back to safer ground, by making a \"major statement\" on the NHS in Westminster in the morning and then heading to Falmouth where he will address a climate change rally. Boris Johnson will also be hoping to move away from talk of faith, after comments by the prime minister likening Muslim women who wear veils to \"letterboxes\" or \"bank robbers\" resurfaced. The chancellor, Sajid Javid, was asked about the comments yesterday and refused to condemn them. Johnson later dismissed criticism by the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). The MCB has also released a report urging parties to tackle racism and Islamophobia to win the support of Muslim voters, which particularly singled out the Conservatives and \"sections of the media\" for \"growing Islamophobia\". The prime minister will be in the south-west today, setting out plans for new phone masts and shared infrastructure to strengthen phone signals in rural areas. Again, will this be enough to make voters forget about Johnson's comments? We'll see. Thanks for reading along with us today, I'll be at the helm of the blog for the first hour, you can get in touch with me on Twitter or via email (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kate.lyons@theguardian.com\">kate.lyons@theguardian.com</email>). 80240 false false  Andrew Sparrow, Kevin Rawlinson, Damien Gayle and Kate Lyons      Boris Johnson delivers a speech during a visit to Healey's Cornish Cyder Farm in Callestick        Dominic Cummings arrives in Downing Street prior to the dissolution of parliament        Lord Heseltine (centre) alongside Liberal Democrat candidates Chuka Umunna (left) and Monica Harding (right) at a Lib Dem event in London this afternoon.

Google will not have to apply Europe's \"right to be forgotten\" law globally, the continent's top court ruled on Tuesday in a landmark case that has pitted personal privacy rights against freedom of speech. The victory for the U.S. tech titan means that, while it must remove links to sensitive personal data from its internet search results in Europe when required, it does not have to scrap them from searches elsewhere in the world. The case has been viewed as a landmark test, in an age of an internet that knows no borders, of whether people can demand a blanket removal of information about themselves from searches without stifling free speech and legitimate public interest. </p><p>It has also been seen by policymakers and companies around the world as a test of whether the European Union can extend its laws beyond its own territory. The ruling, which applies to all search engines, is rare positive news for big tech companies under intense official scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic over their dominant positions and gathering of vast amounts of data. In its judgment, the Court of Justice of the European Union said the right to have personal data protected was not an absolute right. \"The balance between the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, on the one hand, and the freedom of information of internet users, on the other, is likely to vary significantly around the world,\" it added. Google welcomed the decision, saying: \"It's good to see that the court agreed with our arguments.\" The world's predominant internet search engine has previously warned of the dangers of overreach by Europe. In a blog post two years ago, it said there should be a balance between sensitive personal data and the public interest and no country should be able to impose rules on citizens of another. The right to be forgotten was enshrined by the same European court in 2014 when it ruled that people could ask search engines like Google to remove inadequate or irrelevant information from web results appearing under searches for their names. Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, says it has since received 845,501 requests to remove links, and removed 45 percent of the 3.3 million links it was asked to scrap. PRIVACY VS SPEECH UK rights group Article 19, which campaigns for freedom of speech and information, applauded Tuesday's decision, in which the judges also said Google had some leeway in deciding whether to scrap links because of the balance between privacy rights and public interest. \"Courts or data regulators in the UK, France or Germany should not be able to determine the search results that internet users in America, India or Argentina get to see,\" Article 19 said. \"The court is right to state that the balance between privacy and free speech should be taken into account when deciding if websites should be de-listed - and also to recognize that this balance may vary around the world.\" But Patrick Van Eecke, global chair of the data protection practice at law firm DLAPiper, said it would limit the impact of a successful right to be forgotten application as it will be ring-fenced to searches performed within the European Union. \"This might obviously be frustrating for people who will see that people from outside Europe will still be able to find the de-listed search results when performing the same search on Google in New York, Shanghai or any other place in the world,\" he added. The case arose in 2016 after France's privacy watchdog CNIL fined Google 100,000 euros (US$109,790) for refusing to de-list sensitive information from search results globally upon request. Google took its fight to the French Council of State which subsequently sought advice from the European Court of Justice. The Council separately asked for advice after CNIL decided not to order Google to remove links from internet search results based on the names of four individuals. These included a satirical photomontage of a female politician, an article referring to someone as a public relations officer of the Church of Scientology, the placing under investigation of a male politician and the conviction of someone for sexual assaults against minors. CNIL said it would comply with Tuesday's ruling.

Google will not have to apply Europe's \"right to be forgotten\" law globally, the continent's top court ruled on Tuesday in a landmark case that has pitted personal privacy rights against freedom of speech. The victory for the U.S. tech titan means that, while it must remove links to sensitive personal data from its internet search results in Europe when required, it does not have to scrap them from searches elsewhere in the world. The case has been viewed as a landmark test, in an age of an internet that knows no borders, of whether people can demand a blanket removal of information about themselves from searches without stifling free speech and legitimate public interest. </p><p>It has also been seen by policymakers and companies around the world as a test of whether the European Union can extend its laws beyond its own territory. The ruling, which applies to all search engines, is rare positive news for big tech companies under intense official scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic over their dominant positions and gathering of vast amounts of data. In its judgement, the Court of Justice of the European Union said the right to have personal data protected was not an absolute right. \"The balance between the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, on the one hand, and the freedom of information of internet users, on the other, is likely to vary significantly around the world,\" it added. Google welcomed the decision, saying: \"It's good to see that the court agreed with our arguments.\" The world's predominant internet search engine has previously warned of the dangers of overreach by Europe. In a blog post two years ago, it said there should be a balance between sensitive personal data and the public interest and no country should be able to impose rules on citizens of another. The right to be forgotten was enshrined by the same European court in 2014 when it ruled that people could ask search engines like Google to remove inadequate or irrelevant information from web results appearing under searches for their names. Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, says it has since received 845,501 requests to remove links, and removed 45 percent of the 3.3 million links it was asked to scrap. PRIVACY VS SPEECH UK rights group Article 19, which campaigns for freedom of speech and information, applauded Tuesday's decision, in which the judges also said Google had some leeway in deciding whether to scrap links because of the balance between privacy rights and public interest. \"Courts or data regulators in the UK, France or Germany should not be able to determine the search results that internet users in America, India or Argentina get to see,\" Article 19 said. \"The court is right to state that the balance between privacy and free speech should be taken into account when deciding if websites should be de-listed - and also to recognise that this balance may vary around the world.\" But Patrick Van Eecke, global chair of the data protection practice at law firm DLAPiper, said it would limit the impact of a successful right to be forgotten application as it will be ring-fenced to searches performed within the European Union. \"This might obviously be frustrating for people who will see that people from outside Europe will still be able to find the de-listed search results when performing the same search on Google in New York, Shanghai or any other place in the world,\" he added. The case arose in 2016 after France's privacy watchdog CNIL fined Google 100,000 euros (US$109,790) for refusing to de-list sensitive information from search results globally upon request. Google took its fight to the French Council of State which subsequently sought advice from the European Court of Justice. The Council separately asked for advice after CNIL decided not to order Google to remove links from internet search results based on the names of four individuals. These included a satirical photomontage of a female politician, an article referring to someone as a public relations officer of the Church of Scientology, the placing under investigation of a male politician and the conviction of someone for sexual assaults against minors. CNIL said it would comply with Tuesday's ruling.

Google will not have to apply Europe's \"right to be forgotten\" law globally, the continent's top court ruled on Tuesday in a landmark case that has pitted personal privacy rights against freedom of speech. The victory for the U.S. tech titan means that, while it must remove links to sensitive personal data from its internet search results in Europe when required, it does not have to scrap them from searches elsewhere in the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The case has been viewed as a landmark test, in an age of an internet that knows no borders, of whether people can demand a blanket removal of information about themselves from searches without stifling free speech and legitimate public interest. It has also been seen by policy-makers and companies around the world as a test of whether the European Union can extend its laws beyond its own territory. The ruling, which applies to all search engines, is rare positive news for big tech companies under intense official scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic over their dominant positions and gathering of vast amounts of data. In its judgment, the Court of Justice of the European Union said the right to have personal data protected was not an absolute right.</p><p>\"The balance between the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, on the one hand, and the freedom of information of internet users, on the other, is likely to vary significantly around the world,\" it added. Google welcomed the decision, saying: \"It's good to see that the court agreed with our arguments.\" The world's predominant internet search engine has previously warned of the dangers of overreach by Europe. In a blog post two years ago, it said there should be a balance between sensitive personal data and the public interest and no country should be able to impose rules on citizens of another.</p><p>The right to be forgotten was enshrined by the same European court in 2014 when it ruled that people could ask search engines like Google to remove inadequate or irrelevant information from web results appearing under searches for their names. Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., says it has since received 845,501 requests to remove links, and removed 45 per cent of the 3.3 million links it has been asked to scrap.</p><p>UK rights group Article 19, which campaigns for freedom of speech and information, applauded Tuesday's decision, in which the judges also said Google had some leeway in deciding whether to scrap links because of the balance between privacy rights and public interest. \"Courts or data regulators in the UK, France or Germany should not be able to determine the search results that internet users in America, India or Argentina get to see,\" Article 19 said. \"The court is right to state that the balance between privacy and free speech should be taken into account when deciding if websites should be delisted - and also to recognize that this balance may vary around the world.\"</p><p>But Patrick Van Eecke, global chair of the data protection practice at law firm DLAPiper, said it would limit the impact of a successful right to be forgotten application as it will be ring-fenced to searches performed within the European Union. \"This might obviously be frustrating for people who will see that people from outside Europe will still be able to find the delisted search results when performing the same search on Google in New York, Shanghai or any other place in the world,\" he added. The case arose in 2016 after France's privacy watchdog CNIL fined Google 100,000 euros (US$109,790) for refusing to de-list sensitive information from search results globally upon request.</p><p>Google took its fight to the French Council of State which subsequently sought advice from the European Court of Justice. The Council separately asked for advice after CNIL decided not to order Google to remove links from internet search results based on the names of four individuals. These included a satirical photomontage of a female politician, an article referring to someone as a public relations officer of the Church of Scientology, the placing under investigation of a male politician and the conviction of someone for sexual assaults against minors. CNIL said it would comply with Tuesday's ruling. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

One that speaks to populist frustrations with Big Tech and environmental concerns about waste and that is already being adopted in other jurisdictions.</p><p>\"Right to repair\" is a growing movement of people fed up with being told they aren't allowed to fix the stuff they've paid a lot of money to own.</p><p>Whether you've been told a minor fix for your iPhone will cost $650, a replacement part for your two-year-old espresso maker isn't made any more, or it's illegal to repair your John Deere farm implement without using their own high-priced services, you're one of the 75 per cent of Canadians found by recent polls to be in support of government action that would force manufacturers to provide the necessary documents, parts and information to allow anyone to repair their products.</p><p>The movement has hit a nerve across the political spectrum and in both urban and rural communities. As a left-leaning West Coast entrepreneur and a centre-right industrial Quebecois, we're living proof of the broad appeal. And things are moving quickly. In the U.S., over 20 states are already developing \"right to repair\" laws. In Europe, the EU recently passed legislation that will cover products for a wide range of consumer electronics.</p><p>But here in Canada, not so much.</p><p>Most of us grew up taking pride in our ability to repair things. It's a chance to learn about how things work, build some self-reliance, show off some technical flair, save hard-earned money and avoid waste. But the situation has changed dramatically in recent years.</p><p>Companies have aggressively begun to block access to repair through an assortment of strategies. For example, many have stopped selling replacement parts or progressively marked up the pricing, so there's no choice but to by a new item. Manuals and technical information are made scarce as products age, or not made available at all. Important software is locked or unusable without authorized parts or repair systems. All this leaves consumers at the mercy of manufacturers who can charge whatever fees they want. The predictable and calculated result is higher costs, more consumption, greater waste.</p><p>Obviously, the companies that invest in creating the products need to get a fair return on servicing and replacement sales but allowing monopolistic behaviour like this distorts markets, discourages innovation, gouges consumers and creates environmental problems.</p><p>Instead, let's take action to encourage a more circular economy, one that builds resilience and economic opportunity by encouraging reuse, repair and recycling.</p><p>A small regulatory change can make a big difference. Providing reasonable access to parts and information after a manufacturer stops supporting a product would be a good start. Not just for our pocketbooks and landfills, but maybe for our divided parliament and our national mood too.</p><p>Glen Lougheed is a West Coast-based high tech entrepreneur who advises the BCNDP on innovation policy.

Josh Hawley\u2019s bill, the Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology (SMART) Act, would make it illegal for social media companies such as Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat to use infinite scroll, autoplay video or techniques like Snapchat\u2019s \u201cstreaks,\u201d which reward a user with badges for repeated use.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cBig tech has embraced a business model of addiction,\u201d Hawley, a Missouri Republican, said in a statement announcing the bill. \u201cToo much of the \\x91innovation\u2019 in this space is designed not to create better products, but to capture more attention by using psychological tricks that make it difficult to look away. This legislation will put an end to that and encourage true innovation by tech companies.\u201d</p><p>The senator has spent his first year in office taking on Big Tech. He grilled Google executives during hearings on the company\u2019s data-collection policies. He wrote a scathing letter to the Federal Trade Commission, rebuking regulators for failing to protect consumers from privacy abuse and overreach by Silicon Valley. He proposed a major bipartisan update to the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, which would further curb tech companies\u2019 ability to monitor the online behavior of kids.</p><p>At 39, he is a digital native with a deeper understanding of tech than many of his colleagues. Others in the new class to conquer Capitol Hill have used the very social media platforms he rails against to elevate their voices and steer the online conversation. But Hawley has said he chooses to use them sparingly and has even suggested that society would be better off if social media disappeared.</p><p>He has called social media a \u201cparasite on productive investment, on meaningful relationships,</p><p>on a healthy society\" and once asked during an NBC interview, \"should these platforms exist at all?\"</p><p>The bill doesn't go as far as outright banning social media platforms, but it proposes regulatory measures that would force users to actively choose to engage for prolonged periods rather than being mindlessly sucked into the void.</p><p>It would require platforms to implement \"natural stopping points,\" or places where a video or post stops and the users are prompted to click or select another piece of content, rather than it appearing or playing automatically. For example, this could affect the way Instagram stories endlessly rotate from one to the next.</p><p>Hawley's proposal would also require social media companies to create a \"user-friendly interface\" that would allow users to set time limits or boundaries for themselves and actively display how much time they had spent on any platform.</p><p>In addition, the bill would require the FTC to produce a report at least every three years on the \"issue of Internet addiction\" that would explore the ways \"social media companies, by exploiting human psychology and brain physiology, interfere with free choices of individuals on the Internet.\"</p><p>The SMART Act would give the FTC and secretary of Health and Human Services authority to enforce regulations and establish new rules as the tech environment continues to evolve and innovate.</p><p>The Internet Association \\x97 a trade group that represents global Internet companies including Twitter, Facebook and Snap Inc., which owns Snapchat \\x97 said in a statement from President and CEO Michael Beckerman that social media platforms already invest and participate in programs and partnerships that \"promote healthy online experiences.\" Tools to help users regulate their time online already exist, the association added.</p><p>In his statement, Beckerman said the association backs the Children and Media Research Advancement (CAMRA) Act, which would fund a study by the National Institutes of Health examining the impact of media and technology on children's health.</p><p>\"Funding for independent scientific research is critical to better understand the impact of screen time and identify more ways to enhance people's well-being on and offline,\" Beckerman's statement said.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that tech companies use computer design techniques embraced by casinos, such as the idea of \"stickiness\" \\x97 which give \"just enough positive feedback to want to return to the game but deny users enough pleasure so that they don't get satiated,\" Siva Vaidhyanathan told The Washington Post last year. Vaidhyanathan is the author of \"Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy.\"</p><p>A 2018 Pew Research Center study found that 89% of teens surveyed that year said they were online \"almost constantly\" or \"several times a day.\" Forty-five percent said they were online \"almost constantly.\"</p><p>A different study published in 2019 in the Journal of Behavioral Addictions found that those who reported spending excessive time on Facebook were more likely to take risky gambles, performing on a psychological test with the same impulses as someone addicted to drugs.</p><p>Hawley's bill does not yet have any co-sponsors, reported The Hill.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>GOVERNMENT</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>WASHINGTON \\x97 The youngest senator in Congress, and one of its toughest crusaders against Big Tech, proposed a bill Tuesday meant to curb social media addiction by regulating the techniques that prolong engagement on the platforms.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Freshman Sen.

The MU points out that more than half of working musicians earn less than \u00a320,000 a year. </p><p>Mr Trubridge, who had hits with Daddy Cool, The Boy from New York City and Duke of Earl, added: \"The UK music industry is worth a huge amount to the British economy and for its musicians to be denied revenue because of lobbying by the big technology companies is simply unfair and ultimately counterproductive.\"</p><p>The campaign to reinstate the levy element of the Copyright Directive has won the backing of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) and Lord Berkeley of Knighton, the composer, peer and BBC Radio 3 presenter. </p><p>They says the way the Government has drafted the copyright exemption contained in the EU directive will disadvantage musicians, as it does not provide fair compensation and would therefore hit new talent, such as songwriters, composers and musicians. </p><p>Campaigners argue the levy would not be passed on to consumers, as it is absorbed by the manufacturers. </p><p>A spokesman for the MU said: \"Big tech companies absorb the cost and the price of the devices that they sell does not increase. Spain changed its compensation system a few years ago and it had no impact on the price of a device.\"</p><p>The only other countries in the EU not to have what campaigners call a 'fair compensation system' are Cyprus, Ireland, Luxembourg and Malta. </p><p>A spokesman for the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, said: \"The Government considers private copying levies to be unfair, unnecessary and bureaucratic taxes on business and consumers. We have always said that we will be the first government in modern history to reduce rather than increase the amount of regulation in existence. </p><p>\"This change to copyright law will mean millions of people no longer have to break the law just to listen to music that they have already paid for - as long as it is for personal use and not for making copies for other people. The changes will be introduced into parliament shortly.\"</p><p>                     CASE STUDY: Helen Parker-Jayne Isibor and the Venus Bushfires                   </p><p>There have been several times during Helen Parker-Jayne Isibor's music career when - like so many other struggling musicians - she has been forced to rely on income from other jobs to make a living. </p><p>She's worked as an office manager, a receptionist, a PA and even a film and TV extra, just to earn enough so she could carry on writing and making music. </p><p>It was precisely those moments when any extra form of income from the kind of levy on tablets and computers adopted in many European countries, would have been a lifesaver, allowing her to focus more on her music. And it is why she believes it should be introduced in the UK. </p><p>Even now money from the a levy would provide a useful supplement for the Nigerian-born Londoner, who has performed with her band The Venus Bushfiresalongside Sir Paul McCartney and created music for Sony PlayStation, Disney and Channel 4. </p><p>                                            Miss Isibor                     , who moved to Britain with her family at the age of seven, currently relies on fees from concerts, along with selling CDs and merchandising, such as T-shirts, direct to fans at her gigs. \"There have been various points in my career when money from the kind of levy the EU is proposing would have been a big help for me,\" she said. \"There are some young musicians starting off now for whom it could mean the difference between carrying on with music and simply giving up.\"</p><p>Miss Isibor, who sings and plays the hang drums, also believes the technology companies who make big profits from the sale of tablets and computers to music fans have a responsibility to put something back into the music industry. </p><p>She said: \"Basically if it wasn't for the music we produce as artists they would sell far fewer of these items and its only right they put something back to help nurture new talent. It's not a tax on consumers, which I wouldn't agree with as I'm one of them, its a small cost the manufacturers can absorb.\"</p><p>Miss Isibor, 35, who has also performed at London Fashion Week, is currently writing an opera in west African pidgin - about her own experience of growing up with two cultures - to be premiered in Lagos in July followed by performances in the UK. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-17550022</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BPC-0K61-J9YR-G081-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1057\"/><timeReceived>8:45 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"0735\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>March 9, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Only 13 percent of those aged 60 or above viewed such advice as necessary.<br/><br/>Private banks \u201cdon\u2019t necessarily need to offer products, or advice on specifics, but just to get into a level of conversation and have an opinion would be a good starting point,\" said David Wilson, Capgemini\u2019s head of Asia wealth management. \u201cIf you can\u2019t engage on a conversation level with the next-gen clients, then you\u2019ll be out of the conversation and they will go to someone who can.\"<br/><br/>Surging global interest in cryptocurrencies propelled Bitcoin prices more than 1,400 percent higher last year, though they have given up much of those gains in 2018. This year\u2019s sell-off occurred amid a string of cyber heists, including the nearly $500 million theft from Japanese exchange Coincheck Inc. in late January and a smaller hack in South Korea this month.<br/><br/>Only 35 percent of those surveyed by Capgemini said they had received information about cryptocurrencies from their wealth managers. Private banks are deterred by the newness of the market and the lack of consistent guidelines from global regulators, Wilson said. Many wealth managers have yet to develop enough expertise on crypto assets, he added.<br/><br/>Beyond the wealth management industry, the financial world remains divided on the issue of cryptocurrency investment. Vocal skeptics include two of the world\u2019s richest billionaires, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, as well as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\u2019s Jamie Dimon.<br/><br/>\u2018Google Wealth\u2019<br/><br/>Another potential challenge for the private banks is the interest shown by younger millionaires in having a major technology firm act as their wealth manager, according to the survey. About 88 percent of those under 40 said they\u2019d like to get such advice from companies like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google if it enters the wealth business, Capgemini said.<br/><br/>Interest in having a technology firm as an adviser was especially strong in Latin America and in Asia excluding Japan, according to Capgemini. Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. were also mentioned as \u201cdesirable\" wealth managers, should they decide to enter the business.<br/><br/>Wilson said it\u2019s a matter of \u201cwhen, not if\" the big tech firms start to offer wealth management services. Private banks are boosting their investment in technology, such as artificial intelligence and automation, as they adapt to the changing market, he added.<br/><br/>Capgemini surveyed more than 2,600 people with at least $1 million in investable assets across 19 wealth markets in the Americas, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. About 47 percent of those surveyed were under 40.<br/><br/><br/>To contact the reporter on this story: Chanyaporn Chanjaroen in Singapore at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cchanjaroen@bloomberg.net\">cchanjaroen@bloomberg.net</email> To contact the editors responsible for this story: Marcus Wright at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mwright115@bloomberg.net\">mwright115@bloomberg.net</email> Russell Ward</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WLTMNG-387844</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WLTMNG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SM4-0621-JBKS-P22T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433214</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"539\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Penton Business Media, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wealth Management</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 21, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Cheat Sheet</url> delivered by Newstex) --<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Downgrades into Earnings<br/><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://wallstcheatsheet.com/trading-markets/intel-reports-a-monster-quarter/?p=14405/\">Following Intels (NASDAQ: INTC) blockbuster earnings report</url>, its now time for us stock market tech enthusiasts to turn our attention to Googles (Nasdaq: GOOG)\u00a0upcoming report.\u00a0 The 2nd quarter of 2010 will go down in history as the quarter in which Googlebecame a valuation play relative to its peers (yes, Googlewas a \u0153value play during the bust of 2007-08, but that was a time of equal opportunity hating across all classes of equities).\u00a0 For the first time in its history as both a public company and a big tech bellwether, Googlenow trades with a forward p/e (based on consensus analyst estimates) of less than 20.</p><p><br/><br/>Many analysts have tempered expectations ahead of Googles 2nd quarter report.\u00a0 This is as much due to heightened macroeconomic volatility, as it is analysts concern over Googles perceived inability to monetize on any line of business outside its core search and ad-based model.\u00a0 JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) analyst,<url normalizedValue=\"http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/07/07/jp-morgan-lowers-goog-ahead-of-q2-earnings/\"> Imran Khan cited slower sequential growth</url> due to Eurozone weakness, the discontinuation of the Nexus line of phones, and FOREX hedging expenses in contributing to a slower overall growth rate.<br/><br/>Several analysts have expressed concerns over the lack of a foreseeable growth opportunity for Googlerevenues.\u00a0 This stems as much from Googles withdrawal from the rapidly growing Chinese market, as it does the failure of the Nexus to become a hot-selling end consumer device.\u00a0 All in all,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/news/article.aspx?feed=AP&amp;date=20100713&amp;id=11700759\">analysts are expecting earnings of $6.54 per share, on revenues of $5 billion</url>.<br/><br/>Digging a Little Deeper<br/><br/>Analysts do a pretty solid job of projecting Googles earnings from the search and ad-based revenues, as much of that data comes from comScore and cost-per-click data that is largely publicly available.\u00a0 However, Googlehas historically been rather secretive about dividing its revenue sources into easily ascertainable information.\u00a0 During the quarter,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/16/google-youtube-overlay-ads/\">Google made it far easier for anyone to create advertising content on YouTube</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://gizmodo.com/5576453/youtube-gets-it-will-allow-ad-skipping\">started implementing creative ways through which they can better value ads</url> for their customers.<br/><br/>Several times this year, <person><nameText>Eric Schmidt </nameText></person>both hinted and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.ft.com/techblog/2010/01/exclusive-youtube-profits-coming-this-year/\">outright stated that YouTube is on its way to becoming a profitable</url> and integral component of Googles overall strategy.\u00a0 Googles brass does a great job at tempering expectations, and Schmidts clue should be a hint to us all that at some point this year Googlewill unveil and earnings surprise.\u00a0 I personally would not be surprised to see signs of YouTubes profitability in this particular earnings report.<br/><br/>For a company engaged in an aggressive growth via acquisition and investment strategy, it is rather telling that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15196982/\">Googles $1.65 billion investment in YouTube</url> is paying off.\u00a0\u00a0 Speaking of which, regulatory approval for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techcrunch.com/2009/11/09/google-acquires-admob/\">Google to close on their acquisition of AdMob</url> sets the stage for the company to turn the rapid uptake of its Android phone operating system into an earnings behemoth.\u00a0 This acquisition sets the stage for Googleto continue expanding their presence in the growing mobile advertising market, using their Android operating system as a catalyst through which to reach a growing market.<br/><br/>Oh, and about that Android uptake?\u00a0 Well despite the Nexus Ones failure, the Android browser is soaring to successes beyond what any had projected.\u00a0 In the second quarter,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/google-activates-160000-android-phones-each-day-2010-6\">Android activations moved up to 160,000 phones per day</url>, while the app market surged,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.androidguys.com/2010/06/23/160000-android-phones-sold-daily-market-nears-70000-applications/\"> growing from 50,000 total apps to 70,000 in the month of June alone</url>.<br/><br/>HTC, a phone manufacturer which uses the Android browser in many of its top lines just      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/htc-sales-soar-58-thanks-to-google-android-2010-7?\"> last week announced stellar second quarter earnings, which far surpassed any analyst expectations</url>: sales increased by a whopping 58% over 2q 2009.\u00a0 This clues us into the fact that while much of the success in Android uptake has been a recent phenomenon, there should be actual signs of this trend in second quarter earnings for Google(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://hardgeek.org/how-does-google-make-money-on-android-\u0153android-the-cash-cow \">Google doesnt necessarily make money off of Android activations, they primarily monetize the Android via the Apps market and use of Google tools</url>).<br/><br/>What Im Looking For<br/><br/>Since earnings are inherently backwards looking, its not worth talking       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/413813-elliot-turner/72913-google-tv-can-google-prosper-where-apple-failed\">too much about the unveiling of GoogleTV</url>.\u00a0 What is clear is that analysts and traders are looking for the company to show some signs of significant revenue growth beyond the scope of Googles tradition Internet ad model.\u00a0 I want to see more clues that the YouTube and Android successes are turning into tangible profits for the Google.\u00a0 Seeing this transition in the earnings is rather difficult considering the companys secretive ways; however, should Googleturn around and comfortably beat these tempered analyst expectations, it would be a great clue as to these new lines of revenues for the company.\u00a0 Personally, I expect a beat considering the inability for analysts to project revenue growth in the Android and YouTube markets, two areas in which the evidence points to significant acceleration for Google.<br/><br/>Disclosure:

There were those who wanted no regulation - this was the future, don't spoil it with red tape. And there were those who wanted lots of it. These four-ton monsters were dangerous. Someone would get killed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1865, after much toing and froing, the Locomotive Act was introduced. Not only did it set a 4mph speed limit, but it also made it compulsory that a person \"shall precede such locomotive on foot by not less than 60 yards, and shall carry a red flag constantly displayed, and shall warn the riders and drivers of horses of the approach of such locomotives\". Draconian, cried the nascent car lobby, a put-up job by the train lobby.</p><p>What followed, as those car lobbyists predicted, was a whole host of further regulations - brakes became standard, then brake lights, headlights, indicators, seatbelts, airbags, crumple zones, automated collision avoidance systems, windscreen wipers. Yes, people still die in car crashes, but where would the automotive industry be today if it hadn't been for regulation? The red tape didn't stop invention. It made it better.</p><p>This month, we have reached the same pivotal point in the digital world. Ahead are two discrete paths. The first lets Big Tech continue to enjoy self-regulation and to \"move fast and break things\" - as Mark Zuckerberg's strategy for Facebook innovation went. The second leads to the digital equivalent of men walking in front of cars with red flags.</p><p>Until now, Silicon Valley has resisted that second path with a combination of intransigence, promises and, quite simply, not turning up to committee meetings. Now a large swathe of that resistance looks as if it's coming to an end, thanks largely to a cross-discipline, cross-bench and cross-house crack team that includes Baroness Beeban Kidron; the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham; the children's commissioner, Anne Longfield; and Margot James, minister for digital and the creative industries.</p><p>The Age-Appropriate Design Code - or Kids' Code for short - is an extrapolation of last year's Data Protection Act, which introduced tough rules about how our data can be handled.</p><p>\"For the first time, kids have special rights in the law,\" says Denham, who is responsible for the legislation, which is currently in public consultation. \"The code translates those rights into practical standards that companies and service providers will take and build into our digital future. Ten years ago, most of the conversation was about safety and security - keeping kids offpornographic sites, making sure that they're not lured by adults online, protection from cyber-bullying. Now there's a broader conversation to have because websites have been developed in a way that really robs children of agency.\"</p><p>The 16 standards set out in the Kids' Code will amount to a comprehensive, radical change in the digital lives of children. Standard one sets the tone. It states that if children are likely to be using a service, then \"the best interests of a child should be a primary consideration\". As any parent of a YouTubing, Instagramming, Fortniteing teenager will tell you, this is not currently the case.</p><p>Tech firms will have to make their services \"suitable by default\" for all children. Adults can then decide if they want to access sections of the service that are not appropriate for children via robust age verification. In other words, the digital world arrives child-friendly and needs to be tailored to display the grown-up stuff, rather than the other way around, as it is now.</p><p>Companies will no longer be able to share a child's data. They will only be able to collect the minimum amount of data needed to \"provide the elements in which a child is actively and knowingly engaged\".</p><p>Services will be on high-privacy settings by default. Profiling options will be limited drastically. Instead of burying important information about data use in the 147th clause of the 15th page of the terms and conditions, there will have to be clear messaging at the point of entry. If any ulterior motives survive, they will have to be there, in plain sight. Not quite \"We are using your data to sell you stuff\", but not far off.</p><p>There is more. The psychological tricks used prolifically online to keep us addicted will not be allowed under the code if children are likely to be using the service. Likes on Facebook, streaks on Snapchat and games that reward regular log-ons, don't have a save option and give you bonus points if you message friends - all gone.</p><p>\"When you like or streak or share something,\" Denham says, \"you're leaving a digital footprint. And those digital footprints are what the company wants to encourage you to stay online and to deliver advertising. A larger digital footprint allows more personalisation of content, more delivery of advertising and messages that are increasingly more provocative about subjects that a child is interested in.\" All of which will stop under the Kids' Code.</p><p>Those smart devices - the interactive home hubs, the connected thermostats, vacuum cleaners and speakers, the talking teddy bears and wireless baby monitors that sit quietly in our homes gathering intel - will also have to comply with the code. If there are children in the home, Alexa, Siri and friends will no longer be able to listen in unless parents opt to downgrade settings.</p><p>Perhaps most significantly of all, the code will tackle digital rabbit holes. On social media sites and video-streaming services, algorithms are designed to keep you hooked. You found one guide to self-harm, here are 47 more. With restrictions on data-sharing, profiling and geolocating, this psychological snare will no longer be a central part of the digital world's business plan. Should the Kids' Code make it through consultation, the internet will never be the same again.</p><p>Sitting in the riverside tearoom half a corridor along from the House of Lords chamber, Baroness Beeban Kidron, the Bafta-winning filmmaker and children's rights campaigner, remembers the lightbulb moment when she first understood the degree to which children were unprotected online.</p><p>\"It was 2012 and the smartphone had just hit a price point where a parent would give it to a child,\" she says. \"They were suddenly endemic, these mobile universes, and because they were mobile, they were beyond a parent's reach. I was making a documentary [InRealLife] about kids growing up in a connected world, and I was talking to people at the heart of tech. They all held on to that founder's vision - that technology is democratising, that there is no gatekeeper, that all users are equal. Then it clicked - if all users are treated equally then, de facto, you treat a kid as if they're an adult. In no other area of life do we do that.\"</p><p>Kidron went on to spend hundreds of hours watching the way children use the internet or, more pertinently, the way the internet uses children. \"I could see that all of the decisions the kids were being asked to make, all of the critical understanding it assumed they had, was based on the assumption that they were adults.\"</p><p>Data is 21st-century gold. The more data a company can gather, the more valuable it becomes. This is why we are followed around the internet by adverts for a shirt we once considered buying. It's why you can have a conversation about pizza and then find an offer for pizza in your inbox.</p><p>When I mention that I have a smart thermostat from Nest - a company that Google acquired in 2014 - Kidron takes a long, deep breath like a teacher about to explain trigonometry for the umpteenth time. \"If you click through everyone that Nest shares your data with, that's 1,000 sets of terms and conditions you've automatically agreed to, according to research by University of London,\" she says. \"If it does not worry you that your household details are being shared with at least 1,000 companies, then fine. But if you put 1,000 people in your house and asked them to stand silently watching what you and your family were doing, you might feel different.\"</p><p>Many of us, myself included, don't fully comprehend quite how much of this data gold we give away or the myriad ways it is used to profile us and then modify our spending habits, our behaviour, even the way we vote. We are scandalised when we hear about security breaches, but agree to our personal information, tastes, habits and - in the case of robot vacuum cleaners - floorplans being spread around the ether.</p><p>After an eye-opening hour with Kidron, I'm less ignorant and less happy. Thousands of very clever people are devoted to keeping us online for as long as possible. The more Big Tech knows about us, the more it can make us do what it wants. Children need protecting from this. So, perhaps, do adults - but that's for another time.</p><p>Three years after her epiphany, Kidron founded 5Rights, to fight for the established rights of children in the analogue world to be applied to the digital world. She is very much the architect of the Kids' Code.</p><p>\"We are not killjoys,\" she says. \"We're not against tech at all. What we're saying is, 'Give us a truly marvellous new world in which you have considered whether moving fast and breaking things means you're moving fast and breaking our kids.' \" Some in the tech lobby have claimed that regulation amounts to censorship - anathema to the core ethos of Silicon Valley. Kidron has no time for this. \"This is about data practice,\" she says. \"If a child seeks out certain things and they try really hard, they will always find it. The point is how you normatively treat them and how you uphold your own terms and conditions. There are strict rules in advertising, in medicine, in publishing. The digital world should be no different.\"</p><p>The children's commissioner, Anne Longfield, describes herself as \"the eyes and ears\" of children, sticking up for their rights. In the physical world, she tells me those rights are usually clear and understood, but it's different online. \"It's been so fast and so disorganised and, frankly, everyone has been overwhelmed by it,\" she says. \"What is clear with the free flow of content, the algorithms that encourage addictive tendencies and the business model as a whole is that they have not been designed with kids in mind.\"</p><p>She points out that children don't receive the same level of parental support online as they do in the analogue world \"because parents themselves haven't got that experience. They haven't grown up with the digital world, so they don't know as much. Children are at the forefront of this new world without protection or guidance.\"</p><p>In November 2017, Molly Russell, a 14-year-old schoolgirl, was found dead in her bedroom. Her father believes she \"We are not killjoys.</p><p>There are strict rules in advertising, medicine, publishing.</p><p>The digital world should be no different\" baronEss bEEban kIDron, chIlDrEn's rIghTs campaIgnEr \"The time for self-regulation - especially from large platforms - is over.</p><p>I am laser-focused on this\" ElIzabETh DEnham, InformaTIon commIssIonEr The 16 rules set out in the kids' code 1 The child's best interests should be the primary consideration in any services likely to be accessed by a child.</p><p>2 Age-appropriate standards must apply to all users.</p><p>Robust age-verification mechanisms must distinguish children from adults.</p><p>3 Privacy information and other terms must be in clear language suited to the age of the child.</p><p>4 Do not use children's personal data in ways that have been shown to be detrimental to their wellbeing.</p><p>5 Uphold your own published terms, policies and community standards.</p><p>6 Settings must be \"high privacy\" by default, unless you can demonstrate a compelling reason for a different setting.</p><p>7 Collect only the minimum amount of personal data you need to provide the service in which a child is actively and knowingly engaged.</p><p>8 Do not disclose children's data unless you can demonstrate a compelling reason to do so.</p><p>9 Switch geolocation options offby default and provide an obvious sign for children when location tracking is active.</p><p>10 If you provide parental controls, give the child ageappropriate information about this, and provide an obvious sign when they are being monitored.</p><p>11 Switch options that allow profiling offby default.

Earlier this year, Ian Russell told BBC News that Instagram \"helped kill my daughter\". Since then, at least 30 families have contacted the suicide prevention charity Papyrus to say they believe social media was a factor in the deaths of their children.</p><p>In January, Longfield wrote an open letter to the biggest social media companies urging them to take \"a moment to reflect\" on the schoolgirl's tragic death. \"The potential disruption to all user experiences should no longer be a brake on making the safety and wellbeing of young people a top priority,\" she wrote.</p><p>Today Longfield says the imagery on self-harm and suicide were \"pushed to [Molly] by the algorithm. It understood what she asked to see and sent more of it and it became more <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.extreme.No\">www.extreme.No</url> one else was understanding or assessing the impact that this might have on a vulnerable person.\"</p><p>Longfield herself searched for the hashtag #selfharm and was, as she puts it, \"horrified not only by the volume, but by the explicit nature of what I saw. Tech is not the cause, but it is the accelerant. Kids already have the pressure of growing up. Now they have the pressure of constant communication.\"</p><p>In a recent exercise, the Children's Commission translated the terms and conditions of five of the biggest tech companies into plain English, cutting an average 5,500-word document down to one side of A4, and then took them into schools. \"It didn't stop the children going online, but it did make them think about it differently,\" Longfield says. \"They were more careful with what they wrote and what decisions they made.\"</p><p>When the Kids' Code arrives, this level of clarity will become mandatory.</p><p>In a straw poll at our school gate, precisely 100% of parents were hugely in favour of the code. Best interests of the child? Finally. Default settings to high privacy? Of <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.course.No\">www.course.No</url> profiling? \"Can we sign up for this, too?\" And this is the whole point. Most parents are worried about technology, but are relatively powerless to police it. With a lot of discussion and some argument, I managed to keep my eldest offInstagram until he was 13. Even though Instagram is for over-12s only, most of his friends already had an account, some for several years. It is a war of attrition, us versus those clever people in Silicon Valley, and it is unwinnable.</p><p>In the past, I've blamed other parents.</p><p>Why let an eight-year-old on social media? But, as Kidron points out, blaming parents is a go-to dodge of Big Tech. How a child exists in the digital world is down to parents, they say. Except, in reality, it's not as easy as that. To monitor at all times is exhausting. Why not make the digital world more child-friendly in the first place? As minister for digital and the creative industries, it is part of Margot James's brief to, as she puts it, \"foster an environment where innovation thrives\". \"This is,\" she says, \"particularly important for small and growing businesses. Otherwise you'll just concentrate more and more power in the hands of the very big companies. And we will all be the losers for that.\"</p><p>She is, however, another advocate for regulation. \"It's important that we listen to those who are opposed, but no longer will they be able to make decisions with scant regard to the unintended harms that have arisen from the very liberal environment that tech has enjoyed to date. Until now, the needs of children have been an afterthought and only in response to a big outcry.</p><p>\"I don't have children myself,\" she says, \"but I do have two great-nieces who are under the age of 12 and so I see it first-hand, the worries and concerns that parents have in this area as children get to the age when they need to be using the internet for all the benefits it offers. Parents are extremely worried, and with good reason.\"</p><p>James was \"persuaded in the space of one meeting\" that what Kidron was doing was important.</p><p>Responses from children's charities, teachers and parent organisations are resoundingly in favour of the draft code, as are some tech firms. Facebook's response has been \u2026 lukewarm. It claims the code risks \"dumbing down controls for young people who are often highly capable in using digital services\". It invokes the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in arguing against \"barriers\" to a child's freedom of expression. Google \"agrees with the ambitions of the code\", but wants to \"maintain a degree of flexibility\". If, for example, geolocation data is restricted, how is a child going to find the quickest route to school? \"The time for self-regulation - especially from large platforms - is over,\" Denham says. \"People want a more responsible and more human-focused way forward. We didn't expect the big tech companies to like it, but that's no reason to put it in the too-hard pile. I am laser-focused on this and it's not just because I have a young granddaughter who loves playing on her tablet. I want to leave this area of regulation in a better place so that we can truly protect the agency of our kids online.\"</p><p>Kidron is also laser-focused. She tells me the tech sector is now conscious that doing nothing is no longer an option, \"but I have been told by numerous sources that they are quietly lobbying to water down the code. This is a moment where they could stand up and make some of the pronouncements they've made recently a reality for children.\"</p><p>\"It will happen,\" Denham concludes.</p><p>And when it does, I suspect, it will seem crazy that it didn't happen sooner. Almost as crazy as having cars without brakes n Have your say The initial consultation on the Kids' Code has now closed, but the Information Commission still wants to hear from parents (and their children).

Nike's CEO Mark Parker\u2014after addressing all employees at a rare company-wide meeting last week\u2014is promising more changes - NYTimes[3] Mr. Buffett's well on his way to sketching out a Warren-less future for Berkshire Hathaway, as alluded to at this weekend's annual Buffettapalooza[4] - WSJ[5] Wells Fargo will pay $480 million to end a consolidated securities class action in California federal court involving allegations of 'fraud and insider trading by the bank's top brass over its yearslong illegal creation of up to 3.5 million unauthorized accounts' - Law360[6] Everyone agreed.

While his exit has been in the works for some time, a report out yesterday detailing new sexual harassment allegations against him likely influenced the timing of his departure - NYTimes[1] and WSJ[2] and Bloomberg[3] Alibaba's Jack Ma is taking a more graceful (if equally sudden) leave from Alibaba, the $420 billion internet company that he co-founded. CEO Daniel Zhang will assume the chairperson's seat after a year's transition period - NYTimes[4] and WSJ[5] and Bloomberg[6] The Upshot takes to the Delorean to consider whether we're living in an economic[7] throwback to the mid-90s\u2014the 'strongest period of growth and prosperity in recent decades.' </p><p>There are, to be sure, more than a few parallels - NYTimes[8] We're not even in GDPR territory, but Google's appeal this week before the EU's top court will do much to decide the limits of nations' legal authority over the internet across country lines. At issue is a lower court order that extended the EU's 'right to be forgotten' to Google's search engines across the globe - WSJ[9] Here's something to keep an eye on in coming years\u2014the Times profiles Lina Khan, the 29-year-old antitrust prodigy who has her academic sights set on Amazon and the rest of Big Tech - NYTimes[10] Your Daily Dose financial term of the week: 'countercyclical capital buffer'\u2014a regulatory tool that central banks developed after the 2008 financial crisis that require large banks to 'sock away additional capital during good times so they have more to fall back on when loans go bad during bad times' [which the Fed is considering putting in play now while times are good] - WSJ[11] A roundup of last Friday's solid jobs report - Marketplace[12] Citigroup picked an unfortunate time[13] to come up with 'a relatively safe method of trading in crypto' with its digital asset receipts, or DARs - Bloomberg[14] The Journal gives us this interesting look on what, exactly, happened to risk taking in the years after the last financial crisis - WSJ[15] The SEC has accused former Teva Pharmaceutical chair Phillip Frost (and a handful of others) of masterminding a pump-and-dump scheme that generated more than $27 million for those involved - WSJ[16] and Law360[17] The busy agency also halted trading in two crypto-linked securities (Bitcoin Tracker One and Ether Tracker One) over the weekend 'citing investor confusion regarding the assets' - Bloomberg[18] and MarketWatch[19] It was an eventful[20] women's final at the U.S. Open this weekend, but in the end, we were treated to a display of class from Serena that matched Naomi's prowess on the court - MarketWatch[21] [ 1]: <url

He told them to picture it stocked with their data broken up into categories like finances, location, relationships and hobbies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That is you,\" Mr. Mundt said. \"And I promise you this wall knows you better than your wife.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Few listened to Mr. Mundt when, a few years ago, he began raising alarms about the data collected by the tech giants. While online services like Facebook and Google did not charge a dime, people paid a high price by giving the companies so many personal details, he argued. And the people had no choice, because the companies had no real competitors.</p><p>But in February, his agency ruled that Facebook had broken the country's law, and demanded that the company stop automatically sharing data among the services it owns, like Instagram and WhatsApp, or websites that use its \"like\" and \"share\" buttons. It was the first such ruling in Europe, putting in practice ideas that had never fully escaped academic and think-tank debates.</p><p>As American regulators and lawmakers intensify their scrutiny of Big Tech, there is a lot of discussion about whether or how they could accuse the companies of violating antitrust law. Often, regulators look to whether a company is causing consumer harm - a standard that can be hard to prove when a service is free.</p><p>The response from Mr. Mundt is simple. The only way to take on Facebook and some of its peers is to attack what they value most: data.</p><p>He argues that the companies are so dominant in their core businesses that consumers, if they want to search the internet or be on social media, have no choice but to share their personal data. The data then strengthens the tech companies' position over rivals even more - and therefore is anticompetitive, Mr. Mundt says.</p><p>The companies have strongly fought against his argument. But it is gaining traction in antitrust circles, as Mr. Mundt, who has led Germany's antitrust agency for almost a decade, urges officials in other nations to make the same point.</p><p>After the Facebook ruling, Mr. Mundt received calls from regulators and lawyers around the world to discuss the idea. He helped organize a meeting of fellow antitrust officials in Colombia, where they spent four days discussing tech regulation. Joseph Simons, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department antitrust division, were among those attending.</p><p>\"The German authority is way out in front here and in a real sense the leading antitrust authority in the world with respect to these technology issues,\" said Thomas Vinje, partner at the Clifford Chance law firm in Brussels and a veteran of tech industry antitrust battles involving Microsoft and Google.</p><p>Other regulators are looking to build on Germany's approach. The European Commission is in the early stages of an investigation into Facebook, including its use of data, said a person familiar with the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>Online platforms constantly collect data on users: what is clicked on, how fast a person scrolls past a post, what video a person stops to watch. The information helps a company like Facebook infer characteristics about interests, personal connections and financial demographics to better target advertising, or train machine-learning algorithms that can be used for future products.</p><p>It is an extraordinarily lucrative business model. Facebook made $55 billion from advertising last year, while Google's ad sales totaled $116 billion.</p><p>What's distressing to regulators is the lack of new competitors, a trend Mr. Mundt attributes to a company's access to data and plentiful financial resources. He says Facebook controls more than 95 percent of the social networking market in Germany. Without competition, the social network unfairly forces people to make an all-or-nothing choice between agreeing to unlimited data collection or not using Facebook at all.</p><p>When investigating Facebook, German regulators built a map of the information the company collects. It looked similar to the one Mr. Mundt described during his recent speech - a web of personal information that branched into details about homeownership, life events, politics and buying behavior.</p><p>Mr. Mundt contends that Facebook and other tech giants don't need to be broken up, as Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have suggested. Instead, he thinks governments should limit their ability to collect data. The approach can have an effect similar to a breakup by isolating a company's different services.</p><p>\"The business model is to gather and process data, full stop. There is nothing else,\" Mr. Mundt said in an interview. \"If they don't have data, they can have 10,000 very intelligent engineers who tell you what you can make out of data, but without the data you don't make anything.\"</p><p>Germany is at the forefront of a deeper realization among regulators and policymakers globally that laws must evolve to keep pace with technological change. Rules that regulate industries like oil or transportation, where dominance is measured in physical goods and price gouging, don't as easily apply to services that are digital, are often free and rely on people's attention and data more than infrastructure.</p><p>Europe has regularly used antitrust law to take on the tech industry. The European Commission has punished Amazon, Apple, Google and Qualcomm in recent years for unfair competition. And more actions are expected in the years ahead. An investigation into Amazon's use of data was started last year. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's top antitrust regulator, has said data must play a more central role in assessing market dominance in the digital economy, particularly when reviewing acquisitions by tech companies.</p><p>\"Antitrust law will become irrelevant in the digital marketplace if it doesn't adopt to understanding the power of data in analyzing market power and dominance,\" said Gene Kimmelman, the former chief counsel of the Justice Department antitrust division who is now the president of Public Knowledge, a public interest advocacy group that favors stronger oversight of tech platforms.</p><p>Critics say Germany's aggressive approach stretches the limits of antitrust law and won't stand up to court reviews. Mr. Mundt's focus on data is seen by some as overly simplistic and, if adopted widely, will make it harder to offer free services. Because data is shared widely among different businesses and industries, critics say, the attempts to limit its flow will cause unintended consequences and disruptions.</p><p>\"European regulators are using competition policy to pursue objectives that are unrelated to competition,\" said Eline Chivot, a senior policy analyst in Brussels for the Center for Data Innovation, a group funded by a Washington think tank whose board includes representatives from Amazon, Apple and Microsoft. \"It introduces uncertainty.\"</p><p>Facebook is appealing the German decision, arguing that it was transparent with users about how data is collected. The social network argues that its use of data helps improve the service and that German regulators singled it out for practices common across the internet.</p><p>Even those who support Germany's broader goals question whether its approach will be effective. The February ruling allows Facebook to continue sharing data between Instagram and WhatsApp if it gets users to click a new permission box. Many wonder how effective the ruling will be because most people will sign off without much thought.</p><p>\"It might be that you'll end up in the same place you started,\" said Jason Furman, a senior economic adviser in the Obama administration.</p><p>Mr. Furman, a Harvard professor advising the British government on tech regulation, said that rather than relying on antitrust law alone, countries should create a dedicated regulator for the tech industry, to match those covering the banking, health and transportation sectors of the economy. He said a watchdog with expertise in the field could better review a company's behavior and use of data on a case-by-case basis. He said new laws requiring companies to make some of their data available to rivals also could seed competition.</p><p>In the United States, where antitrust law has a narrower scope than in Europe, experts say Germany's approach won't work because it relies on privacy and consumer protection rules that don't exist in America. But lawmakers and federal regulators in Washington are studying new ways to account for data in regulating the digital economy.</p><p>Mr. Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department antitrust division, said in a speech last month that lack of competition may be leading to weaker online privacy protections. \"Diminished quality is also a type of harm to competition,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Mundt says Germany's approach is not a final answer, but he hopes it inspires bolder action by regulators, who he says must push legal boundaries just as the companies have done.</p><p>\"We need innovative cases,\" he said. \"What we have done with Facebook can't be found in a textbook.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006590019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHK-GR71-DYR7-C4V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0006QHC</classCode><className>CLIFFORD CHANCE LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Do you fill in a name and phone number and be done with it'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It matters, because it could reveal more about you than you suspect. If you go beyond the required fields and also fill in an address, job title, email and birthday, it means you're more likely to be organised or a perfectionist, explains alternative credit scoring firm LenddoEFL.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And what do you think your smartphone calendar might reveal about you? Say, if you have a habit of scheduling activities? Do your events point to you being a social animal, or a workaholic'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All this information - including location data, social media activity, the kinds of mobile apps downloaded, and browsing history - helps determine how likely a person is to repay their debt. Alternative credit scoring for those who lack a credit history is just one example of how even the most innocuous habits of yours are being gathered and analysed to glean insights.</p><p>So you are urged to give that data up. Singapore-based LenddoEFL - one of the pioneer startups in the credit scoring space - analyses up to 12,000 variables using its machine learning algorithms to generate a credit score in less than three minutes, according to information on its website. In the past four years, it has assessed five million users across more than 15 countries.</p><p>As the world becomes increasingly digitised, companies are amassing large amounts of data and increasingly reliant on it to fuel their businesses. The phrase often uttered is \"data is the new oil\", thought to be coined in 2006 by British mathematician Clive Humby.</p><p>E-commerce firms rely on data to streamline operations by analysing transactions and shopping behaviour. Healthtech firms are only able to provide personalised care by collecting sensitive information on patients. And with each patient treated, each delivery order fulfilled, and each customer satisfied, many companies grow and refine their machine learning models with the reams of data recorded.</p><p>And as the data economy grows, so have discussions around privacy. The issues are problematic for all businesses dealing with data (and who doesn't') but for startups, they are especially hazardous. Many tech-driven startups, young companies still in the process of scaling up their business, use data to the same extent, or more, as big corporates. But are the safeguards in place'</p><p>While LenddoEFL has an ambitious goal of achieving financial inclusion for 1 billion people (and profiting off it), it is worth questioning how it collects and handles data.</p><p>In October 2018, advocacy group Privacy International published an article highlighting its concerns about the data Lenddo collects through Facebook.</p><p>For instance, it can analyse the history of interactions between the user and their social media connections - being wished \"happy birthday\" on Facebook on the same day every year, by people with whom the user has a close relationship, indicates a high chance that the date of birth provided is real.</p><p>This would mean that during the user verification process, Lenddo also collects information on people who have a relationship with that user but might not have consented to their data being collected by Lenddo, argued Privacy International, citing further evidence that supports their concern. The group had sent queries to LenddoEFL about the extent to which they gather and analyse data on people who were not their customers. As of Jan 21, 2019, Privacy International had not received a response. When The Business Times contacted LenddoEFL, management declined to comment.</p><p>Now you see me</p><p>The importance of data in keeping businesses humming today has also raised questions on whether consumers understand how valuable it actually is. A quick way to get a sense of it? The next time you encounter a website pop-up relating to Internet cookies, instead of automatically clicking \"Accept\" or ignoring it, try clicking on \"Learn more\" to view its potentially long list of third party platforms it shares data with.</p><p>US politicians have proposed a bill requiring companies to tell consumers how they make money off their data and how much it is worth. \"The overall lack of transparency and disclosure in this market have made it impossible for users to know what they're giving up,\" Virginia Senator Mark Warner said in a statement last June.</p><p>On the flip side, author and tech entrepreneur Antonio Garcia Martinez dismissed thinking of data in the same way that one regards oil, or suggesting that people should receive \"dividends\" when companies use their data (as California's governor Gavin Newsom has done). This shows a misunderstanding of how Internet giants like Google operate, said the former Facebook employee in a WIRED article.</p><p>One thing's for sure - whether companies like it or not, consumers are becoming more sensitive to the implications of granting access to their data. Singapore-based technology and data lawyer Charmian Aw says bad actors who have access to that data can cause impactful damage.</p><p>\"To top it off, data which is personal to an individual that is misused could cause all kinds of harm to that individual, which could be very significant and often irreparable,\" says Ms Aw, a lawyer at Reed Smith.</p><p>Lim Chong Kin, Drew &amp; Napier's head of telecommunications, media and technology, says individuals who have their personal data compromised could be at risk of fraud and identity theft. They may also suffer psychological or emotional harm, loss of business or employment opportunities, or damage to their reputation or relationships.</p><p>Insufficient focus on data privacy - the control of how personal data is used - imperils not just individuals but the startups themselves.</p><p>Prof Mohan Kankanhalli, director of the NUS Centre for Research in Privacy Technologies (N-CRiPT), points out that startups are often constrained by limited financial resources and engineering expertise. With growth and revenue among a startup's key performance metrics, one might argue that data privacy is not exactly high on its list of priorities.</p><p>Startups also have to be nimble and might - to use tech-speak - \"pivot\" to a new business model quickly, says Prof Kankanhalli. What they may not realise is that under Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) 2012, they can only use collected data for the purposes that its users have consented to; if there is now a new purpose for the data, consent has to be sought again.</p><p>In an age where data is mined by a horde of companies out there, individuals should more actively exercise their right to withdraw consent at any time, he notes.</p><p>In the book 99 Privacy Breaches to Beware Of, authors Kevin Shepherdson (CEO of Singapore-based data privacy software and consulting firm Straits Interactive), William Hioe and Lynn Boxall discuss how lax data privacy practices could throw a wrench into a startup's plans.</p><p>In their consultancy work, the authors came across a startup subscription business operating in Europe and Asia that had built up a healthy revenue stream. The founder was about to sell the business, when discussions ground to a halt.</p><p>As it turned out, the startup had not satisfied data privacy and protection requirements when signing up customers, forcing the founder to start on a lengthy and costly process to fix the issues and make the business saleable.</p><p>With powerful tech in their hands, some startups play fast and loose with \"the creepy line\" - a term made famous in 2010 by ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt.</p><p>\"The Google policy on a lot of things is to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it,\" he had said, implying that the company would not do anything considered too insidious.</p><p>But this creepy line shifts. Only a number of years ago, it would have been disturbing to think of companies being able to monitor our every move and word, or that we would be the ones enabling it (\"Alexa, play Despacito\"). Last week, The New York Times ran a story about a secretive facial recognition startup called Clearview AI, whose powerful technology has helped US law enforcement solve shoplifting, credit card fraud and murder cases.</p><p>For a month, the company dodged interview requests from the Times. But when the journalist requested police officers to run her photo through the Clearview app, the officers soon got phone calls from company representatives asking if they were talking to the media - \"a sign that Clearview has the ability and, in this case, the appetite to monitor whom law enforcement is searching for\".</p><p>Where is the creepy line drawn now'</p><p>Competitive edge</p><p>In a sign of how important data privacy has become, some startups tout it as an edge, trumping peers that flail under its burden.</p><p>One of South-east Asia's most valuable marketing tech startups, Near, draws data from the mobile apps people use and overlaps it with location data to understand consumer behaviour. It processes information from over 1.6 billion monthly users across 44 countries. One of its clients, gym chain Virgin Active, boosted walk-ins by 82 per cent after Near served targeted mobile ads to specific audiences in the vicinity of the gyms.</p><p>Near co-founder and chief revenue officer Shobhit Shukla says the company only shares aggregated analytics information with customers and partners. Additional steps it takes to ensure the data's privacy, security and authenticity include stripping the data of any personal identifiers (known as \"anonymising\") and hashing it.</p><p>Near is also in the process of getting all their app partners, regardless of region, to follow the European Union's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) standard by explicitly stating, in its terms and conditions, that it works with third-party platform Near, and the purpose for which their data is collected with consent.</p><p>The more granular the data gets, the more the startup needs to look at privacy and security, Mr Shukla says. \"We view privacy as a competitive advantage.\"</p><p>It's an attractive proposition for both consumers and businesses. Public companies in the US that mishandled data saw an average stock price fall of 5 per cent immediately after disclosing the data breach, while 31 per cent of consumers axed their relationship with the company to move towards more trusted organisations, according to a 2017 Ponemon Institute study.</p><p>Singapore-based credit scoring startup CredoLab is another firm hoping to edge out competitors by paying keen attention to privacy. It uses smartphone metadata to score users. Using metadata means that, for instance, information about a digital image - its size, resolution, or date of creation - can be assessed without seeing the image itself.</p><p>CEO Peter Barcak says the company has signed up 62 lenders across 19 countries, with major markets being Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. More than US$1 billion worth of loans have been disbursed in the past two years based on the startup's credit scoring technology.</p><p>The largely untapped opportunity of providing credit to the unbanked and underbanked has led to the proliferation of alternative credit scoring startups like CredoLab and Lenddo. Within the current regulatory environment, credit scoring startups operating in Singapore are not subject to any regulation pertaining specifically to their credit reporting business activities, though they can be within the purview of the PDPA.</p><p>But when a new regulatory framework called the Credit Bureau Act 2016 comes into force, alternative credit scoring startups must apply for a licence to continue their credit reporting business.</p><p>The act specifies that they must, among other things, safeguard the confidentiality, security and integrity of credit information. The act will also apply to startups that carry out credit reporting for profit or gain, even if it is not part of their core business. No definite date has been given for when the act will come into force.</p><p>That said, Drew &amp; Napier's Mr Lim believes data privacy goes beyond complying with regulations. \"Ultimately, startups should not see data protection as a mere compliance exercise but rather, recognise how good data practices and policies can contribute to, and even create, business value.\"</p><p>Some companies take it even further - they focus on data privacy itself as their \"product\".</p><p>Australia's Data Republic, which is backed by Singapore Airlines and Singtel Innov8 (the telco's venture arm), allows companies to securely manage data-sharing projects online.</p><p>When a company shares data with another, it usually disappears into the data centre of the other firm. The first company cannot see who touches the data or who has access to it, explains Raju Bhupatiraju, the general manager and head of sales for Asia-Pacific.</p><p>One of Data Republic's products, called the Senate Platform, puts the data in a secure common workspace with governance controls. It also ensures that data is exchanged without personally identifiable information, and allows parties to negotiate licence terms and kickstart projects in weeks instead of months.</p><p>\"Imagine the data economy of Singapore becomes so good that you have jobs created, you have new streams created for the company, and the consumer can benefit from hyper personalisation,\" says Mr Bhupatiraju.</p><p>The startup started operating in Singapore 14 months ago and is now projecting a five to ten times growth in revenue from Singapore operations in 2020. It is also working on a tool that would allow companies and individuals to manage consent.</p><p>Others in the data privacy space include New York-based OzoneAI, whose vision is one where users have the power to sell anonymised, granular data directly to advertising firms, and London-based Privitar, which helps enterprises stay compliant with data regulations.</p><p>But what about startups that eventually fail? What happens to all the data they have collected'</p><p>\"The PDPA continues to apply to a failed startup, including the retention limitation obligation which requires an organisation to cease to retain personal data if there is no legal or business purpose for doing so,\" says Ms Aw.</p><p>Safety first</p><p>As much as companies should lay down rules for how they collect and use data, the first line of defence to preserving privacy is ensuring good security, Prof Terence Sim writes in an N-CRiPT blog post. \"If security is lax, you can forget about privacy. The bad guys hack in and help themselves to all your data and you're doomed,\" says the research centre's principal investigator.</p><p>Out of 80 per cent of 90 organisations that breached the PDPA's protection obligation between 2016 and August 2019, 85 per cent were due to negligence while the rest were due to cyber attacks. The findings were uncovered by the Data Protection Excellence (DPEX) Centre, Straits Interactive's autonomous research and education arm.</p><p>The lack of data protection policies and failure to obtain consent of individuals were the other two most common PDPC obligations breached.</p><p>\"Based on our security assessment experience, those startups whose founders have never dealt with cybersecurity pay little or no attention to cyber risks at all,\" says Ilya Sachkov, CEO and founder of Group-IB, a Singapore-based cybersecurity company.</p><p>The group's senior threat intelligence analyst Feixiang He highlights that many startups adopt innovative and disruptive processes, whose unproven nature could increase their systematic cyber risks.</p><p>\"Startups also have high growth and turnover rate of human talent. It may introduce insider threats to the companies, unless cybersecurity is taken seriously from day one. Insider threat refers to cases where internal employees leak data to external parties.\"</p><p>Mr Sachkov recommends startups appoint experts with an extensive cybersecurity background to their advisory board. When on a tight budget, bug bounty programs can be used to find and fix security vulnerabilities, he says.</p><p>Fashion e-commerce firm Zilingo employs a team of \"white hat hackers\" - also known as ethical hackers - every three to six months to uncover vulnerabilities in the company's systems. The company's chief technology officer Dhruv Kapoor says that of the over 100 employees at Zilingo, about a tenth looks either exclusively or partially at security.</p><p>It's in the culture as well, he says. \"Our company culture requires us to think about privacy and security from the very start, when there is a new product idea or the start of a business plan.\"</p><p>For instance, Zilingo recently launched a service that would allow merchants to check on the progress of an order placed at a factory - but not before working with partners to create a framework where factories' data is securely shared in a way that does not compromise privacy.</p><p>Anonymity and machine learning</p><p>Tech bosses can probably sleep better at night thinking that current methods of ensuring data privacy are somewhat foolproof, but emerging threats tell us otherwise.</p><p>Take, for instance, the widespread belief that anonymising data can help protect the data owner's privacy. It doesn't, says Reza Shokri, a researcher at N-CRiPT who specialises in data privacy and trustworthy machine learning.</p><p>A skilled attacker who has external information about individuals can combine that information with the anonymised data to reconstruct the whole data set, he explains. This is made even more possible if the attacker has access to data from the many apps people use every day.</p><p>The truth is, startups - and Big Tech firms - exist in a world where bad actors are becoming more sophisticated. For example, depending on how a machine learning model was constructed, it is possible for an adversary to \"reverse engineer\" the model and uncover the underlying data on which it was based.</p><p>Prof Shokri, together with his colleague Prof Daniel Seng from the National University of Singapore's Faculty of Law, recently worked on a paper that looked at different types of machine learning algorithms and whether they comply with the GDPR and other privacy regulations. They found that the machine learning models were not built and trained in a way that preserves privacy.</p><p>\"So if you give access to the machine learning model, we argue that you are essentially giving the whole data away. The privacy risk is equivalent,\" he says.</p><p>N-CRiPT has been studying techniques in differential privacy, a response to privacy attacks, which has been used by organisations such as the US Census Bureau. Instead of directly sharing raw or anonymised data, an organisation can construct a quantitative model that captures the characteristics of the original data. It can then sample some records from that model, and release those sample records to a business partner.</p><p>But the model has to be constructed in a way that does not reveal sensitive information, such as injecting \"noise\" into the model so that it conceals specific individual details, but won't destroy high level statistics.</p><p>The centre has also been looking into ways to scientifically quantify the value of data to an organisation, which could have applications in insurance and risk management.</p><p>Prof Shokri hopes to highlight that data privacy is a science. \"One lesson we can learn is that not everything that is intuitive can effectively provide protection,\" he says.</p><p>\"Privacy needs to be protected by design...the whole chain of computations done on your data needs to be carefully designed so that they preserve the privacy of data. And this is the difficult part. This is what privacy experts work on, which is designing privacy mechanisms with mathematical rigour.\"</p><p>READ MORE: The asymmetry of 'open banking'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Your data, my business: Why data privacy issues are especially hazardous for startups.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-279700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y28-9BR1-JCF2-818C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3244\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 25, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Firms are sending pleading emails asking us to opt in so that business can continue as usual. But it may be for nothing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Previously, we had regulations that everyone assumed they could get away with breaking</p><p>\"It's all rubbish,\" says <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/edwardslilianprof/\">Lilian Edwards</url> at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, UK. Many of these companies already have your consent from when you signed up in the first place, she says. There's nothing in the new regulations that says they have to ask for it again.</p><p>Flooding your inbox was never the goal of the GDPR. Rather, it is meant to be the EU's attempt at reinforcing human rights for the digital age, especially when it comes to abuses of personal data. Rather than introducing new rights, it is shoring up existing ones. The UK has had good data protection principles in place since 1995, says Edwards. Now they have teeth.</p><p>For example, organisations will now need to show that they have obeyed the law at each stage of the data collection and processing pipeline. \"It makes data protection a bit more than a box-ticking exercise,\" says Edwards. \"Previously, we had regulations that everyone assumed they could get away with breaking.\"</p><p>No longer. Among the most talked-about aspects of the GDPR are the large fines that national data protection agencies, like the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), will be able to impose on miscreant businesses. For serious violations, companies can be hit with a penalty of up to \u20ac20 million or 4 per cent of their global turnover, which should hurt even the biggest tech firms.</p><p>Don't reach for the popcorn just yet, however. \"Nothing will happen on 25 May,\" says Edwards, as we don't know how bodies like the ICO will enforce the new rules.</p><p>Policing information</p><p>\"How much of a difference GDPR makes depends on several unknowns, including the willingness of data protection agencies to use fines and how they are funded,\" says <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reubenbinns.com/\">Reuben Binns</url> at the University of Oxford. He points out that the ICO has never imposed its current maximum fine, and that such restraint is likely to continue.</p><p>As for funding, data protection agencies have little to work with \u2013 the ICO's budget is tiny compared with what the legal departments of big tech firms enjoy, says <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/steapp/people/veale\">Michael Veale</url> at University College London. Partly this is a hangover from when these agencies were set up, before the explosion of the internet. \"Now the same agency has to police the information society,\" says Edwards. Brexit could make its work more complex (see \u201cThe Brexit factor\u201d).</p><p>Just how far companies can go before getting slapped with a fine could take years to settle, while courts determine interpretations of the rules. Legal proceedings will drag several thorny issues out into the light, and ultimately, the tech giants could be forced to give up some of their worst habits.</p><p>Facebook is one company that could come face scrutiny. Under the GDPR, firms will not be allowed to coerce us into handing over personal data. This means they cannot make access to a service \u2013 like a social media network \u2013 contingent on the user giving up data that is not essential to the running of that service.</p><p>That might bar Facebook from turning away people who do not want to receive targeted ads based on their posts. However, Facebook could argue that this is an \"essential\" part of their service.</p><p>Another potential flashpoint is data portability. The GDPR says that you should be able to take your data from one organisation and give it to another \u2013 for example, by downloading your Facebook data and uploading it to another social network. But expect fierce fighting over what counts as your data and what counts as Facebook's. Does your web of social connections belong to you, or the social network?</p><p>It's unclear how such stand-offs will be resolved. In extreme cases, data protection agencies will have the power to stop companies processing data, effectively switching off their operations in the EU. \"They could tell Apple to turn off Siri or Facebook to stop targeting ads at people,\" says Veale. \"It's unlikely, but possible.\"</p><p>If such things happen, one result of the new rules could be a growing digital divide between the US and Europe. For some firms, the costs of complying with the regulations are simply too high: they are shuttering their EU operations. So far, the ones doing this are involved in selling niche services that few EU residents will miss, though a handful of online video games are also closing shop to EU players. The EU is also saying goodbye to the controversial service Unroll.me, which automatically unsubscribes users from unwanted mailing lists while also selling marketing data gleaned from those users.</p><p>The European Union could tell Apple to turn off Siri or Facebook to stop targeting ads at people</p><p>There does not seem to be any way to square the EU's new approach to data with the activities of businesses that profit from harvesting and selling data to third parties. That is arguably a good thing. Unfortunately, given that this is how a lot of companies operate online, many are looking for ways to avoid being covered by the new rules.</p><p>In response to this, some enterprising start-ups are offering web tools that simply detect EU visitors and block them. The thinking is that if nobody from the EU can use your service, the new rules surely don't apply.</p><p>Much hype and hand-wringing has accompanied the GDPR. Now that it is here, will it have been worth it? The frustrating answer is that we won't know for a while yet.</p><p>\"We'll see a lot of court cases,\" says Veale. \"Historically, data protection has not been litigated very much. This is going to change.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article appeared in print under the headline \"Your data, safe at last?\"</emphasis></p><p>The brexit factor</p><p>The European Union's new data regulations (see main story) will apply to the UK in the run-up to Brexit, but what happens afterwards? Although UK data protection laws are unlikely to alter as a result of leaving the EU, the way the two exchange data may change.The EU has always made <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23531451-900-eu-plan-to-erase-digital-borders-will-further-isolate-brexit-uk/\">data-sharing</url> deals with outside countries, based on whether their domestic data protection laws were deemed \"adequate\". After Edward Snowden revealed the global scale of the US National Security Agency's online snooping, the EU       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28294-eu-ruling-means-facebook-and-google-cant-send-data-to-the-us/\">demanded a renegotiation</url>.The UK will have to make similar arrangements with both the EU and the US post-Brexit. But the EU is not likely to judge the UK kindly. Thanks to a law called the Investigatory Powers Act, the UK government runs one of the most intrusive digital surveillance schemes in the world. It also wants yet more powers. The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2017-19/dataprotection.html\">Data Protection Bill</url>, which Parliament passed this week, aims to exempt immigration matters from data protection rules, for example.This means the UK may find that life is tougher on the outside than in. \"What few people realise is that when you're actually in the EU, you've got more liberty to disobey EU law because you're assumed to be compliant,\" says Lilian Edwards at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, UK. \"Once you leave, they will actually check.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSCI-mg23831794700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSCI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SD4-K201-JBPJ-72FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158275</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1289\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 New Scientist Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Scientist</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17543\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 0262 4079</issn><volume>Vol. 238</volume><issueNumber>No. 3179</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 23, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Eating a delicious bacon sandwich means clearing the mental hurdle of dirty slaughterhouses, battery farming and dehydrated pigs transported great distances in crammed trucks. So if we manage that, why would we balk at the idea of lab-grown meat, made without killing a single animal? After all a lab burger, the journalist Chase Purdy argues, is made from the same basic stuff as the real thing: animal muscle cells. With a few tweaks - added fat cells, \"scaffolding\" to imitate the stringy texture of meat - the taste and feel can be indistinguishable. And there are huge potential benefits. The meat industry slaughters billions of animals every year and causes 14 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Cultured meat could mean an end to food poisoning too: the salmonella and E. coli that breed in filthy abattoirs don't stand a chance in a sterile lab. Then there is the fact that climate change is threatening global food production. Labgrown meat could make up the difference. So where's the problem? Following various \"meat technology\" start-ups as they beaver away in the lab and race to get their products on plates, Purdy identifies three main obstacles.</p><p>One is psychological. Offered some labgrown p\u00e2t\u00e9, Purdy can only think: \"Cells!\" It tastes right, though, and he has a second helping. The name is key; the start-ups try different labels, such as \"in vitro meat\", \"cultured meat\", \"cell-based meat\", before eventually settling on \"clean meat\", in a bid to appeal to customers. Yet that inflames an existing war with the meat industry, which understandably dislikes the implication its product is dirty. Neither does \"clean meat\" always translate well. In Dutch, a clean-meat activist says, it implies the food has been run through detergent.</p><p>Then there are some of the more enthusiastic \"clean meat\" activists. One, Koert van Mensvoort, has written a theoretical cookbook that features a recipe for \"roast raptor\", \"knitted\" meat and see-through sashimi. Among the most off-putting recipes is meat you can grow on your own skin. One grim illustration shows whiskysoaked meat cubes labelled with photos of pop icons, including Kanye West or Miley Cyrus. In this scenario the cubes have been grown from their stem cells.</p><p>Those creepy concoctions aside, soothing fears will require providing the public with more information. For instance, meat start-ups are secretive about what exactly is in their \"vat fluid\" in which the growing mass of cells float. This once consisted of serum drawn from foetal cows, which was vastly expensive (and unethical). Now it is plant-based - but without a recipe, customers may be hard to reassure.</p><p>Should customers \"get past the whole thought of it all\", as Purdy's sceptical aunt puts it, there is the second big obstacle: price. The first lab-grown burger, produced in 2013, was estimated to have cost $330,000; 1lb of that beef would be $1.2 billion. But the price is falling. In 2019 an Israel-based company said it had got in vitro beef down to $100 a pound. By 2022, it claims, the price will be $10 a pound.</p><p>A third barrier, Purdy says, is the \"difficult regulatory environment\" influenced by the traditional meat industry. Meat lobbyists have their own name for the vat-grown product - \"fake meat\" - and have petitioned to narrow the definition of \"meat\" to exclude it. Yet history is on the side of the outsiders. Furious lobbying by the butter industry in the late 19th century could not stop the march of margarine (even though it was restricted in 24 US states and in five had to be dyed pink). Egg companies lost their battle to squash eggless mayonnaise. Attempts by the dairy industry to stop plant-based milks using the word \"milk\" on packaging have failed.</p><p>Purdy spends rather too long on the minutiae of the various regulatory battles, but the rest of the book bounces along, helped by accounts of his encounters with the food tech business. Purdy's character sketch of Josh Tetrick - lab meat's own Steve Jobs - is a particular treat. Purdy admires him, but Tetrick's employees do not always agree. \"Lying, manipulative, thin-skinned, attention-seeking, reactionary, incompetent,\" was one description of his management style.</p><p>Purdy leaves the reader clear about what will happen next. Clean meat is coming; it cannot be stopped because there is \"too much money, science and willpower pushing it into the market\". Indeed, some meat companies are switching sides and investing in their diminutive rivals, and rebranding as \"protein companies\". In Israel, where limited land and water to grow food are extra incentives, the technology is shooting ahead. One company, Aleph Farms, is growing meat with a vascular system - ready, it claims, in 2023. That shouldn't surprise those who have been paying attention. In 1932 Churchill wrote \"fifty years hence, we shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium\".

I check my phone, look up, and notice it's already here. A white Ford Fusion, its roof bedazzled with futuristic-looking sensors, is idling nearby. Two people sit up front-one monitoring a computer, the other behind the wheel-but the car is in control. I hop in, press a button on a touch screen, and sit back as the selfdriving Uber takes me for a ride.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we zip out onto the road toward downtown, the car stays neatly in its lane, threading deftly between an oncoming car and parked trucks that stick out into the street. I've been in a self-driving car before, but it's still eerie to watch from the back seat as the steering wheel and pedals move themselves in response to events unfolding on the road around us.</p><p/><p>To date, most automated vehicles have been tested on highways in places like California, Nevada, and Texas. Pittsburgh, in contrast, features crooked roads, countless bridges, confusing intersections, and more than its fair share of snow, sleet, and rain. As one Uber executive said, if self-driving cars can handle Pittsburgh, then they should work anywhere. As if to test this theory, as we turn onto a bustling market street, two pedestrians dart onto the road ahead. The car comes to a gentle stop some distance from them, waiting and then continuing on its way.</p><p/><p>A screen in front of the back seat shows the car's peculiar view of the world: our surroundings rendered in vivid colors and jagged edges. The picture is the product of some of an amazing array of instruments arranged all over the vehicle. There are no fewer than seven lasers, including a large spinning lidar unit on the roof; 20 cameras; a high-precision GPS; and a handful of ultrasound sensors. On the screen inside the car, the road looks aqua blue, buildings and other vehicles are red, yellow, and green, and nearby pedestrians are highlighted with what look like little lassos. The screen also indicates how the vehicle is steering and braking, and there's a button that'll ask the car to stop the ride any time you want. This being 2016, Uber has even made it possible for riders to take a selfie from the back seat. Shortly after my ride is over, I receive by e-mail a looping GIF that shows the car's view of the world and my face grinning in the top-right corner. People on the sidewalk stop and wave while we wait at a traffic light, and a guy driving a pickup behind us keeps giving the thumbs-up.</p><p/><p>My ride is part of the highest-profile test of self-driving vehicles to date, after Uber began letting handpicked customers book rides around Pittsburgh in a fleet of automated taxis. The company, which has already upended the taxi industry with a smartphone app that lets you summon a car, aims to make a significant portion of its fleet self-driving within a matter of years. It's a bold bet that the technology is ready to transform the way millions of people get around. But in some ways, it is a bet that Uber has to make. In the first half of this year it lost a staggering $1.27 billion, mostly because of payments to drivers. Autonomous cars offer \"a great opportunity for Uber,\" says David Keith, an assistant professor at MIT who studies innovation in the automotive industry, \"but there's also a threat that someone else beats them to market.\"</p><p/><p>Most carmakers, notably Tesla Motors, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and General Motors, and even a few big tech companies including Google and (reportedly) Apple, are testing self-driving vehicles. Tesla cars drive themselves under many circumstances (although the company warns drivers to use the system only on highways and asks them to pay attention and keep their hands on the steering wheel). But despite its formidable competition, Uber might have the best opportunity to commercialize the technology quickly. Unlike Ford or GM, it can limit automation to the routes it thinks driverless cars can handle at first. And in contrast to Google or Apple, it already has a vast network of taxis that it can make gradually more automated over time.</p><p/><p>Uber's executives have little trouble imagining the upside. With no drivers to split revenues with, Uber could turn a profit. Robot taxis could become so cheap and easy to use that it would make little sense for anyone to actually own a car. Taken to its logical conclusion, automated driving could reprogram transportation itself. Uber is already experimenting with food delivery in some cities, and it recently bought Otto, a startup that is developing automated systems for long-haul trucks. Self-driving trucks and vans could ferry goods from fulfillment centers and stores to homes and offices with dizzying speed and efficiency. Shortly before my test ride Andrew Lewandowski, head of Uber's autonomous operations, a veteran of Google's self-driving program, and one of the cofounders of Otto, said: \"I really believe that this is the most important thing computers are going to do in the next 10 years.\"</p><p/><p>Uber is moving quickly. The company created its Advanced Technology Center, where it's developing its driverless cars, in February 2015 by hiring a number of researchers from the robotics department at nearby Carnegie Mellon University. Using that expertise, Uber developed its self-driving taxis in a little over a year-roughly the amount of time it takes most automakers to redesign an entertainment console.</p><p/><p>But is it moving too quickly? Is the technology ready?</p><p/><p>Robo ancestors</p><p/><p>For the rest of my time in Pittsburgh, I get around using Ubers controlled exclusively by humans. The contrast is stark. I want to visit CMU's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC)-part of its Robotics Institute, one of the pioneering research groups involved in developing selfdriving vehicles-to see what its experts think of Uber's experiment. So I catch a ride with a guy named Brian, who drives a beat-up Hyundai Sonata. Brian says he's seen several automated Ubers around town, but he can't imagine a ride in them being as good as one with him. Brian then takes a wrong turn and gets completely lost. To be fair, though, he weaves through traffic just as well as a self-driving car. Also, when the map on his phone leads us to a bridge that's closed for repairs, he simply asks a couple of road workers for directions and then improvises a new route. He's friendly, too, offering to waive the fare and buy me a beer to make up for the inconvenience. It makes you realize that automated Ubers will offer a very different experience. Fewer wrong turns and overbearing drivers, yes, but also no one to help put your suitcase in the trunk or return a lost iPhone.</p><p/><p>I take a rain check on the beer, say good-bye to Brian, and arrive at NREC's vast warehouse about 20 minutes late. The building is filled with fascinating robotic prototypes. And if you look carefully, you'll find some ancestors of today's automated vehicles. Just inside the entrance, for instance, is Terregator, a six-wheeled robot about the size of a refrigerator, with a ring of sensors on top. In 1984, Terregator was among the first robots designed to roam outside of a lab, rolling around CMU's campus at a few miles per hour. And Terregator was succeeded, in 1986, by a heavily modified van called NavLab, one of the first fully computercontrolled vehicles on the road. Just outside the front door to NREC sits another notable forerunner: a customized Chevy Tahoe filled with computers and decorated with what looks suspiciously like an early version of the sensor stack on top of one of Uber's self-driving cars. In 2007 this robot, called Boss, won an urban driving contest organized by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. It was a big moment for automated vehicles, proving that they could navigate ordinary traffic, and just a few years later Google was testing self-driving cars on real roads.</p><p/><p>The three of these CMU robots show how gradual the progress toward selfdriving vehicles was until recently. The hardware and software improved, but the system struggled to make sense of the world a driver sees, in all its rich complexity and weirdness. At NREC, I meet William \"Red\" Whittaker, a CMU professor who led the development of Terregator, the first version of NavLab, and Boss. Whittaker says Uber's new service doesn't mean the technology is perfected. \"Of course it isn't solved,\" he says. \"The kinds of things that aren't solved are the edge cases.\"</p><p/><p>And there are plenty of edge cases to contend with, including sensors being blinded or impaired by bad weather, bright sunlight, or obstructions. Then there are the inevitable software and hardware failures. But more important, the edge cases involve dealing with the unknown. You can't program a car for every imaginable situation, so at some stage, you have to trust that it will cope with just about anything that's thrown at it, using whatever intelligence it has. And it's hard to be confident about that, especially when even the smallest misunderstanding, like mistaking a paper bag for a large rock, could lead a car to do something unnecessarily dangerous.</p><p/><p>Progress has undoubtedly picked up in recent years. In particular, advances in computer vision and machine learning have made it possible for automated vehicles to do more with video footage. If you feed enough examples into one of these systems, it can do more than spot an obstacle-it can identify it with impressive accuracy as a pedestrian, a cyclist, or an errant goose.</p><p/><p>Still, the edge cases matter. The director of NREC is Herman Herman, a roboticist who grew up in Indonesia, studied at CMU, and has developed automated vehicles for defense, mining, and agriculture. He believes self-driving cars will arrive, but he raises a few practical concerns about Uber's plan. \"When your Web browser or your computer crashes, it's annoying but it's not a big deal,\" he says. \"If you have six lanes of highway, there is an autonomous car driving in the middle, and the car decides to make a left turn- well, you can imagine what happens next. It just takes one erroneous command to the steering wheel.\"</p><p/><p>Another problem Herman foresees is scaling the technology up. It's all very well having a few driverless cars on the road, but what about dozens, or hundreds? The laser scanners found on Uber's cars might interfere with one another, he says, and if those vehicles were connected to the cloud, that would require an insane amount of bandwidth. Even something as simple as dirt on a sensor could pose a problem, he says. \"The most serious issue of all-and this is a growing area of research for us-is how you verify, how you test an autonomous system to make sure they're safe,\" says Herman.</p><p/><p>Learning to drive</p><p/><p>For a more hands-on perspective, I head across town to talk to people actually developing self-driving cars. I visit Raj Rajkumar, a member of CMU's robotics faculty who runs a lab funded by GM. In the fast-moving world of research into driverless cars, which is often dominated by people in Silicon Valley, Rajkumar might seem a bit old school. Wearing a gray suit, he greets me at his office and then leads me to a basement garage where he's been working on a prototype Cadillac. The car contains numerous sensors, similar to the ones found on Uber's cars, but they are all miniaturized and hidden away so that it looks completely normal. Rajkumar is proud of his progress on making driverless cars practical, but he warns me that Uber's taxis might be raising hopes unreasonably high. \"It's going to take a long time before you can take the driver out of the equation,\" he says. \"I think people should mute their expectations.\"</p><p/><p>Besides the reliability of a car's software, Rajkumar worries that a driverless vehicle could be hacked. \"We know about the terror attack in Nice, where the terrorist driver was mowing down hundreds of people. Imagine there's no driver in the vehicle,\" he says. Uber says it takes this issue seriously; it recently added two prominent experts on automotive computer security to its team. Rajkumar also warns that fundamental progress is needed to get computers to interpret the real world more intelligently. \"We as humans understand the situation,\" he says. \"We are cognitive, sentient beings. We comprehend, we reason, and we take action. When you have automated vehicles, they are just programmed to do certain things for certain scenarios.\"</p><p/><p>In other words, the colorful picture I saw in the back of my automated Uber represents a simplistic and alien way of understanding the world. It shows where objects are, sometimes with centimeter precision, but there's no understanding what those things really are or what they might do. This is more important than it might sound. An obvious example is how people react when they see a toy sitting in the road and conclude that a child might not be far away. \"The additional trickiness is that Uber makes most of its money in urban and suburban locations,\" Rajkumar says. \"That's where unexpected situations tend to arrive more often.\"</p><p/><p>What's more, anything that goes wrong with Uber's experimental taxi service could have ramifications for the entire industry. The first fatal crash involving an automated driving system, when a Tesla in Autopilot mode failed to spot a large truck on a Florida highway this spring, has already raised safety questions. Hastily deploying any technology-even one meant to make the roads safer-might easily trigger a backlash. \"While Uber has done a great job of promoting this as a breakthrough, it's still quite a way away, realistically,\" says MIT's Keith. \"Novel technologies depend on positive word of mouth to build consumer acceptance, but the opposite can happen as well. If there are terrible car crashes attributed to this technology, and regulators crack down, then certainly that would moderate people's enthusiasm.\"</p><p/><p>I get to experience the reality of the technology's limits firsthand, about halfway through my ride in Uber's car, shortly after I'm invited to sit in the driver's seat. I push a button to activate the automated driving system, and I'm told I can disengage it at any time by moving the steering wheel, touching a pedal, or hitting another big red button. The car seems to be driving perfectly, just as before, but I can't help noticing how nervous the engineer next to me now is. And then, as we're sitting in traffic on a bridge, with cars approaching in the other direction, the car begins slowly turning the steering wheel to the left and edging out into the oncoming lane. \"Grab the wheel,\" the engineer shouts.</p><p/><p>Maybe it's a bug, or perhaps the car's sensors are confused by the wide-open spaces on either side of the bridge. Whatever the case, I quickly do as he says. ?</p><p>\"We are cognitive, sentient beings. We comprehend, we reason, and we take action.

I check my phone, look up, and notice it's already here. A white Ford Fusion, its roof bedazzled with futuristic-looking sensors, is idling nearby. Two people sit up front-one monitoring a computer, the other behind the wheel-but the car is in control. I hop in, press a button on a touch screen, and sit back as the selfdriving Uber takes me for a ride.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we zip out onto the road toward downtown, the car stays neatly in its lane, threading deftly between an oncoming car and parked trucks that stick out into the street. I've been in a self-driving car before, but it's still eerie to watch from the back seat as the steering wheel and pedals move themselves in response to events unfolding on the road around us.</p><p/><p>To date, most automated vehicles have been tested on highways in places like California, Nevada, and Texas. Pittsburgh, in contrast, features crooked roads, countless bridges, confusing intersections, and more than its fair share of snow, sleet, and rain. As one Uber executive said, if self-driving cars can handle Pittsburgh, then they should work anywhere. As if to test this theory, as we turn onto a bustling market street, two pedestrians dart onto the road ahead. The car comes to a gentle stop some distance from them, waiting and then continuing on its way.</p><p/><p>A screen in front of the back seat shows the car's peculiar view of the world: our surroundings rendered in vivid colors and jagged edges. The picture is the product of some of an amazing array of instruments arranged all over the vehicle. There are no fewer than seven lasers, including a large spinning lidar unit on the roof; 20 cameras; a high-precision GPS; and a handful of ultrasound sensors. On the screen inside the car, the road looks aqua blue, buildings and other vehicles are red, yellow, and green, and nearby pedestrians are highlighted with what look like little lassos. The screen also indicates how the vehicle is steering and braking, and there's a button that'll ask the car to stop the ride any time you want. This being 2016, Uber has even made it possible for riders to take a selfie from the back seat. Shortly after my ride is over, I receive by e-mail a looping GIF that shows the car's view of the world and my face grinning in the top-right corner. People on the sidewalk stop and wave while we wait at a traffic light, and a guy driving a pickup behind us keeps giving the thumbs-up.</p><p/><p>My ride is part of the highest-profile test of self-driving vehicles to date, after Uber began letting handpicked customers book rides around Pittsburgh in a fleet of automated taxis. The company, which has already upended the taxi industry with a smartphone app that lets you summon a car, aims to make a significant portion of its fleet self-driving within a matter of years. It's a bold bet that the technology is ready to transform the way millions of people get around. But in some ways, it is a bet that Uber has to make. In the first half of this year it lost a staggering $1.27 billion, mostly because of payments to drivers. Autonomous cars offer \"a great opportunity for Uber,\" says David Keith, an assistant professor at MIT who studies innovation in the automotive industry, \"but there's also a threat that someone else beats them to market.\"</p><p/><p>Most carmakers, notably Tesla Motors, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and General Motors, and even a few big tech companies including Google and (reportedly) Apple, are testing self-driving vehicles. Tesla cars drive themselves under many circumstances (although the company warns drivers to use the system only on highways and asks them to pay attention and keep their hands on the steering wheel). But despite its formidable competition, Uber might have the best opportunity to commercialize the technology quickly. Unlike Ford or GM, it can limit automation to the routes it thinks driverless cars can handle at first. And in contrast to Google or Apple, it already has a vast network of taxis that it can make gradually more automated over time.</p><p/><p>Uber's executives have little trouble imagining the upside. With no drivers to split revenues with, Uber could turn a profit. Robot taxis could become so cheap and easy to use that it would make little sense for anyone to actually own a car. Taken to its logical conclusion, automated driving could reprogram transportation itself. Uber is already experimenting with food delivery in some cities, and it recently bought Otto, a startup that is developing automated systems for long-haul trucks. Self-driving trucks and vans could ferry goods from fulfillment centers and stores to homes and offices with dizzying speed and efficiency. Shortly before my test ride Andrew Lewandowski, head of Uber's autonomous operations, a veteran of Google's self-driving program, and one of the cofounders of Otto, said: \"I really believe that this is the most important thing computers are going to do in the next 10 years.\"</p><p/><p>Uber is moving quickly. The company created its Advanced Technology Center, where it's developing its driverless cars, in February 2015 by hiring a number of researchers from the robotics department at nearby Carnegie Mellon University. Using that expertise, Uber developed its self-driving taxis in a little over a year-roughly the amount of time it takes most automakers to redesign an entertainment console.</p><p/><p>But is it moving too quickly? Is the technology ready?</p><p/><p>Robo ancestors</p><p/><p>For the rest of my time in Pittsburgh, I get around using Ubers controlled exclusively by humans. The contrast is stark. I want to visit CMU's National Robotics Engineering Center (NREC)-part of its Robotics Institute, one of the pioneering research groups involved in developing selfdriving vehicles-to see what its experts think of Uber's experiment. So I catch a ride with a guy named Brian, who drives a beat-up Hyundai Sonata. Brian says he's seen several automated Ubers around town, but he can't imagine a ride in them being as good as one with him. Brian then takes a wrong turn and gets completely lost. To be fair, though, he weaves through traffic just as well as a self-driving car. Also, when the map on his phone leads us to a bridge that's closed for repairs, he simply asks a couple of road workers for directions and then improvises a new route. He's friendly, too, offering to waive the fare and buy me a beer to make up for the inconvenience. It makes you realize that automated Ubers will offer a very different experience. Fewer wrong turns and overbearing drivers, yes, but also no one to help put your suitcase in the trunk or return a lost iPhone.</p><p/><p>I take a rain check on the beer, say good-bye to Brian, and arrive at NREC's vast warehouse about 20 minutes late. The building is filled with fascinating robotic prototypes. And if you look carefully, you'll find some ancestors of today's automated vehicles. Just inside the entrance, for instance, is Terregator, a six-wheeled robot about the size of a refrigerator, with a ring of sensors on top. In 1984, Terregator was among the first robots designed to roam outside of a lab, rolling around CMU's campus at a few miles per hour. And Terregator was succeeded, in 1986, by a heavily modified van called NavLab, one of the first fully computercontrolled vehicles on the road. Just outside the front door to NREC sits another notable forerunner: a customized Chevy Tahoe filled with computers and decorated with what looks suspiciously like an early version of the sensor stack on top of one of Uber's self-driving cars. In 2007 this robot, called Boss, won an urban driving contest organized by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. It was a big moment for automated vehicles, proving that they could navigate ordinary traffic, and just a few years later Google was testing self-driving cars on real roads.</p><p/><p>The three of these CMU robots show how gradual the progress toward selfdriving vehicles was until recently. The hardware and software improved, but the system struggled to make sense of the world a driver sees, in all its rich complexity and weirdness. At NREC, I meet William \"Red\" Whittaker, a CMU professor who led the development of Terregator, the first version of NavLab, and Boss. Whittaker says Uber's new service doesn't mean the technology is perfected. \"Of course it isn't solved,\" he says. \"The kinds of things that aren't solved are the edge cases.\"</p><p/><p>And there are plenty of edge cases to contend with, including sensors being blinded or impaired by bad weather, bright sunlight, or obstructions. Then there are the inevitable software and hardware failures. But more important, the edge cases involve dealing with the unknown. You can't program a car for every imaginable situation, so at some stage, you have to trust that it will cope with just about anything that's thrown at it, using whatever intelligence it has. And it's hard to be confident about that, especially when even the smallest misunderstanding, like mistaking a paper bag for a large rock, could lead a car to do something unnecessarily dangerous.</p><p/><p>Progress has undoubtedly picked up in recent years. In particular, advances in computer vision and machine learning have made it possible for automated vehicles to do more with video footage. If you feed enough examples into one of these systems, it can do more than spot an obstacle-it can identify it with impressive accuracy as a pedestrian, a cyclist, or an errant goose.</p><p/><p>Still, the edge cases matter. The director of NREC is Herman Herman, a roboticist who grew up in Indonesia, studied at CMU, and has developed automated vehicles for defense, mining, and agriculture. He believes self-driving cars will arrive, but he raises a few practical concerns about Uber's plan. \"When your Web browser or your computer crashes, it's annoying but it's not a big deal,\" he says. \"If you have six lanes of highway, there is an autonomous car driving in the middle, and the car decides to make a left turn- well, you can imagine what happens next. It just takes one erroneous command to the steering wheel.\"</p><p/><p>Another problem Herman foresees is scaling the technology up. It's all very well having a few driverless cars on the road, but what about dozens, or hundreds? The laser scanners found on Uber's cars might interfere with one another, he says, and if those vehicles were connected to the cloud, that would require an insane amount of bandwidth. Even something as simple as dirt on a sensor could pose a problem, he says. \"The most serious issue of all-and this is a growing area of research for us-is how you verify, how you test an autonomous system to make sure they're safe,\" says Herman.</p><p/><p>Learning to drive</p><p/><p>For a more hands-on perspective, I head across town to talk to people actually developing self-driving cars. I visit Raj Rajkumar, a member of CMU's robotics faculty who runs a lab funded by GM. In the fast-moving world of research into driverless cars, which is often dominated by people in Silicon Valley, Rajkumar might seem a bit old school. Wearing a gray suit, he greets me at his office and then leads me to a basement garage where he's been working on a prototype Cadillac. The car contains numerous sensors, similar to the ones found on Uber's cars, but they are all miniaturized and hidden away so that it looks completely normal. Rajkumar is proud of his progress on making driverless cars practical, but he warns me that Uber's taxis might be raising hopes unreasonably high. \"It's going to take a long time before you can take the driver out of the equation,\" he says. \"I think people should mute their expectations.\"</p><p/><p>Besides the reliability of a car's software, Rajkumar worries that a driverless vehicle could be hacked. \"We know about the terror attack in Nice, where the terrorist driver was mowing down hundreds of people. Imagine there's no driver in the vehicle,\" he says. Uber says it takes this issue seriously; it recently added two prominent experts on automotive computer security to its team. Rajkumar also warns that fundamental progress is needed to get computers to interpret the real world more intelligently. \"We as humans understand the situation,\" he says. \"We are cognitive, sentient beings. We comprehend, we reason, and we take action. When you have automated vehicles, they are just programmed to do certain things for certain scenarios.\"</p><p/><p>In other words, the colorful picture I saw in the back of my automated Uber represents a simplistic and alien way of understanding the world. It shows where objects are, sometimes with centimeter precision, but there's no understanding what those things really are or what they might do. This is more important than it might sound. An obvious example is how people react when they see a toy sitting in the road and conclude that a child might not be far away. \"The additional trickiness is that Uber makes most of its money in urban and suburban locations,\" Rajkumar says. \"That's where unexpected situations tend to arrive more often.\"</p><p/><p>What's more, anything that goes wrong with Uber's experimental taxi service could have ramifications for the entire industry. The first fatal crash involving an automated driving system, when a Tesla in Autopilot mode failed to spot a large truck on a Florida highway this spring, has already raised safety questions. Hastily deploying any technology-even one meant to make the roads safer-might easily trigger a backlash. \"While Uber has done a great job of promoting this as a breakthrough, it's still quite a way away, realistically,\" says MIT's Keith. \"Novel technologies depend on positive word of mouth to build consumer acceptance, but the opposite can happen as well. If there are terrible car crashes attributed to this technology, and regulators crack down, then certainly that would moderate people's enthusiasm.\"</p><p/><p>I get to experience the reality of the technology's limits firsthand, about halfway through my ride in Uber's car, shortly after I'm invited to sit in the driver's seat. I push a button to activate the automated driving system, and I'm told I can disengage it at any time by moving the steering wheel, touching a pedal, or hitting another big red button. The car seems to be driving perfectly, just as before, but I can't help noticing how nervous the engineer next to me now is. And then, as we're sitting in traffic on a bridge, with cars approaching in the other direction, the car begins slowly turning the steering wheel to the left and edging out into the oncoming lane. \"Grab the wheel,\" the engineer shouts.</p><p/><p>Maybe it's a bug, or perhaps the car's sensors are confused by the wide-open spaces on either side of the bridge. Whatever the case, I quickly do as he says. ?</p><p>\"We are cognitive, sentient beings. We comprehend, we reason, and we take action.

Wall Street analyst Charles Ortel has shared his vision on the future of the new stablecoin discussing which can be trusted more: Big Tech or Big Banks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook's announcement of its own\u00a0digital coin, Libra,\u00a0managed through a Calibra electronic wallet and founding of the Libra Association, a consortium of 28 members that will govern the new crypto-currency, has made a big splash prompting polarised opinions about the initiative.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u200bRep. Maxine Waters\u00a0(D-Calif.), the chair of the US House Financial Services Committee, argued that the US should not allow Facebook's digital money to \"compete with the dollar\" while another Democratic lawmaker, Sen. Sherrod Brown, warned that the tech titan has already become \"too powerful\".</p><p>\u200bFor his part, Stephen Moore, Donald Trump's previous Federal Reserve board pick and fellow at the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, opined that Libra is \"a good thing\" because it \"represents a new challenge for central bankers that they now have competition from private currencies\".</p><p>Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst and investigative journalist, has weighed up the pros and cons of the new digital currency and explained why Facebook's Libra is unlikely to dethrone the dollar.</p><p>Sputnik: While some finance experts are praising Facebook's initiative to ease money transactions between users around the globe, others are warning: \"Do not trust Libra!\" What are the major pros and cons of Facebook's new crypto-currency?</p><p>Charles Ortel:\u00a0If you distrust the financial system, you might be inclined to welcome Facebook's Libra, that is, until you think carefully about just how trustworthy Facebook and any team of Facebook executives might be competing against the financial system, effectively outside the purview of empowered regulators.</p><p>Having watched Facebook for years, I certainly\u00a0do not trust Facebookand I use it minimally. Like Google, and like Twitter, Facebook lets you adopt various services, mostly for free but fails to explain just how valuable your participation as a user is to the executives and owners of these technology giants.</p><p>The business model that these firms use rightly should be regulated \u2013 before users continue (or start) using the platform, each one should be told, in simple and readily understood terms, how Facebook or Google or Twitter is likely to monetise the information supplied and created by each user.</p><p>Since its inception, Facebook has evolved into a public company that presently is\u00a0worth about $500 billion.\u00a0Its principal revenue stream is from advertising \u2013 as its user base adds more and more information, Facebook is able to gain increasing visibility into the habits of its already massive swarm of adherents. If Libra does become adopted and accepted, Facebook will know even more about its user base.</p><p>It boils down to trust \u2013 and I trust Facebook even less than I trust big players in the financial system.</p><p>Sputnik: What's behind Facebook's decision to kick off a crypto-currency project? What immediate benefits will the Silicon Valley tech giant and its partners gain? Whom will Facebook and Co. be accountable to?</p><p>Charles Ortel:\u00a0On paper, and until now, promoters of alternative \"currencies\" have garnered massive investment returns.\u00a0 In part, this is because the largest nations on earth have behaved irresponsibly since 31 December 2008 (especially) spending trillions more than they receive in tax revenues while inflating asset bubbles by suppressing key, reference interest rates.</p><p>Meanwhile, as governments tighten regulation of the financial system (in theory and in practice), criminals and rule-benders need to find a home for the stock and flow of\u00a0\"dirty\" money\u00a0that does exist and migrate across borders each nano-second of each day.</p><p>Running a global payments operation where you decide who gets to participate and where you get to enforce one-sided rules can sound appealing and likely generates defensible sets of projections that could turn the billionaires of Facebook into trillionaires.</p><p>Before Facebook and we get too far into financial dreamland, US regulators (Congress, the Senate, the Treasury Department, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others) need to think clearly and deeply about the pros and cons of letting Facebook promote Libra.</p><p>I rarely agree with US Representative Maxine Waters but I support her cautionary approach on Facebook and on Libra.</p><p>Sputnik: Libra's creators say that their currency will be backed by the so-called \"Libra Reserve\" to prevent volatility. Given the number of users, Facebook and its partners (including Visa, eBay, Uber, and others) have it appears that the Libra reserve would be comparable to that of a large financial institution. However, Facebook pledges not to develop its own monetary policy. What impact could the Libra and its giant reserve have on the global economy? What if Facebook decides to change the rules of the global financial game?</p><p>Charles Ortel:\u00a0Opaque technology giants, and the people who own meaningful positions in them, have much to gain or lose in elections, particularly in nations with large user bases, or in nations, like Ireland, that have, for now, lenient corporation tax regimes.</p><p>To date,\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg\u00a0and others who operate user-based platforms have failed to protect user data, in some cases egregiously, while displaying disdain, even contempt for regulators and critics.</p><p>Clearly, Facebook structures its operations one-sidedly and has done so for years. So, perhaps executives there are confident they can get their user base hooked into Libra faster than regulators can act to stop the roll-out.</p><p>Perhaps Facebook is confident their technology wizards can outwit all hackers and scoundrels who will concentrate upon harvesting Libra for illicit purposes. I am less sure of that and believe only sovereign governments have resources and threats (prison or worse) to run, or to try to run, a widely-used global system of exchange fairly.</p><p>\u200bRather than allowing Facebook (or any non-government actor) to create rivals for currencies and financial instruments, the existing government system needs\u00a0to reduce the mountain of debt\u00a0created since 2008, while also offering savers and investors safe opportunities to earn \"real\" (after-inflation) rates of return.</p><p>Sputnik: A meme has surfaced on the internet mocking a Facebook ban this time imposed on a Libra user. It says: \"You're blocked from your electronic wallet for 30 days\" because \"you purchased something that goes against our community standards\". Could this joke turn into reality? Could the project end up with Big Tech having tougher control over its users?</p><p>Charles Ortel:\u00a0Absolutely - this is a massive concern. Many believed that rapid advances in technology might encourage competition. Instead, in finance, and with modern global giants, the first mover now has commanding market positions that no national regulator can seemingly constrain.</p><p>\u200bUser-based platforms that harvest trillions in monetary value might fairly be treated as \"utilities\". Like suppliers of electricity or of energy, they should, perhaps, be regulated so that their investors earn a reasonable return on the capital they have deployed to create their systems.</p><p>Beyond that step, likely not one that will make\u00a0Silicon Valley titans\u00a0happy, Facebook and other real and quasi-utilities should not have unchecked power to turn off a user's access to service (and electronic history) because executives or managers find the views of a user clash with \"politically correct\" orthodoxy, or with the views of a political party or faction.</p><p>When it comes to payment systems and currencies, I see little chance that \"In Facebook We Trust\" will become \"a thing\", dethroning the US dollar or any other currency issued by a responsible government or central bank.</p><p>Sputnik</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-148220353</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGF-V961-JDJN-610S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1320\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Yerepouni Daily News.

Bigger ads. Every time I load up an app from Slate or the New York Times, I'm always bummed about the quality of the commercial messages. A typical in-app ad consists of a tiny graphic and some text. Some days I don't even notice they're there. I use the Epicurious recipe app several times a week, but I honestly can't remember if it carries any ads. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I've long been hoping that someone would address this obvious flaw. Wouldn't it be great if marketers could insert huge, full-screen spots inside our favorite mobile apps? Even better, what if there were ads that required me to type in my name, play a game, answer some trivia questions about laundry detergents, or otherwise interact with the marketer's pitch before I could go on to use the app? </p><p>On Thursday, Apple made my wildest dreams come true. At a press event introducing the iPhone's new operating system, <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>unveiled iAd, a system that will allow app developers to insert ads that \"combine the emotion of TV ads with the interactivity of Web ads.\" Jobs showed off a few examples of spots we'll soon start seeing in iPhone apps: One Nike ad took over the screen with a video. A Target ad asked users to design a dorm room with furniture from the store. A spot for Toy Story 3 lets you play a movie-themed game. When it places one of these ads in an app, Apple will get 40 percent of the revenue from the ad; the developer takes 60 percent.</p><p>Jobs says that iAds will fix what he considers the main problem with today's mobile ads-people don't like to click on them because the ads usually load up the Web browser, taking you out of the app you're using. Apple's iAds don't take users out of their favorite apps. Instead, iAds place the full-screen ad inside the app; when you're done \"interacting\" with the ad, you can go back to the app. To recap: Apple has solved the problem of users finding today's small ads too annoying to click on by making it easier for developers to create bigger, more-interactive ads that we'll likely have no choice but to click on.</p><p>I know I sound bitter about iAds, and I know I shouldn't be. I shouldn't even be surprised-the mobile advertising marketplace has been heating up for a year, and it was only a matter of time before big tech companies got into this game. Last year Apple and Google fought to acquire AdMob, which helps developers place ads inside their apps. Apple bid $600 million for the firm, but Google swooped in with a $750 million winning offer. Apple retaliated by buying Quattro, an AdMob rival, for $300 million. The Federal Trade Commission has expressed concerns about the Google-AdMob deal; it would give Google-the Web's largest advertising company-a huge share of the mobile advertising market. In an odd way, then, Apple's iAds announcement is both a worry and a boon for Google. On the one hand, Apple has just become a huge rival-now developers can buy ads through Apple rather than Google's AdMob. But Apple's entry also proves the market for mobile ads is highly competitive, increasing the likelihood that regulators will approve the AdMob deal.</p><p>For iPhone users, then, Apple's iAds announcement means only one thing: Because it sets up intense competition between Google and Apple to attract advertisers, we're likely to see many more annoying ads on our phones. There's an argument that this is good for us; a better marketplace for ads will bring more revenue to app developers and thus will lead to better-and cheaper-apps for us all. Perhaps that'll happen. But as we've seen on the Web, advertisers aren't always good at balancing visibility with usability. Many sites are clogged with annoying ads, which explains why ad-blocking software is so popular. Ad blocking isn't going to be available in our apps, and with the media industries so hard up for new revenue-and with so few of us expressing any willingness to pay for content ourselves-I doubt that newspaper and magazine companies are going to be able to resist stuffing their apps with ads. It's a bright future for advertisers.</p><p>While I understand the financial reasoning behind iAds, the move is still galling. Apple's move into the ad game highlights the many hypocrisies surrounding the locked-down App Store. In February, Apple banned \"sexy\" apps from the iPhone, including most apps that feature scantily clad women. The company said it did so in response to complaints from customers who considered the apps \"degrading and objectionable.\" This seemed an odd justification at the time-Apple didn't kick out the Playboy or Sports Illustrated swimsuit apps, reasoning that they were from \"well-known companies\" and thus, apparently, less objectionable. But the iAds announcement further weakens Apple's claims that it's wary of customer complaints. iPhone users are bound to cry foul when they see their favorite apps launch \"interactive\" ads. How will Apple respond to those complaints? I'm betting we won't see apps blocked because they feature too many annoying ads.</p><p>I know I'm not breaking any news in suggesting that Apple sees every iPhone user as a never-ending stream of revenue. Apple doesn't just make money when it sells you a phone; it gets a cut of your cell contract, apps, music, books, and now even the ads inside the apps. At the same time, it is continuing to lock down app development; as part of a new developer agreement released Thursday, the company prohibited developers from using third-party programming tools to create apps, including Adobe's Flash and Novell's MonoTouch. Apple's rationale is obvious. iPhone customers are a captive, spendy bunch, and the company wants to make sure that all those billions go in its coffers and not to Google, Adobe, or anyone else.</p><p>I don't begrudge Apple any of this. If customers keep flocking to the iPhone despite bigger ads and ever more severe App Store restrictions, Apple has every right to profit. What bothers me is Apple pretending that iAds are a boon to customers-as if annoying ads, just like multitasking or threaded e-mail messages, are a feature we'd all been waiting for. <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>has figured out another way to make gazillions from the iPhone at the expense of his customers. Good for him. I just wish he wouldn't look so happy about it.</p><p>Become a fan of Slate\u00a0and\u00a0Farhad Manjoo\u00a0on Facebook.

We\u2019re spooked when the same set of advertisements tailgate us, yet become furious when our iPhones have no clue where we are when we search for a restaurant (Hello, I am NOT in Fort Wayne). We loathe that our data is mined and scraped, yet still we opt for Googleover DuckDuckGo (never mind that Googleis tracking our moves like an assassin); still we use Facebook (never mind that it harvests our personal information like so many internal organs); and we click \u201cI agree\u201d when downloading our apps, knowing full well that those apps are talking to other apps, telling them how much we eat and what music we listen to and when we ovulate.</p><p>Plus: Has it made one whit of difference that we\u2019re now alerted to the use of cookies on websites, thanks to that recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/technology/europe-gdpr-privacy.html\">rule issued by the European Union</url>? Speaking for myself, I would say it has not. Those alerts make me feel worse, because they reveal my impatience, my recklessness, my everyday failures of self-regulation. I seem to be forever surrendering my privacy in exchange for some short-term gain, rather than dutifully slogging through the decision tree of the cookie opt-out.</p><p>So the question becomes: Why do I \u2014 why do many of us \u2014 consistently act in ways that are directly at loggerheads with the privacy values we profess to hold dear? What explains this phenomenon, which experts have taken to calling \u201cthe privacy paradox\u201d?</p><p>In an attempt at reconciliation \u2014 and expiation and clarification \u2014 I made lots of phone calls and did lots of reading on the topic in recent weeks, much of it online. By the end, I was Google-stalked almost exclusively by ads about privacy-related books and podcasts: I was that deep in a house of meta-horrors. Here, perhaps, was my most liberating discovery: Our conflicting impulses are actually quite rational. As Alessandro Acquisti, a professor of information technology at Carnegie Mellon, points out, sometimes each of the contradictory beliefs in a paradox is perfectly well founded.</p><p>Let\u2019s consider, just as an example, why we are forever skating past the internet\u2019s fine print. In 2008 \u2014 2008! before Instagram, before Uber, before WhatsApp! \u2014 two of Acquisti\u2019s colleagues at Carnegie Mellon calculated just<url normalizedValue=\"https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/72839\">how long it would take</url> for the average internet user to read the privacy policies of all the websites he or she visited in a single year. Their answer: over 30 workdays, at a national opportunity cost of $781 billion.</p><p>Which makes blowing off those policies seem quite reasonable. A necessity, even.</p><p>So there you have one explanation for this so-called paradox: To fully apprehend our vulnerabilities as digital creatures would require far too much time and energy. More than that: It would require an entirely new set of instincts, a radically different cognitive framework from the one we now possess.</p><p>Joyce Searls, a privacy activist and consultant in Santa Barbara, Calif., is forever reminding people that we\u2019ve barely begun to understand who and what we are on the internet, in part because it\u2019s a disembodied experience. We think we\u2019re alone while we\u2019re buzzing through the mists of cyberspace \u2014 that a Google search is akin to thumbing through the Yellow Pages, because it feels just as solitary. But it isn\u2019t. We are being watched, tracked; we simply don\u2019t realize it, because we can\u2019t see it or feel it.</p><p>Which suggests another reason we\u2019re less than conscientious about our online habits: Most of us haven\u2019t paid a humiliating price for being watched and tracked. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a massive experience of walking around naked with no perceived consequences,\u201d says Searls. Why bother getting dressed?</p><p>So we carry on. Even though everyone is mutely collecting our queries, preferences, fetishes, anxieties.</p><p>Google. Amazon. Facebook. YouTube. Pandora. Pinterest. The Weather Channel. Reddit. Wikipedia. Major League Baseball. PornHub. Zillow. Your newspaper. Your bank. Your phone carrier. Everyone.</p><p>Danah Boyd, the founder of the Data &amp; Society Research Institute, perhaps put it best when she wrote we are \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/2010/TechFest2010.html\">public by default, private through effort</url>.\u201d</p><p>For most people, that effort \u2014 to change how they search, how they buy stuff, how they connect with others and absorb news \u2014 is just too great. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that the fight to protect your data is unwinnable,\u201d says Acquisti, of Carnegie Mellon. \u201cYou\u2019d have to learn about other tools, it\u2019s costly in time, and it might not even help, because your data is already out there.\u201d</p><p>Resignation also explains the privacy paradox. It\u2019s a perfectly rational response to a situation in which human beings have very little agency.</p><p>If that\u2019s the case, my initial instinct \u2014 to call our privacy habits \u201cneurotically contradictory\u201d \u2014 is a rather ungenerous one. \u201cIt\u2019s not a neurotic contradiction,\u201d Shoshana Zuboff, a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, says to me in the nicest possible way. \u201cIt\u2019s an intolerable contradiction.\u201d</p><p>Zuboff is the author of \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\u201d an ambitious fright-opus that examines the new corporate trafficking in human habits and the consequences for our society. She thinks it\u2019s absurd, not to mention blaming the victim, to say that we\u2019re reckless with our privacy online. Rather, she argues, we have no choice. Online is where our individual needs get met, because they aren\u2019t being met in real life. \u201cThe real institutional world has abandoned us,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>As she notes: We call the airlines \u2014 or our insurance companies or our banks \u2014 and spend ten minutes talking to robots, then another 15 on hold, waiting to speak to an actual person. Is it any wonder we handle matters concerning our health, travel, and banking online instead?</p><p>Zuboff has equal compassion for our promiscuities on social media, as compromising as they may be to our privacy. Status online has become compensation for living in an environment of economic instability. It may even pay economic dividends. Influencers online can make money. (Two words that turn my blood to ice: Instagram celebrity.)</p><p>What many of us don\u2019t realize, when we\u2019re online, is how very much the technologies we\u2019re using are reshaping our ideas about privacy without our notice. Which in turn reshapes our behaviors.</p><p>This is one of the core themes of \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reengineeringhumanity.com/press\">Re-Engineering Humanity</url>,\u201d by Brett Frischmann and Evan Selinger. It\u2019s not an accident, they argue, that we treat our privacy differently now. The tools we use have been designed with exactly this end in mind.</p><p>I think, in my own life, about the first random person whose friend request I accepted on Facebook. I no longer remember his name. I simply remember realizing that he was not, as best as I could discern, a friend of a good friend, but rather had come my way via a loopity skein of loose ties. Still, I clicked \u201caccept.\u201d Before I knew it, I was doing this pretty regularly, especially in 2014, when I had a book to sell. (Status! Visibility! Sales!) And all was fine with this freewheeling system until the day that one of those random people \u2014 someone who\u2019d requested my friendship, not the other way around (it was never the other way around) \u2014 wrote me a nasty note on Facebook Messenger, letting me know he\u2019d seen me on television and thought me a perfect idiot.</p><p>I unfriended him. But I also felt unnerved and rather furious with myself: He had, at that point, presumably seen pictures of my kid, my wedding at City Hall, my 25th high school reunion. How had I decided that such a thing was \u2026 fine?</p><p>\u201cThe danger that \u2018privacy\u2019 doesn\u2019t capture is this idea of creep,\u201d says Frischmann, an internet law expert at Villanova University. Like letting that random person into your Facebook circle, or \u2014 and this happened in Frischmann\u2019s own life \u2014 seeing your child come home from school with a fitness tracking device, which may seem like a win-win (you get free tech; the child might learn about healthy habits) until you consider what it means.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re conditioning a generation of kids to accept bodily surveillance by others without question,\u201d he says.</p><p>Our uses of big tech are not only based on our own desires, but the desires of those who designed it. There\u2019s a frightening automaticity to them. (I accept. Click.) It\u2019s as if we\u2019re the robots. </p><p>The irony \u2014 or maybe it isn\u2019t? \u2014 is that the demographic most susceptible to the influence of these technologies may also be the savviest about privacy. It was Danah Boyd who set me straight about this. Her book, \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://seeingcollaborations.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/itscomplicated.pdf\">It\u2019s Complicated</url>,\u201d makes it clear that teenagers care deeply about their privacy. The difference is how they go about maintaining it. Some, for instance, just post everything. \u201cThey obfuscate,\u201d she explains, \u201cthrough flooding.\u201d</p><p>They know that our minds are inefficient threshers, slow and lousy at separating wheat from chaff. But if you tell everyone everything, no one knows where to look or what matters. </p><p>There is, of course, someone else in American life who regularly floods the zone, namely with his Twitter feed. He, too, has been able to divert and confound through this deceptively simple means. According to a recent Gallup poll, his approval rating is now at 46 percent. Nearly half of Americans don\u2019t think he\u2019s naked at all. They still think, against all odds, that the emperor is wearing clothes.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

These locations are in the supply chain of at least 83 companies - many of them technology behemoths.</p><p><br/>The report states around 80,000 individuals were moved from the far west of Xinjiang to work in these forced labor camps. The majority of these people are\u00a0Uyghurs, an ethnic minority in China that has undergone\u00a0horrendous treatment.<br/>They were transferred to the force labor camps between 2017 and 2019, as part of the Chinese government's \"re-education\" policy. This effectively includes ideological training, constant surveillance, and religious oppression.<br/>Specifically, the tech companies named in the report are:<br/><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Apple</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Huawei</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Amazon</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Samsung</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Microsoft</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>ASUS</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Sony</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Dell</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Google</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>HTC</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>OPPO</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Oculus</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Acer</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Nintendo</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Nokia</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Sharp</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Siemens</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Toshiba</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Xiaomi</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Vivo</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Panasonic</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Cisco</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Hitachi</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>ZTE</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Lenovo</p></bodyText></listItem></list>How forced labor was involved in the components used by each of these companies varied, but the report outlined a few examples. One of them\u00a0was the transfer of 1,200\u00a0Uyghurs to an O-Film factory in 2017.<br/>This company manufactured the front-facing cameras for the iPhone 8 and iPhone X.\u00a0According to its website it also makes components for companies including Huawei, Lenovo, and Samsung.<br/>What have the companies involved said?Basically, a lot of nothing words jumbled together to the effect of: We are opposed to forced labor camps and will look into this matter<br/>It's what Microsoft told Vice, and it's what Apple told the Washington Post. Is this method of responding a surprise? No, it's straight out of the PR playbook: Don't take responsibility and promise vague, positive action.<br/>Thing is - this is hardly the first time a big tech company has been found using human rights-abusing factories. In fact, if you do a quick Google search looking for \"sweatshops technology\" you'll find an incredible amount of forced labor camps in the industry; a trend going back years and years.<br/>At this point, there's really only one conclusion: Big tech companies don't care.<br/>Until they're found out by investigations like this or from whistleblowers, they're happy to use the cheapest labor available and keep their stockholders happy with increased profits.<br/>Please, prove me wrong. I'm waiting.<br/>What can be done about the forced labor camps?Here we reach one of the biggest issues. Look again at that list of companies. If you're going to partake in the modern world - which, for most of us, isn't really an option - you're going to encounter a product from one of those organizations. And, believe me, if these companies are involved in forced labor camps, expect unlisted businesses to be implicated too.<br/>This means if you love gadgets you're, morally, kinda fucked. Which, as a gadget-lover and reviewer, is depressing as hell.<br/>This leads to a simple question: What can we actually do?<br/>The report from the\u00a0Australian Strategic Policy Institute has a long list of suggestions (scroll down to the \"Recommendations\" part of the report on the right hand sidebar), but these can be summarized to \"put pressure on the Chinese government.\" I have my doubts on how well that works.<br/>We could also consider\u00a0not buying some of these products, but due to the nature of late capitalism - that's not really achievable. Yes, we can try and not buy as many pointless gadgets, but it's tough to exist in the current world without, say, a smartphone or computer - let alone thrive.<br/>Also, this argument buys into a PR technique companies use (especially when it comes to the climate crisis) to absolve themselves from responsibility. You know, it's as though they're saying \"it's you, the people, who need to change, we're just giving you what you want.\"<br/>Which is all sorts of bullshit.<br/>My belief is that forced labor (or \"re-education) camps in the technology space need to be fought with regulation. The clearest way of achieving this is simply delivering huge fines to companies caught using these practices.\u00a0Just see how long hardware makers continue to use sweatshops after they're hit with a fine big enough to reverse the savings they made at a human cost.<br/>And if a fine doesn't work? Put some of the company's executives in prison.<br/>Is there another way?One option is to concentrate on making devices less disposable. The idea being, if you can reduce the yearly churn of new devices, you can ease the burden on factories and the need to create forced labor camps.<br/>The EU in particular has been active when it comes to reducing the impact of the device cycle - although not specifically for the reasons of modern slavery.<br/>One example is the organization looking into forcing phone makers to include replaceable batteries in handsets. Another is its fight with Apple over standardizing cables. There's not a huge leap from this to \"right-to-repair\" legislation, which would help reduce device churn.<br/>And, because the EU is so large, Americans would likely benefit from these changes too - as it wouldn't be cost-effective to make two completely different devices for the markets.<br/>Would this automatically solve forced labor camps? Of course not, but it's a step away from our current system that requires a never-ending manufacturing cycle.<br/>Realistically, businesses are never going to stop using sweatshops because all they really care about is making money - no matter what their marketing materials will have you believe. But there is a real human cost to this.<br/>Of course, as individuals we can be aware and make changes where we can. But never forget that it's the companies themselves supporting and spreading this methodology.\u00a0And the only way to stop this human abuse is to hit them in the only place they care about: Their bank accounts.<br/>How? Fine companies who use sweatshops so hard, they never make the same mistake again, and put the executives responsible behind bars.<br/>For more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-674243</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBS-85H1-JBYT-H4T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1031\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 4, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002R2W</classCode><className>SIEMENS AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>XIAOMI INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002KBZ</classCode><className>NINTENDO CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0004EBT</classCode><className>ASUSTEK COMPUTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002FCF</classCode><className>TOSHIBA CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A new report fromthe Australian Strategic Policy Institute[1]found that the Chinese government has 'facilitated the mass transfer of Uyghur and other ethnic minority citizens' to factories across the country and forced them to work. These locations are in the supply chain of at least 83 companies \u2014 many of them technology behemoths. The report states around 80,000 individuals were moved from the far west of Xinjiang to work in these forced labor camps. </p><p>The majority of these people areUyghurs, an ethnic minority in China that has undergonehorrendous treatment[2]. They were transferred to the force labor camps between 2017 and 2019, as part of the Chinese government's 're-education' policy. This effectively includes ideological training, constant surveillance, and religious oppression. Specifically, the tech companies named in the report are: AppleHuaweiAmazonSamsungMicrosoft ASUS SonyDellGoogle HTC OPPO Oculus Acer NintendoNokia Sharp SiemensToshiba Xiaomi Vivo PanasonicCisco Hitachi ZTE Lenovo How forced labor was involved in the components used by each of these companies varied, but the report outlined a few examples. One of themwas the transfer of 1,200Uyghurs to an O-Film factory in 2017. This company manufactured the front-facing cameras for the iPhone 8 and iPhone X.According to its website it also makes components for companies including Huawei, Lenovo, and Samsung.What have the companies involved said?Basically, a lot of nothing words jumbled together to the effect of: We are opposed to forced labor camps and will look into this matter It's what Microsoft told Vice[3], and it's what Apple told the Washington Post[4]. Is this method of responding a surprise? No, it's straight out of the PR playbook: Don't take responsibility and promise vague, positive action. Thing is \u2014 this is hardly the first time[5] a big tech company has been found using human rights-abusing factories. In fact, if you do a quick Google search looking for 'sweatshops technology' you'll find an incredible amount of forced labor camps in the industry; a trend going back years and years. At this point, there's really only one conclusion: Big tech companies don't care. Until they're found out by investigations like this or from whistleblowers, they're happy to use the cheapest labor available and keep their stockholders happy with increased profits. Please, prove me wrong. I'm waiting.What can be done about the forced labor camps?Here we reach one of the biggest issues. Look again at that list of companies. If you're going to partake in the modern world \u2014 which, for most of us, isn't really an option \u2014 you're going to encounter a product from one of those organisations. And, believe me, if these companies are involved in forced labor camps, expect unlisted businesses to be implicated too. This means if you love gadgets you're, morally, kinda fucked. Which, as a gadget-lover and reviewer, is depressing as hell. This leads to a simple question: What can we actually do? The report from theAustralian Strategic Policy Institute has a long list of suggestions (scroll down to the 'Recommendations' part of the report on the right hand sidebar[6]), but these can be summarized to 'put pressure on the Chinese government.' I have my doubts on how well that works. We could also considernot buying some of these products, but due to the nature of late capitalism \u2014 that's not really achievable. Yes, we can try and not buy as many pointless gadgets, but it's tough to exist in the current world without, say, a smartphone or computer \u2014 let alone thrive. Also, this argument buys into a PR technique companies use (especially when it comes to the climate crisis[7]) to absolve themselves from responsibility. You know, it's as though they're saying 'it's you, the people, who need to change, we're just giving you what you want.' Which is all sorts of bullshit. My belief is that forced labor (or 're-education) camps in the technology space need to be fought with regulation. The clearest way of achieving this is simply delivering huge fines to companies caught using these practices.Just see how long hardware makers continue to use sweatshops after they're hit with a fine big enough to reverse the savings they made at a human cost. And if a fine doesn't work[8]? Put some of the company's executives in prison.Is there another way?One option is to concentrate on making devices less disposable. The idea being, if you can reduce the yearly churn of new devices, you can ease the burden on factories and the need to create forced labor camps. The EU in particular has been active when it comes to reducing the impact of the device cycle \u2014 although not specifically for the reasons of modern slavery. One example is the organisation looking into forcing phone makers to include replaceable batteries in handsets[9]. Another is its fight with Apple over standardizing cables[10]. There's not a huge leap from this to 'right-to-repair' legislation, which would help reduce device churn. And, because the EU is so large, Americans would likely benefit from these changes too \u2014 as it wouldn't be cost-effective to make two completely different devices for the markets. Would this automatically solve forced labor camps? Of course not, but it's a step away from our current system that requires a never-ending manufacturing cycle. Realistically, businesses are never going to stop using sweatshops because all they really care about is making money \u2014 no matter what their marketing materials will have you believe. But there is a real human cost to this. Of course, as individuals we can be aware and make changes where we can. But never forget that it's the companies themselves supporting and spreading this methodology.And the only way to stop this human abuse is to hit them in the only place they care about: Their bank accounts. How? Fine companies who use sweatshops so hard, they never make the same mistake again, and put the executives responsible behind bars.For more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter[11] and Flipboard[12].

Others may find it simpler to use just one set of rules.</p><p>Other businesses are limiting their policy changes to Europe.</p><p>WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, announced last week for example that will hike its minimum user age in Europe to 16 from 13 in order to comply. The lower age threshold will remain elsewhere.</p><p/><p>GDPR seeks to expand and update data rules that have been in place since 1995 -- long before hacks, security breaches and data leaks became common.</p><p>Organizations face big fines if they do not comply. European regulators can fine larger companies up to 4% of annual global sales, which for the big tech firms could run into billions of dollars.</p><p>Thompson said that companies are preparing for a wave of data deletion requests from users.</p><p>\"If you are a large investment bank, it could be five requests a week. If you are a large retail bank, it could be 500 a day,\" he said.</p><p>The new rules are a headache for businesses, but some are better off than others.</p><p>Companies with large data stockpiles are finding it especially difficult to prepare for the May 25 deadline, and some companies outside Europe are still waking up to the scope of the law.</p><p>\"I've been with a number of Global 100 boards and they are not going to be compliant. They've spent multiple, multiple millions [of dollars], some in excess of a hundred million so far,\" Thompson said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180426gdpr-data-privacy-email-consent1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S7C-FV11-JBPX-W249-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><timeReceived>10:34 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 26, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002P53</classCode><className>LLOYDS BANKING GROUP PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Two elements of the news laws \u2014 formerly referred to as articles 11 and 13 \u2014 have been hotly opposed by critics. Put simply, these impose a so-called \"link tax\" on content aggregators, like Google, and make websites responsible for policing copyright. But the EU said memes would be safe under the new laws. The legislation is also a long way off being implemented. The European Parliament on Tuesday voted in favour of highly controversial new digital copyright laws[1]. The directive passed by a majority of 74 votes, prompting dismay from tech firms, academics, and politicians. Two elements of the directive have drawn particular criticism: Article 15 and Article 17, formerly known as Article 11 and Article 13. Put simply, these impose a so-called \"link tax\" on content aggregators, like Google, and make websites responsible for policing copyright. Below is an explanation of what Article 15 and Article 17 actually mean \u2014 and why your memes are safe.Article 17: Making websites police copyrightArticle 17 has proved the most contentious part of the EU's copyright reforms. It makes companies liable for content uploaded to their platforms. So if a user uploads a piece of content that infringes copyright, the platform is at risk. This part of the directive, in particular, has received a lot of pushback from big companies, including YouTube,[2] Reddit, and Wikipedia[3]. Read more: Reddit, Wikipedia, and PornHub are strong-arming users into protesting against laws that could change the face of the internet in Europe[4] \"Making internet companies liable will enhance rights holders' chances (notably musicians, performers and script authors, as well as news publishers and journalists) to secure fair licensing agreements, thereby obtaining fairer remuneration for the use of their works exploited digitally,\" the European Parliament said in a press statement[5]. In particular, it also noted that uploads to non-commercial sites like Wikipedia and GitHub will be exempt, and that start-up platforms will be subject to \"lighter obligations\" than big, established tech companies. Some critics, including Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, say that the new legislation will work in favour of tech giants, further entrenching their monopoly.Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1110517366365044736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw You, the Internet user, have lost a huge battle today in Internet parliament. The free and open internet is being quickly handed over to corporate giants at the expense of ordinary people. This is not about helping artists, it is about empowering monopolistic practices.Critics have also said Article 17 could result in the use of upload filters, which could potentially end up preventing users from uploading images which fall under fair use, leading to a chilling of freedom of expression. In a Q...rom January[6], supporters of the directive said companies wouldn't be obliged to use upload filters. \"However, if large platforms do not come up with any innovative solutions, they may end up opting for filters,\" the Q...dded.But memes are safeArticle 17 also had some internet users worried that it would neuter the creation of memes[7]. The EU announced on Tuesday that memes, along with gifs, will be shielded from the directive as they will fall under provisions for \"quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody or pastiche.\" In short: Your memes are safe. Article 15: Imposing a \"link tax\" on firms like GoogleThe so-called \"link tax\" will automatically give news publishers the right to negotiate a license with news aggregators, such as Google. It also specifically stipulates that individual journalists or \"authors\" are entitled to an \"appropriate share\" of the money their publication gets from its licensing agreement with services like Google. The EU added in a special provision when re-drafting the original version of the legislation[8], making sure that hyperlinks and sharing \"snippets\" from news articles are exempt from Article 15. Google quickly voiced its disappointment on Twitter[9] following the vote on Tuesday, and indicated it would keep up lobbying efforts as the laws progress through European Parliament. \"We look forward to working with policy makers, publishers, creators and rights holders as EU member states move to implement these new rules,\" Google tweeted[10].This is still a long way off...Although the directive has been voted through on Tuesday, it's still a way off implementation. It still needs to be ratified by the EU Council, which an EU spokesman told Business Insider is likely to happen in early April. Once that's done, it will be up to EU member states whether they want to adopt the new laws. If they decide to do so, they will have two years to implement them. Some opposing MEPs have already begun the fight to reject the legislation in their home countries, such as Germany's Julia Reda[11].

On Thursday, for example, the front page was dominated by The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://professional.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703421204576331610501421954.html\">LinkedIn IPO as the lead story</url> \u201c unsurprising given the eye-catching numbers and the apocalyptic projections of an emerging bubble.</p><p><br/><br/>Such fears over a bubble seem to question the ultimate power of social networking sites, but as a counterpoint, the second most prominent story on that day, \u0153<url normalizedValue=\"http://professional.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704281504576329441432995616.html\">\u02dcLike Button Follows Web Users</url> by Amir Efrati, played on the growing fear that they could be too powerful. It seems social networking sharing buttons (Like, Tweet, Buzz), prevalent on much online content, allow social networks to trace where users are visiting, even if they dont click to share.  They simply have to be logged-in to one of those sites at the time they are browsing. <br/><br/>Now, you are a savvy web user.  You already knew this.  But did your mom know?  Did your cousin from Oshkosh know?  Likely not.<br/><br/>Thats why we see privacy outrage bubble up whenever the general consumer feels betrayed.  The hot mess surrounding Apples use of locational data on iPhones, for example, led privacy advocates to ask stern questions in the media. Facebook and Google(NASDAQ:GOOG) , for their part, have responded by saying that the data is anonymized and not held permanently, but who really believes \u02dcem?  They have individualized web surfer data and they are strictly anonymizing it?  Really?  Cmon.  Is that why the Feds are so eager to petition Google, et al., for user data? <br/><br/>But forget the Feds.  For marketers, such data is highly desirable in trying to deliver highly personalized and targeted campaigns, and even some consumers will see the benefits of receiving offers and content that is relevant and useful to them.  And thats great.  But what is NOT great, is when big tech companies surprise users re: how their data is being recorded and used.  <br/><br/>Transparency upfront is the solution.  Easy opt-in/out is the answer.  But lets face it, plenty of folks would opt-out, which is a head-scratcher for the big players, for whom breadth is as important as depth.<br/><br/>At a recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.masstlc.org/\">Mass Technology Leadership Council</url>event in Cambridge, MA,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://allthingsd.com/author/kara/\">Kara Swisher of All Things Digital</url> pondered some of these points and called for far more transparency from the likes of Facebook and Google.  Its easy enough to explain to consumers what a widget does and how it affects them in plain English, she argued.  <br/><br/>Its in Googleand Facebooks best interests to get more transparent, more quickly.  If consumers come to distrust those ubiquitous SHARE functions associated with web content, everyone loses, including Social Media evangelists like Yours Truly.  Im not sure when or how well reach a tipping point when consumers awaken and demand more transparent communications from social networking sites\u00a6 hopefully before a government regulator is forced to step in.<br/><br/>What are your thoughts?  Privacy vs. Personalization and the Role of Transparency\u00a6 sounds juicy! Have at it in the comments.<br/><br/>This post was co-written with my colleage       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/DominicWeeks\">Dominic Weeks</url>.<br/><br/> Newstex ID: PRS-0001-104366567   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-newstexPRS-0001-104366567</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRS-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:52Y4-4531-F03R-N1HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"553\"/><timeReceived>12:59 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Newstex LLC<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2011 PR Squared</copyright><publicationName>PR Squared</publicationName><aggregationName>Newstex Web Blogs</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>May 25, 2011 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We also look at President Trump\u2019s lashing-out over Syria and a place where pugs rule.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A Brexit deal? Not yet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brexit talks <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/world/europe/brexit-boris-johnson-eu.html\">continued late into the night</url>, with Donald Tusk, the European Council president, and Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, offering different takes on whether an agreement might be reached. </p><p>Little time remains to strike a deal that can be voted on when European heads of state arrive in Brussels today, and then be approved by Britain\u2019s Parliament in a special session on Saturday \u2014 if the country is to leave the bloc by Oct. 31, as Mr. Johnson insists will happen. </p><p>Progress: Hopes rose as Mr. Tusk said the \u201cbasic foundations of an agreement are ready\u201d and President Emmanuel Macron of France voiced optimism as well. </p><p>But there were mixed signals, with the leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party saying there was much work to be done. (Mr. Johnson needs the party\u2019s support to get a deal through Parliament.) Mr. Johnson himself compared the negotiations to climbing Mount Everest, saying the peak was still \u201cshrouded in mist.\u201d </p><p>Strategy: The E.U. may be extracting concessions from Mr. Johnson with the knowledge that his worst-case scenario would be a delay (he once said he would rather be \u201cdead in a ditch\u201d than postpone Brexit). </p><p>President Trump lashed out on Syria</p><p>Democratic leaders walked out of a White House meeting about the worsening situation in Syria on Wednesday, after President Trump repeatedly insulted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. </p><p>Separately, The Times obtained a letter from last week in which <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/world/europe/brexit-boris-johnson-eu.html\">Mr. Trump warned President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey</url> against an invasion: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d </p><p>Bipartisan rebuke: Earlier Wednesday, more than 100 Republicans joined Democrats in the House in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/world/europe/brexit-boris-johnson-eu.html\">condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces</url> from Syria.</p><p>Mr. Trump, for his part, essentially washed his hands of the Turkish assault on America\u2019s Kurdish allies there, saying, \u201cThat has nothing to do with us. The Kurds know how to fight, and, as I said, they\u2019re not angels, they\u2019re not angels.\u201d</p><p>On the ground: Mr. Erdogan <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/world/europe/brexit-boris-johnson-eu.html\">urged the Kurds to lay down their arms</url>. And Vice President Mike Pence will lead a delegation today to Turkey, where he hopes to convince the president to pull back his offensive. </p><p>An emerging pattern in the impeachment inquiry.</p><p>Closed-door testimony to House investigators this week has a theme: President Trump went his own way on Ukraine, whose leaders he urged to investigate his Democratic rivals.</p><p>Today, Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, testified that he quit because <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/world/europe/brexit-boris-johnson-eu.html\">career diplomats had been sidelined</url>, and said he was disappointed with how politicized the State Department had become under Mr. Trump. </p><p>And we learned that Fiona Hill, a former top White House foreign policy adviser, testified on Monday that she saw Gordon Sondland \u2014 a Trump donor who was named ambassador to the European Union \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/world/europe/brexit-boris-johnson-eu.html\">as a potential national security risk</url> because of his inexperience.</p><p>Mr. Sondland, who played a role in the administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, is scheduled to meet with impeachment investigators today.</p><p>If you have some time, this is worth it</p><p>In the Philippines, a journalist versus a president</p><p>President Rodrigo Duterte refers to journalists as \u201cspies,\u201d \u201cvultures\u201d and \u201clowlifes.\u201d His wish, he has said, is to \u201ckill journalism\u201d in the Philippines. Maria Ressa, above, the editor of the independent news site Rappler, has incurred much of the president\u2019s wrath, becoming the target of almost a dozen civil and criminal cases in the past year and a half. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/world/europe/brexit-boris-johnson-eu.html\">\u201cIt\u2019s a strange time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely existential.\u201d</url></p><p>Here\u2019s what else is happening</p><p>Russia: Three American diplomats were removed from a train <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/world/europe/brexit-boris-johnson-eu.html\">heading to an Arctic town near the site of a recent nuclear accident</url>, Russian news agencies reported on Wednesday. </p><p>Big tech: The E.U.\u2019s top antitrust regulator <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/world/europe/brexit-boris-johnson-eu.html\">ordered Broadcom to halt potentially anticompetitive practices</url> while an investigation is underway, applying a rarely used rule.</p><p>Opioids: The three largest drug distributors in the U.S. are in negotiations to settle thousands of cases related to the opioid epidemic.

The phenomenon has over the past few years, slowly, but surely risen to the top of the political agenda.<br/>Political campaigning - often verging on propaganda -\u00a0has existed for centuries, so what's changed. Why has the transition to a digital advertising space caused so much concern? What is it about this new way of communicating that has allowed the increase of lies and manipulation of the general public?</p><p><br/>The twin shocks of the Brexit referendum and the US presidential election in 2016 - and the related Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal - point the finger at microtargeting. But there is also the very real tidal wave of information that individuals struggle to deal with. The volume, velocity and vectors for information have all increased exponentially, while who takes responsibility for generating and disseminating that information grows ever more opaque.<br/>At a recent event in Brussels, the European Partnership for Democracy (EPD) argued that \"the tension between the integrity of electoral systems and a vastly unregulated digital sphere have arguably become an inherent danger to democracies worldwide. It is clear that additional safeguards are needed that would allow regulators, and the public more generally, to understand who is funding what online.\"<br/>While it could certainly be argued that electoral law in many European countries is badly in need of an upgrade, at EU level, some - tentative - steps are being taken. European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen announced her plans for a European Democracy Action Plan that should include legislative proposals to guarantee transparency in political advertising. And in 2018, a self-regulatory Code of Practice was signed between the European Commission, major tech companies - Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Mozilla - and advertisers.<br/>However, self-regulation lacks teeth. Asking companies to be accountable to themselves does not necessarily guarantee results.\u00a0<br/>Before the European Parliament elections of 2019, the EPD commissioned research to be conducted in three countries, the Czech Republic, Italy and the Netherlands, in order to monitor the level to which tech platforms comply with the Code of Practice against disinformation on matters related to digital political advertising.<br/>The results were not reassuring. \"We believe that this central part of the connected society cannot be left to voluntary systems of company-level self-regulation, but should be subject to legal accountability and regulatory scrutiny in order to protect democracy and freedom of speech online,\" explained Ruth-Marie Henckes, EPD Advocacy and Communications Officer.<br/>At the end of October, the European Commission published the first annual self-assessment of the signatories to the Code. Despite the opportunity for greater transparency, the Commission concludes that \"further serious steps by individual signatories and the community as a whole are still necessary.\"<br/>Action taken by the platforms \"vary in terms of speed and scope\" and in general \"lag behind the commitments\" made, while \"cooperation with fact-checkers across the EU is still sporadic and without a full coverage of all Member States and EU languages.\"<br/>\"Overall, the reporting would benefit from more detailed and qualitative insights in some areas and from further big-picture context, such as trends. In addition, the metrics provided so far are mainly output indicators rather than impact indicators,\" said the Commission.<br/>The Commission plans to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the Code to be presented in early 2020, and will also take into account input from the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services (ERGA), evaluations from a third party selected by the signatories and an independent consultant engaged by the Commission, as well as a report on the 2019 elections to the European Parliament.<br/>The issue of transparency is one that is raised again and again, including at the EPD Virtual Insanity event. Although it was widely agreed that users should be able to understand why they are seeing an ad and what data was used to target that ad, there remain obstacles.<br/>There are inherent difficulties in defining a \"political\" ad. Different platforms use different definitions. Banning all political ads, as Twitter has recently done, can result in blocking some political content, such as climate change activism, that is not about targeting a particular election or referendum.<br/>Google has also announced major changes to its political ads policy -\u00a0\"political advertisers\" will only be able to target ads based on users' age, gender and location. But who decides who is and isn't a \"political advertiser\"? Only political parties? Third parties? Pressure groups? What is and is not designated \"political\" remains murky at best.<br/>Given this, one might have some small amount of sympathy for Facebook's controversial decision to allow politicians an exemption from its own ban on false claims in advertising. Fair enough if they say it is not their job to fact-check politicians, but examining the role of these companies leads to the conclusion that they are overwhelmingly the gatekeepers of public discourse online. It is not inherently wrong that social networks have their own ethical guidelines on what can and cannot be published on their platform - indeed, do we want Big Tech to become the arbiter of truth?<br/>The answer seems to be that we want responsibility and accountability. And transparency appears to be the first step on that road. Platforms should at the very least be proactive in complying with the many rules already in place for social networks, both on EU and national level.<br/>Clearly illegal content, such as hate speech, should be routinely flagged and taken down. Users should be informed about about when and how this is happening - current transparency reports rarely explain which content has been removed and why, and whether and how a particular user was targeted.<br/>Given the scale of the problem and the potential harmful consequences for democracy, disinformation needs to be taken seriously.<br/>Even more sophisticated possibilities for manipulation, so-called deepfakes, are likely to emerge in coming years. Not alone are they able to mislead convincingly, but they will also have a wider ranging \"chilling effect\" as people are increasingly unable to tell what is true or false and will dismiss even factual content as \"fake.\" A failure to take this will play straight into the hands of the despots and disrupters of democracy and Europe needs to act now.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-359760</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM8-H661-JBYT-H2T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1103\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 29, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>PARTNERSHIP FOR DEMOCRACY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We spoke with Sarah Blesener, one of a number of photographers who has helped us cover the show.</p><p>Have you covered anything like this before?</p><p>Oh my, no. This is my first time, and there\u2019s nothing like it. It feels like there\u2019s too much to photograph. It\u2019s visually overwhelming \u2014 that\u2019s a better way to put it. The activities are quite redundant, the grooming and the competition, but the people and the dogs are unique. You turn a corner and there\u2019s hair spray in the air and a dog in a new outfit, or people are dressed in \u201940s sequins.</p><p>How do you work with the other photographers?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html\">We cover different shifts</url>. Somebody will be there in the morning, somebody in the afternoon, somebody in the evening. Somebody is doing video. It feels nice, you have more confidence to have your own vision.</p><p>What are you looking to capture?</p><p>The people are so quirky and interesting, and their relationships with the dogs are remarkable. That\u2019s what I was drawn to. But it\u2019s hard, because you have to make it not look too kitschy, to get something that\u2019s more than just another cute dog. And you don\u2019t want to disturb or overwhelm anyone. People are really emotional, they\u2019re really stressed. It was more challenging than I realized.</p><p>That\u2019s it for this briefing.

It allows secondary units everywhere, not just on lots that share a property line with a public laneway, and includes suburban communities across the state.</p><p>Toronto's bylaw is just for Toronto and East York. The planning and housing committee recently recommended expanding it across the city. But this needs final approval from council and would still sharply limit how many secondary units can be built as most laneways are downtown.</p><p>The California law is no silver bullet. But it is \"a silver buck shot,\" Brown says with a laugh, a reference to a hunting shot where multiple pellets scatter at a target.</p><p>It's also a way to get around NIMBY(not in my backyard) neighbours who might oppose the density a multi-storey housing tower would bring. Brown sees ADUs as a \"different and flexible way\" to add a lot of housing units relatively quickly. \"A garage is already there. So it won't look or feel any different at all,\" she says. \"I see it as very complementary to rededicating our cities to people, instead of cars.\"</p><p>The cities of Portland and Bend, Ore., and Seattle have also recently made it easier to build ADUs.</p><p>Jo Flatt, program director at Evergreen, a Canadian non-profit that works to build better cities, said laneway homes were the \"low hanging fruit\" in Toronto because people around them were already used to activity and traffic.</p><p>\"Laneway suites are a great solution for the downtown, but when you think about the massive swaths of land that people have at their disposal in suburban areas or in other parts of the city, we need to think about how to unlock those opportunities for rental,\" she says.</p><p>\"We know that we're in a position with our housing that we need to be as creative as we can be and we need to look in every kind of place we can look to find new and creative solutions to address this challenge we have right now.\"</p><p>Some people would oppose more secondary suites, as they sometimes do tall housing towers. But it's not an \"either or situation,\" Flatt says. Both kinds of housing are needed, and the strategy for tackling NIMBYism for both includes breaking down stigma about bringing renters into single-family-home neighbourhoods.</p><p>\"There's obviously a need for culture change and for people to be comfortable with that, but I think it's a huge opportunity for our city and we should be thinking about the different unique ways,\" she says.</p><p>California's new law overrides local regulations, mandating cities and counties issue permits on applications for second units on properties that have a single-family dwelling within 120 days, according to Greg Nickless, a housing policy analyst with the state.</p><p>Local jurisdictions can expand on development standards, like maximum height and size. But they cannot prohibit a secondary unit or be too burdensome with regulations. Secondary units also have to be rented if not used by the owner and can't be independently sold.</p><p>By the numbers, California's new law has been a \"tremendous success,\" Brown says. The state doesn't track permits, but cities do.</p><p>In Los Angeles, there's been 17 times the number of permits filed for ADUs since the change in state law in January 2017, compared to two years earlier, according to the city's most recent housing progress report. Eighty per cent are conversions of or additions to existing buildings, such as garages, and there's been a 42 per cent increase in permits filed from 2017-2018. Although, as Brown notes, some of this is from people who already had secondary units and are now just obtaining the proper permits.</p><p>Many cities have gone further, putting in their own legislation that makes it even easier to convert garages and build other kinds of secondary units.</p><p>Like San Jose, a sprawling Silicon Valley bedroom community of about 1.1 million tucked between big tech headquarters, where the housing crisis has gotten so bad that last year local news outlets reported on a university professor living out of her car.</p><p>The city has partnered with the Housing Trust of Silicon Valley for the Yes In My Backyard Program (a play on NIMBY), to waive city fees and offer forgivable loans of up to $20,000 (U.S.) for homeowners who convert a garage or build another kind of secondary housing unit and agree to restrict rents to a level that is affordable to low-to-moderate income households.</p><p>\"We're trying to see if we can do whatever's possible to eliminate the barriers to entry and really scale the number of these ADUs,\" Mayor Sam Liccardo told the Star. \"We have ambitions to do much more.\"</p><p>San Jose is the 10th largest city in the U.S. but is \"relatively new on the scene\" compared to the better known L.A. or San Francisco. Like a lot of the GTA, it \"grew up\" very fast in the '60s, '70s and '80s, Liccardo says. \"That rapid period of growth was really in the age of the automobile, so it was a very suburban sprawl pattern of growth, which provided a very high quality of life for a lot of families for many years, but ultimately created a chronic challenge around housing affordability and traffic.\"</p><p>At the same time, tech companies like Google and Apple have moved in nearby. They create \"multimillion-square-foot campuses\" that generate enormous revenue but leave their own employees without anywhere to live. Liccardo estimates average one-bedroom rent is almost $3,000.</p><p>San Jose is now caught in an \"awkward age\" like a teenager as a city. \"It's a very painful time for us to be taking parking spaces away from folks who feel chained to the steering wheel,\" Liccardo says.</p><p>\"There's no question that the densificationin these single-family neighbourhoods is going to have adverse impacts for those who believe they have a constitutional right to the parking space in front of their home.\"</p><p>That's a sentiment that wouldn't be out of place in the GTA. Off-street parking makes up 15 per cent of Mississauga's land, for example, according to a parking master plan released in May.</p><p>Evergreen's Flatt said it's \"the biggest irony\" that cars have their own houses, in a city where so many people don't.</p><p>City staff did not have an estimate of how many garages there are in Toronto, but according to the 2016 census, across the GTA almost 40 per cent of about 2.1 million private dwellings are single-detached houses, or about 845,000. Many, if not most, of those come with garages. That's a lot of potential affordable housing.</p><p>The region's population keeps growing - it's projected to jump from 6.9 million in 2017 to 9.7 million by 2041, according to provincial population projections. But with already congested streets, and everyone needing to cut down the carbon emissions generated by vehicles, car ownership can't keep pace, Flatt says.</p><p>According to a 2018 Transportation Tomorrow Survey, released this year based on 2016 data, 28 per cent of households in Toronto already do not have a vehicle. In downtown wards, as many as 55 per cent of households don't own one.</p><p>The California solution isn't perfect. In addition to pains around parking, there have been issues with high cost of conversion, which can be in the $150,000 to $160,000 range, San Jose's Liccardo says. His city is trying to lower the cost.</p><p>Cherry Tung, an L.A. accountant and YouTuber, says living in a converted garage has both pros and cons.</p><p>There's no central air and she struggles to keep out ants. But the price, at $950 a month compared to $2,000 for comparable places in Alhambra, about 10 minutes from downtown L.A., is right. And she finds she has plenty of space for herself and her cats Cotton and Candy, with a living room, kitchen, bedroom and bath.</p><p>About two hours south from Tung's cosy garage apartment, longtime contractor John Arendsen has seen his San Diego area business Crest Homes increase \"dramatically\" since the changes in state law.</p><p>Garage conversions make up a huge chunk of it, as they're the most \"practical\" and \"least costly,\" kind of secondary units by far.</p><p>He estimates at least 50 per cent of his customers are looking to rent out a secondary unit. But he also sees millennial kids back with their parents who want more space, downsizing boomers who move into the smaller unit themselves, and older adults who want live-in caregivers to stay on the property.</p><p>The 72-year-old plans to eventually build his own secondary unit in the backyard of the single-storey California ranch, where he lives with his wife.</p><p>\"We will never leave our home, chances are we'll probably age in place,\" he said over the phone from Palm Desert.</p><p>It may not be perfect, but Evergreen's Flatt says the \"California model\" starts to give Toronto \"things to work with.\" It also helps us realize it \"isn't so scary after all.\"</p><p>\"It just needs to be customized to our context,\" she says.</p><p>\"It's not yes or no, but how.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019071755079151</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKF-G5K1-JBTY-W00D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1666\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF OREGON</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUM0Mzc1ODgzMUM2NDQ1M0IxMUUyNDM1RUVFNjA5QzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUQzM0QzNzNGREY4NDcxOEIyRTk4NTM1OTcwMzcwMUY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOSH</classCode><className>HOUSING AFFORDABILITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009S6Y</classCode><className>HOUSING ASSISTANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N624229JM</classCode><className>LOW COST HOUSING SCHEMES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008XWL</classCode><className>EVICTION</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUVBNzBGMzM3NUY1NEExQjg1QTUxRTZCRjA1QTU1NDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUZDQTAzRTdEMTMzNDZEOTg4N0M3OUMyOUNEMjI0MTQ</classCode><className>Eviction Actions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DNU3</classCode><className>SPORTING GOODS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001645</classCode><className>SUBURBS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DDMF</classCode><className>HOUSING SHORTAGES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001220</classCode><className>NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

It's time to #BreakUpBigTech,' she wrote in another tweet, linking back to her campaign website.</p><p>An audio recording of one of Zuckerberg's all-hands meetings with Facebook employees in July was leaked and published Tuesday, revealing that he felt the 2020 political candidate's proposal for dealing with tech giants was misinformed.</p><p>Zuckerberg also touched on several other topics after being questioned by staff, including that Facebook has had 'private engagement' with regulators, out of the spotlight, about launching its digital currency Libra. </p><p>He also told staff that some of the media reports detailing the stress and trauma some of the company's 30,000 content moderators faced at work were 'overdramatic'. And when employees asked how to respond to friends who were critical of the company, they were to tell them that it 'cares about problems'.</p><p>The candid meeting also saw Zuckerberg joke to staff that he would have been fired years ago if he didn't have shares with special voting rights, giving him total control of the company. </p><p>Zuckerberg also detailed plans to pursue 'brain computer interface' as VR and AR becomes more popular in the next five to 10 years, but he said it will be non-evasive and the company 'won't perform brain surgery'. </p><p>                     Leaked audio reveals what Zuckerberg told Facebook staff                    </p><p> - Zuckerberg told staff that he would be willing to 'go to the mat' and 'fight' Elizabeth Warren should she become president and attempt to break up big tech companies. He added that it would not solve issues like election interference, but amplify them</p><p>- The company has had 'private engagement' with regulators about launching its digital currency Libra, out of the media spotlight. Facebook hopes to have 100 private partners by the time it launches sometime in 2020 </p><p> - Some of the reports detailing the stress and trauma around 30,000 contracted comment moderators faced were 'overdramatic'. Zuckerberg added that most people are 'not looking at terrible things all day long', and there is a 'distribution of experiences'</p><p> - Zuckerberg - who is both CEO and chairman - joked to staff that he would have been fired years ago if he didn't own nearly 60 percent of Facebook stock that gives him special voting rights on the board, effectively giving him total control of the company </p><p>- Employees who asked how to respond to friends who were critical of Facebook were told to tell them the company 'cares about problems'</p><p>- Facebook will pursue 'brain computer inferface', but it will be non-invasive and the company 'won't perform brain surgery' </p><p>At the meeting, Zuckerberg said that there 'might be a political movement where people are angry at the tech companies or are worried about concentration' when answering a question from one employee, according to a transcript published by The Verge on Tuesday. </p><p>'That doesn't mean that, even if there's anger and that you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies.'</p><p>'I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government,' he continued. 'But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.'</p><p>Zuckerberg confirmed on his official Facebook page the validity of the leaked audio and even linking back to the transcript so people could listen and read his comments that are usually reserved for employees.</p><p>'Every week I do a Q&amp;A at Facebook where employees get to ask me anything and I share openly what I'm thinking on all kinds of projects and issues,' he wrote. </p><p>'The transcript from one of my Q&amp;As a few months ago just got published online,' Zuckerberg continued, 'and even though it was meant to be internal rather than public, now that it's out there, you can check it out if you're interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I'm thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics like social responsibility, breaking up tech companies, Libra, neural computing interfaces, and doing the right thing over the long term.'</p><p>Senator Warren, who most recently polls in either first or second place among Democratic voters, has a whole section of her campaign website dedicated to outlining her plan to 'break up big tech' like Facebook, Google and Amazon - companies she claims hold monopolies.</p><p>'Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,' Warren charges in her proposal. 'They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.'</p><p>'That's why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition - including breaking up Amazon, Facebook, and Google.' </p><p>Although Warren believes breaking up these companies will root out corruption, such as election meddling, Zuckerberg insists it would only exacerbate the issue since smaller companies are unable to allocate the same sort of investments towards safety and security. </p><p>'It's just that breaking up these companies, whether it's Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues,' Zuckerberg said in one of the meetings.</p><p>'And, you know, it doesn't make election interference less likely,' he continued. 'It makes it more likely because now the companies can't coordinate and work together. It doesn't make any of the hate speech or issues like that less likely. It makes it more likely because now... all the processes that we're putting in place and investing in, now we're more fragmented.'</p><p>Facebook employs 39,651 people and as of June 2019 the social media platform has 2.41 billion monthly active users. When combining daily users to Facebook and subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, the company has more than 2.1 billion combined visitors every day.</p><p>Google is by far the most popular search engine and most visited website in the world - receiving on average 63,000 searches per second, which translates into at least 3.8 million searches per minute, 228 million searches per hour, and 5.6 billion searches per day and a whopping 2 trillion searches per year. And the website's email platform, Gmail, has more than 1 billion monthly active users. </p><p>Amazon has more than 100 million Prime members, which costs $119 per year. The online marketplace usually has between 2-3 billion visitors per month.</p><p>Zuckerberg, whose net worth is $67.3 billion, has been making efforts to work with Washington to restore faith in big tech - especially since it was revealed Facebook was utilized by foreign entities attempting to influence the 2016 elections. </p><p>In April 2018, Zuckerberg testified in a congressional hearing regarding the use of Facebook data to target voters in the last presidential elections, and since then has met with members of Congress and the president. </p><p>Zuckerberg joined Donald Trump for a meeting in the Oval Office in September, and a White House official said the topic of 'bias came up.' Earlier that same day, he was seen on Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers.</p><p>'Mark is in Washington, D.C., meeting with policymakers to hear their concerns and talk about future internet regulation. He also had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,' a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement regarding the trip.</p><p>Zuckerberg had a closed-door dinner with senators as part of his Washington visit aimed at lobbying lawmakers on privacy and regulation issues important to Facebook.</p><p>Facebook has held 'private meetings' with regulators to launch its digital currency Libra </p><p>Facebook in June announced plans to launch a digital currency called Libra, which was met with criticism from regulators.</p><p>Notably, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in July that 'the project can go forward' without addressing concerns about 'privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability'.</p><p>In the leaked audio during the staff Q&amp;A session, Zuckerberg said that 'private engagement' with regulators, out of the media spotlight, would be key to securing approval.</p><p>'Part of the process is going to be public, like the hearings that [Facebook VP of messaging products David Marcus] did over the last couple of days,' he said. </p><p>'The public things, I think, tend to be a little more dramatic. But a bigger part of it is private engagement with regulators around the world, and those, I think, often are more substantive and less dramatic,' he continued.</p><p>The CEO also said that Facebook hoped to have 100 private partners by the time Libra launches, after securing 27 partners for the initial announcement.</p><p>Facebook has said that the first version of the project is supposed to launch sometime next year.</p><p>Zuckerberg says reports that comment moderators were traumatized by their work were 'overdramatic' </p><p>Facebook employs some 30,000 content moderators worldwide, most of them outside contractors, who are tasked with reviewing and removing content that is violent, extremist, or otherwise banned.</p><p>In recent months, several reports have emerged detailing the stress and trauma that contractors endure watching violent videos for much of the day.</p><p>'Some of the reports, I think, are a little overdramatic,' Zuckerberg said. 'From digging into them and understanding what's going on, it's not that most people are just looking at just terrible things all day long.'</p><p>'Within a population of 30,000 people, there's going to be a distribution of experiences that people have,' he continued.</p><p>'We want to do everything we can to make sure that even the people who are having the worst experiences, that we're making sure that we support them as well as possible.'</p><p>Zuckerberg joked he would have been fired years ago if he didn't have control of the company </p><p>Zuckerberg is the company's chairman and CEO, and controls nearly 60 percent of the shareholder voting power at Facebook as he owns stock in a class that gives him special voting rights. This puts him firmly in control of the board and making it effectively impossible to fire him. </p><p>In May, outside shareholders revolted, with 68 percent voting to oust Zuckerberg as chairman and 83 percent voting to implement a 'one share, one vote' system - measures that failed due to Zuckerberg's veto.</p><p>In the leaked audio of the Q&amp;A session with staff, Zuckerberg revealed that he would have been fired long ago without control of the board.</p><p>'In 2006, when Yahoo wanted to buy our company, I probably would've been fired, and we would have sold the company. We wouldn't even be here if I didn't have control,' he said. </p><p>'Going back to 2006 when we were just a college service, and we were about to roll out open registration so everyone can sign up, and we were about to launch News Feed, which didn't exist yet. And like Yahoo came in with this big offer for a billion dollars, which is, like, was going to, like, fulfill everyone's financial dreams for the company,' he said.</p><p>'And I was like, 'I don't really think we should do this.' And everyone was like 'What?' And at the time, we had 10 million people using Facebook, and Myspace had 100 million people, and it was growing faster.'</p><p>'So I turn it down, and our board was super upset. Our whole management team basically quit,' he continued.</p><p>Employees should tell friends who criticize Facebook that the company 'cares about the problems' </p><p>'I think humanizing stuff is always really important,' Zuckerberg said when asked what employees should say to friends to trash-talk Facebook.</p><p>'I think it's tough to break down these perceptions and build trust until you get to a place where people know that you have their best interests at heart. So that's one thing that you all will be well-suited to do as ambassadors, if you choose to be, having spent time here, as I think you know the heart of this place at this point,' he said.</p><p>He continued: 'I just find that sitting down and talking to people and having them know that you care about the problems and acknowledge that there are issues and that you're working through them ... I think it just makes a big difference.'</p><p>Facebook is pursuing neural interfaces 'but not brain surgery' </p><p>'Brain-computer interface is an exciting idea,' Zuckerberg said in the leaked transcript.</p><p>The CEO pointed out that the field is separated into two approaches: invasive and noninvasive.</p><p>'Invasive being things that require surgery or implants, but have the advantage that it's actually in your brain, so you can get more signal. Non-invasive is like, you wear a band or, for glasses, you shine an optical light and get a sense of blood flow in certain areas of the brain. You get less signal from noninvasive,' he said.</p><p>'We're more focused on - I think completely focused on non-invasive,' he continued, drawing laughter from the room.</p><p>'We're trying to make AR and VR a big thing in the next five years to 10 years ... I don't know, you think Libra is hard to launch. 'Facebook wants to perform brain surgery,' I don't want to see the congressional hearings on that one.' </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-56582935</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5P-DS01-JCJY-G2F3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2500\"/><timeReceived>3:14 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Would music fans be willing to pay for such an inferior product? I don't think so,\" Bragg said.</p><p>O'Brien, whose band Radiohead once sold its In Rainbows album by asking people to pay whatever they thought it was worth, said marginalising indies meant a digital music world catering only to big names and corporations.</p><p>\"Indie artists and labels are at the cutting edge of the future of music,\" O'Brien added. \"To restrict them in this way is to risk creating an internet just for the superstars and big businesses.\"</p><p>Faced with such high profile lobbying YouTube argues its online platform has become hugely important to help musicians build their fanbases. The company said that it has hundreds of successful commercial arrangements in place with record labels around the world.</p><p>But the Worldwide Independent Network (WIN), a trade body representing independent labels worldwide, is so frustrated with YouTube's negotiating stance that it will lodge a formal complaint today with the European Commission over the site's tactics.</p><p>WIN represents 850 labels in the UK including Beggars Group - owner of labels including XL Recordings, which is home to Adele and The White Stripes - and Domino, which has signed Franz Ferdinand as well as Arctic Monkeys.</p><p>Other acts threatened by the YouTube ban include Radiohead, Queens of the Stone Age, Vampire Weekend, Goldfrapp, The Prodigy, Nitin Sawhney, The xx, Twin Atlantic, M.I.A. and Grimes.</p><p>Three large music companies dominate the industry - Universal, Warner Music and Sony Music, known as the majors. In an attempt the match their clout in negotiations with digital media giants such as YouTube, the remaining independent labels negotiate collectively, but often complain that they struggle for the best commercial terms.</p><p>They say YouTube is trying to cut out Merlin, the body that represents them in rights deals, and is instead making direct approaches to individual independents with a \"non-negotiable\" contract for its proposed streaming service.</p><p>The labels say they have allegedly been threatened that if they don't sign on YouTube's terms they could find their music videos blocked. Alison Wenham, chief executive of WIN, said: \"We have been hearing from many companies across the world who are expressing fear, displeasure, outrage and confusion at the phone calls, letters and bullying they seem to be receiving from YouTube employees.\"</p><p>A YouTube spokesman said the site \"provides a global platform for artists to connect with fans and generate revenue for their music\", adding: \"We have successful deals in place with hundreds of independent and major labels around the world, however we don't comment on ongoing negotiations.\"</p><p>Google and YouTube's sheer size mean that the group is frequently the target of regulatory and legal actions. A ruling by a European court ruling forced Google to allow users to demand inadequate or irrelevant personal information be removed from search results, known as the \"right to be forgotten\".</p><p>Wenham said the European complaint marks a \"first step\" in a global campaign in which small labels would use their artists to campaign against the digital giant.</p><p>\"Our fellow trade associations around the world, representing tens of thousands of independent companies, also take issue with the actions of YouTube,\" she said.</p><p>John Enser, partner at law firm Olswang, said: \"Music services offered by big tech companies, not just in terms of YouTube but also iTunes, have often offered 'take it or leave it' terms to indie labels.</p><p>\"While it is understandable that YouTube cannot devote resources to thousands of negotiations of small contracts, the indies do have a body, in the form of Merlin, that negotiates deals for them.</p><p>\"For YouTube not to offer terms to Merlin on a similar basis to those it offers to the three remaining traditional majors does appear to give them a case to answer to the competition authorities.\"</p><p>YouTube's plans to go head to head with Spotify, Deezer and other subscription music services have been rumoured for some time. In March the New York Post reported that the new service would be called Music Pass, and would be likely to cost $5 a month in the US with ads or $10 a month for an ad-free version.</p><p>Captions:</p><p>Thom Yorke of Radiohead, one of many indie acts threatened by YouTube's ban</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-140504040614f0031</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CBY-5YY1-DYRX-X010-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Guardian - Final Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30338\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>June 4, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp;

And like other years, there are platforms that have found themselves in hot water on brand safety issues more so than others.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Enter: <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/t/youtube/\">YouTube</url>. The world's largest video website in 2019 has already come under fire for content moderation-related gaffes including acting as a      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/world/americas/youtube-pedophiles.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fmax-fisher&amp;module=inline\">\"digital playground\"</url> for child predators and      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/05/youtube-flip-flops-on-steven-crowder-suspension.html\">seemingly ignoring</url> the bigoted harrassment of a Vox journalist. The platform has also recently been blamed for      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html\">radicalizing</url> young adults and serving content to children that's      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-17/the-most-popular-kids-video-site-in-the-world-isn-t-for-kids\">unsuitable</url> for them. And most recently, a Wall Street Journal       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-youtube-overrun-with-bogus-cancer-treatment-claims-11562072401\">investigation</url> found misinformation about cancer treatment widely available on large digital platforms including       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/shay-mitchell-pregnant-youtube-original-series-1203256027/\">YouTube</url>.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">YouTube has faced repercussions from these less-than-ideal occurrences. In February, some of the country's major advertisers like Disney and Hasbro pulled their ads from YouTube after reports surfaced that videos on the platform of young children facilitated predatory comments from pedophiles.</p><p>These are concerning hiccups for a company that wants to be the de facto digital video advertising platform for brands globally, to be sure. But at the same time, there's a very high possibility that YouTube's ad revenue will remain largely unscathed from its 2019 content gaffes and the most recent (relatively mini) brand boycott.\u00a0</p><p>The fact is that 2 billion people use YouTube monthly worldwide, and 73% of U.S. adults use the video platform. Comparatively, Facebook and Instagram, two of the biggest digital platforms around, reach 69% and 37% of U.S. adults, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/10/share-of-u-s-adults-using-social-media-including-facebook-is-mostly-unchanged-since-2018/\">according to Pew Research.</url> In other words, YouTube's scale makes its occasional ad-in-the-wrong-place a tolerable risk for many brands. That's why several advertisers told      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adweek.com/digital/youtubes-comments-section-is-a-cesspool-but-advertisers-arent-going-anywhere/\">Adweek</url> earlier this year that YouTube's reach, targeting capabilities, and ad inventory make them willing to \"stick it out\" on the platform.</p><p>This helps explain why content controversies of yesteryears haven't made YouTube completely radioactive in the eyes of advertisers. As far back as 2017, reports surfaced that YouTube was running ads next to hateful and extremist videos, which led to hundreds of advertisers pausing their ad spending on the platform. YouTube apologized while pledging to do more to protect brands from similar gaffes, and most of the boycotting advertisers returned to YouTube just months later.\u00a0</p><p>In the following year, CNN<url normalizedValue=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/19/technology/youtube-ads-extreme-content-investigation/index.html\">found</url> ads of many big companies running on more extremist channels, which led Under Armour to pause its advertising on the platform. That same day, Bloomberg reported that P&amp;G would resume advertising on YouTube after its year-long hiatus from the platform. There's a pattern here, and it's likely to be repeated with YouTube's most recent ad-pullers.</p><p>Returning ad-pullers will allow YouTube to continue bolstering its top line. The company was estimated to generate over<url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/facebook-instagram-social-video-ad-spending-2018-study-1202973518/\">$3.3 billion</url> in U.S. video ad revenue in 2018, a figure up 17% year-over-year, per eMarketer estimates. And this figure is estimated to grow to about $4.4 billion by 2020. YouTube's anticipated ad revenue shows how the company is able to grow its ad business in the face of content headaches.</p><p>If anything, YouTube should be more concerned with what action will be taken by regulators, rather than advertisers, as it further sharpens its content moderation abilities. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/t/federal-trade-commission/\">Federal Trade Commission</url> is already investigating YouTube after consumer groups complained the platform improperly harvested children's data and allowed unsavory videos to show up in searches for kids content. The investigation is something that could result in fines being levied against the video platform, and privacy advocates have recently called on the FTC to impose fines of tens of billions of dollars against YouTube for its violations,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/youtube-content-for-children-should-be-barred-advocacy-groups-tell-ftc-11561478754\">according</url> to The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0</p><p>There are already indications that the FTC wants to act more strictly against big tech too: Facebook in April said that it expects to be fined $3 to $5 billion by the FTC over privacy violations, which would represent the largest fine ever levied against a tech company by a government agency. The government agency may choose to act similarly harshly against YouTube by imposing a big fine on it to further discourage other big tech companies from becoming overzealous on their data collection practices. \u00a0</p><p>Of course, the FTC may not choose to fine YouTube billions of dollars for its mishandling of children's videos and data. But receiving a fine in the billions would likely be more financially damaging to the company than any brand safety-advertiser boycott incident. Analysts in March 2017 estimated YouTube's brand safety debacle would cost the company $750 million, for example. And this estimate may have been on the bearish end, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/t/google/\">Google</url>'s ad revenue still grew about 19% from Q1 to Q2 2017.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. government has already signaled that it's interested in potentially investigating tech giants including <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/trump-sue-facebook-google-twitter-political-bias-1203253341/\">Google</url> for antitrust violations. And Google-owned YouTube again growing its ad spend in 2019 in the midst of fresh content moderation blunders could further embolden regulators that believe big tech companies wield too much power.</p><p>One argument for regulators against Google could go as such: Companies may not necessarily want to continue returning to advertise on a video platform that is repeatedly placing some ads next to unsavory content, but more-or-less feel inclined to because of the platform's reach, and because advertisers can extend their YouTube campaigns across multiple other Google properties like maps and search. Of all companies, Google already has the biggest share of U.S. digital ad revenue at<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2019/report-shows-amazon-taking-digital-advertising-market-share-google-facebook-duopoly/\">37%</url>.\u00a0</p><p>So it shouldn't be allowed to acquire additional tech companies to potentially allow advertisers to extend their campaigns across and make YouTube advertising even more enticing, regulators might argue, because this could help other companies retain digital ad clients and promote competition in the digital ad marketplace.</p><p>Another potential route for antitrust regulators to pursue is to force a spin-off of one of Google's businesses that helps it dominate the U.S. ad market, such as YouTube. But such an action is less likely to occur, because unwinding mergers are generally <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613617/breaking-up-big-tech-will-be-really-hard-to-do/\">difficult</url> for the government to get in motion. \"Far more remedies have been taken in antitrust cases that do not deal with massive scale breakups,\" former FTC antitrust lawyer Charlotte Slaiman       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/break-up-big-tech-antitrust-laws/\">told</url> Wired in June. Part of this is due to the difficulty in figuring out which parts of a business need to be broken off, according to Slaiman. Moreover, antitrust enforcement may become more difficult if the government is unsuccessful in a case against a tech company.</p><p>Regardless of which way regulators want to take it, YouTube's blunders certainly don't help its parent company Google look any better under the lens of antitrust scrutiny.

But some analysts say YouTube may not have much incentive to take drastic measures to fix the problem, because the issues have failed to meaningfully affect the platform's advertisers and revenue. YouTube would likely only take sweeping action in a situation like 2017's Adpocalypse[2], when advertisers pulled their ads from the platform en masse and cost the platform an estimated $750 million[3], says Josh Cohen, cofounder of online video industry publication Tubefilter[4]. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[5]. These past few months have been nothing short of hellish and eventful for YouTube. The video-streaming platform has faced much scrutiny as it works to wade through a deluge of scandals, including concerns over child exploitation[6], the spreading of dangerous conspiracy theories[7], and the company's policies regarding the LGBTQ community[8]. But YouTube has been relatively conservative in its reaction to the most recent controversies. </p><p>The company's incentive to act with drastic changes is low, analysts told Business Insider. Actions that YouTube has taken have been incremental and reactionary: the website took down white supremacist videos[9] already on the site, although hate speech and hateful content has flourished for long enough to radicalize users[10]. YouTube also declined to punish a conservative YouTuber[11] who used racial and homophobic slurs to refer to a Vox journalist. Despite much criticism and demand from creators, users, and even Google employees to do something, YouTube's most important clients have stayed relatively quiet: advertisers. With more than $3 billion in revenue[12] each year just from ads on its platform, YouTube's cost-benefit formula is simple, analysts say: As long as advertisers are still putting their ads on YouTube, there's little reason to make sweeping changes. \"Companies have to weigh the question, 'How much advertising will I lose if I remove this content from my platform?'\" Forrester analyst Renee Murphy told Business Insider. \"Users are the product, not the customer.\" YouTube has previously been forced to make major changes due to advertiser backlash. Back in 2017, hundreds of brands pulled their advertising from YouTube[13] after it was revealed their ads were appearing next to extremist videos[14]. Dubbed the \"YouTube Adpocalypse,\" the mass boycott cost YouTube's parent company, Google, an estimated $750 million[15]. YouTube responded with major changes[16]: It gave advertisers more say over the content their ads appear next to, and revamped YouTube's Partner Program[17] to exert more control over who and what can be monetized on the platform. The same pattern happened in February 2019, after a YouTuber helped expose[18] a \"soft-core pedophile ring\" found on the video-sharing platform. After brands like Disney, Nestl, and Fortnite-owner Epic Games removed their ads[19], YouTube announced it would now disable comments[20] on most videos featuring kids. But in more recent months as further issues and concerns over the policing of its platform have arisen, there hasn't been any exodus of YouTube's most important and biggest advertisers off the platform. YouTube has learned from its past incidents to be \"more quick to act and forthright in their communication,\" says Josh Cohen, cofounder of online video industry publication Tubefilter[21]. \"From the advertiser perspective, YouTube has achieved all of its goals,\" Cohen told Business Insider. \"None of this is ideal, but I don't think it's having a massive effect on YouTube's business.\" Google, which owns YouTube, did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Although advertisers have yet to pick up and move their business away from YouTube to the extent of what we saw in 2017, we could see a larger shift away from the platform in the next two years for brands that run advertisements next to children's content. A recent PwC report predicts[22] that by 2021, children's advertisers could abandon YouTube, which is currently under investigation for violating[23] children's privacy laws, in favor of video platforms that are compliant to stricter upcoming digital privacy laws[24].NOW WATCH: Watch Apple's 2019 WWDC event in 11 minutes[25]See Also: Facebook, Google, and Apple are going on the defense as

Google says Amazon won't carry its Chromecast and GoogleHome services and won't make Prime Video available for GoogleCast users.</p><p>It also says Amazon last month stopped selling some of the products offered by Nest, another part of the Google, sorry, Alphabet empire (Alphabet is now the official name of theholding company at the top although everyone still calls it Google).</p><p>There is a back story: Both companies are desperately trying to win the battle to dominate the market for voice activated devices, which some expect will become the next big thing.</p><p>Amazon has a handy lead at the moment, but the battle is a long way from being won. I only need to listen to mywife's furious telling off of Alexa when she's trying to get something she wants played on her Echo to know that. For the record, almost the onlyuse I make of voice activated services is in askingApple's Siri silly questions to make the kids laugh (you should try it, it's a hoot).</p><p>Anyway, Amazon describes Google's move as a \"disappointing precedent\" while insisting it hopes to resolve the issue. Googlebemoans a lack of reciprocity from Amazon. But it also says it wants to be buds again.</p><p>This might involve big business, big tech, and big money, but parents with more than one child will be very familiar with what is at the core of thetwo statements:</p><p>Nyah, nyah. He said, she said. MUM!</p><p>It's wearisome, and tends to drives parents to distraction at the end of a long day, just as this bought of corporate pettiness will drive users of the affected services to distraction.</p><p>So how on earth does this work for the consumer, I hear you ask.They would seem to be the big losers here, because theirdeviceswill no longer offer a full range of services.</p><p>Let's return to our squabbling children. Eventually the parent has no choice but to intervene, usually byseparating the warring siblings before negotiating peace between them. Sometimes, if the squabble is serious enough, this is accomplished alongside the imposition of some type of penalty.</p><p>There are no parents to stop our pair of technological titans from bickering. But if they prove unwilling, or unable, to solve their own disputes (to be fair Amazon and Apple kissed and made up after a similar spat a while back) what you will be left with is a market failure.</p><p>When that happens someone, i.e. a regulator, will have to step in and sort it out, perhaps alongside the imposition of a financial penalty.</p><p>We, as consumers, would likely benefit from that in the long run.

Even though financial analysts on Wall Street think YouTube makes about as much money as the Gap, General Mills or Netflix, the video service's financial results are a secret. They are lumped in with the rest of Google, an even larger internet company that last year generated $137 billion in revenue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That secrecy has led to growing frustration among analysts and investors, who will be looking for more details about YouTube when Google's parent company, Alphabet, reports results for its second financial quarter on Thursday. Three months ago, Alphabet executives pointed to issues with YouTube as a factor in disappointing financial results in the first quarter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I think their reticence to provide information borders on paranoia, as if they would be admitting failure if they allowed us to discover whether one of their businesses was performing more poorly than expected,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.</p><p>Big tech companies have been under pressure from regulators and lawmakers to provide more insight into how their businesses operate. The lack of disclosure around YouTube's finances is a reminder that some of them have actually made understanding how they make money more difficult over the last year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[The Justice Department will open </emphasis>an antitrust review of big tech companies<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.]</emphasis></p><p>In November, Apple announced it would stop disclosing iPhone sales figures. The company had been providing that data for a decade. But now that iPhone sales are slowing, Apple argues that they are no longer representative of the strength of the company's overall business.</p><p>In July, when Facebook reported slower than expected growth in users for its main service, the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, disclosed a new, more positive metric: 2.5 billion people used at least one of the company's apps - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger - in June.</p><p>The obfuscation of information that investors want more of has become a \"foundational practice\" by tech companies, said Gene Munster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm, who was a financial analyst for 20 years. \"Companies change the disclosures to change the narrative and make it more difficult to get to the things investors want to know.\"</p><p>When it reports financial results, Alphabet groups YouTube with other Google properties like search, the Google Play app store and Gmail. Analysts who follow the company say putting everything under Google makes it hard to parse out the performance of YouTube, especially because search remains the biggest business at the company.</p><p>YouTube does not disclose revenue, profitability, how many ads it runs alongside videos, user numbers and how often those users visit the site - all metrics that would help an investor \"understand the health of the business and its growth trajectory,\" said Mr. Pachter.</p><p>\"I don't think the company provides anything that helps us understand the business,\" he said.</p><p>More details around YouTube's business may confirm that it does not compare favorably to Facebook in key metrics for gauging its popularity, such as how long users stay on the site and how frequently they visit, Mr. Pachter said.</p><p>An Alphabet spokeswoman, Winnie King, declined to comment for the story.</p><p>When Alphabet last reported quarterly earnings in April, the company stunned investors as revenue came in $1 billion below Wall Street expectations.</p><p>In response to a question from a financial analyst about the company's first-quarter shortfall, Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, said growth in clicks for YouTube ads had \"decelerated\" because of tighter restrictions in early 2018 on what videos could carry advertising. Ms. Porat said YouTube had made \"important\" and \"strong\" contributions to revenue, but was not more specific.</p><p>When Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, spoke about YouTube in the call, he announced new features or policy changes that for the most part had already announced. The new information he did reveal - such as viewership of Super Bowl commercials was up 60 percent on YouTube - was a narrow sliver of YouTube's business.</p><p>Companies in the United States have significant leeway in determining what information is considered \"material\" and has to be disclosed in financial results reported to regulators.</p><p>In 1976, the Supreme Court in TSC Industries v. Northway established the definition of material as information that would have been considered important to a reasonable investor. The definition, however, was vague, and companies have generally been allowed to make their own decisions about what would be important to a reasonable investor.</p><p>When big tech companies have offered more insight into their far-flung operations, it has been well received by Wall Street.</p><p>When Amazon disclosed revenue and profit for its high-margin Amazon Web Services unit in 2015, it eased concerns about the company's ability to turn a profit.</p><p>Last year, Google surprised analysts on an earnings call by announcing that its Google Cloud business had surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue. At the time, Google had been fighting the perception that its cloud business was struggling to make inroads against A.W.S. and Microsoft's cloud-computing competitor, Azure.</p><p>\"Companies usually pull back disclosure when items turned negative, and then they try to offset with more positive disclosure,\" said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who follows Alphabet and other internet companies.</p><p>He said he did not expect Alphabet to change its disclosure for YouTube anytime soon. But Mr. Mahaney said - frustration aside - that he did not believe more detail about YouTube's business would alter investors' perception of Alphabet.</p><p>Investors generally see YouTube accounting for about 20 percent of Google's revenue. There are more questions around YouTube's profitability, but he said the general view was that it was \"modestly profitable but not dramatically so.\"</p><p>Starting in July 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission sent three letters to Alphabet asking, among other things, for an explanation on why it does not need to break out YouTube from Google.</p><p>In its response, Alphabet said that since Larry Page, its chief executive, did not receive weekly updates on how YouTube's business performed to assess the performance of Google, the disclosure requirement was \"not applicable.\"</p><p>Alphabet also said detailing its advertising revenue by different product areas was unnecessary because its goal was to sell one product - online advertising - regardless of how a customer paid for it or where that ad appeared.</p><p>In January 2018, the S.E.C. said it completed its review with no further action.</p><p>Marcia Narine Weldon, a lecturer in law at the University of Miami who specializes in compliance and corporate governance, said the arguments made by Alphabet to the S.E.C. for not disclosing YouTube separately \"don't hold water.\"</p><p>\"I'm surprised that the S.E.C. hasn't pressed it more,\" said Ms. Narine Weldon. \"It's a legitimate question for shareholders given the size of the business.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006625321</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN1-1NY1-JC85-N542-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1236\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001S0I</classCode><className>GENERAL MILLS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
