Under her bill, filings with securities regulators would describe risks to the company from policies that would force steep emissions cuts consistent with holding global temperature rise to 1.5C. Why it matters: The campaign argues that this would lead to so-called stranded oil and natural gas reserves that would create big financial liabilities for energy companies.Yes, but: The idea of stranded assets is controversial and beyond the scope of this blurb. </p><p>And achieving emissions cuts consistent with 1.5C is looking quite unlikely. But those huge caveats aside, the campaign argues that this risk would push companies to break apart. What they're saying: \"If oil companies are required to disclose this information to investors, there will be enormous investor pressure on these companies to break up so that the non-fossil fuel parts of these companies would not be taken down by likely losses in the fossil fuel parts,\" Warren's campaign said.The state of play: Warren touched on this goal in passing during Tuesday's Democratic debate when she was asked about her goal of breaking up tech giants. \"We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating, Big Tech, Big Pharma, Big Oil, all of them,\" said Warren. The bottom line: Warren is now the co-frontrunner with Joe Biden. It's another sign of the aggressive posture Warren has staked out.Go deeper: Elizabeth Warren wants a climate-friendly SEC[2] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.axios.com/click/18346460.38747/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29uZ3Jlc3MuZ292L2JpbGwvMTE2dGgtY29uZ3Jlc3Mvc2VuYXRlLWJpbGwvMjA3NS90ZXh0P3I9MTUmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NnZW5lcmF0ZSZzdHJlYW09dG9w/5c90f2c505e94e65b176e000B86b3970c\">https://link.axios.com/click/18346460.38747/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29uZ3Jlc3MuZ292L2JpbGwvMTE2dGgtY29uZ3Jlc3Mvc2VuYXRlLWJpbGwvMjA3NS90ZXh0P3I9MTUmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NnZW5lcmF0ZSZzdHJlYW09dG9w/5c90f2c505e94e65b176e000B86b3970c</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://link.axios.com/click/18346460.38747/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXhpb3MuY29tL2VsaXphYmV0aC13YXJyZW4tY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2Utc2VjLWRpc2Nsb3N1cmVzLTQzZTc3MjJkLTFkNTQtNDY2ZC04ZWRiLTdjNmYwNjdiNDU0Yy5odG1sP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1uZXdzbGV0dGVyX2F4aW9zZ2VuZXJhdGUmc3RyZWFtPXRvcA/5c90f2c505e94e65b176e000Baafd415f\">https://link.axios.com/click/18346460.38747/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXhpb3MuY29tL2VsaXphYmV0aC13YXJyZW4tY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2Utc2VjLWRpc2Nsb3N1cmVzLTQzZTc3MjJkLTFkNTQtNDY2ZC04ZWRiLTdjNmYwNjdiNDU0Yy5odG1sP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1uZXdzbGV0dGVyX2F4aW9zZ2VuZXJhdGUmc3RyZWFtPXRvcA/5c90f2c505e94e65b176e000Baafd415f</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO100095441571237140098251765300170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8Y-0K91-JCMN-Y2CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"411\"/><timeReceived>2:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>energy</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Senator Warren announced the proposal in a campaign email on Friday in an email with the subject line, \"It's time to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook.\" Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced a regulatory plan[2] that would propose breaking up American tech giants such as Facebook, Amazon[3], and Google on Friday. </p><p>\"America's biggest tech companies are controlling more and more of our digital lives,\" Senator Warren wrote in a campaign email announcing the plan under the subject line, \"It's time to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook.\" The plan was first reported by The New York Times.[4] Under her proposal, some acquisitions made by these tech firms in recent years would be rolled back. This would include Facebook's $19 billion WhatsApp and $1 billion Instagram deals, Google's acquisition of navigation app Waze and ad platform DoubleClick, and Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods and online shoe and clothing retailer Zappos, Senator Warren wrote in a Medium post[5] detailing the plan. The proposal would also require that dual entities such as Amazon Marketplace and Amazon Basics be split apart, and tech firms would be prohibited from sharing or transferring user data with third parties. Senator Warren is proposing passing legislation that would categorize large tech firms with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more that also operate online marketplaces as \"Platform Utilities.\" These \"Platform Utilities\" would not be able to own both the platform utility and any participants on that platform, and they would be required to meet a \"standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users.\" Smaller companies with an annual global revenue of between $90 million and $25 billion wouldn't be required to separate from any participant on the platform, but would still be required to uphold a \"standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealings with users.\" \"Here's why tech companies with nearly unfettered power aren't a good thing,\" Senator Warren wrote. \"They buy potential rivals, like Facebook did with Instagram and WhatsApp, limiting innovation and choice. They create marketplaces that they own and compete on \u2014 a conflict of interest that lets them snuff out smaller rivals \u2014 like Amazon and Google have done for shopping, search tools, and online ads.\"Calls for regulating big tech have increased over the past yearThe push for the regulation of big tech firms like Facebook, Amazon, and Google has been brewing in Congress for quite some time. Last year, for example, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) proposed a plan[6] for regulation tech firms that included taking steps such as implementing privacy protection rules similar to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and labeling bot accounts. Advocacy groups have also called for the government to intervene in how Facebook operates. In a letter[7] to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sent in January, organizations such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center, Color of Change, and Government Accountability Project among others urged the commission to impose fines on the social giant and unwind its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram. The proposal comes after Facebook in particular has come under increased scrutiny when it comes to its data privacy practices. In explosive reports from The New York Times[8] and The Guardian[9] last March, it was revealed that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to the data of tens of millions of Facebook accounts. The social giant also revealed[10] to Congress last summer that it had special arrangements with dozens of companies that provided access to friends' data even after it had said it was cutting off such access, furthering concerns about how Facebook handles user data. Facebook has come under fire overseas as well. Just last month, British lawmakers accused the tech firm[11] of behaving like 'digital gangsters' in a report on the spread of misinformation published by the British Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Committee. Facebook has indicated in the past that it would be open to regulatory plans. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last April [12]that federal regulation of Facebook and big tech companies is \"inevitable\" when speaking to members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg also said the company would be \"open to regulation\"[13] following the Cambridge Analytica revelations. The announcement also comes as Senator Warren is planning to hold an event on Friday in Long Island City, the same neighborhood where Amazon had planned to build a second headquarters before it scrapped plans to do so[14] last month. Here's the full email from Senator Warren announcing the plan: Think about all the time you spend on the internet \u2014 checking the news, shopping, catching up with old friends, reading emails like this one. Well, more and more of the things we do online are being controlled by a smaller and smaller group of giant corporations. They've mastered a very powerful business model: Monopolize their platform and force other companies, media platforms, and publishers out of business. If you buy something online, there's a nearly 50% chance that you're going through Amazon. If you go to any website, there's more than a 70% chance that it's owned or run by Google or Facebook. America's biggest tech companies are controlling more and more of our digital lives. Here's why tech companies with nearly unfettered power aren't a good thing: They buy potential rivals, like Facebook did with Instagram and WhatsApp, limiting innovation and choice. They create marketplaces that they own and compete on \u2014 a conflict of interest that lets them snuff out smaller rivals \u2014 like Amazon and Google have done for shopping, search tools, and online ads. They bully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts \u2014 and spend the profits they get from being the only game in town to lobby and rig the rules even further in their favor. They even scare investors away from funding new startups \u2014 because what's the use in going up against a giant corporation that'll just snap you up or drive you out of business? This all means less competition, less innovation, and a worse internet for all of us. Think about it: If you're not happy with Facebook's privacy policy, maybe you'd like to spend your time on Instagram instead. Except, wait: Facebook owns Instagram. We've got to call it out. And we've got to do something about it. So today, I'm proposing a new plan to break up the biggest tech companies and make sure these corporations don't get so powerful that they undermine our democracy. Add your name if you agree: It's time to break up our biggest tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook. There's a long history in America of breaking up companies if they have too much power in the marketplace: Standard Oil, AT...and the railroad industry led to the bipartisan creation of our first antitrust laws. What I'm proposing is right in line with our country's history \u2014 and it's a big part of what has allowed our economy to grow and new companies to thrive. Here's how our plan works, Bill \u2014 there are two big pieces to it. #1: Pass a new law for \"Platform Neutrality.\" If you're a ginormous tech company that's created a platform for other businesses to compete on \u2014 like the Amazon marketplace, or the Google ad exchange \u2014 you shouldn't also own a company that sells on it. Put simply: You shouldn't be able to tilt the playing field in your own direction. #2 Appoint regulators who'll use existing legal tools to unwind tech mergers that illegally undermine competition. With the antitrust laws that are already on the books, we can undo big mergers that never should have been approved in the first place \u2014 and give smaller and medium-sized companies a fighting chance to compete with the big guys. That means we break Facebook away from Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon away from Whole Foods, Google away from Nest, and more. We could be doing this right now \u2014 but we need a president (ahem) who'll appoint regulators to make it happen. So what would the internet look like after all these reforms? Here's what won't change: You'll still be able to go on Google and search like you do today. You'll still be able to go on Amazon and find 30 different coffee machines that you can get delivered to your house in two days. You'll still be able to go on Facebook and see how your old friend from school is doing. Here's what will change: Small businesses would have a fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business. Google couldn't smother competitors by demoting their products on Google Search. Facebook would face real pressure from Instagram and WhatsApp to improve their user experience and protect our privacy. Tech entrepreneurs would have a fighting chance to compete against the tech giants. This is how we'll make sure we get more competition and more new ideas in the tech economy, instead of just a few giant tech companies calling all the shots \u2014 and regular people not having much say in the tools we use everyday. That's how we get innovation. That's how we get an internet that does a better and better job of letting us stay connected with each other \u2014 from pictures of grandkids to emails and petitions like this one. That's how we protect our privacy in a rapidly changing world. We can get this done, Bill. We can make big, structural change. But it's going to take a grassroots movement, and it starts right now.

I want one that works for our families,' Warren recently said to a cheering crowd of more than 15,000 supporters at a rally in Seattle, Washington.A September IBD/TIPP survey of Democrats and independents showed the Massachusetts senator with 24% backing, a close second place to the Democratic front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden at 28%.

Embed\" /&gt;CopyWATCH: Elizabeth Warren's Progressive Agenda Could Cast Long Shadow on 2020 Election Shaping 2020 electionEven if Warren ultimately fails to get her party's presidential nod, her detailed economic proposals could shape the 2020 election. Together, they constitute a progressive blueprint for sweeping change in America that challenges other candidates to endorse her agenda or counter it with what they would do instead.'It's certainly driving other candidates to have to produce more [policy proposals],' said John Halpin, a Democratic political analyst at the Center for American Progress.The effect of Warren's prodigious left-of-center prescriptions in the general election is harder to predict. </p><p>Some analysts say they could work in President Donald Trump's favor by alienating moderates wary of expansive and expensive government interventions in the economy.'When he says that the Democrats are socialists you can point to elements of Elizabeth Warren's agenda,' said Alex Conant, who worked on Senator's Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign and is now a media consultant with Firehouse Strategies. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.voanews.com/s3/files/styles/sourced/s3/ap-images/2019/09/d78110e3be0fe7c5a1fdf24d200409cc.jpg?itok=yUtAH_JeDemocratic\">https://www.voanews.com/s3/files/styles/sourced/s3/ap-images/2019/09/d78110e3be0fe7c5a1fdf24d200409cc.jpg?itok=yUtAH_JeDemocratic</url> presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., holds an Elizabeth Warren doll given to her at a campaign event, Sept. 2, 2019, in Hampton Falls, N.H. 'Economic Patriotism'Warren, first elected to the Senate in 2013, considers herself a capitalist intent on reforming what she sees as a corrupt system that unfairly favors the rich and powerful. Under former President Barack Obama, she both helped create and was the first head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which seeks to shield Americans from corporate abuses. Before that, she taught law at Harvard University, specializing in commerce and bankruptcy.Her 'Economic Patriotism' plan in some ways echoes President Trump's 'America First' rhetoric to protect jobs and industries in the U.S. However, unlike the president, who has mostly employed unilateral tariffs to help U.S. companies compete, and whose signature legislative achievement was a corporate tax cut to stimulate economic growth, Warren proposes increasing taxes on the rich, restricting corporate power and using government intervention to spur job creation and increase wages.Warren's proposals include: Taxing the ultra-rich and big corporations. Individuals and families earning between $50 million and $1 billion would pay an extra 2% in federal taxes that would increase to 3% for those making even more. Her campaign says this tax would bring in $2.75 trillion over 10 years. Corporations would also pay an additional 7% tax on profits above $100 million.Trade deals that focus on workers, transparency and human rights. Warren lists a number of trade pre-conditions including human and labor rights, and said any agreement must protect domestic industries. Warren has criticized Trump's tariffs as 'reckless' but has indicated she might impose similar measures as part of a 'coherent trade policy.'Breaking up big tech companies. Warren justifies the need to increase competition and innovation in this field by noting that nearly half of all e-commerce in the U.S. goes through Amazon and more than 70% of all Internet traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Google or Facebook.Creating a new Department of Economic Development focused on jobs that would consolidate business-oriented federal government agencies. The new department would closely regulate U.S. corporations and greatly expand federal training programs. It would also boost research and development spending to help American workers and U.S. technology compete in the global marketplace.Requiring corporations to obtain a federal charter legally obligating the companies to serve the greater public interest, rather than chase short-term profits.Mandating corporations give workers representation on boards of stakeholders, and mandating that 75% of stakeholders approve all political contributions.Requiring the U.S. government to buy American-made products whenever possible, to use billions of dollars in federal spending to develop domestic industries.Devaluing the U.S. dollar to in increase U.S. exports. Warren also supports the 'Medicare For All' plan, first proposed by rival Democratic candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, that would provide government funded health care to all Americans, and a plan to make public colleges free.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-04/58FA810C-F087-4BAF-B787-3A3E6213AF8B.jpg?itok=9eFzL9xAFILE\">https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/styles/sourced/s3/2019-04/58FA810C-F087-4BAF-B787-3A3E6213AF8B.jpg?itok=9eFzL9xAFILE</url> - U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) hold a news conference for their proposed Green New Deal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in 10 years, at the Capitol in Washington, Feb. 7, 2019. In addition, she has endorsed the Green New Deal to end U.S. dependency on fossil fuels, which was introduced by New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive firebrand. In addition, Warren has proposed investing $2 trillion in federal funding to develop renewable energy programs. She also would direct the U.S. military, the single largest government consumer of energy, to reduce carbon emissions.German modelAlthough Warren describes herself as a capitalist, Republican critics have tried to portray her as a socialist whose costly, interventionist polices would stifle economic growth, innovation and end up hurting workers by reducing the number of jobs.Progressive supporters commend her detailed plans to regulate capitalism and free markets to benefit workers, whose wages have lagged far behind soaring corporate profits.Parts of Warren's industrial and trade policies are based on Germany's business-government collaboration model that has protected manufacturing jobs while expanding trade to low wage countries like China.Jeromin Zettelmeyer, a former economic policy director for the government of Germany, unfavorably compared Warren's proposed industrial policies to Germany's experience. Now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, he called Warren's plans to increase worker training and development a move in the 'right direction.'However, in a recent article for the non-partisan think tank website, Zettelmeyer said 'she's wrong' to suggest Germany's trade surplus was the result of government policy and not market forces such as Chinese demand for high quality German products.Election divideIf she becomes the Democratic nominee, Warren is betting that her detailed plans to tax the rich and help the poor and middle class will resonate with traditional Democratic constituencies and win back working class voters in manufacturing states who voted for Trump in 2016.'Warren's pretty clear that she's fighting for working people of all races, the middle class and against plutocrats and corrupt politicians,' Halpin said.At the same time, Warren's embrace of sweeping government economic intervention and higher taxes could alienate free market-minded voters, including many who are weary of Trump's style of governance and divisive messaging.'There's a lot of Republicans that held their noses and voted for Trump in 2016 and will probably do it again in 2020, if somebody like Elizabeth Warren is the Democratic nominee,' former Republican strategist Conant said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121567688838798251761300017</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X05-SV81-JB5Y-N3SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1375\"/><timeReceived>1:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Public Contracts Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDA5QTlFMDVCQUY0NEY0NUE1QzMyQzA1QkQyQzJGRUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Domestic Procurement Preferences</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzQwRDRFMTMyRTQ4NDZDRTg3NjhDMzI3RDg3OTkwMjg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDk3MDVERUE0RjQ1NDcyNjhCRURCMEY5REYyM0RFRTM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Authorities &amp;

Warren has criticized Trump's tariffs as \"reckless\" but has indicated she might impose similar measures as part of a \"coherent trade policy.\"</p><p>Breaking up big tech companies. Warren justifies the need to increase competition and innovation in this field by noting that nearly half of all e-commerce in the U.S. goes through Amazon and more than 70% of all Internet traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Google or Facebook.</p><p>Creating a new Department of Economic Development focused on jobs that would consolidate business-oriented federal government agencies. The new department would closely regulate U.S. corporations and greatly expand federal training programs. It would also boost research and development spending to help American workers and U.S. technology compete in the global marketplace.</p><p>Requiring corporations to obtain a federal charter legally obligating the companies to serve the greater public interest, rather than chase short-term profits.</p><p>Mandating corporations give workers representation on boards of stakeholders, and mandating that 75% of stakeholders approve all political contributions.</p><p>Requiring the U.S. government to buy American-made products whenever possible, to use billions of dollars in federal spending to develop domestic industries.</p><p>Devaluing the U.S. dollar to in increase U.S. exports.</p><p>Warren also supports the \"Medicare For All\" plan, first proposed by rival Democratic candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, that would provide government funded health care to all Americans, and a plan to make public colleges free.</p><p>In addition, she has endorsed the Green New Deal to end U.S. dependency on fossil fuels, which was introduced by New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive firebrand. In addition, Warren has proposed investing $2 trillion in federal funding to develop renewable energy programs. She also would direct the U.S. military, the single largest government consumer of energy, to reduce carbon emissions.</p><p>German model</p><p>Although Warren describes herself as a capitalist, Republican critics have tried to portray her as a socialist whose costly, interventionist polices would stifle economic growth, innovation and end up hurting workers by reducing the number of jobs.</p><p>Progressive supporters commend her detailed plans to regulate capitalism and free markets to benefit workers, whose wages have lagged far behind soaring corporate profits.</p><p>Parts of Warren's industrial and trade policies are based on Germany's business-government collaboration model that has protected manufacturing jobs while expanding trade to low wage countries like China.</p><p>Jeromin Zettelmeyer, a former economic policy director for the government of Germany, unfavorably compared Warren's proposed industrial policies to Germany's experience. Now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, he called Warren's plans to increase worker training and development a move in the \"right direction.\"</p><p>However, in a recent article for the non-partisan think tank website, Zettelmeyer said \"she's wrong\" to suggest Germany's trade surplus was the result of government policy and not market forces such as Chinese demand for high quality German products.</p><p>Election divide</p><p>If she becomes the Democratic nominee, Warren is betting that her detailed plans to tax the rich and help the poor and middle class will resonate with traditional Democratic constituencies and win back working class voters in manufacturing states who voted for Trump in 2016.</p><p>\"Warren's pretty clear that she's fighting for working people of all races, the middle class and against plutocrats and corrupt politicians,\" Halpin said.</p><p>At the same time, Warren's embrace of sweeping government economic intervention and higher taxes could alienate free market-minded voters, including many who are weary of Trump's style of governance and divisive messaging.</p><p>\"There's a lot of Republicans that held their noses and voted for Trump in 2016 and will probably do it again in 2020, if somebody like Elizabeth Warren is the Democratic nominee,\" former Republican strategist Conant said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-VAV9059B9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X05-Y5T1-JCCP-051M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468347</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1238\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Voice of America News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 5, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Country &amp;

Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate, proposed on Friday a plan to break up[1] big tech companies like Amazon[2], Facebook[3], and Alphabet[4]'s Google. The plan doesn't appear to immediately threaten Amazon, said Eric Sheridan, an analyst at UBS, who spoke with Markets Insider on Friday. Still, regulation is the top concern he discusses with investors, as far as challenges facing large-cap tech names. </p><p>Watch Amazon trade in real-time[5].Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and 2020 presidential contender, announced on Friday a plan to break up[6] big tech companies she argues have grown too big. \"Today's big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" Warren wrote[7] before the stock market opened. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\" Warren's plan named Amazon[8], Facebook[9], and Alphabet[10]'s Google, and would force the rollback of some of their acquisitions, like Facebook's WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's Whole Foods, and Google's Waze. Amazon[11] shares \u2014 which in recent weeks have been engulfed[12] in a flurry of announcements and political controversy[13] \u2014 opened lower Friday morning, but finished little changed as the broader stock market recouped the majority of its early losses. At the moment, Warren's plan still has a lot of unknowns \u2014 like which federal agency would see to the proposal, said Eric Sheridan, an analyst at UBS who has a \"buy\" investment rating on the stock. And while regulation is the \"number one topic\" Sheridan discusses with investors as far as mega-cap tech headwinds go, he thinks Amazon is not under threat, at least in the near-term. Read more: Elizabeth Warren says she wants to break up big tech companies, including Amazon, Google, and Facebook[14] \"I would expect \u2014 and I'll try to make this as least a political statement as possible \u2014I would expect, given the stance the Democratic party might try to take into the election of being more progressive and left-leaning, that I'm sure there will be plenty of press releases and shots taken at big tech in the next year, year and a half,\" Sheridan told Markets Insider on Friday. \"It's a fairly easy mechanism to score political points. Whether it ever turns into something that's reality, we'll continue to factor.\" He added: \"I think we're a long way from that going from noise, and a political issue, to reality.\" In a report Sheridan wrote in November 2017, he and his colleagues came to the conclusion around the state of large-cap Internet regulation that investors were heading into a \"multi-year wave that would act as a headwind for the group.\" The proposal may be subject to legal obstacles, Sheridan said, as the deals that Warren is taking aim at have already been approved by US regulators. There's not a lot of precedent for going back and revisiting prior approved mergers, and then breaking them apart, \"but we'll have to monitor it,\" he said. \"If you look at why I think some of the companies have underperformed for certain periods of time in the last year and a half \u2014 we have a neutral rating on Facebook \u2014 we think some of these issues do factor into stock prices, and multiple compression, and things like that,\" Sheridan said, referring to data and privacy issues. \"There's no doubt that when GDPR was implemented[15], or the Cambridge Analytica scandal[16], that those had a headwind impact on the stocks.\" Read more related coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider: Amazon took over the $176 billion market for cloud computing.

There's not a lot of precedent for going back and revisiting prior approved mergers, and then breaking them apart, \"but we'll have to monitor it,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"If you look at why I think some of the companies have underperformed for certain periods of time in the last year and a half - we have a neutral rating on Facebook - we think some of these issues do factor into stock prices, and multiple compression, and things like that,\" Sheridan said, referring to data and privacy issues.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's no doubt that when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/marketers-are-still-getting-nightmares-about-gdpr-europe-consumer-privacy-law-2018-10?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">GDPR was implemented</url>, or the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-suspends-cambridge-analytica-strategic-communication-laboratories-2018-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">Cambridge Analytica scandal</url>, that those had a headwind impact on the stocks.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read more related coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Amazon took over the $176 billion market for cloud computing.

Impeachment involves the House of Representatives exercising a responsibility clearly bestowed on it with broad latitude by the U.S. Constitution, to punish an act by President Donald Trump that was foolish and improper, but also squarely within his constitutional powers.</p><p> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi likes to say Trump violated the Constitution on his call with the Ukrainian president, but there\u2019s no serious argument for this. The conduct of foreign policy \u2014 and horse-trading with foreign leaders \u2014 is a core presidential duty.</p><p> The problem was mingling personal political priorities with actions in his official capacity, a symptom of one of the worst aspects of Trump\u2019s presidency, namely his inability or unwillingness to distinguish between himself and his office. Trump doesn\u2019t think institutionally or constitutionally.</p><p> In contrast to his carelessness and highly personalized view of the presidency, Warren offers a carefully thought-out agenda of open contempt for legal and constitutional boundaries. It\u2019s not that she, a former Harvard Law professor, doesn\u2019t know that they exist; it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t care.</p><p> Her broad approach is if she doesn\u2019t like something about America, she\u2019ll act as president to ban it or curtail it, whether she has the legal or constitutional authority or not. This isn\u2019t a trait personal to her. Instead, it is inherent to progressive government, which from its beginnings in the early 20th century strained against constitutional limits it considered antiquated and unnecessary.</p><p> One of Warren\u2019s signature domestic proposals is her wealth tax. Without dwelling on the complex legal arguments, her plan is constitutionally dubious, at best, and would instantly end up in the Supreme Court if it ever passed.</p><p> Someone scrupulously committed to the Constitution would want to steer clear on this basis alone, but \u201cconstitutionally or legally suspect\u201d is the unifying thread of much of the Warren agenda.</p><p> As conservative writer David French points out, her proposed executive order prohibiting fracking obviously runs afoul of a 2005 federal law protecting it from federal regulation. She is promising to do something illegal, pure and simple.</p><p> And on it goes. She says she would act unilaterally to expand background checks for gun purchases, circumventing Congress. She wants to tax lobbying, an activity protected under the First Amendment, in yet another constitutionally fraught initiative. She wants to break up Big Tech, although it\u2019s not clear under what authority.</p><p> Tellingly, almost no one on her side says, \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re getting at, Liz, but you can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p> To their credit, a couple of CNN panelists pressed her in July on the constitutional basis of her wealth tax, and she just waved them off. Needless to say, the op-ed pages and airwaves weren\u2019t thick with denunciations of her casual dismissal of the Constitution.</p><p> This gets to a marked, and annoying, hypocrisy in the reaction to Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. The same people who are most convinced that it is somehow unconstitutional or illegal didn\u2019t raise a peep when President Barack Obama rewrote immigration law on his own after repeatedly, and correctly, saying he didn\u2019t have the power to do it.</p><p> To be sure, the reliable, consistent constituency for strictly bounded executive action is vanishingly small. It amounts to about a dozen senators, those Republicans brave enough to oppose Trump\u2019s emergency declaration to repurpose military funding for the border wall, the most problematic of his executive actions.</p><p> All you need to know about how seriously most of the left takes the Constitution is that at the same time it\u2019s freaking out about Trump, it\u2019s boosting the prospects of Elizabeth Warren, who is promising to ignore it as a matter of policy.</p><p> Rich Lowry is on Twitter: @RichLowry</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIN-176880250C834623</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289BD343493CBF NWBKIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X82-DCX1-DXVP-V2YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401917</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Bluffton News-Banner<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Impeachment involves the House of Representatives exercising a responsibility clearly bestowed on it with broad latitude by the U.S. Constitution, to punish an act by President Donald Trump that was foolish and improper, but also squarely within his constitutional powers. </p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi likes to say Trump violated the Constitution on his call with the Ukrainian president pushing for a Biden-related investigation, but there's no serious argument for this. The conduct of foreign policy - and the inevitable cajoling of and horse-trading with foreign leaders - is a core presidential duty. </p><p>The problem was mingling personal political priorities with actions in his official capacity, a symptom of one of the worst aspects of Trump's presidency, namely his inability or willingness to distinguish between himself and his office. Trump doesn't think institutionally or constitutionally, making it a historic irony that he's appointed a phalanx of judges who will attempt to faithfully interpret the Constitution and protect the institutional prerogatives of the different branches for decades to come. </p><p>In contrast to Trump's carelessness and highly personalized view of the presidency, Warren offers a carefully thought-out agenda of open contempt for legal and constitutional boundaries. It's not that she, a former Harvard Law professor, doesn't know that they exist; it's that she doesn't care. </p><p>Her broad approach is if she doesn't like something about America, she'll act as president to ban it or curtail it, whether she has the legal or constitutional authority or not. This isn't a trait personal to her. Instead, it is inherent to progressive government, which from its beginnings in the early 20th century strained against constitutional limits it considered antiquated and unnecessary. </p><p>The philosophical and political line from Woodrow Wilson - the foundational progressive political leader and thinker who scorned what he considered the inefficiency of our traditional constitutional system - to Warren is direct and unbroken. </p><p>One of Warren's signature domestic proposals is her wealth tax of 2 percent annually on household net worth of $50 million to $1 billion and 3 percent on net worth above $1 billion. Without dwelling on the complex legal arguments, the Warren plan is constitutionally dubious, at best, and would instantly end up in the Supreme Court if it ever passed. </p><p>Someone scrupulously committed to the Constitution would want to steer clear on this basis alone, but \"constitutionally or legal suspect\" is the unifying thread of much of the Warren agenda. </p><p>As conservative writer David French points out, her proposed executive order prohibiting fracking obviously runs afoul of a 2005 federal law protecting it from federal regulation. She is promising to do something illegal, pure and simple. </p><p>And on it goes. She says she would act unilaterally to expand background checks for gun purchases, circumventing Congress. She wants to tax lobbying, an activity protected under the First Amendment, in yet another constitutionally fraught initiative. She wants to break up Big Tech, although it's not clear under what authority. </p><p>Tellingly, almost no one on her side says, \"I appreciate what you're getting at Liz, but you can't do that.\" </p><p>To their credit, a couple of CNN panelists pressed her in July on the constitutional basis of her wealth tax, and she just waved them off. Her answer came down to the assertion that if a majority supports the tax, it should pass muster. Needless to say, the op-ed pages and airwaves weren't thick with denunciations of her casual dismissal of the Constitution. </p><p>This gets to a marked, and annoying, hypocrisy in the reaction to Trump's Ukraine call.

She wants to break up Big Tech, although it\u2019s not clear under what authority.</p><p> Tellingly, almost no one on her side says, \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re getting at Liz, but you can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p> To their credit, a couple of CNN panelists pressed her in July on the constitutional basis of her wealth tax, and she just waved them off. Needless to say, the op-ed pages and airwaves weren\u2019t thick with denunciations of her casual dis-missal of the Constitution.</p><p> This gets to a marked, and annoying, hypocrisy in the reaction to Trump\u2019s Ukraine call. The same people who are most convinced that it is somehow unconstitutional or illegal didn\u2019t raise a peep when President Barack Obama rewrote immigration law on his own after repeatedly, and correctly, saying he didn\u2019t have the power to do it.</p><p> To be sure, the reliable, consistent constituency for strictly bounded executive action is vanishingly small. It amounts to about a dozen senators, those Republicans brave enough to oppose Trump\u2019s emergency declaration to repurpose military funding for the border wall, the most problematic of his executive actions.</p><p> All you need to know about how seriously most of the left takes the Constitution is that at the same time it\u2019s freaking out about Trump, it\u2019s boosting the prospects of Elizabeth Warren, who is promising to ignore it as a matter of policy.</p><p> Contact Rich Lowry on Twitter @RichLowry.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNM-17692B58D7621C94</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898CFAB3BBD4A NWBKNM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8G-B5Y1-JBCN-4331-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409154</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Gallup Independent.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Only a few hours later, she arrived in Long Island City in New York City to pitch her proposal to a community that recently felt threatened by one of those companies.</p><p> Hello, Long Island City,  Warren shouted to the crowd.  I understand that you ve had a visitor. </p><p>Amazon came. Amazon left,  she continued.  That is the problem in America today. We have these giant tech companies that think they rule the earth. </p><p>Over 1,000 people weathered the cold to hear Warren s proposal. She came out swinging at Amazon, and the crowd hollered and applauded as she called out the company for acting anti-competitively.</p><p> They think they can scoop up all of our personal data and sell it to whoever they want </p><p> She s one of the only politicians that has put out a policy that matches the scale of this consolidation of corporate power in the tech space,  one person in the crowd told me.</p><p>In her proposal, Warren says that, if elected, she would appoint regulators who would work to spin off former acquisitions by companies like Facebook and Google back into their own companies again. In the case of Facebook, that would mean forcing the company to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. In addition, she proposed legislation that would bar platforms that bring in more than $25 billion in revenue annually from acting as  participants  on their platform.</p><p>To many, the legislation appeared to be a direct jab at Amazon. If Warren s proposal is approved, Amazon wouldn t be allowed to sell its own goods on its website, solely third-party products.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren</p><p>@ewarren </p><p>6285:10 AM   Mar 9, 2019Twitter Ads info and privacy</p><h>Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma</h><p>Watch live as I discuss my new plan to #BreakUpBigTech.</p><p>pscp.tv 316 people are talking about this </p><p>Long Island City (LIC), situated in the Queens borough of New York City, was a symbolic choice of location for Warren s campaign event Friday night. Last year, Amazon courted dozens of cities across the country for the location of its second headquarters searching for the sweetest set of incentives from local officials. In November, Amazon announced that it would be slicing its new HQ in two, split between LIC and Northern Virginia. Virginia welcomed the company with little criticism, but shortly after the announcement, local New York City politicians and advocates rallied against the decision. A few months later, Amazon backed out.</p><p>Warren was introduced by two members of the New York legislature who pushed the hardest against Amazon, Sens. Mike Gianaris and Jimmy Van Bramer. Both were at the forefront in advocacy efforts to either renegotiate the deal or push Amazon out entirely, and supported Warren as she criticized the company s behavior.</p><p> [Big tech companies] think they can come to towns and states and bully everyone into doing what they want,  Warren said.  They think they can scoop up all of our personal data and sell it to whoever they want and for whatever purposes. They think they can run their business and just roll right over every small business, every entrepreneur, and every start-up that might threaten their position. And what does our government in Washington do? Nothing. </p><p>Over the past year, discussions on the state of US antitrust law have taken on new relevance. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are now beginning to rethink how regulators can combat anti-competitive behavior   especially when it comes to tech companies. Criticism of the companies has become commonplace in Congress, but no politician has been as explicit about the importance of breaking up giant tech corporations as Warren.</p><p> I want a government that isn t here to work for giant tech companies,  Warren said.  I want a government that s here to work for the people. </p><p>Tags: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Website:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/us-world/2019/3/8/18256908/amazon-facebook-instagram-elizabeth-warren-queens-lic-campaign-tech-antitrust-nyc\">https://www.theverge.com/us-world/2019/3/8/18256908/amazon-facebook-instagram-elizabeth-warren-queens-lic-campaign-tech-antitrust-nyc</url><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contact Information:</emphasis><br/>Makena Kelly<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tags:</emphasis><br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/artificial-intelligence-newswire/\">Artificial Intelligence Newswire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpicrowdnewswirecom20190311elizabethwarrentakesonamazonatlongislandcitycampaignevent</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM5-N371-JCTB-F3MX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><timeReceived>10:40 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Tuesday morning tore into Facebook following a report containing leaked audio from the company\u2019s top executive and founder.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed a question about Warren\u2019s plan to break up big tech companies during an internal Q&amp;A session and expressed concern about the prospect. According to the leaked audio, obtained by The Verge, the social-media titan said: \u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.\u201d</p><p>Zuckerberg added, according to the audio: \u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d</p><p>Warren responded on Twitter by saying: \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d</p><p>In a subsequent Facebook post, Zuckerberg confirmed the authenticity of the audio: \u201cEven though it was meant to be internal rather than public, now that it\u2019s out there, you can check it out if you're interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I'm thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics.\u201d</p><p>At issue is a sweeping proposal Warren introduced in March to break up major tech companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. The plan from the Massachusetts Democrat entailed unwinding major mergers like Amazon\u2019s ownership of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook\u2019s ownership of WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google\u2019s ownership of Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick as well as requiring companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion and more to be designated as \u201cplatform utilities,\u201d subject to new regulations and restrictions.</p><p>The social-media giant specifically has become the target of ire among many Democratic presidential candidates, for its misuse of data and allowance for a Russian disinformation campaign on the platform during the 2016 presidential election.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2299617610</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5X-DKC1-JBHT-D3JC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"368\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 1, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The proposal entails appointing a bunch of regulators to undo mergers that her administration would deem anti-competitive. Warren\u2019s plan would classify any company that runs a marketplace and makes more than $25 billion a year as a \u201cplatform utility\u201d and prohibit them from selling their own products.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Considering the prevalent knee-jerk loathing of Big Tech and capitalism in general, it\u2019s likely to be a popular idea. Many conservatives, angered at social media platforms, will also find the notion of breaking up these companies agreeable. But there are number of good economic and idealistic reasons to oppose Warren\u2019s plan.</p><p> For starters, Warren\u2019s plan wouldn\u2019t only strip the incentive for big companies to invest in growth and innovation; it would inhibit small-business innovation, as well. It\u2019s true that Big Tech frequently swallows enterprises to eliminate competition. Yet many times smaller tech firms don\u2019t have access to capital that allows them to bring big ideas to fruition, or they simply can\u2019t take the risk. Big corporations can do both.</p><p> I look forward to the day that market forces, rather than meddling politicians with aversions to the profit motive, smash Apple for good. But does anyone believe a gaggle of technocratic political appointees are going to do a better job of allocating investments?</p><p> \u201cTwenty-five years ago,\u201d Warren writes, \u201cFacebook, Google, and Amazon didn\u2019t exist. Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. It\u2019s a great story \u2014 but also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.\u201d</p><p> The fact that Facebook, Google and Amazon didn\u2019t even exist 25 years ago tells us the exact opposite. It highlights how quickly innovative ideas can transform the marketplace in an era of relative deregulation. I\u2019d tell you to ask the executives at Woolworth\u2019s or Blockbuster \u2014 and soon AOL, MySpace and Sears \u2014 but there aren\u2019t any.</p><p>Apple or Amazon were early adapters of the market\u2019s new realities. Now, some of their businesses are forced to compete with other giants like Walmart or Samsung. This has been beneficial for consumers. Now, if Twitter and Facebook want to stay on top, they probably should stop antagonizing half of their marketplace. Then again, in 25 years, it\u2019s quite likely that a bunch of new platforms will overtake both, no matter what they do.</p><p> That hasn\u2019t stopped Warren from acting as if tech companies like Google are the new Standard Oil. \u201cI want a government that makes sure everybody \u2014 even the biggest and most powerful companies in America \u2014 plays by the rules,\u201d Warren claims. This misleading turn of phrase has become standard on the left, which often acts as if companies are breaking the law or using \u201cloopholes\u201d when they fail to adhere to imaginary regulations. Tech companies aren\u2019t breaking any rules by ignoring Warren\u2019s fictitious strictures. We already have a place to adjudicate the usefulness of mergers, and it\u2019s called the Justice Department. They already do a terrible job without any more help. And if the DOJ is susceptible to partisan pressure \u2014 Democrats are now arguing that Trump ordered it to block the Time Warner/AT&amp;T merger \u2014 surely a second regulatory body based on capricious progressive concepts of the common good would likewise be ripe for abuse.</p><p> A number of voters, regrettably, seem to believe that increasing regulatory oversight helps alleviate the destructive relationship between government and business. Yet, by giving politically motivated regulators expansive powers to dictate how and when companies can grow, Warren would not only imbue government with more power to pick winners and losers, she would further incentivize CEOs to placate government officials and politicians rather than do what\u2019s best for their companies and consumers. It would be a lot more productive if we left markets to compete and instead broke up government power.</p><p> \u201cCurious why I think FB has too much power?\u201d Warren recently asked on Twitter after Facebook took down some of her ads. \u201cLet\u2019s start with their ability to shut down a debate over whether FB has too much power. Thanks for restoring my posts. But I want a social media marketplace that isn\u2019t dominated by a single censor.\u201d</p><p> A person doesn\u2019t need to be exceptionally perceptive to notice that Warren\u2019s grievance regarding a \u201csingle censor\u201d shutting down debate on social media is weakened by the fact that she went to a competing social media platform to perpetuate the debate. Nor did it take much work to find out that virtually every major news site had thoroughly covered her plan to break up Big Tech.</p><p> Her own tweet debunks the notion that a sole social media site can dominate news coverage or a national debate. Taking Instagram away from Facebook would do nothing to induce the social media giant to embrace truly open debate. However, forcing a private entity to run ads that call for its own destruction is an unambiguous attack on free expression.</p><p> In the end, Facebook contends that they removed Warren\u2019s ads because they violated company rules against use of its corporate logo. \u201cIn the interest of allowing robust debate, we are restoring the ads,\u201d the company explained. That makes the tech giant a far more robust space for free expression than your average news channel. And as sure as state intervention into TV news \u201cfairness\u201d would backfire so, too, will opening the door to Big Tech intervention.</p><p> David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist and the author of the book \u201cFirst Freedom: A Ride Through America\u2019s Enduring History With the Gun.\u201d To read features by other Creators Syndicate writers and cartoonists, visit the Creators Syndicate webpage at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.creators.com\">www.creators.com</url>.</p><p> \u00a9 2019 CREATORS.COM</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMD-1725398EE36BE5C0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897C4CC8CBF53 NWBKMD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPJ-GDX1-DXVP-V1J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409144</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"970\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

TheU.S. senator from Massachusetts described a country that has gone off course. When she was a child andher father got sick, she recalled, her mother was able to take a minimum wage job at Sears that paid the mortgage and put food on the table. </p><p>When Warren went to college, she said, it cost $50 a semester. Law school was $450 a semester. 'Today, a full-time minimum wage job in America will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty, that is wrong,' Warren said, underneath the Space Needle, at Seattle Center. 'Understand this, that difference is no accident, that difference is who government works for.' Warren, who is running second or third among nearly two dozen Democratic candidates in polling averages,described a government that works for drug companies, but not people filling prescriptions. A government for investors in private prisons, but not for families torn apart by incarceration. A government that once had two political parties that aimed to address climate change, but now, largely, does not. 'When you see a government that works great for the rich,' Warren said, 'that works great for the wealthy and the well-connected and is not working so well for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple.' Warren, who's known for her two-dozen or so detailed policy plans to address specific issues, spoke on a broader level to a crowd that her staff estimated at 15,000. The crowd size, she said, was evidence that 'people are ready for change in Washington. 'They understand they've got a government that's working great for the bazillionaires but just not working for them,' she said. 'To change that it's going to take all of us, nobody gets to stay on the sidelines.' After speaking for about an hour, Warren stayed hours longer, taking selfies with everybody in a massive line that snaked around the perimeter of the Seattle Center lawn. Her speech outlined three tenets: ending corruption, remaking the economy and rebuilding democracy. She used climate change as an example of the corruption she said is endemic to Washington, D.C. A generation ago, Republicans and Democrats both sought to address climate change. President George H.W. Bush, a Republican, signed the United Nations' first treaty on climate change and got it ratified by Congress. But, she said, years of massive spending by oil companies and the Koch brothers on climate-denying experts gave Republican politicians an 'umbrella they can hide under' so they can feign ignorance on the topic. 'I guarantee that if there's a decision to be made in Washington, it has been influenced by money,' Warren said. 'It has been shaped by money, money, money, money.' She promised, on her first day in office, to halt drilling and mining on federal lands. She also thanked Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who just dropped his climate-centered campaign[1], for bringing attention to the issue and called him 'one of the finest governors in America.' Warren spent a portion of her speech pitching one of the foundational ideas of her campaign \u2014 a wealth tax of 2% on families with more than $50 million in assets. 'Your first $50 million is free and clear,' Warren said. 'Your 50 millionth and first dollar you've got to pitch in 2 cents, and 2 cents on every dollar after that.' With that money, Warren said, we could pay for child care, pre-K and public college for everybody in the country. Standing just blocks from Amazon's headquarters and major office sites of Facebook and Google, Warren only hinted at her plans to break up America's largest tech companies[2]. 'How about we get a president who has the courage to enforce the anti-trust laws?' she said, to cheers. Warren has said she would appoint regulators who would use antitrust laws already on the books to undo mergers that have allowed the companies to grow more powerful and eliminate competitors. She'd roll back Amazon's purchases of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook's union with WhatsApp and Instagram and Google's acquisition of Waze. She would tighten regulations on the largest tech companies (those with over $50 billion in annual revenue), banning them from sharing data with third parties and barring Amazon from acting as an independent merchant on its own marketplace. Heather Matthies, who attended the speech, likes Warren's message of economic fairness and consumer protection. 'The only thing I am worried about is she might get stuck in the weeds,' said Matthies, a Lynnwood resident. 'A president needs to think about the big picture.' Charlie Lapham, who works for the Martin Luther King County Labor Council, likes Warren but is undecided. 'Electability is important,' he said. 'I want to see if she can make a connection with people.' Kaitlin Vintertun, executive director of the Washington State Republican Party, in a prepared statement on Warren's visit, called Seattle 'a haven for insane liberal policies' and said it's 'more important now than ever before to make sure we reelect President (Donald) Trump.' She called Warren 'one of the furthest left candidates in the presidential race' and described the senator's policies as reckless. Asked by an audience member how she'd counter Trump, Warren said she wouldn't back down but his election is a reflection of deeper issues affecting the country. 'A country that elects Donald Trump is a country in serious trouble,' she said.'We need to pay attention to what's been broken not just in the last two-and-a-half years, but what's been broken for decades.'

As Democrats realize, with some broadening of his appeal, Mr. Trump could make that happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Following that 2020 re-election rally kick-off came the rising tensions with Iran including a flare-up over the shooting down of an unmanned U.S. drone. Mr. Trump shot down hawks on his foreign policy team who wanted a vigorous military response.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'm not looking for war,\" he said.</p><p>How refreshing is that? His Republican Party, because of its trigger-happiness, has often been called the war party. But he's made it clear since being elected that he's more of a peacenik than a warmonger. That's a position that does in fact broaden his appeal beyond his base. It's moving in on Democratic turf.</p><p>The 20 Democrats contending for the party's presidential nomination take to the debate stage to make the case against him Wednesday and Thursday. There will be 10 one night in Miami, 10 the next.</p><p>The race has taken a strange turn. The candidate on the rise now is the one whom many decry as the new Hillary Clinton. That would be Senator Elizabeth Warren who is of similar age and has a somewhat similar look as Ms. Clinton and who, like her, is a highly educated policy wonk from the northeast who has been accused of being shrill and elitist. In other words, an ideal target for bottom-feeding, intellectually bankrupt Trumpians.</p><p>Ms. Warren was taken for dead or close to it following a controversy in which she claimed to be of Native American descent. But she has stormed back mainly on account of pitching herself as the candidate of real depth and real change. She and her team of brainiacs have put out thick policy books on every subject imaginable. Her rallying cry is \"I have a plan for that.\"</p><p>Her vision is to transform the American economy, rebalancing the power of labour and capital with intrusive federally-directed industrial policy. Seats on corporate boards would go to workers. Big tech would be regulated with trust-busting fervour. The ultra-rich would be taxed like never before. Her plans include a US$2-trillion federal investment in climate-friendly industries, universal child care and free higher education.</p><p>It's a new deal for the country, a frontal attack on income equality. Bernie Sanders was the radical candidate but he's coming across as same old, same old, while she's a torpedo whose program cuts into his support and makes what Ms. Clinton offered appear wishy-washy.</p><p>What also has allowed Ms. Warren to score well is mistakes by the other lead contenders. \"Gaffe machine\" Joe Biden lived up to the billing last week by boasting about how well he used to work with old segregationist senators. He had already drawn fire on racial issues because of his stance as a young senator opposing school busing as a path to desegregation. Now he gratuitously raised the racial controversy again. His performance on the hustings has been halting. He comes across as old, which he is.</p><p>Meanwhile Pete Buttigieg, the policy-vague mayor of South Bend, Ind., who got off to a hot start, has been embroiled in a controversy in his hometown over his handling of the shooting of a black man by a white police officer.</p><p>Senator Kamala Harris, who also started off well, has gone nowhere since because few know where she really stands. Amy Klobuchar has hit the ground strolling and Beto O'Rourke has receded owing in part to a senseless decision to avoid doing televised town halls.</p><p>Of course, the Warren boomlet could well be a temporary thing. A month from now, another candidate could steal the momentum and become, to borrow a sports term, the \"Big Mo.\" And a month from then, another. But Ms. Warren is focused and daunting and has an organization of Prussian precision.</p><p>Because there are so many candidates in the debates, each will have only a few minutes to make their case. It's a format that favours fluff over substance, candidates who can get off zingers that TV producers love to replay.</p><p>Ms. Warren will face heavy headwinds. She will be labelled an extremist. The Trumpians will delight in tagging her as the new Hillary. But her all-substance approach is getting traction. In the dumbed-down, knuckle-dragging arena of American politics, that is great to see.</p><p>Keep your Opinions sharp and informed.

About 26 percent of Americans in rural areas have no access to home broadband internet, according to a report released by the Federal Communications Commission last May. But broadband is probably even scarcer in rural areas than the reports suggests. The FCC has traditionally considered an entire census block, which can include hundreds or thousands of people, to be served by a broadband provider if that provider offers service to a single home in the blockeven if it would cost thousands of dollars for a customer to connect. The agency only changed its reporting requirements this month.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even where broadband is available, many people can't afford it. According to a Pew Research Center report, 19 percent of people who don't use the internet cited the cost of internet service or the expense of owning a computer as the reason they aren't online.</p><p>Wednesday, presidential candidate and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) unveiled a plan to spend $85 billion to bring internet service to unserved and underserved areas, along with proposals to restore net neutrality and crack down on what she calls \"sneaky maneuvers\" by broadband providers to increase prices and decrease competition. \"I will make sure every home in America has a fiber broadband connection at a price families can afford,\" Warren said in a statement. Warren also detailed several other proposals to invest in rural America.</p><p>Warren is among the first presidential candidates to inject telecom policy into the campaign. She has issued unusually detailed proposals on other topics, including a plan to break up big tech companies under antitrust laws.</p><p>Although Warren calls her plan a \"Public Option for Internet,\" she doesn't propose that the federal government deliver internet access itself. Instead, she wants to provide grants to broadband providers to connect underserved areas. The FCC has already spent billions on programs such as the Connect America Fund and the Universal Service Fund that provide grants to internet providers to offer service in underserved areas. But Warren isn't satisfied with the results of those programs, which often give money to for-profit corporations she says only do the minimum required to receive funds.</p><p>Warren would exclude such companies from her grants, which she says will be limited to electricity and telephone cooperatives, nonprofit organizations, tribes, cities, [and] counties. A growing number of communities, from small towns like Sandy, Oregon to cities like Chattanooga, Tennessee, have built their own publicly owned networks.</p><p>Many states have laws that ban or limit municipal broadband services, for example by restricting a municipality's ability to serve other nearby communities. Warren says she will attempt to preempt these sorts of state laws.</p><p>Warren proposes creating an Office of Broadband Access within the Department of Economic Development to run the program, and would set aside $5 billion of the $85 billion specifically for tribal nations and expand the FCC's Office of Native Affairs and Policy to provide additional training and funding.</p><p>In addition to funding public and nonprofit networks, Warren wants to make the broadband market more competitive. Smaller broadband companies have complained for years that entrenched telcos make it too hard for competitors to string cable along utility poles. To that end, Warren proposes giving cities, rather than individual telcos, control over utility poles, and mandating \"dig once\" policies that would ensure that broadband conduits are installed as part of all road and highway construction projects. The current Republican-controlled FCC has floated similar ideas.</p><p>As for net neutrality, Warren says she will appoint FCC commissioners who will restore the Obama-era regulations banning broadband providers from blocking or otherwise discriminating against lawful content on their networks. 2019 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICTMOW-151173239</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICTMOW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS6-3T11-JDJN-64YF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"666\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ICT Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35460\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 8, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjJBNjQ3RjNENTI2NEVCQkJFMTI4RTMxNzIyM0QyNjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Warren, who is seeking to stand out in a crowded field of presidential candidates, said in a blog post that on their way to the top, the big tech companies purchased a long list of potential competitors, like Facebook's acquisition of Instagram. 'They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. </p><p>And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,' Warren wrote. Warren said that she would nominate regulators who would unwind acquisitions such as Facebook's deals for WhatsApp[1] and Instagram[2], Amazon's deals for Whole Foods[3] and Zappos[4], and Google's purchases of Waze[5], Nest[6] and DoubleClick[7]. Investors shrugged off her comments, with shares in the three companies barely affected. Shares of Facebook and Alphabet were each down less than 0.5 percent on Friday. Amazon.com was down 0.9 percent. It is rare for the government to seek to undo a consummated deal. The most famous case in recent memory is the government's effort to break up Microsoft. The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact. Warren also proposed legislation that would require tech companies like Google and Amazon who offer an online marketplace or exchange to refrain from competing on their own platform. This would, for example, forbid Amazon from selling on its own Amazon Marketplace platform. Amazon and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook declined to comment. The tech companies have come under fire because of their role in displacing existing businesses. Amazon has replaced brick and mortar stores and has been criticized for its poorly-paid warehouse workers. Facebook has angered lawmakers for losing track of users' data and for not doing more to stop foreign meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Google has clashed with smaller companies, like Yelp, over search placements and has raised concerns it would comply with China's internet censorship and surveillance policies if it re-enters the Asian nation's search engine market. Congress held a series of hearings last year looking at the dominance of major tech companies.Tech under fireNetChoice, an e-commerce trade group whose members include Facebook and Google, said Warren's plan would lead to higher prices. 'Sen. Warren is wrong in her assertion that tech markets lack competition. Never before have consumers and workers had more access to goods, services, and opportunities online,' said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for NetChoice. Public Knowledge, a tech policy group, called Warren's plan a step toward protecting the next generation of businesses but stopped short of a full-throated support for breaking up the tech giants. 'We need legislation specifically targeted to enhance competition on digital platforms so that there is a real opportunity for new, innovative competitors to succeed,' said Charlotte Slaiman, the group's policy counsel. Tech expert Tim Wu, who coined the term 'net neutrality' and has warned against an economy dominated by a few giant firms, tweeted that it was 'heartening' to see the idea of breaking up the tech giants gaining some traction. Tech companies are some of the biggest political donors. Google spent $21 million to lobby in 2018 while Amazon spent $14.2 million and Facebook spent $12.62 million, according to their filings to U.S. Congress. Angering a deep-pocketed industry could hurt Democrats. Warren made her political mark by going after big banks after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. In the Senate, Warren continues to be an outspoken critic of Wall Street and is a leader of her party's progressive wing. Other candidates have also criticized the tech firms. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota used her presidential campaign launch speech to vow action on digital issues like privacy, saying 'big tech companies' misuse personal data. Vermont's Bernie Sanders, another presidential candidate, in 2018 even named a bill after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the Stop BEZOS Act, which would tax big companies if their employees receive public benefits.

In defeat, misery is their lot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ben Wedeman, CNN, Eastern Syria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.</p><p>ANA CABRERA, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Ana Cabrera, in for Brooke Baldwin. You're watching CNN.</p><p>A very busy Friday for the Trump White House, which finds itself again at the center of several breaking news stories right now. Communications chief Bill Shine is out, taking a job in the Trump reelection campaign. More on that in just a moment.</p><p>And for Paul Manafort, the man who was chairman of Donald Trump's first presidential campaign, a 47-month prison sentence has now been handed down. A federal judge issuing the ruling after Manafort was convicted on multiple financial crimes. That sentence was far short of the 19 to 25 years recommended by Robert Mueller's team.</p><p>And the news sparked sharp criticism throughout the legal and the political world. The president, however, praised the decision.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I feel very badly for Paul Manafort. I think it's been a very, very tough time for him. But if you notice, both his lawyer, a highly respected man, and a very highly respected judge, the judge, said there was no collusion with Russia. This had nothing to do with collusion. There was no collusion.</p><p>It's a collusion hoax. It's a collusion witch hoax. I don't collude with Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) CABRERA: We should be clear, despite what you just heard, the judge in this case did not say there was no collusion, only that it did not pertain to the charges in this particular case.</p><p>CNN's Kaitlan Collins joins us at the White House.</p><p>The president is really trying to spin this one in his favor, Kaitlan.</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you can see why the White House is seizing on that portion of the judge's remarks, as Manafort's sentencing hearing got under way, because otherwise they're answering questions about the fact that the president's former campaign chairman has been sentenced to nearly four years in prison for not paying his taxes and committing bank fraud.</p><p>They are paying attention to that. So are Manafort's attorneys repeating that claim, saying also that they -- the false claim that there was on -- that that's what the judge said, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.</p><p>And you can expect to hear that over the coming days. One thing that the White House isn't saying or ruling out so far, despite multiple questions from reporters, is a possible pardon for Paul Manafort.</p><p>CABRERA: I thought we might have had sound there.</p><p>Kaitlan Collins, let me ask you about Bill Shine for a second. He's leaving the White House. He's essentially the communications director. He's going to be joining the Trump campaign now. What is the back story there?</p><p>COLLINS: This all happened really quickly and it caught a lot of people in the West Wing off-guard because it wasn't that long ago that Bill Shine was talking about reorganizing the communications team, doing different things, so people said they did not have an indication that he was on his way out the door right now.</p><p>A little bit of what might have hinted at that is that he was actually scheduled to go on the president's trip to Vietnam for that second nuclear summit with Kim Jong-un, but then abruptly just two days before he announced that he was no longer going on that trip and was going to stay back in Washington.</p><p>Now, Ana, our reporting shows that the president had gotten pretty frustrated with Bill Shine in recent weeks, complaining that his coverage had not improved since he hired him to come in and essentially give him better coverage.</p><p>So that certainly is something that contributed to it, and also Bill Shine just being in the spotlight with stories not only about his family, but also his history at FOX News.</p><p>Now the question inside in the White House is, who is going to replace Bill Shine? Because, of course, this is a position that staffers often joke is cursed, because so many people have held this title since President Trump took office. And now they're waiting to see who's going to be number seven.</p><p>CABRERA: All right, Kaitlan Collins. Never a dull moment even on a Friday. Kaitlan, good to see you.</p><p>All right, President Trump may be losing his communications chief, but he's escalating a war of words with his former fixer, Michael Cohen, himself, blasting him for comments Cohen made to Congress last week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER ATTORNEY/FIXER FOR DONALD TRUMP: I have never asked for nor would I accept a pardon from President Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: In a tweet today, the president called Cohen a liar, saying he directly asked Trump for a pardon and that Trump turned him down.</p><p>Gloria Borger is CNN's chief political analyst. Carrie Cordero is former council to a attorney general, assistant attorney general.</p><p>Carrie, now that Trump is weighing in on Cohen's statements about this pardon idea, did he just give Democrats and Mueller an easier path to force Trump's own witness testimony?</p><p>CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I don't know that they will be calling the president to testify, but it certainly indicates that the president once again is willing to use his public forum to say things that most likely is not true.</p><p>[15:05:07]</p><p>Michael Cohen said under oath when he appeared before Congress, correcting prior information that he had provided. So this most recent testimony by Michael Cohen was his opportunity to tell the truth. He understood the consequences of it. And he said he didn't ask for pardon.</p><p>And he used pretty precise language as far as him asking for a pardon. The president is saying the opposite. And the public will have to determine which one they believe.</p><p>I don't think that we will see the president called before Congress to testify, nor will at this point it doesn't seem likely that the president will be speaking to the special counsel's investigators.</p><p>CABRERA: OK, but now we have a new Twitter spat, Gloria, Cohen responding to Trump on Twitter with this: \"Just another set of lies @realDonaldTrump. Mr. President, let me remind you that today is International Women's day. You may want to use today to apologize for your own lies and dirty deeds to women like Karen McDougal and Stephanie Clifford.\"</p><p>What's your reaction, Gloria?</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, neither of these men are known for their use of nuance in their communications.</p><p>And I think that Michael Cohen wants to hit back at Donald Trump in every way that he can. And in terms of what you were just talking about to Carrie, our own Jim Acosta said last night that there was some chatter about perhaps the White House referring Michael Cohen's so-called perjury, which they described as perjury, to the Department of Justice.</p><p>If they were to do that, then perhaps the president would be called to testify or would be open to discovery on the whole Stormy Daniels- Karen McDougal thing, and I don't think they're going to want to do that either.</p><p>But this is just their effort to continue to discredit Michael Cohen, which has also been the Republican strategy.</p><p>CABRERA: Let's talk Manafort now, because the president really focused on these comments from the judge. I quote from Judge Ellis: \"He is not before the court for anything having to do with colluding with the Russian government,\" talking specifically about this particular case.</p><p>Carrie, he did not say there was no collusion, as much as Trump wants people to believe this.</p><p>CORDERO: Right. He didn't.</p><p>His lawyers emphasized that when they left the courthouse. The judge didn't actually need to say this statement. This has been consistent with what he did throughout the trial, which I think indicates that the judge was sympathetic throughout the trial to Paul Manafort because he thought that he was selectively prosecuted.</p><p>I think that this judge thought the Paul Manafort would have never been brought to trial had he not been connected to Donald Trump and their campaign and wrapped up in the special counsel's investigation.</p><p>But the fact the matter is that he was convicted by a jury in the Eastern District of Virginia on eight different counts of different types of financial crime. And so the president can try to twist the judges words. And it may have been inappropriate for the judge to even be talking about collusion, when that actually was not part of the case.</p><p>But the fact the matter is that Paul Manafort was convicted of what he was convicted for.</p><p>CABRERA: And, Gloria, the president says he feels badly for Paul Manafort. What I just can't get over about those words is the president's public empathy for convicted criminals.</p><p>BORGER: Well, the president likes people who are loyal to him. He has called Paul Manafort, I believe, either brave or courageous.</p><p>On the other hand, he's called Michael Cohen a rat. So the president tends to judge people by how they regard him. And Manafort has -- and his attorney who came out of the courtroom yesterday and said there was no collusion, even though the attorney knew full well his case was not about Russia, that it was about bank fraud, tax fraud.</p><p>Those are signals. Those are arrows that are being sent directly into the Oval Office, saying, look at this, look at this. Pardon me, pardon me. That's what that's about.</p><p>I don't think the judge was doing that. But I do think that this has been ongoing, and that Manafort's lawyer did the same thing coming out of the courtroom yesterday, and the president feels empathetic towards Manafort. We don't know what he's going to end up doing.</p><p>CABRERA: The other big news today, White House communications chief Bill Shine out.</p><p>Gloria, what do you make of a timing, the week this damning report came out about the depth of the White House-FOX News connection?</p><p>BORGER: Yes, it may be tangentially connected to it, because, of course, that report showed that it's kind of an incestuous relationship between FOX News and the White House and the people come and go from FOX to the White House.</p><p>But I think that really Bill Shine is somebody who may have thought he would have a larger role than the role he ended up having, which was effectively stage-managing the president, that the president is his own communications director.</p><p>[15:10:12]</p><p>And there have been reports at CNN and elsewhere that the president wasn't thrilled with the performance of Shine, because he thought he would get them better press than he's gotten.</p><p>And so I think you put all those things together, and I think Shine decided to leave. And the fact that they say he's going to the campaign is really very much of a soft landing. He has no title and who knows how long he will remain.</p><p>CABRERA: All right, Gloria Borger, Carrie Cordero, thanks, ladies.</p><p>BORGER: Sure.</p><p>CABRERA: Up next, 2020 presidential contender Elizabeth Warren rolls out a plan to break up big tech companies like Amazon and Google. We will explain how that would work.</p><p>Plus, two former rivals in the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal in the same room for the first time. You will hear them spar over the current special counsel probe and whether President Trump obstructed justice.</p><p>And then later, \"The Miami Herald\" digs up a photo of President Trump with the woman who once owned that spa where Robert Kraft was accused of soliciting prostitution. Details on how she ended up at the Trump Golf Club to watch the Super Bowl.</p><p>[15:15:35]</p><p>CABRERA: A shockingly week jobs report on this Friday bringing a bad into a rough week of economic numbers for President Trump and the country.</p><p>Of course, the president loves to take credit for the economy, but only 20,000 jobs added last month, a fraction of the 180,000 jobs expected. And this report follows the news that the deficit exploded by 77 percent so far in just the first four months of the 2019 fiscal year.</p><p>At the same time, the U.S. trade deficit is now the largest in the country's history.</p><p>And with us now is CNN global economic analyst Rana Foroohar.</p><p>What do you read into these new jobs numbers? Is this the start of a an economic slowdown?</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN ANALYST: Well, I think we knew we were going to be in an economic slowdown by this point. I mean, historically, recovery cycles last about 10 years. We're at 10 years. So it's time for the economy to be moving a little more slowly.</p><p>This was a big surprise, though. I mean, 20,000 jobs, not a lot. On the upside, if you were to average out the last couple of months, we had a really great January, we had a poor February. If you average it over three months, which is kind of how I like to look at things -- you can't take just one month in isolation -- then you get about 180,000, 186,000 jobs being created month by month. That's not bad.</p><p>But economists are forecasting that we're going to see weakness ahead in the next year. And the thing that I like to look at a lot is the work force participation number. That's the number of Americans, the percentage of Americans that are actually working.</p><p>That's still low. That's at about 63 percent. You want to see that closer up to 67, 70 percent in order to really feel like the economy is where it needs to be.</p><p>CABRERA: And that work force participation number you mentioned, does that have to do with also the unemployment number actually going down, even though there were only 22,000 jobs added?</p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, that the unemployment number went down very, very slightly. And that's in part because a lot of people that had been furloughed because of the shutdown were coming back onto the job.</p><p>It did not go down enough to really push that overall participation number up. And that's what you need to see in order to get the kind of money in people's pockets, the spending, the consumer demand to really get the economy going.</p><p>I don't think that you're going to see that in the next year or two. I suspect that, by 2020, you're going to be in a real slowdown.</p><p>CABRERA: Let me ask you about some comments from Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CABRERA: This new plan to break up big tech companies like GoogleAmazon, Facebook.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>CABRERA: Listen to what she said, how this would work.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The way to think about this right now is Amazon is one like the umpire in the baseball game. It runs the marketplace. And it also has a lot of teams on the field because it's actually competing with the other businesses on that platform and giving special advantage, putting them on page one, and somebody they don't like back on page six.</p><p>So my notion is, you can be an umpire or you can own a team, but you can't do both at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: Rana, I know you're writing a book on the big tech companies.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>CABRERA: What do you make of her idea to break them up?</p><p>FOROOHAR: It's actually a very elegant way, what she just described. It is like, you own the marketplace and you can play in the marketplace. That's the problem with the big tech companies, Amazon, Google, Facebook.</p><p>There are privacy issues, and then their competition issues. And I think what's interesting about her proposal is, it knits together some of those things. And it says, look, we need to make sure that we're not living in a rigged game, where not just people, but individual small companies feel like they can't come into the marketplace and compete with these bigger players, because that's bad for the overall economy.</p><p>I think it's very brave that she's taking on this issue. And it's going to be a tough one for the Democrats, because Democrats get a lot of money from Silicon Valley.</p><p>CABRERA: Would this have a big impact on the economy at large?</p><p>FOROOHAR: I think that, over the longer term, if we actually regulate some of the biggest companies more tightly, it'll be good for the economy.</p><p>And if you look back, say, 20 years ago, which is when we had the last big tech antitrust case, that was the Microsoft case, just the threat of that regulation actually allowed companies like Google to be born. There was more of an open marketplace. And I think that that's what we will see again.</p><p>CABRERA: So interesting.</p><p>Rana Foroohar, good to see you. Thanks for being here on this Friday.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Good to see you.</p><p>CABRERA: Up next, a fascinating debate about the Mueller investigation between two men who are no strangers to White House scandal.</p><p>Former independent counsel Ken Starr and President Clinton's former Press Secretary Joe Lockhart battle over whether President Trump has obstructed justice.</p><p>Plus, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar sparking controversy again with criticism of President Obama's policies -- why she's calling his message of hope and change a mirage.</p><p>[15:24:44]</p><p>CABRERA: Two key players in one of this country's biggest political scandals, former independent counsel Ken Starr and former Clinton White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart met for the very first time today.</p><p>The objective? Let bygones be bygones. Discuss what went wrong in the Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal and weigh in on the parallels and the pitfalls of the investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign.</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOE LOCKHART, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY FOR FORMER PRESIDENT WILLIAM J. CLINTON: I think there is an important comparison to make here, though, and I would be interested in Judge Starr's view, which is Donald Trump has acted way beyond the pale.</p><p>President Clinton did not fire the head of the FBI. President Clinton did not want the head of the FBI in office and thought that he had a political agenda against him. But he didn't fire him.</p><p>President Clinton didn't go out every day and call this a witch-hunt and say that there was nothing to this. The president went about doing his job. President Clinton didn't 10,000 times tell lies and mislead the American public.</p><p>He did mislead the American public and lie to them in that Roosevelt Room. There is no defense of that.</p><p>But to try to compare these things -- and I think that's -- getting back to the Axios stories, that is the strength of the Axios stories. Donald Trump is using the full weight of the federal government and the executive branch now to protect himself and to cover up what he has done.</p><p>And in the case of President Clinton, he let this thing go. And the idea that we sit here 20 years later saying, oh, the president committed crimes, the president made mistakes, he's acknowledged them, and that's -- but I don't believe he has committed a crime.</p><p>And the one thing we haven't seen from President Trump is any acknowledgment.</p><p>And I will remind you, President Clinton went out and apologized for this before the report came out, before the House took up impeachment. So he wasn't -- until -- he wasn't saying, I want to wait until all -- the jury is totally in. He acknowledged these things as things he had done wrong.</p><p>He acknowledged the pain he had caused to his family and the distraction to the country. And I think it's wholly on a different scale when you have allegations and now evidence that a foreign government influenced our election, maybe delegitimized the election of a president, and the president's team, if not the president, was working with them. Wholly on a different scale.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: What about that, Judge?</p><p>KENNETH STARR, FORMER SPECIAL PROSECUTOR: Well, one of the great strengths of the special counsel investigation is that a very important set of charges have been brought against 13 Russian individuals and two organizations.</p><p>I read those indictments carefully. There's not one word that suggests collusion. The Russians behaved very badly, indeed, criminally, and they should be brought to the bar of justice.</p><p>Let's see, was there collusion? Thus far, including in the Paul Manafort case, we have seen no evidence of collusion.</p><p>CAMEROTA: But Joe is talking about obstruction of justice that we have seen evidence of, if you believe all of the tweets about a witch- hunt and the firing the head of the FBI. Do you consider that obstruction of justice about this investigation?</p><p>STARR: We did not charge President Clinton with obstruction of justice because of James Carville, Sidney Blumenthal, an entire army.</p><p>And one of the things, Joe, as you know, that President Clinton was very clever, very shrewd, because others did the dirty work. We were continually attacked, constantly attacked. Our motives and so forth, our operations were attacked.</p><p>And our integrity was attacked, but President Clinton was able to rise above it, let others do the dirty work.</p><p>CAMEROTA: But what about this example of President Trump?</p><p>STARR: And what President Trump refuses to do is follow the Clinton model. He wants to go on the attack himself. I do not consider that obstruction.</p><p>I really don't, because when you look at what the law of obstruction, you can have the moral view of what obstruction is, and then you can have the legal view, what in fact constitutes the crime of obstruction of justice.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STARR: But hold on a second. Hold on, Joe.</p><p>LOCKHART: But President Trump went on television...</p><p>STARR: There is no corrupt motive that has been defined by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p><p>And that's where I'm -- in this room, I have said, don't be so broad- minded, so to speak, in saying this constitutes obstruction of justice.</p><p>It doesn't obstruct justice to do what the president has the power to do, which is to fire the head of the FBI.</p><p>LOCKHART: Maybe I should have gone to law school.</p><p>But -- so let me speak for everyone in America who didn't go to law school. President Trump went on television even after two -- two days leading up to that interview, he lied about why he fired Comey.</p><p>He directed Rod Rosenstein to write a phony letter about he was being -- but when he went on TV, he just felt like he had to let it all out.

In defeat, misery is their lot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ben Wedeman, CNN, Eastern Syria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANNOUNCER:  This is CNN breaking news.</p><p>ANA CABRERA, CNN ANCHOR:  I'm Ana Cabrera, in for Brooke Baldwin.You're watching CNN.</p><p>A very busy Friday for the Trump White House, which finds itself againat the center of several breaking news stories right now.Communications chief Bill Shine is out, taking a job in the Trumpreelection campaign.  More on that in just a moment.</p><p>And for Paul Manafort, the man who was chairman of Donald Trump'sfirst presidential campaign, a 47-month prison sentence has now beenhanded down.  A federal judge issuing the ruling after Manafort wasconvicted on multiple financial crimes.  That sentence was far shortof the 19 to 25 years recommended by Robert Mueller's team.</p><p>And the news sparked sharp criticism throughout the legal and thepolitical world.  The president, however, praised the decision.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I feel very badly forPaul Manafort.  I think it's been a very, very tough time for him.But if you notice, both his lawyer, a highly respected man, and a veryhighly respected judge, the judge, said there was no collusion withRussia.  This had nothing to do with collusion.  There was nocollusion.</p><p>It's a collusion hoax.  It's a collusion witch hoax.  I don't colludewith Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)CABRERA:  We should be clear, despite what you just heard, the judgein this case did not say there was no collusion, only that it did notpertain to the charges in this particular case.</p><p>CNN's Kaitlan Collins joins us at the White House.</p><p>The president is really trying to spin this one in his favor, Kaitlan.</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, you can see whythe White House is seizing on that portion of the judge's remarks, asManafort's sentencing hearing got under way, because otherwise they'reanswering questions about the fact that the president's formercampaign chairman has been sentenced to nearly four years in prisonfor not paying his taxes and committing bank fraud.</p><p>They are paying attention to that.  So are Manafort's attorneysrepeating that claim, saying also that they -- the false claim thatthere was on -- that that's what the judge said, there was nocollusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.</p><p>And you can expect to hear that over the coming days.  One thing thatthe White House isn't saying or ruling out so far, despite multiplequestions from reporters, is a possible pardon for Paul Manafort.</p><p>CABRERA:  I thought we might have had sound there.</p><p>Kaitlan Collins, let me ask you about Bill Shine for a second.  He'sleaving the White House.  He's essentially the communicationsdirector.  He's going to be joining the Trump campaign now.  What isthe back story there?</p><p>COLLINS:  This all happened really quickly and it caught a lot ofpeople in the West Wing off-guard because it wasn't that long ago thatBill Shine was talking about reorganizing the communications team,doing different things, so people said they did not have an indicationthat he was on his way out the door right now.</p><p>A little bit of what might have hinted at that is that he was actuallyscheduled to go on the president's trip to Vietnam for that secondnuclear summit with Kim Jong-un, but then abruptly just two daysbefore he announced that he was no longer going on that trip and wasgoing to stay back in Washington.</p><p>Now, Ana, our reporting shows that the president had gotten prettyfrustrated with Bill Shine in recent weeks, complaining that hiscoverage had not improved since he hired him to come in andessentially give him better coverage.</p><p>So that certainly is something that contributed to it, and also BillShine just being in the spotlight with stories not only about hisfamily, but also his history at FOX News.</p><p>Now the question inside in the White House is, who is going to replaceBill Shine?  Because, of course, this is a position that staffersoften joke is cursed, because so many people have held this titlesince President Trump took office.  And now they're waiting to seewho's going to be number seven.</p><p>CABRERA:  All right, Kaitlan Collins.  Never a dull moment even on aFriday.  Kaitlan, good to see you.</p><p>All right, President Trump may be losing his communications chief, buthe's escalating a war of words with his former fixer, Michael Cohen,himself, blasting him for comments Cohen made to Congress last week.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER ATTORNEY/FIXER FOR DONALD TRUMP:  I have neverasked for nor would I accept a pardon from President Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  In a tweet today, the president called Cohen a liar, sayinghe directly asked Trump for a pardon and that Trump turned him down.</p><p>Gloria Borger is CNN's chief political analyst.  Carrie Cordero isformer council to a attorney general, assistant attorney general.</p><p>Carrie, now that Trump is weighing in on Cohen's statements about thispardon idea, did he just give Democrats and Mueller an easier path toforce Trump's own witness testimony?</p><p>CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Well, I don't know that they willbe calling the president to testify, but it certainly indicates thatthe president once again is willing to use his public forum to saythings that most likely is not true.</p><p>[15:05:07]</p><p>Michael Cohen said under oath when he appeared before Congress,correcting prior information that he had provided.  So this mostrecent testimony by Michael Cohen was his opportunity to tell thetruth.  He understood the consequences of it.  And he said he didn'task for pardon.</p><p>And he used pretty precise language as far as him asking for a pardon.The president is saying the opposite.  And the public will have todetermine which one they believe.</p><p>I don't think that we will see the president called before Congress totestify, nor will at this point it doesn't seem likely that thepresident will be speaking to the special counsel's investigators.</p><p>CABRERA:  OK, but now we have a new Twitter spat, Gloria, Cohenresponding to Trump on Twitter with this: \"Just another set of lies@realDonaldTrump.  Mr. President, let me remind you that today isInternational Women's day.  You may want to use today to apologize foryour own lies and dirty deeds to women like Karen McDougal andStephanie Clifford.\"</p><p>What's your reaction, Gloria?</p><p>GLORIA BORGER, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Well, neither of thesemen are known for their use of nuance in their communications.</p><p>And I think that Michael Cohen wants to hit back at Donald Trump inevery way that he can.  And in terms of what you were just talkingabout to Carrie, our own Jim Acosta said last night that there wassome chatter about perhaps the White House referring Michael Cohen'sso-called perjury, which they described as perjury, to the Departmentof Justice.</p><p>If they were to do that, then perhaps the president would be called totestify or would be open to discovery on the whole Stormy Daniels-Karen McDougal thing, and I don't think they're going to want to dothat either.</p><p>But this is just their effort to continue to discredit Michael Cohen,which has also been the Republican strategy.</p><p>CABRERA:  Let's talk Manafort now, because the president reallyfocused on these comments from the judge.  I quote from Judge Ellis:\"He is not before the court for anything having to do with colludingwith the Russian government,\" talking specifically about thisparticular case.</p><p>Carrie, he did not say there was no collusion, as much as Trump wantspeople to believe this.</p><p>CORDERO:  Right.  He didn't.</p><p>His lawyers emphasized that when they left the courthouse.  The judgedidn't actually need to say this statement.  This has been consistentwith what he did throughout the trial, which I think indicates thatthe judge was sympathetic throughout the trial to Paul Manafortbecause he thought that he was selectively prosecuted.</p><p>I think that this judge thought the Paul Manafort would have neverbeen brought to trial had he not been connected to Donald Trump andtheir campaign and wrapped up in the special counsel's investigation.</p><p>But the fact the matter is that he was convicted by a jury in theEastern District of Virginia on eight different counts of differenttypes of financial crime.  And so the president can try to twist thejudges words.  And it may have been inappropriate for the judge toeven be talking about collusion, when that actually was not part ofthe case.</p><p>But the fact the matter is that Paul Manafort was convicted of what hewas convicted for.</p><p>CABRERA:  And, Gloria, the president says he feels badly for PaulManafort.  What I just can't get over about those words is thepresident's public empathy for convicted criminals.</p><p>BORGER:  Well, the president likes people who are loyal to him.  Hehas called Paul Manafort, I believe, either brave or courageous.</p><p>On the other hand, he's called Michael Cohen a rat.  So the presidenttends to judge people by how they regard him.  And Manafort has -- andhis attorney who came out of the courtroom yesterday and said therewas no collusion, even though the attorney knew full well his case wasnot about Russia, that it was about bank fraud, tax fraud.</p><p>Those are signals.  Those are arrows that are being sent directly intothe Oval Office, saying, look at this, look at this.  Pardon me,pardon me.  That's what that's about.</p><p>I don't think the judge was doing that.  But I do think that this hasbeen ongoing, and that Manafort's lawyer did the same thing coming outof the courtroom yesterday, and the president feels empathetic towardsManafort.  We don't know what he's going to end up doing.</p><p>CABRERA:  The other big news today, White House communications chiefBill Shine out.</p><p>Gloria, what do you make of a timing, the week this damning reportcame out about the depth of the White House-FOX News connection?</p><p>BORGER:  Yes, it may be tangentially connected to it, because, ofcourse, that report showed that it's kind of an incestuousrelationship between FOX News and the White House and the people comeand go from FOX to the White House.</p><p>But I think that really Bill Shine is somebody who may have thought hewould have a larger role than the role he ended up having, which waseffectively stage-managing the president, that the president is hisown communications director.</p><p>[15:10:12]</p><p>And there have been reports at CNN and elsewhere that the presidentwasn't thrilled with the performance of Shine, because he thought hewould get them better press than he's gotten.</p><p>And so I think you put all those things together, and I think Shinedecided to leave.  And the fact that they say he's going to thecampaign is really very much of a soft landing.  He has no title andwho knows how long he will remain.</p><p>CABRERA:  All right, Gloria Borger, Carrie Cordero, thanks, ladies.</p><p>BORGER:  Sure.</p><p>CABRERA:  Up next, 2020 presidential contender Elizabeth Warren rollsout a plan to break up big tech companies like Amazon and Google.  Wewill explain how that would work.</p><p>Plus, two former rivals in the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal in the sameroom for the first time.  You will hear them spar over the currentspecial counsel probe and whether President Trump obstructed justice.</p><p>And then later, \"The Miami Herald\" digs up a photo of President Trumpwith the woman who once owned that spa where Robert Kraft was accusedof soliciting prostitution.  Details on how she ended up at the TrumpGolf Club to watch the Super Bowl.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:15:35]</p><p>CABRERA:  A shockingly week jobs report on this Friday bringing a badinto a rough week of economic numbers for President Trump and thecountry.</p><p>Of course, the president loves to take credit for the economy, butonly 20,000 jobs added last month, a fraction of the 180,000 jobsexpected.  And this report follows the news that the deficit explodedby 77 percent so far in just the first four months of the 2019 fiscalyear.</p><p>At the same time, the U.S. trade deficit is now the largest in thecountry's history.</p><p>And with us now is CNN global economic analyst Rana Foroohar.</p><p>What do you read into these new jobs numbers?  Is this the start of aan economic slowdown?</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN ANALYST:  Well, I think we knew we were going to bein an economic slowdown by this point.  I mean, historically, recoverycycles last about 10 years.  We're at 10 years.  So it's time for theeconomy to be moving a little more slowly.</p><p>This was a big surprise, though.  I mean, 20,000 jobs, not a lot.  Onthe upside, if you were to average out the last couple of months, wehad a really great January, we had a poor February.  If you average itover three months, which is kind of how I like to look at things --you can't take just one month in isolation -- then you get about180,000, 186,000 jobs being created month by month.  That's not bad.</p><p>But economists are forecasting that we're going to see weakness aheadin the next year.  And the thing that I like to look at a lot is thework force participation number.  That's the number of Americans, thepercentage of Americans that are actually working.</p><p>That's still low.  That's at about 63 percent.  You want to see thatcloser up to 67, 70 percent in order to really feel like the economyis where it needs to be.</p><p>CABRERA:  And that work force participation number you mentioned, doesthat have to do with also the unemployment number actually going down,even though there were only 22,000 jobs added?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Well, that the unemployment number went down very, veryslightly.  And that's in part because a lot of people that had beenfurloughed because of the shutdown were coming back onto the job.</p><p>It did not go down enough to really push that overall participationnumber up.  And that's what you need to see in order to get the kindof money in people's pockets, the spending, the consumer demand toreally get the economy going.</p><p>I don't think that you're going to see that in the next year or two.I suspect that, by 2020, you're going to be in a real slowdown.</p><p>CABRERA:  Let me ask you about some comments from Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CABRERA:  This new plan to break up big tech companies like GoogleAmazon, Facebook.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Yes.</p><p>CABRERA:  Listen to what she said, how this would work.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  The way tothink about this right now is Amazon is one like the umpire in thebaseball game.  It runs the marketplace.  And it also has a lot ofteams on the field because it's actually competing with the otherbusinesses on that platform and giving special advantage, putting themon page one, and somebody they don't like back on page six.</p><p>So my notion is, you can be an umpire or you can own a team, but youcan't do both at the same time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  Rana, I know you're writing a book on the big techcompanies.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Yes.</p><p>CABRERA:  What do you make of her idea to break them up?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  It's actually a very elegant way, what she just described.It is like, you own the marketplace and you can play in themarketplace.  That's the problem with the big tech companies, Amazon,Google, Facebook.</p><p>There are privacy issues, and then their competition issues.  And Ithink what's interesting about her proposal is, it knits together someof those things.  And it says, look, we need to make sure that we'renot living in a rigged game, where not just people, but individualsmall companies feel like they can't come into the marketplace andcompete with these bigger players, because that's bad for the overalleconomy.</p><p>I think it's very brave that she's taking on this issue.  And it'sgoing to be a tough one for the Democrats, because Democrats get a lotof money from Silicon Valley.</p><p>CABRERA:  Would this have a big impact on the economy at large?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  I think that, over the longer term, if we actually regulatesome of the biggest companies more tightly, it'll be good for theeconomy.</p><p>And if you look back, say, 20 years ago, which is when we had the lastbig tech antitrust case, that was the Microsoft case, just the threatof that regulation actually allowed companies like Google to be born.There was more of an open marketplace.  And I think that that's whatwe will see again.</p><p>CABRERA:  So interesting.</p><p>Rana Foroohar, good to see you.  Thanks for being here on this Friday.</p><p>FOROOHAR:  Good to see you.</p><p>CABRERA:  Up next, a fascinating debate about the Muellerinvestigation between two men who are no strangers to White Housescandal.</p><p>Former independent counsel Ken Starr and President Clinton's formerPress Secretary Joe Lockhart battle over whether President Trump hasobstructed justice.</p><p>Plus, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar sparking controversy again withcriticism of President Obama's policies -- why she's calling hismessage of hope and change a mirage.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:24:44]</p><p>CABRERA:  Two key players in one of this country's biggest politicalscandals, former independent counsel Ken Starr and former ClintonWhite House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart met for the very first timetoday.</p><p>The objective?  Let bygones be bygones.  Discuss what went wrong inthe Clinton-Monica Lewinsky scandal and weigh in on the parallels andthe pitfalls of the investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign.</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOE LOCKHART, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY FOR FORMER PRESIDENT WILLIAM J.CLINTON:  I think there is an important comparison to make here,though, and I would be interested in Judge Starr's view, which isDonald Trump has acted way beyond the pale.</p><p>President Clinton did not fire the head of the FBI.  President Clintondid not want the head of the FBI in office and thought that he had apolitical agenda against him.  But he didn't fire him.</p><p>President Clinton didn't go out every day and call this a witch-huntand say that there was nothing to this.  The president went aboutdoing his job.  President Clinton didn't 10,000 times tell lies andmislead the American public.</p><p>He did mislead the American public and lie to them in that RooseveltRoom.  There is no defense of that.</p><p>But to try to compare these things -- and I think that's -- gettingback to the Axios stories, that is the strength of the Axios stories.Donald Trump is using the full weight of the federal government andthe executive branch now to protect himself and to cover up what hehas done.</p><p>And in the case of President Clinton, he let this thing go.  And theidea that we sit here 20 years later saying, oh, the presidentcommitted crimes, the president made mistakes, he's acknowledged them,and that's -- but I don't believe he has committed a crime.</p><p>And the one thing we haven't seen from President Trump is anyacknowledgment.</p><p>And I will remind you, President Clinton went out and apologized forthis before the report came out, before the House took up impeachment.So he wasn't -- until -- he wasn't saying, I want to wait until all --the jury is totally in.  He acknowledged these things as things he haddone wrong.</p><p>He acknowledged the pain he had caused to his family and thedistraction to the country.  And I think it's wholly on a differentscale when you have allegations and now evidence that a foreigngovernment influenced our election, maybe delegitimized the electionof a president, and the president's team, if not the president, wasworking with them.  Wholly on a different scale.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR:  What about that, Judge?</p><p>KENNETH STARR, FORMER SPECIAL PROSECUTOR:  Well, one of the greatstrengths of the special counsel investigation is that a veryimportant set of charges have been brought against 13 Russianindividuals and two organizations.</p><p>I read those indictments carefully.  There's not one word thatsuggests collusion.  The Russians behaved very badly, indeed,criminally, and they should be brought to the bar of justice.</p><p>Let's see, was there collusion?  Thus far, including in the PaulManafort case, we have seen no evidence of collusion.</p><p>CAMEROTA:  But Joe is talking about obstruction of justice that wehave seen evidence of, if you believe all of the tweets about a witch-hunt and the firing the head of the FBI.  Do you consider thatobstruction of justice about this investigation?</p><p>STARR:  We did not charge President Clinton with obstruction ofjustice because of James Carville, Sidney Blumenthal, an entire army.</p><p>And one of the things, Joe, as you know, that President Clinton wasvery clever, very shrewd, because others did the dirty work.  We werecontinually attacked, constantly attacked.  Our motives and so forth,our operations were attacked.</p><p>And our integrity was attacked, but President Clinton was able to riseabove it, let others do the dirty work.</p><p>CAMEROTA:  But what about this example of President Trump?</p><p>STARR:  And what President Trump refuses to do is follow the Clintonmodel.  He wants to go on the attack himself.  I do not consider thatobstruction.</p><p>I really don't, because when you look at what the law of obstruction,you can have the moral view of what obstruction is, and then you canhave the legal view, what in fact constitutes the crime of obstructionof justice.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STARR:  But hold on a second.  Hold on, Joe.</p><p>LOCKHART:  But President Trump went on television...</p><p>STARR:  There is no corrupt motive that has been defined by theSupreme Court of the United States.</p><p>And that's where I'm -- in this room, I have said, don't be so broad-minded, so to speak, in saying this constitutes obstruction ofjustice.</p><p>It doesn't obstruct justice to do what the president has the power todo, which is to fire the head of the FBI.</p><p>LOCKHART:  Maybe I should have gone to law school.</p><p>But -- so let me speak for everyone in America who didn't go to lawschool.  President Trump went on television even after two -- two daysleading up to that interview, he lied about why he fired Comey.</p><p>He directed Rod Rosenstein to write a phony letter about he was being-- but when he went on TV, he just felt like he had to let it all out.And he said:  I fired him because I wanted to stop the Russianinvestigation, because I think the Russian investigation is a witch-hunt.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>[Byline: Rana Foroohar, Gloria Borger, Carrie Cordero, KaitlanCollins, Ana Cabrera][High: President Trump loses another communications director.

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday challenged her Democratic primary rivals to release the names of contributors and fundraisers with influential positions on their campaigns, while pledging to champion legislation that would effectively disqualify big-dollar donors from being appointed to cushy diplomatic posts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The requests were written into a series of mostly new proposed campaign finance restrictions, which would ban corporate PACs from donating to federal candidates and make it illegal for certain super PACs to be run by operatives with professional or personal ties to the candidate they're backing.</p><p>Now firmly among the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination, Warren has increasingly centered her campaign on a broad anti-corruption platform. In past rollouts, she promised to forbid lobbyists from making political contributions, acting as bundlers or hosting fundraisers for candidates. Former top federal officials -- including presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, judges, and cabinet secretaries -- would also be permanently prohibited from taking lobbying jobs.</p><p>While Warren does not name any of her competitors in her Medium post, the new call for campaigns to \"disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign, including national and regional finance committee members and bundler designations\" is an apparent nudge to a number of top rivals, like former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who all regularly attend big-dollar fundraising events.</p><p>Warren's call to cut off the donor-to-ambassador pipeline, which she acknowledges has been common practice in both Republican and Democratic administrations, comes with increased resonance now that President Donald Trump's EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland, a Republican megadonor who gave $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, has emerged as a key figure in the Ukraine scandal.</p><p>Sondland got tied up in the ongoing congressional impeachment inquiry after the disclosure of his text messages with Bill Taylor, a career diplomat serving as the charge d'affaires at the US Embassy in Kiev, in which Taylor questions why Trump is withholding \"security assistance\" to the Ukrainian government.</p><p>For decades, administrations of both political parties have appointed big donors and bundlers to ambassadorial posts around the world,\" Warren writes. \"My plan will make it the law by prohibiting campaign donations and political spending from being a consideration in the selection of an ambassador.\"</p><p>Warren also used the new round of proposals to further explain the parameters of her campaign's self-imposed fundraising rules. Last week, she said for the first time that her primary strategy of refusing to solicit wealthy donors and hold big-dollar fundraisers will extend into the general election if she were to become the nominee.</p><p>She previously disavowed federal lobbyist and PAC money and put a cap on contributions she receives from fossil fuel and big pharmaceutical executives. In the plan released Tuesday, Warren broadens those restrictions, writing, \"I'm not going to take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds.\"</p><p>Amid her feud with Facebook over the social media giant's advertising policy, which exempts posts by candidates from third-party fact-checking, Warren is also proposing to \"modernize campaign finance law for the digital age.\"</p><p>Online political ads would, according to Warren's proposal, be regulated more like those run on television and radio, forcing \"large platforms\" like Facebook to keep \"to keep a 'political file' with information about ad buys.\" Warren also calls for those companies to make a \"reasonable\" attempt to seek out and reject \"illegal ad buys by foreign nationals.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Warren would expand disclosure requirement for super PACs and other dark money groups that grew up out of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, while reducing individual contribution caps and established a 6-1 matching funds program on all donations less than $200.</p><p>The Massachusetts senator also addresses the quadrennial influx of corporate cash to both major parties' national conventions, proposing to make them publicly funded. That follows Sen. Bernie Sanders' pledge last week to put a stop on all corporate contributions to the 2020 Democratic National Convention if he becomes the nominee.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20191014elizabeth-warren-campaign-finance-donor-disclosure1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8T-YHY1-JBPX-X0TT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><timeReceived>10:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 14, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>elizabeth-warren-campaign-finance-donor-disclosure</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000245</classCode><className>CAMPAIGN FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday challenged her Democratic primary rivals to release the names of contributors and fundraisers with influential positions on their campaigns, while pledging to champion legislation that would effectively disqualify big-dollar donors from being appointed to cushy diplomatic posts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The requests were written into a series of mostly new proposed campaign finance restrictions, which would ban corporate PACs from donating to federal candidates and make it illegal for certain super PACs to be run by operatives with professional or personal ties to the candidate they're backing.</p><p>Now firmly among the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination, Warren has increasingly centered her campaign on a broad anti-corruption platform. In past rollouts, she promised to forbid lobbyists from making political contributions, acting as bundlers or hosting fundraisers for candidates. Former top federal officials -- including presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, judges, and cabinet secretaries -- would also be permanently prohibited from taking lobbying jobs.</p><p>While Warren does not name any of her competitors in her Medium post, the new call for campaigns to \"disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign, including national and regional finance committee members and bundler designations\" is an apparent nudge to a number of top rivals, like former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and California Sen. Kamala Harris, who all regularly attend big-dollar fundraising events.</p><p>Warren's call to cut off the donor-to-ambassador pipeline, which she acknowledges has been common practice in both Republican and Democratic administrations, comes with increased resonance now that President Donald Trump's EU ambassador, Gordon Sondland, a Republican megadonor who gave $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, has emerged as a key figure in the Ukraine scandal.</p><p>Sondland got tied up in the ongoing congressional impeachment inquiry after the disclosure of his text messages with Bill Taylor, a career diplomat serving as the charge d'affaires at the US Embassy in Kiev, in which Taylor questions why Trump is withholding \"security assistance\" to the Ukrainian government. </p><p>For decades, administrations of both political parties have appointed big donors and bundlers to ambassadorial posts around the world,\" Warren writes. \"My plan will make it the law by prohibiting campaign donations and political spending from being a consideration in the selection of an ambassador.\"</p><p>Warren also used the new round of proposals to further explain the parameters of her campaign's self-imposed fundraising rules. Last week, she said for the first time that her primary strategy of refusing to solicit wealthy donors and hold big-dollar fundraisers will extend into the general election if she were to become the nominee.</p><p>She previously disavowed federal lobbyist and PAC money and put a cap on contributions she receives from fossil fuel and big pharmaceutical executives. In the plan released Tuesday, Warren broadens those restrictions, writing, \"I'm not going to take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds.\" </p><p>Amid her feud with Facebook over the social media giant's advertising policy, which exempts posts by candidates from third-party fact-checking, Warren is also proposing to \"modernize campaign finance law for the digital age.\"</p><p>Online political ads would, according to Warren's proposal, be regulated more like those run on television and radio, forcing \"large platforms\" like Facebook to keep \"to keep a 'political file' with information about ad buys.\" Warren also calls for those companies to make a \"reasonable\" attempt to seek out and reject \"illegal ad buys by foreign nationals.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Warren would expand disclosure requirement for super PACs and other dark money groups that grew up out of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, while reducing individual contribution caps and established a 6-1 matching funds program on all donations less than $200.</p><p>The Massachusetts senator also addresses the quadrennial influx of corporate cash to both major parties' national conventions, proposing to make them publicly funded. That follows Sen. Bernie Sanders' pledge last week to put a stop on all corporate contributions to the 2020 Democratic National Convention if he becomes the nominee.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Elizabeth Warren has just just quietly threatened to beat big tech monopolies with a big stick. Channeling the ghost of Teddy Roosevelt, Warren has proposed a plan to break up companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google in order to trim the bloated and douchey tech industry. </p><p>By threatening Silicon Valley's socially awkward hoodie Hitlers, she's sending a signal to the rest of the corporatocracy that their tax-payer funded free lunch is over. It's about damn time!In a Medium post[1] announcing out her proposed policy, Warren argues tech companies have \"too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy\" and \"squash small businesses and innovation\" so they can all drive around Palo Alto in Teslas and Hummers with plastic machine gun[2] mounts. Warren's plan is a bit of wonky (it's a broad economic policy on tech, SO SEXY!), but the TLDR is that tech companies would suffer the same fate as Ma Bell and Standard Oil. First, any company running an online marketplace raking in $25 billion or more will be classified as a \"platform utility\" and barred from competing with other companies that use their platform to reach consumers. Companies earning between $90 million and $25 billion could still play with the big kids, but they'd have to follow new fairness rules. Anyone caught breaking the rules would be slapped with a five percent fine on their annual revenue (which is a lot).The second part of Warren's plan would use existing antitrust rules to \"unwind anti-competitive mergers,\" like Amazon owning Whole Foods and Zappos, or Google's ownership of Nest, DoubleClick and Waze. The TLDR here is Warren is telling Jeff Bezos he can either own a shoe company and a grocery store or he can own an online catalog and delivery service, but he can't do both. Mark Zuckerberg could spy on you via Facebook, but he can't look at your drunken selfies and sext messages with Instagram and WhatsApp. In order to enforce these rules, Warren says we'd need to appoint new federal regulators and State Attorney Generals to go after companies. These rules would also let random grandmas in flyover country sue tech companies if they're caught trying to crowd them out of online marketplaces. Silicon Valley is of course scoffing at the plan. Rob Atkinson, president of a the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech think tank,[3] bemoans the loss of Palo Alto's profits in arguing \"many of the services big tech companies now provide free used to cost consumers money.\" According to Atkinson, breaking up the tech companies will force them to start charging money for ad-filled apps and services we currently get for free. And Facebook itself is (arguably) spooked by the idea of looming antitrust litigation[4] as Zuckerberg recently announced that he suddenly gave a shit[5] about your privacy while casually announcing he was merging Facebook with all the other crap that it owns in order to argue it's too big to be broken up. Warren is asking people to sign a petition[6] if they want her go to California and start beating corporate overlords with Teddy Roosevelt's big, trust busting Sherman stick. We fully support this decision, and think it's about time someone slapped that robotic smirk off Mark Zuckerberg's face. We're not economists, but we're pretty confident tech companies will do just fine even if they have to start paying their fair share and playing by the rules.[Sen.

She says, companies like Amazon and Google which provide a platform for other shouldn't sell/promote their own things. </p><p>However, soon after she clarified that by 'big companies', she has the Cupertino based company Apple in mind as well.When asked about how Warren would like to break Apple, she mentioned that, the company runs the App Store which is a platform for developers to sell/share their work while also publishing Apple's own work. Elizabeth says that, Apple has a huge advantage in this case as it has all the statistical data on the other apps i.e how many users are buying, the price, etc and it gives Apple an upperhand to play in the apps arena. APPLE RUNS THE APP STORE AND ALSO PUBLISHES ITS OWN APPS To solve the problem, Warren said that, Apple will have to choose between running the App Store or publishing their own apps on the platform, in accordance with her proposal to break big companies. To follow up on that, she was asked as to how Apple would keep the iPhone secure if the App Store is not run by Apple. She replied by saying that, if Apple does want to run the App Store then, it will have to stop publishing its own apps. 'It's got to be one or the other', Warren said. 'Either they run the platform or they play in the store. They don't get to do both at the same time.' With the 2020 presidential elections approaching, Warren's proposal of regulating the tech companies has been one of the valorous.ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE COMPANY Apple makes more than $25 billion a year from its hardware and services business. It also runs it own App Store on iOS, the operating system that powers iPhones and iPads (also iPod Touchs). Warren says, that fact alone gives Apple a competitive advantage over its competitors. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ILOU100094471552205196201251761700099</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ILOU-10009447</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKY-RJ61-JCMN-Y2BT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"318\"/><timeReceived>8:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iLounge</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 10, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

She pointed to data suggesting that venture capitalists are now hesitant to fund new start-ups over fear that they'll be acquired or driven out of business.US Senator Elizabeth Warren is proposing to break up tech giants Amazon, Facebook and Google should she be elected president in 2020. In a post on Medium[1], the Massachusetts Democrat said today's big tech companies have too much power over the economy, our society and our democracy. </p><p>Such companies have bulldozed the competition, she said, adding that they've used our private information for profit, hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.With fewer competitors, Warren said big tech doesn't have to compete as aggressively in critical areas such as privacy protection. Amazon[2], for example, she said, has grown so powerful that it can 'bully cities and states into showering them with massive taxpayer handouts in exchange for doing business.' Warren said she would appoint regulators to unwind anti-competitive mergers including: Amazon: Whole Foods; Zappos Facebook: WhatsApp; InstagramGoogle: Waze; Nest; DoubleClick Doing so wouldn't change your ability to visit Google and search for things like you do today, use Amazon to find '30 different coffee machines that you can get delivered to your house in two days,' or use Facebook to see how old friends are doing. What will change, however, is that 'Google couldn't smother competitors by demoting their products on Google Search,' small businesses would have a fair shot at selling their products on Amazon without fear of being pushed out of business and 'Facebook would face real pressure from Instagram and WhatsApp to improve the user experience and protect our privacy.'Related ReadsShare this article: [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/78760-amazon-pulls-out-plans-build-headquarters-new-york.html\">https://www.techspot.com/news/78760-amazon-pulls-out-plans-build-headquarters-new-york.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TSPT133881155206565921625176500054</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSPT-133881</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKK-CR51-F03R-N24B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"354\"/><timeReceived>5:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>TechSpot</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Second, Warren said that, if elected, she would appoint regulators \"committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers.\"</p><p>A company would be defined as a \"platform utility\" if it earned annual global revenue of $25 billion or more, Warren wrote, and would be required to meet a standard of fair dealing with consumers and not share data with third parties. An additional restriction seems designed to thwart monopolies: \"These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform,\" she wrote.\u00a0</p><p>Warren suggested that the government unwind what she called \"anti-competitive mergers,\" and named several: Amazon's acquisitions of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google's acquisitions of Waze, Nest, and DoubleClick.</p><p>\"Unwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market\u200a-\u200awhich will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy,\" Warren wrote.</p><p>Warren said that her proposed actions wouldn't prevent users from shopping on Amazon, searching on Google, or checking up on old friends on Facebook. Putting tech companies like Instagram or WhatsApp in competition with Facebook, though, would force Facebook to take action on privacy, more so than it already has.\u00a0</p><p>\"The steps I'm proposing today will allow existing big tech companies to keep offering customer-friendly services, while promoting competition, stimulating innovation in the tech sector, and ensuring that America continues to lead the world in producing cutting-edge tech companies,\" Warren wrote. \"It's how we protect the future of the Internet.\"</p><p>What this means for you: Warren, the senior senator from Massachusetts, is one of about a dozen Democratic Party candidates (so far) vying to unseat Donald Trump for the U.S. presidency.\u00a0This proposal may be seen as a talking point designed to elevate Warren in the national discussion, 18 months or so before the 2020 Presidential election. It also brings up an interesting fundraising question: Will deep-pocketed tech employees give money to essentially undermine their own industry? Or will they see it as seeding new competition, and new opportunities?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PCWRLD-3356465</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PCWRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKN-X3X1-DY58-D2PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459107</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"445\"/><timeReceived>10:42 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 IDG Communications, Inc.

It's certainly worth reading to understand where she's coming from, and some of the arguments are worth thinking about -- but much of it does feel like just grandstanding populism in front of the general \"anti-big tech\" stance, without enough substance behind it.Twenty-five years ago, Facebook, Google, and Amazon didn't exist. Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. It's a great story\u200a\u2014\u200abut also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.I find this a very odd way to open this proposal. I don't see how the first sentence supports the second. </p><p>Indeed, the first sentence would seem to contradict the second. Twenty-five years ago those companies didn't exist, and if you asked people what tech companies would take over the world, you'd get very different answers. Technology is an incredibly dynamic and rapidly changing world, in which big incumbents are regularly and frequently disrupted and disappear. One of my favorite articles to point people to was a 2007 article warning of the power of a giant monopolistic social network that would never be taken down[2] by competition. That social network? MySpace. The article briefly mentions Facebook, but only to note that it \"will always be on MySpace's periphery.\" Let me make my position clear on all this too: I am always supportive of greater competition, and have always been a huge supporter of disrupting incumbents, because I believe that's how we get to better innovations. But I also believe that this is rarely done by government intervention, and usually comes from new technologies and new innovations in the marketplace. For years now I've been talking about why the real way to \"break up\" big tech platforms is to push for a world of protocols, rather than platforms[3], which would push the power out to the ends[4] of the network, rather than keeping them centralized under a single silo with a giant owner. But I fear that nearly all of these plans to \"break up\" big tech actually make that harder. It doesn't open up new opportunities for a protocol-based approach, and simply assumes that the world will always be managed by giant platform companies -- just slightly smaller, and highly regulated, ones. And that might actually lead us to a much worse future, one that is still controlled by more centralized systems, rather than more decentralized, distributed protocols where the users have power. The internet is a constant challenge with lots of new upstarts hoping to disrupt the big guys. And sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. We should be wary of companies with too much power abusing that position to block competition. And I'm certainly open to looking at specific situations where it's alleged that these companies are blocking competitors, but a general position that says breaking up the internet giants seems more opportunistic and headline-grabbing than realistic.In the 1990s, Microsoft\u200a\u2014\u200athe tech giant of its time\u200a\u2014\u200awas trying to parlay its dominance in computer operating systems into dominance in the new area of web browsing. The federal government sued Microsoft for violating anti-monopoly laws and eventually reached a settlement. The government's antitrust case against Microsoft helped clear a path for Internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge.Two things on this. First, Microsoft was clearly engaged in anti-competitive practices that were designed to restrict competition and harm consumers. There was clear evidence of the company proactively seeking to undermine competitors. There is (to date!) little such evidence of the same thing with the big internet companies. It is entirely possible that such evidence will eventually be found, and if that's the case, then it's reasonable to punish the companies for such practices. But, to date, all of the examples people cite as \"evidence\" of anti-competitive practices by the big internet companies really looks like reasonable steps to improve consumer welfare with their products (i.e., the opposite of what Microsoft was doing in the 90s.) Second, I know some may disagree, but I find it difficult to believe that the government's antitrust case against Microsoft truly \"helped clear a path\" for Google and Facebook. After all, that antitrust case fizzled with the DOJ, despite \"winning\" the case, eventually getting basically no real concessions from Microsoft at all. The argument that some will make was that merely being involved in the antitrust case helped clear the path by (a) distracting Microsoft and forcing it to spend a bunch of resources on fighting the DOJ and (b) by making the company more hesitant to continue its historical practices, but I'm not sure there's much evidence to support either of those claims. Microsoft fell behind Google and Facebook because the company was structurally oblivious to the power of the internet, and when it finally realized the internet was important, really couldn't make the necessary shifts to be a truly internet native company. Yes, it took over the browser market, temporarily, but was easily beaten back when better browsers came on the market.The story demonstrates why promoting competition is so important: it allows new, groundbreaking companies to grow and thrive\u200a\u2014\u200awhich pushes everyone in the marketplace to offer better products and services. Aren't we all glad that now we have the option of using Google instead of being stuck with Bing?Again, this seems to contradict the larger message here. If Microsoft were a stronger company, then, uh, wouldn't that mean Google had less dominance?Today's big tech companies have too much power\u200a\u2014\u200atoo much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.It may be true that they have too much power. But the way to deal with that is by encouraging more innovation. A heavily regulated market... tends not to do that. As for Warren's actual plan, it has two steps:First, by passing legislation that requires large tech platforms to be designated as 'Platform Utilities' and broken apart from any participant on that platform. Companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties would be designated as 'platform utilities.' These companies would be prohibited from owning both the platform utility and any participants on that platform. Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.So, first thing on that: passing legislation is the job of Congress, not the President. And Warren is already in Congress. So if this is part of her Presidential platform, it seems like, maybe she should start by introducing such legislation now, while she's actually in the legislative body. Second, while \"fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users\" sounds nice -- and is used in other things such as FRAND patent licensing -- it's not entirely clear what it truly means in these situations. Everyone likes the words \"fair,\" \"reasonable\" and \"nondiscriminatory,\" but in the context of users on a platform, does it mean that internet platforms can no longer ban trolls for harassment? Because right now there are a lot of trollish people who are insisting that being banned from Facebook, Twitter or YouTube is unfair, unreasonable and discriminatory. Indeed, this seems like a huge gift to the trolls and grifters who pretend to be \"conservative\" and then whine when platforms cut them off. Certainly, at the very least this would lead to a huge burst of such lawsuits, as Warren's plan allows basically anyone to sue over this:To enforce these new requirements, federal regulators, State Attorneys General, or injured private parties would have the right to sue a platform utility to enjoin any conduct that violates these requirements, to disgorge any ill-gotten gains, and to be paid for losses and damages. A company found to violate these requirements would also have to pay a fine of 5 percent of annual revenue.This is a recipe for insane amounts of litigation -- often vexatious litigation, just seeking to ding a company for being \"unfair\" in its choices. Incredibly, this includes \"search results.\" Warren specifically calls out Google search as a \"platform utility,\" and says that under her plan:Google couldn't smother competitors by demoting their products on Google Search.And that sounds good if Google was legitimately \"smothering competitors\" by \"demoting their products on Google search\" but there's no evidence that it does. The very nature of search is that Google is expressing its opinion by ranking the search results in the order it thinks best serves you. If it believes that your particular site is not relevant, it's going to demote it. But, under Warren's plan, if you're not showing up at the top of Google results, you can sue for massive damages. In other words, SEO-by-litigation and anyone who isn't happy with where they show up is going to sue. Indeed, in her plan, she links to the big NY Times article about the site Foundem[5] that has been at the center of various antitrust challenges against Google over the past decade. And, as we wrote all the way back in 2010[6], Foundem's argument makes no sense. The company made a shopping search engine, and insists that it was anticompetitive that Google's search engine kept dropping Foundem's site in Google's search results further and further. But the reason for that was that when people were searching on Google for products, they wanted links to actual products and not to another search engine. Foundem's search results dropped not because Google suddenly feared competition from Foundem, but because pointing users to another search engine was a bad experience for users. Back in 2009 there was a great analysis that explained why Google downranked Foundem[7] and it had nothing to do with competition, but because Foundem was a crappy link directory (with affiliate codes attached) that was basically just a spam site hoping to live off of Google traffic. Now imagine if every such spam company could now sue Google for not ranking high enough? Is that really the world we want? The second part of Warren's plan is to break up already consummated tech merger deals:Second, my administration would appoint regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers. Current antitrust laws empower federal regulators to break up mergers that reduce competition. I will appoint regulators who are committed to using existing tools to unwind anti-competitive mergers, including: Amazon: Whole Foods; ZapposFacebook: WhatsApp; InstagramGoogle: Waze; Nest; DoubleClick Unwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the market\u200a\u2014\u200awhich will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy.First of all, I should note that just recently lots of people were totally up in arms over Donald Trump supposedly trying to interfere[8] with the DOJ's analysis of the AT... Time Warner merger. And I'm curious if those people feel the same way about a potential President Warren announcing ahead of time -- without any actual investigation by a supposedly independent DOJ -- that it's okay to declare that they should be broken up? It certainly seems like the same form of bogus interference, even if for different reasons. The DOJ is supposed to be an independent agency for a reason. We shouldn't cheer when Donald Trump ignores that and we shouldn't cheer when any other President or Presidential candidate does it either. Second, while I might find myself much more supportive of a more aggressive DOJ that blocks future acquisitions by these companies, I'm not sure I see how the specifically listed divestiture plans would... do much of anything (with the one possible exception of Google/Doubleclick, which I'll get to). While I'm sure that Amazon, Facebook and Google would grumble about breaking off all of the others, for the most part, all of the listed divestitures involve companies that were mostly left alone and run as separate subsidiaries, which don't necessarily have much to do with any of those companies' core business. Sure, there might be some revenue or growth hits in spinning those off, but it doesn't really change their fundamental ways of doing business. Amazon loses Zappos? Meh. It'll still sell lots of shoes and maybe ramp up its efforts there in a way that ends up making Zappos tough to sustain by itself. Google loses Waze? Well, it already has Google Maps which probably has more users anyway. Facebook might be a little different, since Instagram and Whatsapp clearly seem to be a key part of Facebook's future strategy[9], but at least for now they're pretty separate. The Google Doubleclick one could be a bigger deal, since that is a core part of Google's business. Warren's \"plan\" talks about Google buying up DoubleClick as if that were done for anticompetitive reasons, and pretending that the DOJ \"waved through\" the deal while ignoring the monopoly issues, leaving out the fact that it happened way back in 2007 when the marketplace was very, very different, and Google's current position was far from certain. And while Doubleclick, as part of Google, may end up handling a lot of the ad serving market, there are tons of alternatives. The online ad market is crammed with tons and tons of companies. It's not difficult to find confusing maps[10] laying out the state of the market -- and many companies are looking to take down Google Doubleclick, which is often seen as the provider of last resort (it works, but the quality is shit and the payouts are worse). In other words, this entire plan gets headlines (duh) because so many people are (perhaps reasonably!) angry at the power of big tech companies. But, very little in the actual plan makes much sense. The \"platform utility\" idea will lead to massive, wasteful, stupid lawsuits. The unwinding of old mergers will involve interfering with an independent agency, and seem unlikely to do much to change the main \"concerns\" that Warren raises in the first place. And, again, none of this is to say we shouldn't be concerned about big internet companies with too much power. It's a perfectly reasonable concern, but just because you want to \"do something\" and \"this is something,\" doesn't mean that it's the something we should do. The way to attack the positions of these big internet companies is to enable more competition -- and you do that by encouraging alternatives in the marketplace. This is why I'm actually hopeful that some of these companies will actually start to explore an idea of moving to protocols, rather than owning the whole platform themselves, or that we'll see new protocols springing up. Meanwhile, if Warren were truly concerned about \"monopolies\" and a lack of competition, why isn't her plan looking at the lack of competition in the broadband and mobile markets -- cases where we have legitimate competition problems due to bad regulatory policies going back decades?Permalink[11] | Comments[12] | Email This Story[13] [ 1]: <url

Warren outlined a significant plan on Friday calling for Facebook, Amazon, and Google to be broken up, too. It's not the first time that Warren has expressed interest in breaking up Apple.On Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, outlined a sweeping proposal [1]to break up and regulate the largest tech companies. </p><p>Warren's plan specifically examined Facebook, Amazon, and Google, and asks them to eliminate marketplaces that limit competition and undo mega-mergers like Google's DoubleClick and Facebook's Instagram. She also said that new regulations wouldn't allow tech companies to share data with third parties. \"Today's big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" Warren wrote in a Medium post. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\" Read more: Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up the tech giants could give marketers more choice, but it also could cause 'unmitigated chaos'[2] While not mentioned in her proposal, the senator added Apple to the list of companies that she would like to have broken up. In an interview with The Verge published Saturday,[3] Warren said that Apple's business has the same problems as Amazon, Facebook, and Google: Apple runs its App Store and sells its own apps in it. \"Either they run the platform or they play in the store,\" she told The Verge. \"They don't get to do both at the same time.\" Apple has two competitive advantages with its control of the App Store that gives the company \"an enormous comparative advantage,\" she said: Data and preferential treatment for its own products. \"One, you've sucked up information about every buyer and every seller before you've made a decision about what you're going to sell,\" she said. \"And second, you have the capacity \u2014 because you run the platform \u2014 to prefer your product over anyone else's product. It gives an enormous comparative advantage to the platform.\" In addition to tech companies, Warren said that she also believes that Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal should be broken up. \"I'm already there. I'm clearly on record on it,\"[4] she told The Verge.Warren has called out Apple in the pastThis isn't the first time that Warren has zeroed in on Apple. In 2016, the Massachusetts senator said that Apple should pay more taxes [5]after the European Union ordered Apple to pay Ireland back more than $14 million in taxes after the tech company was paying a tax rate of 1 percent or lower. \"Now that they are feeling the sting from foreign tax crackdowns, giant corporations and their Washington lobbyists are pressing Congress to cut them a new sweetheart deal here at home,\" Warren wrote at the time. \"Giant corporations are pushing corporate tax reform proposals that offer a lower permanent tax rate for earnings generated abroad than earnings generated at home. That is nuts.\"NOW WATCH: Elon Musk sent a $100K Tesla Roadster to space a year ago. It has now traveled farther than any other car in history.[6]See Also: Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break up the tech giants could give marketers more choice, but it also could cause 'unmitigated

There do seem to be issues[3] with Big Tech. But is antitrust, as currently practiced, the best tool toaddress them? Ms. Warren contemplates this by suggesting a new regulatory regime should be implemented to control Big Tech. Should we treat platforms like a regulated utility? Should we pass a new antitrust law that supplements current common law and allows for more vigorous enforcement? Or are there tools available to modern antitrust that can address Big Tech and the issues Ms. Warren identifies? We ask those questions and suggest some high-level responses to further the dialogue. Ms. Warren's Views Ms. Warren thinks Big Tech has too much power over our economy, society and democracy. She feels that Big Tech has used their power to crush small business and innovation, and to substitute their financial interests for the interests of the American people. In particular, she believes Big Tech has used mergers to squelch new and innovative technology that might have challenged their dominance. And she believes Big Tech is abusing their dominance in platforms to expand their power in new markets. Her proposal is to regulate the platforms as utilities and require that they divest themselves of any interest in participants on those platforms. So, in the case of Google,for example, the law would force Google to cease to provide restaurant reviews that compete with the likes of Yelp. That would eliminate Google's incentive to promote its reviews over Yelp's. Under theproposed law, the utilities would be required to engage in fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with all participants. She says specifically:Amazon Marketplace, Google's ad exchange, and Google Search would be platform utilities under this law. Therefore, Amazon Marketplace and Basics, and Google's ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart. Google Search would have to be spun off as well.She also plans to sue to unwind consummated transactions: Amazon/Whole Foods; Amazon/Zappos; Facebook/What'sApp; Facebook/Instagram; Google/Waze; Google/Nest; Google/DoubleClick. She believes that people need more control over their personal information, content creators need to receive more value for their products, and to limit the ability of hostiles like Russia to use the platforms to subvert our political process. The Current Law Monopolies gained through superior product, business acumen, or historic accident are not illegal. To be illegal, one would have to demonstrate that Amazon, Facebook and Google were in fact a monopoly and engaged in exclusionary or anticompetitive conduct. Big Tech is going to argue that they invented their modes of business, and to the extent they have any market power, it's because of business acumen. They would also certainly argue that they have no market power. For example, Amazon's pricing New York Times Best Sellers below cost\u2014which some have called predatory\u2014could be described as a consumer benefit. E-commerce displaced the inefficient independent bookstore, the 'buggy whips' of the book business. Google's algorithm does appear to prefer its products over competitors but could be described as consumer-welfare enhancing. By getting to know people better and what they mean when they use particular words (and what they buy), Google can tailor the search answers uniquely to that person making their experience of the Internet better. And Facebook keeps you in touch with friends from whom you might otherwise never see or hear. Each of the mergers Ms. Warren describes were reviewed by the antitrust agencies. Under the law, the agencies asked whether the transaction substantially lessened competition or tended to create a monopoly. In a vertical merger, the main issue is foreclosure. Does one of the merging parties control some element of competition that a combined entity could use to disadvantage competitors. In horizontal mergers, does the combination allow the merged party to raise price or lower output. Ms. Warren appears to be arguing that the targets of Big Tech consistently play an outsized role in the competitiveness of the market by virtue of their maverick innovativeness, and that by acquiring them, Big Tech has attained or expanded their dominance. By unwinding these deals, presumably, that innovativeness and ultimately competition would be restored.. There are several issues with that approach. The first is that, barring a patent, Big Tech could have duplicated the functionality on its own site without the merger. This matters because Big Tech was already big. If the functionality is not protected by patent, Big Tech could have duplicated it. That means that the target really wasn't that competitive in the first place, and likely, under the theory, could have been displaced by Big Tech easily. The acquisition was a 'make or buy' decision which is usually afforded significant deference. The target's technology, if unprotected, can still be duplicated by other startups. The second is that the people who came up with the idea have taken their money and left. These people might not return to the target post divestiture. There's no way to know if a newly-liberated target would be the same competitive and innovative force as it was. Most of these targets were small at the time of acquisition. It would be difficult to know whether they would have become big had they had the opportunity. MySpace comes to mind. Courts would be reluctant to force a divestiture when the uncertainty of the value of the divestiture is so high. Lastly, courts are reluctant to unwind consummated deals, and, while there have been a few cases that discuss potential competition as part of a bigger ruling, none have been based on potential competition alone. So, in the case of Amazon/Whole Foods, Amazon was not a grocer of any merit before the deal, and Whole Foods did not have an ecommerce solution that sold trillions of products all over the world. There's some verticality in that Amazon may favor Whole Foods products over others on Amazon's platform, but the government would have to prove Amazon had market power in ecommerce and that the preference it might give itself would negatively impact other groceries that had no choice but to sell on Amazon's sites. These are tough cases to bring. How to Accomplish These Ends To constrain Big Tech, Ms. Warren suggests regulating them, perhaps by passing an FCC-enforced regime similar to, say, the Telecommunications Act of 1996. That legislation would be met by significant resistance by Big Tech but also more generally the free marketers who believe that regulation harms consumers by reducing incentives to innovate. She would also have to change substantive merger law and somehow get the rules to apply retroactively to these consummated transactions. Another option would be to create a new antitrust law that forbids, for example, 'undue concentrations of economic power.' 'Undue concentration' would be something less than monopoly or market power, and would not exempt from challenge those concentrations achieved through superior product, business acumen or historic accident. An undue concentration could occur in a merger that takes a market from 5 to 4 participants (one that normally isn't challenged now); that deprives a competitor of 'fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory' access to a 'necessary' platform ('essential facilities,' a current antitrust doctrine of access is almost gone from the courts); or pursues other socio-economically harmful outcomes otherwise outside the reach of the current antitrust laws. The standard would contemplate more than just consumer welfare or economic efficiency. The new law could also apply to mergers that 'substantially lessen innovation' to give enforcers tools to prevent the problem Ms. Warren sees in incumbent platforms buying up mavericks. This 'new law' approach would leave it to the courts to interpret, however. They might ultimately limit the new law much as the modern courts have limited the Sherman and Clayton Acts. But by making a new law that expressly takes into account variables beyond just consumer welfare, for example, Congress might be able to direct the courts more than they did under the existing laws. A New Theory of Predation There may be avenues with existing law as well. One of the first things Amazon did when it was starting up was to price New York Times Best Sellers below cost. Most independent book stores make money off the higher priced best-sellers. They use that to fund sales of mid- and backlist books (and other services like author signings or Harry Potter nights) which have much smaller margins. Essentially this model is a form of windowing, the same as you see with movies. You satisfy demand with the most price insensitive at higher prices first. Once that demand is satisfied, you move to another format and the next group consumers who are less price insensitive. You keep repeating this process over time so that demand is satisfied at prices that are optimal for those particular consumer clusters. The temporal quality makes it unnecessary to know who is in each window, a difficult process in a media-based market like books and movies. By collapsing the windows, Amazon is satisfying demand suboptimally. People who would pay more aren't. This would seem like a benefit. If Amazon is willing to reduce its profit by selling books below cost, more power to them. The price insensitive consumer surely benefits. And there doesn't appear to be any recoupment either. Amazon is still pricing below cost today. And entry barriers to bricks-and-mortar book stores are low. If Amazon did raise price, it could very well prompt meaningful entry. The market appears to be competitive. One might argue, however, that Amazon is not discounting books to dominate the bricks-and-mortar book world (although they recently entered the bricks-and-mortar). What they are doing is drawing desirable consumers to their platform so Amazon can extract their data. In essence, the below-cost pricing draws highly profitable, price insensitive consumers to their platform so that Amazon can observe their shopping habits. These are valuable consumers because they spend more. The more things they buy over time, the more Amazon will know about them and what they like. In essence, by observing you in as many possible transactions, and other 'situations,' as possible, they can create a fairly comprehensive understanding of what you want to buy, when and at what price. They observe you to perfect their understanding of the demand curves unique to you. They then sell access to those demand curves. There are benefits beyond just knowing who you are. If one has enough observations of enough people, one should be able to predict accurately the demand of others even if those others rarely use the site. Say I'm very private about what I buy on Amazon such that they only have a couple of observed events for me, a couple sales of shoes and a book. Say my neighbor is not. He buys many things, reads on Kindle, buys at Whole Foods, listens to Prime Music and watches Prime television shows. [1] But he buys a couple of the same things I do. By virtue of my one or two events and my neighbor's millions, Amazon now knows me. And I have no control over that. As a consequence, I cannot assess the value of my two interactions because I have no visibility into what they know about people like me. And my neighbor doesn't know the value of his data because he doesn't know how many others there are like him. Has he given Amazon a roadmap to a million consumers or a handful. This lack of visibility may also hide potential rents that might be occurring. Since consumers cannot value their data, they cannot judge whether the 50 percent discount they are getting on a Best Seller is more than the value of the data they are exchanging. Of course, it may be the case that those profits in data do not reflect monopoly rents at all but rather the result of an unfair bargain made with unsuspecting consumers. The high valuations, and profits, of these institutions suggest that they are reaping a considerable benefit from the data. The lack of visibility suggest that consumers are transferring more value than they can understand for their 'free' or 'discount' products. This is where the predation in platform industries can occur. Platforms drive out rivals in data-feeding markets not to raise price to consumers in that market, but to acquire consumers they can observe and develop more and more comprehensive understandings of their particular demand curves and those of similar people. Platform predators recoup their losses in data-feeder markets by selling access to the demand curves they've discovered. This scenario also presages a strong network effect. The more users, the more data, the more desirable the platform is to sellers. The more sellers, the more products to sell, the more things to observe, the more desirable the platform is to consumers. There should therefore be a tipping point.[2] The nature of the Internet also makes detection very difficult. In a bricks-and-mortar environment, you put a shoe on sale, everyone can see the sale. So, you have to wait until you've sold all the shoes you can at full price before you start discounting. Amazon can do it immediately. They know that Jack is price insensitive, so he will pay full price. They know that Bill is price sensitive, so they discount to Bill. But they can sell the same shoe to two different people at two different prices immediately, without waiting for demand to be satisfied in a particular window, because there's no way Jack will see the discounted price. Amazon can present a unique storefront to anyone at any time. This effectively eliminates the need for time-based windowing in retail. You can completely saturate a market at varying price points immediately.[3] And Amazon can sell this not only as a perk of their platform but as a marketing analytic tool. With this data, they can now predict an optimal price for a new product, how many products will sell, and who to sell them to. Facebook and Google do this as well through advertising. What do you click through and buy. Facebook is valuable because they correlate those commercial events with a great deal more about you personally. Facebook might know that your grandmother just died and serve you an advertisement for flowers. They might also know you like Donald Trump, would be receptive to advertisements for fringe political candidates and be able to sell ads to those candidates. Amazon may be a little better at selling to manufacturers because they are selling the actual things themselves. Facebook may be better at selling your 'psychological constellation' than your demand for a particular product since they aren't actually selling the product. They could enter into data sharing agreements with their advertisers where the seller provides that transaction data back to Facebook. A Potential Case Against Big Data The antitrust agencies have not been particularly receptive to arguments that Amazon's below-cost pricing is predatory, and seem to think that there can never be anti competitive predation in no-cost markets. The agencies may buy too readily the notion that consumers are benefiting from the lower prices or better advertising and more closely-tailored products. If consumers cannot know the value of the thing they are exchanging, they cannot know whether they've got a reasonable deal. The goal of 'predacious' Big Tech is to keep competitors in data-feeder markets out of the market to retain access to as many consumers, and events, as possible. The recoupment occurs when they monetize the data they extract. This theory could also be used to explain why data sharing between platforms can be anti competitive. Platforms innovate their platforms to acquire more and more meaningful consumer observations. Sharing data between them reduces competition between them to draw users to the platforms and provide innovative environments in which to observe them. It may also be a case ripe for a test of the unfairness doctrine under Section 5. Consumers cannot individually value their data in the hands of a particular platform because they don't and cannot know what other data the platform has. An individual's data could be worthless because they are very unique or highly valuable because there are many price insensitive consumers just like her. Such a case could expose the value of data, allow consumers some redress for their 'Cambridge Analytica' problems, force Big Tech to be more forthcoming about and, with a sufficiently large fine, disincentivize them from exploiting the data informational asymmetry going forward. The FTC might also want to initiate a 6(b) investigation into how Big Tech uses customer data to market to customers and to gain insight on how to value that data and whether consumers are being exploited. How do they use data; how much do they make from the data; how does one value the data individuals give up and in the collective; could there be a tipping point for big data; do data exchange agreements between big data harm competition. The FTC should include Bureau of Consumer Protection staff in their new Technology Task Force. Conclusion New regulatory legislation, a new antitrust statute, or bringing new cases using existing case law and theory, have upsides and downsides. Implementing these things can limit the ability of Big Tech to innovate or they could free innovation by limiting the ability of Big Tech to capture only those technologies that protect their dominance and to exploit consumers. It's a conversation worth having. The Gilded Age saw the birth of a tremendous disparity in wealth among our citizens. Antitrust was one means of restoring some economic balance to our society. Wealth disparity is now at the same levels if not greater than it was in the late 19th Century. It may be time to reconsider whether the contraction of antitrust into solely a question of economic efficiency was wise. The next President and Congress may very well do so. [1] The more Amazon knows about your preferences in any number of things, the more they know about you, the more easily they can compare you to others. It offers music and movies, for example, to create new points of comparison between people they know a lot about and others who don't participate that much on the platform. [2] This is likely why the market prices Walmart lower than Amazon. Walmart doesn't have a consumer data strategy nearly as comprehensive as Amazon. [3] This is also how the Russian trolls can spread political disinformation without meaningful detection. Facebook resembles a marketplace of ideas, where your friends gather and exchange ideas, where you hear news from your trusted news sources, and hear from your trusted organizations, like your church. But really Facebook controls everything you see, what messages you read. You are not in Speakers Corner. You alone are hearing what could be a very narrow band of ideas, curated by an entity that wants you to continue to engage on the platform so that it can continue to observe you, and perfect its knowledge of you, so it can sell you more things at higher prices. In essence, Facebook is free-riding off the trust and authority that your organizations. That trust infuses everything you see on Facebook. This issue, however, is economic vis--vis the commercial organizations, and a matter of consumer education in the case of users. People know how to tell the difference between a magazine like Weekly World News and Time when looking at a magazine stand. They learned that.

We also agree that there\u2019s reason to fear the power that Facebook and Google wield, or could wield someday.We\u2019re still not on board at the moment with Warren\u2019s idea that the federal government ought to break up the big tech companies. But, if we can half-agree on the problems, then we can certainly find some solutions on which we all agree.Here\u2019s our compromise proposal: Before we resort to breaking up big tech, how about we just stop propping<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>up big tech? Before cracking down on Amazon, Facebook, and Google, let\u2019s kill the public policies that rig the game in the favor of Amazon, Facebook, and Google.For example, a House committee last week passed a bill to set minimum wage at $15 an hour. Amazon, which recently agreed to pay its workers $15 an hour, is lobbying for this law in order to break its competitors who lack Amazon's volume and cannot operate on its tight margins. If you worry that Amazon is becoming too powerful, stop outlawing its smaller competitors by supporting the wage law that will outlaw its competitors' business model.In fact, all regulations and taxes that add to the cost of operating a brick-and-mortar store help Amazon by shutting down mom and pop businesses or preventing them from starting. Warren ought to examine the federal regulations that cripple Main Street, and try to alleviate that burden wherever possible, before resorting to the extremely invasive but occasionally necessary measure of breaking up a lawfully built company.If Amazon really is the bad guy, then why are so many in Congress eager to pass a federal Internet sales tax bill and net neutrality regulations that it favors? Net neutrality is a major lobbying priority for all three of Warren\u2019s boogeymen \u2014 Amazon, Facebook, and Google \u2014 because it freezes in place a business model that favors these giants. Passage of such a law does not seem like a great way to challenge their market dominance.Internet sales taxes are similar. Amazon already collects these taxes. That's why it is lobbying for a federal law to require all online retailers to collect them. Again, this is a measure designed to break Amazon's competition in the area of fulfillment. If a local bookstore gets out-of-state orders over the Internet, it would now be required to calculate, collect, and remit state taxes that until now were the sole responsibility of the out-of-state buyer. It is beyond the ability of most small businesses to calculate, collect, and remit taxes for thousands of different state and local jurisdictions nationwide. But Amazon can do it, and so this law enhances its advantage in the market. If Warren is really serious about battling Amazon\u2019s dominance, she can do it by opposing this bill.Finally, of course there are the rafts of corporate welfare state and local politicians offer the likes of Amazon. Does Warren have any pull with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio, or the Virginia Democrats who prostrated themselves before Amazon, offering billions in handouts and special targeted tax breaks?If Warren is serious, and if she really wants to curb the e-commerce giant's power, she should start by attacking the tax and regulatory subsidies the company is using to slant the playing field against its competitors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2191414497</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN6-KGV1-JBHT-D0N9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"566\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

Now shes making their break-up a key component of her presidential platform.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Warren has just released her plan for breaking up big tech, in what seems like a watershed moment for a Democratic nominee. Since Al Gore  famously (infamously?) invented the internet, Democratic candidates have turned away from serious regulation of technology companies, preferring instead to receive their campaign contributions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Eric Schmidt and Google donors were hugely important to the Obama campaign, and big tech companies were among his biggest supporters.</p><p>Now, Warren has said (on Medium no less) that the massive market power that Google, Facebook  and Amazon wield is a threat and will be treated accordingly.</p><p>Twenty-five years ago, Facebook, Google, and Amazon didnt exist, writes Warren. Now they are among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. Its a great storybut also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets.</p><p>The parallel she uses to make her case is the breakup of Microsoft, which she weirdly calls the tech giant of its time (Microsoft is still a tech giant), and holds as perhaps the last example when government went toe to toe with the technology industry.</p><p>The governments antitrust case against Microsoft helped clear a path for Internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge, Warren writes.</p><p>But now the companies that flourished in the wake of the Microsoft case have, themselves, become too powerful, she argues.</p><p>Theyve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation, writes Warren.</p><p>The key components of the Warren plan include passing legislation that would designate companies with annual global revenue above $25 billion that provide marketplace, exchange or third-party connectivity as platform utilities and prohibit those companies from owning participants on their platforms.</p><p>Its a dragnet that now encompasses Alphabet and Amazon (but I dont think it touches Facebook?). The new law would also be required to meet a standard of fair and non-discriminatory use with their users, and platforms would be restricted from sharing user data with third parties.</p><p>For companies with revenues below $25 billion, theyd be required to adhere to the fair use standard.</p><p>Warren would give state attorneys general and private parties the right to sue a platform for conduct that violates those requirements and the government could fine a company 5 percent of their annual revenue for violating the terms of the new legislation.</p><p>As Warren notes, Amazon Marketplace, Googles ad exchange, and Google Search would be platform utilities under this law. Therefore, Amazon Marketplace and Basics, and Googles ad exchange and businesses on the exchange would be split apart. Google Search would have to be spun off as well.</p><p>The second (and more aggressive) part of Warrens plan would be the appointment of regulators to roll back acquisitions that Warren deems anti-competitive. In Amazons case that means Whole Foods and Zappos  would have to be spun back out. Alphabet would have to unwind Googles acquisitions of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick (but not YouTube?), and Facebook would have to part with WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>Unwinding these mergers will promote healthy competition in the marketwhich will put pressure on big tech companies to be more responsive to user concerns, including about privacy, Warren writes.</p><p>Her call for regulation is a big moment for the tech industry; it should also serve as a wake-up call for these companies to do more than just pay lip service to the problems their dominance is causing in the marketplace.</p><p>As Warren writes:</p><p>We must give people more control over how their personal information is collected, shared, and soldand do it in a way that doesnt lock in massive competitive advantages for the companies that already have a ton of our data.</p><p>We must help Americas content creatorsfrom local newspapers and national magazines to comedians and musicianskeep more of the value their content generates, rather than seeing it scooped up by companies like Google and Facebook.</p><p>And we must ensure that Russiaor any other foreign powercant use Facebook or any other form of social media to influence our elections.</p><p>Those are each tough problems, but the benefit of taking these steps to promote competition is that it allows us to make some progress on each of these important issues too. More competition means more options for consumers and content creators, and more pressure on companies like Facebook to address the glaring problems with their businesses. 2019 Global Data Point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICTMOW-139949963</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICTMOW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM6-NF01-JDJN-63C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Global Data Point Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ICT Monitor Worldwide</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35460\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As the senators noted in the press release, under this bill, \"Equifax would have had to pay at least a $1.5 billion penalty for their failure to protect Americans' personal information.\"</p><p>The bill, the Data Breach Prevention and Compensation Act, would also establish a cybersecurity office at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \"tasked with annual inspections and supervision of cybersecurity at CRAs.\"</p><p>The stark penalties and regular reviews could incentivize financial services companies to invest in good cybersecurity and avoide breaches of their users' personal information. Cybersecurity is a growing problem in several industries as companies digitize, collecting ever-increasing amounts of data on their users and customers, and then storing that data in the cloud, which many experts fear is too easily compromised.</p><p>Warner and Warren introduced the bill right before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs committee hearing on privacy and data collection on Tuesday, where members of the committee slammed financial services and social media companies alike for playing fast and loose with consumer data.</p><p>\"Equifax put 150 million Americans' info out there, they took a small dip in the stock market, and the fact that they haven't paid a penalty or a fine is outrageous,\" Warner said at the hearing.</p><p>Maciej Ceglowski, founder of Pinboard, a web service that allows you to organize and keep track of your bookmarked webpages, told senators at the hearing that tech companies across financial services and social media industries need regulation because they've broken consumers' and regulators' trust.</p><p>\"As a small businessman in a big industry, I fear we are losing the trust of our users,\" he said. \"People are being asked to make irrecoverable decisions about their online lives over and over again. The pattern that I've seen in my industry is one of deceit. We're not honest about what we collect, what we use it for, and we are ashamed, frankly, of our business models. You'll never get someone from Google or Facebook to speak honestly about what they're doing with your data.\"</p><p>U.S. regulation doesn't incentivize businesses to innovate in a consumer-friendly way, he said, which only feeds the problem.</p><p>\"They don't like regulation and see a way around it,\" he said. \"We don't like banking regulation, so we invent cryptocurrency. We don't like anti-discrimination regulation, so we use machine learning and blame the algorithm.\"</p><p>Even the European Union's GDPR, often heralded as a consumer-friendly privacy regulation, may not be truly consumer friendly. Silicon Valley wants GDPR-like rules in the U.S., but Ceglowski said that might not be the best route for U.S. consumers.</p><p>GDPR is \"a weapon by those who don't want their data practices examined,\" he said, because websites and tech companies \"bludgeon\" consumers with hundreds of notifications with opt-in requirements to track or collect potentially sensitive data. When they're bombarded with all those notifications, he said, they're not going to read them, which means tech companies still control the process and consumers still can't really avoid tracking or data collection.</p><p>But Warner and Warren's bill could force tech companies to change how they handle consumers' data.</p><p>Lindsay Gorman, an adjunct fellow with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and CEO of Politech Advisory, previously worked on Warner's tech policy staff and said this bill is \"definitely a test case for other industries.\"</p><p>\"I think it's pretty good, it's tackling one problem,\" Gorman told InsideSources. \"Legislation that shores up cybersecurity when there may not be a compelling business case for leaks and hacks to be reported and no business interest to doing that, we really need an incentive. There's also a collection action problem. Our cybersecurity is only as strong as the individual players, like Equifax. There are massive vulnerabilities, in healthcare, the automotive sector. I think this is one way of trying to incentivize investment in cybersecurity that might not be at the top of a company's priority list.\"</p><p>As industries like financial services, healthcare and auto continue to digitize, she said, they're not necessarily thinking about cybersecurity or protecting consumers' data. This bill incentivizes investment, which is good not only for the cybersecurity industry, but for the companies and consumers they serve.</p><p>\"It's not because [some companies] are doing anything wrong in the present, but because it hasn't really been part of the threat model,\" Gorman said. \"Hospitals care deeply about protecting private medical data, but when you have 23andMe and DNA companies storing ostensibly personal information, a lot of them are startups. Have they invested in cybersecurity and the resources they need? I think that's a bit open.\"</p><p>The bill also shows another side of how Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate, may address tech-related issues if she wins the White House. Warren already said she wants to use antitrust law to break up Big Tech, but this bill shows Silicon Valley isn't the only industry she plans to rebuke and rein in if she perceives harm to consumers.</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

Elizabeth Warren introduced new legislation today that would hold corporate executives criminally liable when their companies experience major data breaches, engage in criminal activity or cause widespread consumer harm.</p><p>The Corporate Executive Accountability Act,\u00a0which Warren teased Tuesday in a Washington Post op-ed, would hold criminally liable the executives of any corporations making more than $1 billion annually in the event that their companies break the law or harm large portions of Americans or state residents in civil violations.</p><p>Any civil violation of federal state law that occurred during an executive\u2019s tenure \u201cthat affects the health, safety finances or personal data\u201d of either 1 percent of the U.S. populace or 1 percent of a state\u2019s populace could face up to a year of jail time and additional fines for the first violation. Executives of companies that commit additional offenses could face jail time of up to three years.</p><p>\u201cCorporations don\u2019t make decisions, people do, but for far too long, CEOs of giant corporations that break the law have been able to walk away, while consumers who are harmed are left picking up the pieces,\u201d Warren said in a statement announcing the bill.</p><p>Warren, a consumer rights advocate and Wall Street foe who has long pushed for more stringent laws regulating U.S. corporations, announced the legislation in tandem with the re-introduction of another bill. That bill would hold big bank executives responsible for making sure their companies are not breaking the law and would give the U.S. government more authority to prosecute financial crimes.</p><p>The Corporate Executive Accountability Act will likely face opposition in the Republican-held Senate and from Democrats with close ties to big business, but it\u2019s part of Warren\u2019s sustained focus on corporate America, which she has said faces few penalties in the event of corporate misdeeds.</p><p>\u201cIf top executives knew they would be hauled out in handcuffs for failing to reasonably oversee the companies they run, they would have a real incentive to better monitor their operations and snuff out any wrongdoing before it got out of hand,\u201d Warren wrote in the Post prior to the bill\u2019s release.</p><p>Earlier this year, Warren proposed breaking up big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google. Today\u2019s legislation is a sign that Warren is keeping the heat on major industries, including the tech industry, which makes billions every year off targeted advertising and has experienced major data breaches that exposed the personal information of millions of their customers.</p><p>The potential impact wouldn\u2019t stop at big tech: data brokers like Experian, brands like Target and media giants like Sony have all experienced massive data breaches in recent years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1036185</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT7-2PT1-DYRK-H55S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"458\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 3, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Then the fracking revolution came about, and the U.S. resumed its long-lost place as the world\u2019s No. 1 oil and natural gas producer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The result: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart\">lower oil prices</url> for American consumers,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart\">less dependence on petrodespots</url>, a dramatic       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart\">shift from coal to natural gas</url> for electricity generation (with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart\">concomitant benefits in carbon emissions</url>), and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart\">hundreds of thousands of working-class jobs</url>, including tens of thousands in swing states like Colorado and Pennsylvania. </p><p>Elizabeth Warren wants to kill all this.</p><p>You don\u2019t have to think that fracking is an unalloyed blessing \u2014 much less deny that tough safety standards are necessary \u2014 to acknowledge its benefits. You might also argue that curbs on oil and gas production are needed both to preserve the environment and accelerate a transition to renewables. Fine.</p><p>Yet it takes a peculiar sort of political audacity to pledge, as the Massachusetts senator did last month, to \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart\">ban fracking \u2014 everywhere</url>.\u201d Warren also favors a ban on fossil-fuel exports \u2014 another U.S. industry that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart\">has seen dramatic growth in recent years</url>\u2014 and a \u201ctotal moratorium\u201d on new fossil fuel leases on federal lands, which generate billions every year in federal and state tax revenue.</p><p>American Indian tribes <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart\">also got about $1 billion</url> from those leases in 2018. Isn\u2019t the Warren campaign supposed to be about sticking it to richer Americans instead of poorer ones?</p><p>That\u2019s a question that would-be Warren supporters might ask a little more insistently as she approaches front-runner status.</p><p>Take health care. As an ethical matter, it may be defensible for Warren to argue that Medicare for All is fairer than the current system. As an economic matter, she could be right that overall costs will come down under her scheme. And as a political matter, it isn\u2019t surprising that she has been less than forthright about the middle-class tax increases her plan will require.</p><p>But what about the fact that Warren isn\u2019t merely proposing a dramatic change in the way 170 million or so Americans obtain health insurance? She is advocating the abolition of an entire industry, one that employs approximately 550,000 people. Whatever one thinks of health-insurance companies (and most Americans seem <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart\">satisfied with the coverage they have</url>), isn\u2019t it worth wondering what these half-million workers might do with themselves after being put out of work \u2014 or, as voters, what they might think of Warren\u2019s designs for their future? </p><p>Then there\u2019s big tech, another industry Warren doesn\u2019t like and promises to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart\">\u201cbreak up\u201d by turning Facebook, Amazon and Google into regulated utilitie</url>s. For this task, involving some 800,000 workers and companies with about $500 billion in revenues, she has \u2026 a 1,700-word plan.</p><p>One wonders what Warren thinks might happen when things don\u2019t work out. Industries aren\u2019t assemblages of Lego blocks that can be taken apart and reassembled according to a clever new design. They are complex and evolving ecosystems, organized around scores of institutions, hundreds of laws, thousands of personalities, millions of relationships, and a potentially limitless number of ideas. </p><p>What will happen to the real human beings whose lives and careers will be upended or derailed while the mandarins of the Warren administration try to figure things out? Will President Warren have contingency plans for her ever-proliferating plans when \u2014 as they inevitably will \u2014 things don\u2019t go according to plan?</p><p>Of course she won\u2019t. She won\u2019t because she can\u2019t; she can\u2019t because the central flaw of every economic plan is the plan itself. That\u2019s the lesson of the 20th century, and it\u2019s why Warren\u2019s critics aren\u2019t totally off the mark in accusing her of being a socialist \u2014 not in intent, but in mentality. Those with plans for everything prove only that they can\u2019t be trusted to plan for anything.</p><p>Voters may not yet see this, which is why Warren has risen in the polls. But they will, eventually, especially when they notice what the senator\u2019s plans entail for them. It\u2019s one thing for a Democratic politician to promise, as Barack Obama once did, to \u201cspread the wealth around\u201d \u2014 but only when \u201cwealth\u201d and \u201cwealthy\u201d mean the same thing. The Warren standard is to spread your wealth around whether you\u2019re wealthy or not.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart\">In a recent column</url>, my colleague David Brooks posed a difficult and necessary question: If the choice is Trump or Warren, what then? David\u2019s answer is that one would have to choose Warren, for the sake of democracy. Maybe he\u2019s right. But voters tend to place their personal interests ahead of their political ideals. And, other than Bernie Sanders, no Democratic candidate would more richly tempt Americans to vote the former than Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>For the sake of democracy, let\u2019s hope Democrats give America a better, safe, easier choice.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2480/brent-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

Warren is expected to introduce the Senate version of the bill\u00a0while Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., will introduce a House companion. It was unclear when the bill would be introduced.</p><p>According to draft legislation (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-12-04/warren-drafts-legislation-reverse-mega-mergers\">https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-12-04/warren-drafts-legislation-reverse-mega-mergers</url>) obtained by\u00a0 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-04/warren-is-drafting-u-s-legislation-to-reverse-mega-mergers\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-04/warren-is-drafting-u-s-legislation-to-reverse-mega-mergers</url>) Bloomberg News , Warren's bill would alter the current antitrust approach, which is based on the consumer welfare standard, assessing\u00a0the impact of mergers, primarily through their impact on prices and quality of\u00a0 products or services. Warren's legislation would instead task regulators with reviewing mergers with different criteria, including the\u00a0impact workers and innovation, and\u00a0empower regulators\u00a0to reverse mergers that have occurred in\u00a0the past two decades.</p><p>The bill would also propose a ban on future mergers -- with a few exceptions, like when a company is in danger of insolvency -- when one company involved has annual revenue greater than $40 billion or when both of the companies involved have sales of topping $15 billion a year.</p><p>Some critics of the legislation say it is unlikely ever to be adopted.\u00a0</p><p>\"The way I read it is that Elizabeth Warren is trying to make a political statement in the course of her campaign,\" Barak Orbach, a law professor at the University of Arizona, told Bloomberg. \"It's likely to have negative effects on antitrust enforcement, so I just don't see the upside other than for the campaign.\"</p><p>Warren has indeed made antitrust enforcement a major theme of her presidential campaign.

They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.

But corporations generally provided their workers with pensions and health insurance and kept executive salaries in reasonable proportion; expected hard bargaining with vigorous unions; and understood that a Darwinian capitalism which devalued employees was destructive to social cohesion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Beginning in the 1970s, this model was overtaken by a model of corporate leadership \u2014 popularized by Milton Friedman \u2014 focused exclusively on maximizing shareholder value through deregulation, tax cuts, gutting unions, lowering wages, and overpaying themselves for slashing benefits and downsizing their workforce.</p><p> The result? Stunted earnings and a decline in net worth for the typical American family \u2014 a sort of socialism in reverse which redistributed income upwards and replaced corporate citizenship with shareholder sociopathy armed with disproportionate political power.</p><p> Young people today are particularly vulnerable \u2014 burdened by student loans; working for peanuts in insecure jobs without building assets. Little wonder that more millennials express an openness to socialism.</p><p> Now comes Elizabeth Warren to save capitalism.</p><p> She bristles with arresting plans for making society fairer and more inclusive. Necessarily, this includes how to raise more money \u2014 including a 2 percent annual wealth tax on households whose net worth exceeds $50 million, and 3 percent on those over $1 billion. By her estimate, this would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years from roughly 75,000 families \u2014 less than 0.1 percent of American households.</p><p> Read more commentary:</p><p> Elizabeth Warren didn't miss her presidential moment. Win or lose, 2020 is her time.</p><p> Warren's toothless break-up plan ignores real Big Tech threats</p><p> Joe Biden's 2020 nightmare: He could be the Democratic reincarnation of Jeb Bush</p><p> To what end? While Warren has joined the chorus for \"single payer health care,\" she acknowledges cheaper alternatives for achieving universal coverage. More distinctive, she proposes that the government manufacture affordable generic drugs where the marketplace fails to provide them; increase home ownership by helping build or rehabilitate affordable housing; and meet the needs of working families by providing universal childcare \u2014 paid for by increased productivity and, in an ideal world, by the passage of her wealth tax.</p><p> Making corporations accountable</p><p> Uniquely, she spotlights the pre-tax distribution of economic gains: how the marketplace functions, or malfunctions, before the government starts taxing and spending. Through a sweeping program of reforms which are fiscally affordable \u2014 no small thing \u2014 Warren would ground corporate decision-making in a far-sighted ethic that transcends the accretion of shareholder value and political power.</p><p> Her Accountable Capitalism Act requires that large corporations obtain a charter of corporate citizenship which codifies their broader obligations to society; that employees select 40 percent of board members; that executives hold shares they receive as compensation for at least five years; and that 75 per of shareholders and directors approve corporate political activity.</p><p> Similarly, her Climate Risk Disclosure Act mandates corporations to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions; their ownership of fossil-fuel related assets; and their strategy for ameliorating the physical and regulatory risks posed by climate change.</p><p> Further, she would increase competition by using antitrust laws to prevent corporate behemoths like Amazon, Facebook and Google from crushing competitors; protect consumers by policing financial institutions, strengthening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and prosecuting white-collar criminals; and empower workers by safeguarding unions, curbing mandatory arbitration and non-compete clauses in employment contracts, and raising the minimum wage.</p><p> Finally, she would ban selected federal officials from owning individual stock or later pursuing lobbying careers; require that the president and vice president place assets which raise potential conflicts of interest into a blind trust; compel them to release their tax returns; ban direct political donations from lobbyists to legislators; require lobbyists to disclose the interests they represent and their meetings with public officials; and create an independent agency to enforce and investigate ethics violations.</p><p> Saving capitalism from itself</p><p> In her telling, Warren is a \"capitalist to my bones,\" who would free markets from the dominance of the wealthy few; break the corrupt nexus between government and special interests; restore a vibrant middle class; and broaden economic opportunity. She's not Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed \"democratic socialist\" who imagines restructuring our economy by sparking an unlikely \"political revolution.\" She's Franklin Roosevelt, bent on saving capitalism for all \u2014 and from itself.</p><p> As with Roosevelt, wealthy interests often despise her \u2014 both for de-emphasizing shareholder value and funding programs for average Americans by taxing four decades of wealth appropriated by the top 0.1 percent. But their monopolization of economic and political power serves neither capitalism nor democracy.</p><p> If wresting the Electoral College from Donald Trump is Job 1, the question of whether Democrats should entrust it to an ardent blue-state progressive \u2014 let alone one whose \"native American\" problem, however tangential \u2014 has the nettlesome persistence of kudzu. While a feisty stump speaker, Warren lacks the blue-collar appeal of Joe Biden or the loose-limbed charm of Beto O'Rourke; her campaign should confiscate forthwith the tapes of Kate McKinnon's killer parody. She can stoop to the short-sighted pander: though Warren surely knows better, to win over base voters she embraced the vapid slogan \"abolish ICE\" \u2014 preposterous as policy and, as purple-state electoral politics, crack-smoking lunacy.</p><p> Still, most people get that Warren is onto something big. Corporate reform and a wealth tax speak to the basic American ideal of fairness. Faced with Trump's accusations of \"socialism,\" Democrats might do well to counter as Elizabeth Warren has: that true capitalism must serve the many, and that true democracy should be lived every day in the homes and workplaces of ordinary Americans.</p><p> Richard North Patterson, a political commentator and best-selling novelist, is a former chairman of Common Cause, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a board member of the bipartisan Renew Democracy Initiative.</p><p> This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Elizabeth Warren wants to save capitalism, but first she'd have to beat Donald Trump</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-7c29b460bdd56f3daf159fd1d1de3ff7315e2df</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5F6E919BEC NWBKPA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRV-GX41-DXVP-V0JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1142\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily American<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

But corporations generally provided their workers with pensions and health insurance and kept executive salaries in reasonable proportion; expected hard bargaining with vigorous unions; and understood that a Darwinian capitalism which devalued employees was destructive to social cohesion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Beginning in the 1970s, this model was overtaken by a model of corporate leadership \u2014 popularized by Milton Friedman \u2014 focused exclusively on maximizing shareholder value through deregulation, tax cuts, gutting unions, lowering wages, and overpaying themselves for slashing benefits and downsizing their workforce.</p><p> The result? Stunted earnings and a decline in net worth for the typical American family \u2014 a sort of socialism in reverse which redistributed income upwards and replaced corporate citizenship with shareholder sociopathy armed with disproportionate political power.</p><p> Young people today are particularly vulnerable \u2014 burdened by student loans; working for peanuts in insecure jobs without building assets. Little wonder that more millennials express an openness to socialism.</p><p> Now comes Elizabeth Warren to save capitalism.</p><p> She bristles with arresting plans for making society fairer and more inclusive. Necessarily, this includes how to raise more money \u2014 including a 2 percent annual wealth tax on households whose net worth exceeds $50 million, and 3 percent on those over $1 billion. By her estimate, this would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years from roughly 75,000 families \u2014 less than 0.1 percent of American households.</p><p> Read more commentary:</p><p> Elizabeth Warren didn't miss her presidential moment. Win or lose, 2020 is her time.</p><p> Warren's toothless break-up plan ignores real Big Tech threats</p><p> Joe Biden's 2020 nightmare: He could be the Democratic reincarnation of Jeb Bush</p><p> To what end? While Warren has joined the chorus for \"single payer health care,\" she acknowledges cheaper alternatives for achieving universal coverage. More distinctive, she proposes that the government manufacture affordable generic drugs where the marketplace fails to provide them; increase home ownership by helping build or rehabilitate affordable housing; and meet the needs of working families by providing universal childcare \u2014 paid for by increased productivity and, in an ideal world, by the passage of her wealth tax.</p><p> Making corporations accountable</p><p> Uniquely, she spotlights the pre-tax distribution of economic gains: how the marketplace functions, or malfunctions, before the government starts taxing and spending. Through a sweeping program of reforms which are fiscally affordable \u2014 no small thing \u2014 Warren would ground corporate decision-making in a far-sighted ethic that transcends the accretion of shareholder value and political power.</p><p> Her Accountable Capitalism Act requires that large corporations obtain a charter of corporate citizenship which codifies their broader obligations to society; that employees select 40 percent of board members; that executives hold shares they receive as compensation for at least five years; and that 75 per of shareholders and directors approve corporate political activity.</p><p> Similarly, her Climate Risk Disclosure Act mandates corporations to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions; their ownership of fossil-fuel related assets; and their strategy for ameliorating the physical and regulatory risks posed by climate change.</p><p> Further, she would increase competition by using antitrust laws to prevent corporate behemoths like Amazon, Facebook and Google from crushing competitors; protect consumers by policing financial institutions, strengthening the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and prosecuting white-collar criminals; and empower workers by safeguarding unions, curbing mandatory arbitration and non-compete clauses in employment contracts, and raising the minimum wage.</p><p> Finally, she would ban selected federal officials from owning individual stock or later pursuing lobbying careers; require that the president and vice president place assets which raise potential conflicts of interest into a blind trust; compel them to release their tax returns; ban direct political donations from lobbyists to legislators; require lobbyists to disclose the interests they represent and their meetings with public officials; and create an independent agency to enforce and investigate ethics violations.</p><p> Saving capitalism from itself</p><p> In her telling, Warren is a \"capitalist to my bones,\" who would free markets from the dominance of the wealthy few; break the corrupt nexus between government and special interests; restore a vibrant middle class; and broaden economic opportunity. She's not Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed \"democratic socialist\" who imagines restructuring our economy by sparking an unlikely \"political revolution.\" She's Franklin Roosevelt, bent on saving capitalism for all \u2014 and from itself.</p><p> As with Roosevelt, wealthy interests often despise her \u2014 both for de-emphasizing shareholder value and funding programs for average Americans by taxing four decades of wealth appropriated by the top 0.1 percent. But their monopolization of economic and political power serves neither capitalism nor democracy.</p><p> If wresting the Electoral College from Donald Trump is Job 1, the question of whether Democrats should entrust it to an ardent blue-state progressive \u2014 let alone one whose \"native American\" problem, however tangential \u2014 has the nettlesome persistence of kudzu. While a feisty stump speaker, Warren lacks the blue-collar appeal of Joe Biden or the loose-limbed charm of Beto O'Rourke; her campaign should confiscate forthwith the tapes of Kate McKinnon's killer parody. She can stoop to the short-sighted pander: though Warren surely knows better, to win over base voters she embraced the vapid slogan \"abolish ICE\" \u2014 preposterous as policy and, as purple-state electoral politics, crack-smoking lunacy.</p><p> Still, most people get that Warren is onto something big. Corporate reform and a wealth tax speak to the basic American ideal of fairness. Faced with Trump's accusations of \"socialism,\" Democrats might do well to counter as Elizabeth Warren has: that true capitalism must serve the many, and that true democracy should be lived every day in the homes and workplaces of ordinary Americans.</p><p> Richard North Patterson, a political commentator and best-selling novelist, is a former chairman of Common Cause, a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a board member of the bipartisan Renew Democracy Initiative.</p><p> This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Elizabeth Warren wants to save capitalism, but first she'd have to beat Donald Trump</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMD-b4c02d34d98979812aa8a55bd24f28973689b887</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5FFB38D3AE NWBKMD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRV-9P01-JBCN-44RB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409144</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1142\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Herald-Mail.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

If elected, she has said she will appoint regulators to undo anti-competitive tech mergers.[10] Bernie Sanders raised the second largest amount of money in Silicon Valley, about $155,000, according to the Bloomberg report by Eric Newcomer and Bill Allison that analyzed Federal Election Commission data. Sanders said that he \"absolutely\" supports breaking up big tech[11], and he has a plan to implement partial employee ownership[12] of all large companies, which would affect these tech companies. Read more: Mark Zuckerberg and his wife have reportedly been privately recommending hires for the Buttigieg campaign[13] Pete Buttigieg, who Bloomberg reported ranked third in Silicon Valley donations, has anotably different position[14] on big tech from those of Warren and Sanders. </p><p>Buttigieg does not plan to break up big tech companies, although he has mentioned worries about privacy and data ownership[15]. On Monday, Bloomberg reported[16] that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been privately recommending campaign hires[17] for Buttigieg. So far, 2 of the recommendations have been hired.The Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg campaigns did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Warren has pledged not to accept large donations from tech executives[18]. Her campaign has been in contact with Facebook, Zuckerberg told NBC Nightly News[19]. Zuckerberg has not spoken to Warren himself, but he says the company has been in contact over her concerns about its misinformation policies.[20] Bloomberg looked at contributions from ten large tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Apple[21], to arrive at these numbers. Employees at Google parent company Alphabet Inc. were the biggest donors, followed by Microsoft. Contributions from employees at all ten companies totalled about $752,000.NOW WATCH: How Area 51 became the center of alien conspiracy theories[22]See Also: Millennials love plants so much it's

The game allows users to find, capture, battle, and train virtual creatures, called Pok\u00e9mon, that are superimposed over real world locations on their mobile device, such as an iPhone or an Android. The game uses the camera and GPS system on the phones to superimpose creatures on top of whatever surroundings the camera scans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The town has contracted with Nucleus Augmented Reality, a West Hartford start-up that will act as an agent for the town in negotiating advertisements that could be superimposed on town property via augmented reality applications.</p><p> First Selectwoman Lori Spielman said the agreement would allow the town to make money from advertising revenue if brands such as Coca-Cola, for example, want to advertise within augmented reality games played in Ellington.</p><p> The agreement does not cost the town any money, but the agency representing the town will earn a commission on any advertising revenue the town brings in.</p><p>Ellington is one of four towns in Connecticut that have entered into agreements with Nucleus Augmented Reality. The others are Coventry, Plainville, and New London.</p><p> Adam Reiser, director of augmented reality business development at the agency, said the augmented reality industry is still in its infancy and has yet to realize its full potential.</p><p> He said there are no offers yet to put augmented reality advertisements anywhere in Ellington.</p><p> \"We just want to get out in front of it and make sure we have control,\" he said.</p><p> Reiser explained that as the industry develops, the town could be compared to social media networks such as Facebook that host advertisements.</p><p> \"It's just another way to combat big tech a little bit,\" he said. \"This regulation and oversight needs to happen, and it'll be good to be in front of it for once.\"</p><p> Though ultimately the town voted to enter into a contract with the agency, the selectmen were not all in agreement that they should move forward.</p><p> The motion to enter into a contract with Reiser's agency passed in a 3-2 vote, with two selectmen abstaining during the selectmen's meeting Monday at the senior center. Spielman, David Stavens and John Turner voted in favor; Sarah Cook and Ronald Stomberg voted against; and Melinda Ferry and James Prichard abstained.</p><p> \"This is a brand new arena where there is limited data to make a decision that is in the best interest of our town,\" Cook said. \"I felt signing a contract was premature.\"</p><p> Cook said she would have liked to learn more about the industry, and said she felt \"doing a little more research would have been a better decision.\"</p><p> Ferry, who abstained from the vote, felt similarly about the contract. Ferry said she was conflicted because she felt she didn't know enough about the industry, but she did think Reisner was \"very entrepreneurial.\"</p><p> She added that she had hoped the selectmen could have had a third party advise them on the matter before a decision was made, and she'd hoped the decision could have been tabled.</p><p> Stomberg and Prichard could not be reached for comment.</p><p> The motion stipulates that \"before any agreement for augmented reality is signed with a third party or network, that the Planning and Zoning Commission adopt appropriate regulations regarding signage.\"</p><p> Town Planner Lisa Houlihan said it's a zoning issue, and that the commission has already discussed the potential of augmented reality advertising and gotten input from the town attorney.</p><p> Houlihan said it was agreed that augmented reality advertising would fall under the zoning rules for temporary signage, and that the commission would have to amend its regulations accordingly.</p><p> \"I definitely think we're venturing into new territory,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-25dd1bfe523ab9e857e83ffa73045e5dab87033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289799ED94ADE7 NWBKCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XG8-1K51-DXVP-V0J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Journal Inquirer Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.
