About a decade ago, that is. The fellow of London think tank Demos grew increasingly worried about what was happening under Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the rest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally he confessed to a mild panic about the industry and opened his most recent book with these words: \"In the coming few years either tech will destroy democracy and the social order as we know it, or politics will stamp its authority over the digital world.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech has had 23 years to do exactly what Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg urged in his company's old motto: \"Move fast and break things.\"</p><p>Because the tech firms haven't just had an unbounded Wild West opportunity to roam and raid unregulated territory. Twenty-three years ago, the US Congress passed a law that actually suspended the normal operation of law so that the tech industry could have unique advantages.It was section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act that cast a magical protective spell to give the tech companies a special immunity - they're not responsible for what others put on their platforms. Other countries, afraid of seeming uncool and anti-innovation, generally followed America's lead.</p><p>So the tech firms moved fast and broke a lot of things and now the governments of the world have had enough. They're no longer quirky, fun, garage start-ups. They are among the biggest and most ruthless corporations on the planet. Google's parent, Alphabet, for instance, has a share market value three times that of entertainment behemoth Walt Disney, six times that of the biggest Australian company, BHP Billiton, and 140 times that of the New York Times Company.</p><p>Do they really need special legislative immunity from the consequences of their businesses any longer? Consequences like the propaganda and recruitment successes of the terrorist army Daesh, or Islamic State. Or the Russian government's subversion of US elections and democracy everywhere. Consequences like the exponential proliferation of child abuse images.</p><p>And the US Congress didn't actually grant them immunity from paying tax on their earnings - that's a little extra liberty the tech firms granted themselves. After 23 years, the reckoning has arrived. The Australian government is at the forefront. It started four years ago with the Office of the e-Safety Commissioner, a world first designed to protect kids from cyberbullying and other web-borne harms. Now it also removes revenge porn from the web. It's been a success, which is why other nations are studying it and the tech companies are lobbying to curb it.</p><p>Australia's e-Safety Commissioner, Julie Inman-Grant, started her tech involvement with Microsoft when the tech industry could do no wrong: \"Fast forward two decades and the policy pendulum is definitely swinging the other way, with calls in the US for section 230 to be repealed and governments across the world seriously contemplating whether the internet industry should be more closely regulated,\" she told the National Press Club in Canberra last year.</p><p>Incidentally, if you do a Google search for more on America's section 230, you'll find a set of self-serving results. You'll find more objective information if you use a non-profit search engine, such as duckduckgo.com.</p><p>\"I'm proud to say that I believe it is now Australia that is leading the way in terms of regulating the social media industry for the content and conduct that takes place on these platforms,\" Inman-Grant said.</p><p>Three other examples. First. After an Australian man walked into two Christchurch mosques in March and murdered 51 people in a hate crime partially livecast on Facebook, Scott Morrison joined his New Zealand counterpart, Jacinda Ardern, to get a G-20 agreement to work towards the elimination of terrorist and violent extremist content online. The G-7 summit in France next month will develop the theme. France's President Emmanuel Macron invited Morrison and Ardern in recognition of their leadership.</p><p>Second. The Australian Tax Commissioner, Chris Jordan, had a gutful of big multinational firms dodging their Australian taxes. He went after the big mining firms too, but the tech companies were the main target. They were collecting billions in Australian sales but booking the revenue through low-tax subsidiaries in Ireland or Singapore. In four years, armed with new laws and a hand-picked taskforce, he's got the multinationals booking an extra $7 billion of revenue a year in Australia. And paying tax on it in Australia. Recently, some European governments have reached the same breaking point and announced new tax regimes specifically to target the tax-dodging tech titans.</p><p>Third. Last week the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission delivered its final report into digital platforms. Its chair, Rod Sims, spoke of \"many adverse effects\" that flow from the market dominance wielded by Google and Facebook in particular. In neat symmetry, the commission delivered 23 recommendations for action to protect Australia from some of those effects, one for each year of the era of untrammelled techxploitation. The Morrison government immediately agreed to one of the 23 - for the ACCC to create special branch to protect online privacy and prevent abuse of market power - and is considering the other 22.</p><p>There are two big caveats. First is that while Australia's government can be proud that it is leading in the much-needed regulation of Big Tech, it should also be working to allow Australian business to lead in innovation, as well. Second is that all these initiatives are positive, but they are piecemeal and partial. For instance, none of the Australian measures address Jamie Bartlett's larger worry - the \"manipulation, endless distraction and the slow diminishing of free choice and autonomy\" that Big Tech delivers.</p><p>Is Bartlett's mild panic giving way to paranoia perhaps? Read what Google's then boss, Eric Schmidt, said in 2010 and make up your own mind: \"You give us more information about you, about your friends, and we can improve the quality of our services. We don't need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you've been. We can more or less know what you're thinking about.\"</p><p>That's not creepy at all.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Hartcher is international editor.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520160962</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP6-9SB1-JBJ7-N44W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1043\"/><timeReceived>09:35 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

About a decade ago, that is. The fellow of London think tank Demos grew increasingly worried about what was happening under Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the rest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally he confessed to a mild panic about the industry and opened his most recent book with these words: \"In the coming few years either tech will destroy democracy and the social order as we know it, or politics will stamp its authority over the digital world.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech has had 23 years to do exactly what Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg urged in his company's old motto: \"Move fast and break things.\"</p><p>Because the tech firms haven't just had an unbounded Wild West opportunity to roam and raid unregulated territory. Twenty-three years ago, the US Congress passed a law that actually suspended the normal operation of law so that the tech industry could have unique advantages.It was section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act that cast a magical protective spell to give the tech companies a special immunity - they're not responsible for what others put on their platforms. Other countries, afraid of seeming uncool and anti-innovation, generally followed America's lead.</p><p>So the tech firms moved fast and broke a lot of things and now the governments of the world have had enough. They're no longer quirky, fun, garage start-ups. They are among the biggest and most ruthless corporations on the planet. Google's parent, Alphabet, for instance, has a share market value three times that of entertainment behemoth Walt Disney, six times that of the biggest Australian company, BHP Billiton, and 140 times that of the New York Times Company.</p><p>Do they really need special legislative immunity from the consequences of their businesses any longer? Consequences like the propaganda and recruitment successes of the terrorist army Daesh, or Islamic State. Or the Russian government's subversion of US elections and democracy everywhere. Consequences like the exponential proliferation of child abuse images.</p><p>And the US Congress didn't actually grant them immunity from paying tax on their earnings - that's a little extra liberty the tech firms granted themselves. After 23 years, the reckoning has arrived. The Australian government is at the forefront. It started four years ago with the Office of the e-Safety Commissioner, a world first designed to protect kids from cyberbullying and other web-borne harms. Now it also removes revenge porn from the web. It's been a success, which is why other nations are studying it and the tech companies are lobbying to curb it.</p><p>Australia's e-Safety Commissioner, Julie Inman-Grant, started her tech involvement with Microsoft when the tech industry could do no wrong: \"Fast forward two decades and the policy pendulum is definitely swinging the other way, with calls in the US for section 230 to be repealed and governments across the world seriously contemplating whether the internet industry should be more closely regulated,\" she told the National Press Club in Canberra last year.</p><p>Incidentally, if you do a Google search for more on America's section 230, you'll find a set of self-serving results. You'll find more objective information if you use a non-profit search engine, such as duckduckgo.com.</p><p>\"I'm proud to say that I believe it is now Australia that is leading the way in terms of regulating the social media industry for the content and conduct that takes place on these platforms,\" Inman-Grant said.</p><p>Three other examples. First. After an Australian man walked into two Christchurch mosques in March and murdered 51 people in a hate crime partially livecast on Facebook, Scott Morrison joined his New Zealand counterpart, Jacinda Ardern, to get a G-20 agreement to work towards the elimination of terrorist and violent extremist content online. The G-7 summit in France next month will develop the theme. France's President Emmanuel Macron invited Morrison and Ardern in recognition of their leadership.</p><p>Second. The Australian Tax Commissioner, Chris Jordan, had a gutful of big multinational firms dodging their Australian taxes. He went after the big mining firms too, but the tech companies were the main target. They were collecting billions in Australian sales but booking the revenue through low-tax subsidiaries in Ireland or Singapore. In four years, armed with new laws and a hand-picked taskforce, he's got the multinationals booking an extra $7 billion of revenue a year in Australia. And paying tax on it in Australia. Recently, some European governments have reached the same breaking point and announced new tax regimes specifically to target the tax-dodging tech titans.</p><p>Third. Last week the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission delivered its final report into digital platforms. Its chair, Rod Sims, spoke of \"many adverse effects\" that flow from the market dominance wielded by Google and Facebook in particular. In neat symmetry, the commission delivered 23 recommendations for action to protect Australia from some of those effects, one for each year of the era of untrammelled techxploitation. The Morrison government immediately agreed to one of the 23 - for the ACCC to create special branch to protect online privacy and prevent abuse of market power - and is considering the other 22.</p><p>There are two big caveats. First is that while Australia's government can be proud that it is leading in the much-needed regulation of Big Tech, it should also be working to allow Australian business to lead in innovation, as well. Second is that all these initiatives are positive, but they are piecemeal and partial. For instance, none of the Australian measures address Jamie Bartlett's larger worry - the \"manipulation, endless distraction and the slow diminishing of free choice and autonomy\" that Big Tech delivers.</p><p>Is Bartlett's mild panic giving way to paranoia perhaps? Read what Google's then boss, Eric Schmidt, said in 2010 and make up your own mind: \"You give us more information about you, about your friends, and we can improve the quality of our services. We don't need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you've been. We can more or less know what you're thinking about.\"</p><p>That's not creepy at all.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Hartcher is international editor.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520160962</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP6-0GT1-JBJ7-N3H9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1043\"/><timeReceived>09:35 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The late Robert Forsyth, who started as assistant cashier in 1946, served as president until about 2000. His son, John Forsyth, had worked there since 1970, serving as president for the past 12 years.</p><p>The bank merged with American Bank and Trust with headquarters in Wessington Springs on Dec. 7. American Bank and Trust has a branch in Mellette.</p><p>It was the easiest transition for customers, John Forsyth said. Some customers might go to Warner or Aberdeen, but that is their choice, he said.</p><p>Changing demographics and changes in agriculture have made it difficult for banks in small towns to survive.</p><p>\"The town just died around us,\" Forsyth said. \"My customer base got old and died.\"</p><p>Mansfield has 93 residents, according to the 2010 census.</p><p>The town had a thriving Main Street 60 years ago, but the only reminder of that era is a sign \"Lawrence Welk Played Here\" affixed to the peeling facade of the community hall.</p><p>There is a bar on Main Street, but it is open only occasionally. It has a for sale sign on its front.</p><p>Few vehicles drive the road except for grain trucks heading for the Wheat Growers elevator.</p><p>\"We had a good bank,\" said Forsyth. \"We always were rated at the top by the FDIC for safety and soundness.\"</p><p>Staff members were known for their friendliness.</p><p>\"We were very hometown oriented,\" he said. \"We knew everybody by their first name and knew their wife's name, their dog's name and their cat's name. Ninety to 95 percent of the people who called me didn't need to identify themselves on the phone because I could recognize their voices.\"</p><p>Mansfield State Bank has always been agriculturally oriented.

It is bad for the town to have the bank close.\"</p><p>Palmer has lived in Mansfield her whole life and said the bank has a rich history.</p><p>The building was erected in 1900 or 1901 and W.H. Brown received a charter to operate the bank in 1903, according to town history. Frank Simmons and A.R. Baisch bought the bank in 1920.</p><p>The bank made it through the Great Depression of the 1930s because of community support.</p><p>Forsyth said when there was a nationwide run on banks, Baisch and Simmons decided to risk full disclosure with town leaders.</p><p>\"Certain community leaders in the German community and at Trinity Lutheran Church had a lot of say about what went on in town,\" Forsyth said. \"Baisch and Simmons opened up their books to them. 'If you pull your money, we are going down,' Simmons told them. The townspeople kept their money in the bank.\"</p><p>Because the bank couldn't support two employees, Simmons went to work for the Federal Land Bank, Forsyth said. Simmons kept an ownership share, but Baisch operated the bank.</p><p>When Robert Forsyth returned from World War II in 1946, Simmons asked him if he could help get the bank's books in order. Robert Forsyth had gone to business school before the war. After helping balance the books, he stayed on as assistant cashier.</p><p>Simmons committed suicide in 1953. His wife, Bertha Simmons, took over as president. In 1958, Robert Forsyth bought Simmons' controlling interest in the company.</p><p>John Forsyth began working at the bank after he returned from service in the Vietnam War. He worked side-by-side with his father for more than 30 years.</p><p>\"We did not worry about titles,\" he said. \"We both just did what needed to be done.\"</p><p>Forsyth said there was a time when the Mansfield State Bank could have expanded to Aberdeen to attract more deposits and business. The Warner State Bank did that, he said.</p><p>The family decided not to expanded and to run the bank as it always had, he said.</p><p>\"I knew after that decision that we would eventually get to small to exist,\" he said.</p><p>While the Mansfield bank did not make the transition to a big, tech-savvy bank, it offered something Mansfield residents with miss -- the human touch.</p><p>Eisenbeisz said that the three people who worked at the bank -- Forsyth, Dennis Holm, vice president, and Linda Torrence, cashier -- cared about their customers.</p><p>\"They are exceptional people,\" she said.</p><p>She said that the bank was always a sponsor of community events.  It was always there to sponsor a girl in the Snow Queen competition or help out schools such as Northwestern and Warner, she said.</p><p>The small, neat post office where Eisenbeisz presides is now the only store on Main Street. It is open four and one-half  hours a day Monday through Friday and one and one-half hours on Saturday morning.</p><p>Eisenbeisz said, the bank's closure is sad for her.</p><p>\"It is going to be tough not to have them next door,\" she said.</p><p>___ (c)2012 the American News (Aberdeen, S.D.)

Shares in the so-called \"Faangs\" - a racy acronym denoting Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google - have taken a remarkable beating, at one point shedding more than $1 trillion (\u00a3764bn) in market value from the record highs they struck in 2018.\u00a0The plunge has been blamed for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/10/28/silicon-valley-rout-sends-global-stocks-bear-market-territory/\">triggering the first bear market since 2009</url> .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not just these companies finances that have come under strain. Silicon Valley has been engulfed by a string of sexual harassment scandals, employee protests, consumer fatigue and at least one high-profile affair.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now there is evidence that the premium they once enjoyed over more established rivals is coming to an end. JP Morgan estimates that public tech companies are trading at one of the smallest premiums in their history, while the Faangs' share price to earnings ratio has dropped by more than 60 per cent since early 2017.\u00a0</p><p>Next week we will discover the real extent of the damage. Amazon, Apple and Facebook will all report their latest batch of earnings - as will Tesla and Microsoft, which was throughout December the world's most valuable company. Will their numbers be sufficient to deliver a boost for the sector, or will they unleash a new round of sell-offs? \u00a0</p><p>It will certainly be judgement day for Amazon, whose founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos is laying low after his dirty laundry was aired in public. Earth's richest man, estimated to be worth $160bn, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/10/28/silicon-valley-rout-sends-global-stocks-bear-market-territory/\">announced he was divorcing his wife Mackenzie</url>, whom he married before founding the e-commerce site and is mother to his four children.\u00a0</p><p>While the public was gripped by tales of his late-night jaunts on private jets with his new lover, the news anchor Lauren Sanchez, investors are keen to learn whether it was business as usual in the Seattle headquarters.\u00a0</p><p>The forecast seems positive. Amazon, the world's largest online retailer and leading cloud computing provider, is expected to defy the wider downturn when it reports its results on January 31. Early market data suggests it will beat estimates on Christmas sales in the US, despite a general drop in the UK. But its previous results were disappointing, driving shares down as much as 10pc, and it warned at the time that operating profits could be as low as $2.1bn - flat with 2018.\u00a0</p><p>Despite this, Amazon's outlook is positively rosy compared to Apple's. The iPhone maker, which reports on January 29, has already warned of a slump in sales for its flagship product; George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, predicts that it \"could sell less than 200 million iPhones for the first time in four years\". In a surprise warning issued after Christmas, chief executive Tim Cook blamed Apple's new policy of offering battery replacements for older models, as well as a general economic slowdown in China. But few believe this to be the whole story.</p><p>Despite innovations such as foldable handsets, the smartphone market is widely expected to stagnate this year, and Apple is ill-equipped to face that. \"We are getting to peak iPhone,\" says Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets. \"[Apple's] innovation is confined to putting an extra chip and more cameras in the iPhone. That suggests to me that they're running out of ideas.\" The company, he says, is \"very reliant\" on the iPhone, yet its eye-watering charges mean it is \"pricing itself out of the market\" in the event of a recession.\u00a0</p><p>Both Apple and Amazon are increasingly turning to services which can bring in revenue continually, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/10/28/silicon-valley-rout-sends-global-stocks-bear-market-territory/\">with healthcare a particular target</url> . Here too, Mr Hewson says, Amazon has the edge. Amazon is a much more diversified brand. It's got elements in cloud computing, services, retail.\"</p><p>The shopping giant is competing with Apple for smart speakers and tablets, where it shows strong sales (though these may be down to heavy discounting, making them unsustainable in terms of revenue). Its most recent report also showed growth in its advertising business, which represents a small but real threat to Google and Facebook.\u00a0</p><p>As for Facebook itself, which reports on January 30, storm clouds are gathering. After years of high margins and high growth, Mark Zuckerberg warned in October that investors should expect slower progress in future. Facebook's user base is pretty much at \"saturation\" in Europe and North America, and its sister services - Whatsapp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger - have yet to prove their money-making prowess.</p><p>Mr Zuckerberg has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/10/28/silicon-valley-rout-sends-global-stocks-bear-market-territory/\">signalled that he thinks internet users are recoiling from semi-public posts towards private and disappearing messaging</url>, but it remains to be seen whether Facebook can profit from that shift.\u00a0Sales of Facebook's new Portal video-calling device are unlikely to make much difference, even if it were a success.</p><p>The company is also exposed China's slowdown to a degree most investors do not appreciate: though it remains banned by the Communist Party, several billion dollars-worth of advertising is tied up in Chinese companies and their intermediaries.</p><p>Facebook's biggest problems, however, are political. After years of \"moving fast and breaking things\", and following several backfired attempts to smother its critics, Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser believes that the company is now \"toxic\" and that further regulatory action, whether in the US, the EU or elsewhere, is \"inevitable\".</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/10/28/silicon-valley-rout-sends-global-stocks-bear-market-territory/\">iPhone sales worldwide from 2007 to 2018</url></p><p>\"Facebook has for the most part not been operating in a manner in which most societies expect their companies to operate,\" he says. \"Unless you believe it's going to take its $14bn capital expenditure budget and buy nuclear warheads, do you think governments will win or Facebook will win?\"\u00a0</p><p>That will of course mean fines, perhaps similar to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/10/28/silicon-valley-rout-sends-global-stocks-bear-market-territory/\">record penalty dished out to Google on by the French data regulator</url> . Mr Wieser cites that ruling as evidence that Eurocrats are not impressed by Silicon Valley's attempt to comply with the new law and that more such penalties are likely very soon.</p><p>But the more serious problem for Facebook is that regulation or the threat of regulation will force it to operate like a slow-moving \"corporate citizen\" rather than a nimble start-up, spending ever-increasing money on removing dangerous content and consulting carefully about every new project it launches.</p><p>In extremis, it could even be broken up by competition regulators into several smaller services, and would suffer more from such a move than Amazon or Apple because its tight control by Mr Zuckerberg and his inner circle has left it with a very small roster of potential managers.\u00a0</p><p>On the topic of fines: Google, whose parent company Alphabet reports the following week on February 5, is also politically vulnerable, but safer than Facebook. New European data protection regulations have actually helped it somewhat, wiping out smaller rivals who did not have the capital to invest in compliance. Its search engine, the largest part of its business, is still the most effective and most successful example of digital advertising in existence. For that reason, according to Colin Sebastian, a senior analyst at Baird, it would be foolish to sell.</p><p>\"I know the media narrative is very negative, but overall Google's business is strong,\" he says. Sebastian argues that its large payments to Apple to get Google apps onto the iPhone's operating system will shrink as time goes on, and that sales of its Pixel smartphone and its smart speaker Google Home are less important because they are such a small proportion of its business compared to Apple.</p><p>Its big weakness is in cloud computing. There is a running joke in the industry that Google, one of the largest and first investors in massive data centres, has yet to catch up with Amazon's data storage service. Many fear Google has missed the boat on this \"massive opportunity\". Do not expect to hear much about it either: Google still hides cloud computing in the \"other bets\" section of its report, making it impossible to untangle from its blue-sky investments in internet balloons and driverless cars.</p><p>All these companies, despite their differences, may face one larger problem. At the start of this year Vincent Deluard, a strategist at INTL FCStone, wrote a provocative note proposing that the era of high-flying tech stocks is over for good. \"If technology is everywhere, the tech sector no longer exists,\" he said. \"If the tech sector no longer exists, its premium is no longer justified.\"</p><p>His argument is twofold. First, most of the Fangs' competitors are now copying their methods well enough that they are no longer unique. If legacy car manufacturers such as BMW are making electric cards just like Tesla, why should it be trading at so many more multiples of its earnings than them?\u00a0</p><p>Second, today's tech giants <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/10/28/silicon-valley-rout-sends-global-stocks-bear-market-territory/\">may simply have exhausted their capacity for innovation</url> . \"They are competing in existing industries versus creating new industries,\" says Mr Deluard. \"When the iPhone came out it was something that created the market from scratch, and it took the industry several years to catch up.\" Now, their sheer scale gives them less room to grow, and the new industries they are trying to move into - such as medicine, grocery shopping and banking - will struggle to give them such rapid, explosive progress. Hence, share premiums \"reflect an era of growth that is unlikely to reoccur\".</p><p>As a result, says Mr Deluard, \"the sense of invincibility\" that seemed to surround tech executives has collapsed, in no small part due to their own mis-steps, and therefore so has their shield against the cold winds of the market. \"In 2017 people thought Mark Zuckerberg was running for president, and Sheryl Sandberg was touted as this source of inspiration for young women,\" he says. \"Just saying it today seems laughable... there was this almost mystical aura around them that could only compare to what Steve Jobs was able to command after his third resurrection. It turns out they were humans after all.\"</p><p>Time will tell if the correction suffered by the Faangs at the end of 2018 was merely a return to reality for Silicon Valley or the first tremors of of a much wider downturn. Two weeks from now, we will have at least six more pieces of evidence.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-51139749</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V8D-VFS1-F021-64V5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1702\"/><timeReceived>10:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 24, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

In a rather unexpected move, the EU Commission informed the company, on the same day, of its intention to impose interim measures, a long-forgotten tool. Broadcom, which is a major supplier of components for TV and modem chipsets, is being suspected of having put in place contractual restrictions to exclude its competitors from the market.Hearings were held in late August.On October 16, 2019, the EU Commission, likely unconvinced by Broadcom's arguments, ordered[2] Broadcom to unilaterally cease applying exclusivity clauses contained in its agreements with six manufacturers of TV set-top boxes and modems, withhold commercial advantages granted to some of its customers, and refrain from agreeing to the same provisions or like provisions for the time being.The investigation on the merits is still ongoing.Commenting on the October decision, Commissioner Vestager justified the recourse to interim measures, which had not been used for almost two decades, by saying that DG COMP had 'strong indications' of Broadcom having engaged in exclusive or quasi-exclusive dealings with key customers and that 'in the absence of intervention, Broadcom's behavior [was] likely to create serious and irreversible harm to competition.'In her official statement[3] about the Broadcom case, Commissioner Vestager made it clear that it would not remain a one-off case and that she was 'committed to making the best possible use of this important tool,' whose advantages (efficiency, quickness) seemed to have been 're-discovered' on this occasion.So, why such a change?</p><p>Interim measures, a tool long neglected by the EU CommissionThe EU Commission's power to impose interim measures was first recognized by the EU judge in 1980 in the Camera Care[4] case. In this case, the judge ruled that the EU Commission had the power 'to take interim measures which are indispensable for the effective exercise of its functions and, in particular, for ensuring the effectiveness of any decisions requiring undertakings to bring to an end infringements which it has found to exist.'The conditions to impose such interim measures were further clarified by subsequent caselaw.Regulation 1/2003 later codified them as follows: 'In cases of urgency due to the risk of serious and irreparable harm to competition, the Commission, acting on its own initiative may by decision, on the basis of a prima facie finding of infringement, order interim measures' (Article 8).This codification, which could have been viewed as an opportunity to develop the use of this tool, has, instead, discouraged the EU Commission from doing so.The conditions set forth in Article 8 of Regulation 1/2003 were indeed perceived as significantly harder to fulfill than the caselaw conditions until then applicable. The risk of a false positive (or Type 1 errors) was another reason for the EU Commission's reluctance to use interim measures.Thus, while decisions imposing such measures were already rare, there have simply been none since the entry into force of Regulation 1/2003.The Commission is regularly asked to revisit its overly cautious approach to interim measures to no avail - until the Broadcom case.Interim measures is a tool already used with some success by EU national competition authorities and is intended to be further developed at a national levelThe EU Commission's status quo contrasted with the dynamism of certain EU Member States' competition authorities.With an impressive track record of 27 cases of interim measures imposed between 2002 and 2019, the French Competition Authority ('FrCA') has been by far one of the most active. While the greater use of interim measures by the FrCA may be explained by a lower burden of proof (condition of 'likelihood of competition infringement' for the FrCA versus 'prima facie finding of infringement' for the EU Commission; condition of 'serious and immediate harm' construed broadly for the FrCA versus serious and irreparable damage to competition as a whole for the EU Commission), it is also the result of a greater interventionism.The fact that certain national competition authorities, like the FrCA, have used interim measures for years, with some success (including in the high-tech industry), has necessarily inspired the EU Commission.It may also well be that, with the upcoming implementation of the ECN+ Directive[5] that requires all Member States to enable their competition authorities to resort to interim measures, the EU Commission felt increased pressure to lead by example.Dusted off tools for new challengesThe development of fast-moving markets and the hot debate as to whether the traditional tools of antitrust law are sufficient to tackle the issues posed by some big tech companies also explain the timely resurgence of interim measures.While, around the world, legislators, academics, practitioners and competition authorities themselves continue to devise the best possible answer(s), competition authorities must find solutions to address everyday concerns voiced by consumers, clients and competitors confronted with potentially unlawful conduct adopted by big tech companies.Dusting off some tools from the existing toolbox clearly forms part of the solution. It has been the case with the notion of exploitative abuse, voluntarily left aside from the Commission's enforcement priorities back in 2009[6], and now revived.It may now be the case with interim measures.ConclusionThe EU Commission's change of approach to interim measures is good news: certain circumstances do require prompt action to preserve competition on the markets and avoid irreversible harm to consumers, something which can only be achieved by interim measures given the long duration of the investigation on the merits.This renewed interest for interim measures should not however make the EU Commission forget too quickly what it has long feared, namely Type 1 errors. Interim measures are prone to these errors which are very costly for the companies concerned and the economy in general. They can discourage companies from innovating and have the power to adversely affect public opinion for years to the detriment of the investigated companies even if the companies are cleared at the end of the day.We can, of course, count on companies facing such measures to remind the EU Commission of these limits, as necessary.In any event, to know whether this tool has definitively found its place in the EU Commission's arsenal, one will have to wait for the EU judge's reaction either in the Broadcom case, if Broadcom appeals the October decision (which seems highly likely), or in the following case of appeal against interim measures. If the EU Judge sets the bar too high in terms of the standard of proof required from the EU Commission, it will probably consign interim measures to oblivion. If the EU Judge is less demanding, it will open a rift that the EU Commission is sure to rush into.

Many observers of corporate life have been asking this question as America's listed companies report last quarter's results in January and February. The omens going into the decade's first earnings season did not look good. The current expansion is the longest in American history, so a downturn seemed inevitable. Indeed, the first three quarters of 2019 saw year-on-year declines in earnings for the S&amp;P 500 index of leading firms. Financial analysts had forecast another drop, of 2% or so, in the fourth, marking the first such prolonged malaise since 2015-16, when America suffered a manufacturing slump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With firms accounting for two-thirds of S&amp;P 500 earnings out of the way, the mood has shifted\u2014and then some. American bosses have unfurrowed their brows. A survey of big firms' chief executives by the Conference Board, a business think-tank, showed a rebound in confidence from a ten-year low in the third quarter. The latest poll of smaller firms by the National Federation of Independent Business, a trade group, also recorded greater optimism. Equities may be headed for what Michael Wilson of Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, calls \"a Goldilocks environment\". </p><p>America's biggest firms are leading the charge. Apple's net income grew by 11% to a record $22.2bn thanks in part to surprisingly strong iPhone sales. A surging cloud business boosted Microsoft's net income by 38% to $11.6bn. Even Amazon, renowned for profitless growth, increased net income by a tenth, year on year, to $3.3bn. But Big Tech is not alone. Industries from utilities to banks to health care appear to be back in business\u2014prompting analysts to revise upwards their forecasts for 2020. Jill Casey of Bank of America expects profits to rise by 8% this year, compared with the latest estimate of about 1% for last year. </p><p>What happened? For a start, fears of a recession have not materialised. If anything, America's economy is perking up. In January the IMF forecast that American GDP would grow by 2% in 2020, faster than the euro area (1.3%) or Japan (0.7%). The \"current activity indicator\", an aggregate of 37 economic metrics compiled by Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, rose sharply in January (see chart on next page). Even manufacturing, where activity had been slowing since mid-2018, looks in better nick. A survey published on February 3rd by the Institute of Supply Management points to the first expansion in months. </p><p> America's commercial truce with China announced in December played a role. Most bosses know that this \"phase one\" deal is imperfect. China's commitment to purchase $200bn of American agricultural and other exports in 2020 and 2021 is widely seen as unrealistic. But the deal did make clear that President Donald Trump is willing to avoid an all-out trade war with America's Asian rival, at least for the time being. </p><p>Mr Trump's massive corporate tax cut continues to be a source of bosses' contentment, as are low interest rates. So too is the absence of wage inflation\u2014a big concern in boardrooms last year. David Kostin of Goldman Sachs argues that it should not be. He calculates that for the median stock in the American market, labour costs (including everything from salaries to share options to health insurance) are stable at around 13% of revenues\u2014despite record-low levels of unemployment. Overall wage growth has been stuck around 3% a year for a while. </p><p>A balmier business climate is encouraging companies to invest. Morgan Stanley's index of capital-expenditure plans, which combines various indicators, moved up in January after falling for seven straight months. The bank's economists attribute this capex revival in part to \"more positive headlines on global trade\". </p><p>Jonathan Golub of Credit Suisse, an investment bank, argues that if the expansion since the global financial crisis of 2007-09 is measured not in time but in GDP, which has grown unusually slowly by historical standards since 2008, it may have life in it yet. The business cycle is not dead, he says. But it is \"elongated\". Economists scoff at such simplistic metrics, but a version of this argument is an increasingly common refrain among bulls on Wall Street. Their poster child is Tesla, an electric-car manufacturer whose market value nearly quadrupled in four months.</p><p>Lest the bulls get carried away, they should consider the three risks facing America's Goldilocks market. First, the coronavirus from Wuhan is infecting American firms' Asian supply chains\u2014and global confidence (see Finance section). Manufacturers in particular are vulnerable to contagion. Most economists, pointing to the modest global impact of outbreaks such as SARS in 2003, remain cautiously optimistic. But if the Wuhan virus turns into a deadlier global pandemic equity markets would invariably suffer.</p><p>Another worry is that the entire stockmarket is skewed by Big Tech. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook account for 18% of the S&amp;P 500. Cassandras note that in 2000, on the eve of the dotcom bust, the giants of the day\u2014Microsoft, Cisco, GE, Intel and ExxonMobil\u2014also made up 18% of the index. Because of their exposure to other tech firms, including frothy startups, Microsoft, Intel and especially Cisco were brought low by the crash rather than being a counterweight to it. </p><p>Mr Kostin notes that today's big five are different. They trade at lower multiples of annual earnings than the big five of 2000 did (30 now versus 47 then) and reinvest more capital into the business (48% against 26%). The implication is that today's giants have room to grow. Even so, their shares are looking pricey; Tesla's plunged by 17% on February 5th. The companies remain vulnerable to antitrust action, privacy regulation, uncertain succession (see next article), as well as the health of their myriad Asian suppliers. </p><p>The final bear case has to do with potential weakness in American household consumption. Ellen Zentner of Morgan Stanley notes that real personal consumption spending grew at an annualised rate of 1.8% in the fourth quarter, down from 3.2% in the third. She calculates that the annualised growth in spending on non-durable goods last quarter was only 0.8%, down from 3.9% in the one before. Spending on food and beverages fell by 0.5% on an annualised basis in the fourth quarter of 2019, down from an increase of 5% in the previous three months.  </p><p>The profits just reported by big banks, which owe their strength in part to credit-card spending and mortgages, suggest that consumers are in a buying mood for now. Bosses have reason to kick back and relax. Farsighted ones know that this warm feeling will not last for ever.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-VK8DH0H</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9C-TVD1-JBKN-B2M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1119\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

In more than five hours of adversarial interrogation before the House Antitrust Subcommittee on Wednesday, the chief executives of Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Facebook, Inc. and Google owner Alphabet Inc. were accused of a range of unfair business practices.    But Democrats focused more on the alleged stifling of competition to preserve their dominance, while Republicans honed in more on the platforms' outsize grip on information and public debate.    Members at times dismissed one another's specific concerns and proposed solutions, making it clear that legislative changes concerning Big Tech aren't imminent.    \"We do not need to change our antitrust laws. They have been working just fine,\" said Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.), the subcommittee's top Republican, at Wednesday's hearing. He said law enforcement agencies should be the ones to decide whether they were wrong in permitting tech companies' growth, allowing: \"Maybe they made a mistake.\"    Still, the near-universal enmity was a sign that Capitol Hill inquiries into the companies will continue no matter who controls Congress next year.    \"Yesterday's event was a milestone. It makes clear to everybody that the question is no longer should we, could we do something about the platform monopolists but when exactly are we going to do it, and what exactly are we going to do?\" Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, which advocates for breaking up and imposing new rules on tech platforms, said Thursday.    Robert Kaminski, an analyst with Capital Alpha Partners, counted 28 discrete policy issues lawmakers raised, saying it indicates the so-called Tech Lash has room to run.    \"The quantity and diversity of issues serve to keep the spotlight on tech for an indefinite amount of time,\" he said in a note to clients.    The tech industry's supporters dismissed the hearing as lacking in substance.    \"This hearing isn't about competition, evidence, or consumers; it's a piece of political theater,\" said Carl Szabo, general counsel of NetChoice, a trade group whose members include Google, Facebook and Amazon. \"We heard odd arguments about how each of these companies is somehow a monopoly in the same overlapping markets.\"    For now, the near-term threat to the companies remains ongoing investigations by the agencies that enforce U.S. antitrust laws, including the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission as well as the states.    As did the subcommittee, those agencies have been collecting documents and talking to the companies' competitors during the past year, so evidence cited in the Wednesday hearing may not have surprised them. The Justice Department is expected to sue Google as soon as this summer, and other less-advanced investigations are proceeding into the other companies, The Wall Street Journal has reported previously citing people familiar with the matter.    Lawmakers sought to put pressure on the agencies, in part by disclosing dozens of documents, such as internal company emails and strategy discussions.    \"The documentary evidence shows that several of these companies were engaged in serious anticompetitive practices,\" said Rep. Joe Neguse (D., Colo.), a member of the House panel in an interview after the hearing. \"Regulators in many respects across multiple administrations, Democratic and Republican, have been asleep at the wheel.\"    If the hearing put scrutiny on the record of antitrust enforcers, though, it also offered examples of the arguments they would face in taking one of the tech giants to court.    Lawmakers in both parties said Facebook's strategy to acquire apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp appeared designed to maintain a dominant market position. But courts also would consider the effects of the transaction, as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg implied when he countered that Instagram \"has done wildly well largely because not just of the founder's talent, but because we invested heavily.\"    The criticism of the CEOs came across a range of topics. Mr. Zuckerberg took heat from Rep. David Cicilline, the subcommittee chairman, concerning the spread of misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, and from Rep. Gregory Steube (R., Fla.) about the ideological diversity of people who monitor Facebook content.    Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos heard concerns about how his company treats independent retailers from Rep. Kelly Armstrong, a North Dakota Republican, and from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat whose district includes the company's headquarters in Seattle.    The House panel is set in the coming weeks to publish a report summarizing its probe into the tech firms and making policy recommendations.    Democrats pushed for a change in laws governing competition, arguing that existing antitrust statues have failed to curb the technology giants. \"Their control of the marketplace allows them to do whatever it takes to crush independent business and expand their own power. This must end,\" Mr. Cicilline said at the close of the hearing.    Republicans' primary concern at the hearing was perceived censorship of conservative speech by social-media companies. Democrats and the tech companies dispute those allegations, pointing in part to the popularity of conservative content on platforms such as Facebook.    To address that issue, some GOP lawmakers have proposed changes to Section 230, a law that immunizes websites from lawsuits for moderating content. Tech companies oppose those efforts. Democrats generally say they are willing to review Section 230 but are skeptical of the Republican proposals.    Lawmakers also have discussed legislation imposing new requirements on tech firms to protect consumer privacy, but this year failed to reach a compromise.

She is due to announce new competition tools before the end of the year. The debate over taxation is also expected to pick up in the coming months as governments figure out how to increase their revenues to deal with the ongoing economic crisis.  Two European lawmakers told CNBC they are eager to step up discussions with major tech CEOs as the debate over their dominance rumbles on.   The chiefs of Amazon , Facebook , Apple and Google (referred to as GAFA) were grilled by the United States Congress on Wednesday amid investigations as to whether these firms have abused their market dominance. The overall concern among many American lawmakers is that current antitrust laws \u2014 which aim to create fair market competition \u2014 are not fit for the digital economy.   This is a concern also shared by many lawmakers in Europe.   \"The Congressional hearing proved that antitrust tools in Europe and the United States \u2026 have their limits,\" Luis Garicano, a Spanish economist and member of the European Parliament for the liberal group Renew Europe, told CNBC Thursday.   He added that the Parliament, the only directly-elected EU institution, is likely to intensify discussions over the future of competition rules after the summer.   In fact, the head of competition policy in Europe, Margrethe Vestager has been tasked with revising parts of the antitrust rulebook during her second mandate in Brussels and she is due to announce new competition tools before the end of the year.   In a letter to U.S. lawmakers ahead of Wednesday's hearing, Vestager wrote that \"many if not most parts of today's economy are becoming increasingly digitized\" and while \"these platforms can bring significant benefits,\" there is a concern \"that the reach and role of some platforms is unprecedented.\"   \"And that they have a gatekeeper role which means that if they act unchecked, they can also cause significant harm to competition, innovation and ultimately to consumers,\" Vestager also wrote.   St\u00e9phanie Yon-Courtin, another European lawmaker who has chaired competition discussions among policymakers, said Thursday that \"it is time\" the chamber organizes hearings with the same big four tech CEOs.   Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is the only tech CEO that has ever faced the European Parliament. However, the format chosen to question him back in 2018 received criticism by members of the European Parliament as only a selected few politicians could ask questions.   \"In the past, GAFA CEOs have refused to attend themselves hearings in the European Parliament, with the exception of Mark Zuckerberg,\" Yon-Courtin, told CNBC via email Thursday.   \"I hope the CEOs will reconsider their approach,\" she also said, adding that apart from competition policy she is also keen to hold discussions over taxation.  Digital taxation  The European Union has been at the forefront of talks to increase taxation on digital companies. However, the 27-member bloc cannot impose an EU-wide levy without a consensus position among all the capitals, which has not happened until now.   The European Commission has previously estimated that digital companies pay on average an effective tax rate of 9.5% in the EU \u2014 compared to 23.2% for traditional businesses.   The debate over taxation is also expected to pick up in the coming months as governments figure out how to increase their revenues to deal with the ongoing economic crisis.   \"Tech firms will likely have their hands full over the years to come as they grapple not only with groups of lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic eager to see them regulated with greater scrutiny, but also with very different regulatory models being used to achieve policymakers' aims,\" David Livingston, analyst at the consultancy firm Eurasia Group, told CNBC Thursday, in reference to how the EU and the U.S. have different regulatory approaches.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42749627214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H5-B831-JCSC-J4T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Under the deal, announced by the World Federation of Advertisers, common definitions would be adopted for forms of harmful content such as hate speech and bullying, and platforms would adopt harmonized reporting standards. </p><p>The deal comes less than six weeks before a polarizing U.S. presidential election. Three months ago, major advertisers boycotted Facebook in the wake of anti-racism demonstrations that followed the death of George Floyd, an American Black man, in police custody in Minneapolis. Advertisers have complained for years[2] that big social media companies do too little to prevent ads from appearing alongside hate speech, fake news and other harmful content. Big tech companies have begun taking steps to fend off calls for more regulation. The platforms agreed to have some practices reviewed by external auditors, and to give advertisers more control of what content is displayed alongside their ads. 'This is a significant milestone in the journey to rebuild trust online,' said Luis Di Como, executive vice president of global media at Unilever, one of the world's biggest advertisers. 'Whilst change doesn't happen overnight, today marks an important step in the right direction.' Carolyn Everson, Facebook's vice president for Global Marketing Solutions, said the agreement 'has aligned the industry on the brand safety floor and suitability framework, giving us all a unified language to move forward on the fight against hate online.'ScepticalCampaigners who want more regulation of social media companies welcomed the agreement but voiced scepticism and vowed to keep up the pressure. 'While this is an early step and many details need to be resolved, we welcome today's announcement,' said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, one of the oldest and biggest anti-racism campaign groups in the United States and a backer of the Stop Hate for Profit campaign behind the boycott. 'These commitments must be followed in a timely and comprehensive manner, to ensure they are not the kind of empty promises that we have seen too often from Facebook. We will continue to press Facebook and other providers to make meaningful changes to their platform in the weeks and months ahead.' Stop Hate for Profit did not respond to a message seeking comment. In a statement last week, it said: 'Facebook's failures lead to real-life violence and sow division, and we're calling on the company to improve its policies. We need to urge people to vote and demand Facebook stop undermining our democracy. Enough is enough.'

Commentators predict (and EU and UK regulators hope) that these initiatives will drive widespread market changes, including increased competition, innovation and greater market access, which will herald a new era of customer-focused, technology-driven banking services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To make this vision a reality, banking customers need to share their bank account information in order to access new products and benefit from greater choice. This includes sharing personal data and other information that is highly sensitive, valuable and heretofore confidential between the customer and their bank.</p><p>In March 2018, the New York Times and the Guardian reported the full extent of data misuse by Cambridge Analytica, which involved the harvesting of profile information belonging to an estimated 87 million Facebook users. For Facebook, the fallout included US Senate hearings and a UK Commons Select Committee appearances for senior executives, not to mention a maximum fine of \u00a3500,000 ($650,000) from the UK Information Commissioner's Office. Had the breach occurred under the General Data Protection Regulation regime that came into force in May 2018, the fine would have been significantly higher.</p><p>DOUBTS REMAIN The Cambridge Analytica scandal served as a warning to big tech companies about the financial and reputational impact of data breaches and left questions in the minds of sceptical customers about the risks of sharing data.</p><p>In this context, it may come as a surprise that respondents to TLT's recent open banking survey identified big tech companies (such as Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook and Apple) as the biggest potential threat in the developing open banking market.</p><p>However, there are good reasons to think those survey respondents may be right.</p><p>Looking at markets outside the EU, there are multiple examples of big tech and telecoms companies establishing a mass market in payments and related financial services. M-Pesa (operated by Vodafone) provides mobile payment services for about 30 million users in Kenya (population 45 million). In China, Alibaba's Alipay service has 450 million users and Tencent's WeChat Pay has 600 million, each offering payments and investments via their respective social media platforms.</p><p>Could this level of market penetration be replicated by big tech companies in the EU? The launch of Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay, all of which pre-date the open banking era, indicate a willingness on the part of major players to disrupt the market.</p><p>Big tech companies have specific advantages that leave them well positioned to capitalise on the opportunities presented by open banking. Like established banks (but unlike many fintechs), they have a significant customer base and the scale and capacity to make major investments. Like fintechs (but unlike many established banks), they are designed around more agile mobile technology platforms and focus obsessively on positive user experience and frictionless transactions.</p><p>RISK PROFILE There are, of course, risks for big tech companies entering the financial services market in the EU, including significant governance and compliance obligations, oversight from multiple financial and data regulators and substantial fines for regulatory breaches. The traditional banking model is likely to remain too risky and too heavily regulated for big tech.</p><p>In this respect, open banking offers some interesting alternatives, which could allow big tech companies to focus on what they do best (i.e. provide good user experience and data-driven insights), without being exposed to all the regulatory requirements applicable to banks. The emerging market of open banking services has already attracted a range of fintech providers, including the first wave of providers with PSD2 registrations as 'account information service providers' and 'payment initiation services providers' (AISPs and PISPs). Big tech could also use this route to build on existing successful business models and create new ones, with a lighter regulatory burden.</p><p>If big tech providers establish successful AISPs and PISPs, the threat identified by our survey respondents would be well founded. That scenario would also present an interesting dilemma for regulators, if the more competitive market promised by open banking starts to be dominated by a small number of big tech companies.</p><p>BUILDING UNDERSTANDING At the moment, while there is clear potential for big tech to make an impact in open banking, dominance in the EU looks a long way off. Established banks have thus far proved to be relatively resilient. There is also a broad range of challengers, neo-banks, alternative payment providers (notably PayPal) and fintechs who are chasing and winning market share.</p><p>Big tech companies (and anyone else hoping to make an impact) will need to do more to build customer understanding, trust and support for open banking services. The market is still in its infancy and, from a customer's perspective, there is not yet a 'must have' app that demands attention and engagement in open banking. It remains to be seen who will be the first to release such an app, but it will come as no surprise if one of the big tech companies enters the race.</p><p>DAVID Gardner is a partner at UK law firm tlt.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The Bracken column is named after Brendan Bracken, the founding editor of The Banker in 1926 and chairman of the modern-day Financial Times from 1945 to 1958.

M-Pesa (operated by Vodafone) provides mobile payment services for about 30 million users in Kenya (population 45 million).

The traditional banking model is likely to remain too risky and too heavily regulated for big tech.</p><p>In this respect, open banking offers some interesting alternatives, which could allow big tech companies to focus on what they do best (i.e. provide good user experience and data-driven insights), without being exposed to all the regulatory requirements applicable to banks. The emerging market of open banking services has already attracted a range of fintech providers, including the first wave of providers with PSD2 registrations as 'account information service providers' and 'payment initiation services providers' (AISPs and PISPs). Big tech could also use this route to build on existing successful business models and create new ones, with a lighter regulatory burden.</p><p>If big tech providers establish successful AISPs and PISPs, the threat identified by our survey respondents would be well founded. That scenario would also present an interesting dilemma for regulators, if the more competitive market promised by open banking starts to be dominated by a small number of big tech companies.</p><p>BUILDING UNDERSTANDING At the moment, while there is clear potential for big tech to make an impact in open banking, dominance in the EU looks a long way off. Established banks have thus far proved to be relatively resilient. There is also a broad range of challengers, neo-banks, alternative payment providers (notably PayPal) and fintechs who are chasing and winning market share.</p><p>Big tech companies (and anyone else hoping to make an impact) will need to do more to build customer understanding, trust and support for open banking services. The market is still in its infancy and, from a customer's perspective, there is not yet a 'must have' app that demands attention and engagement in open banking. It remains to be seen who will be the first to release such an app, but it will come as no surprise if one of the big tech companies enters the race.</p><p>DAVID Gardner is a partner at UK law firm tlt.</p><p>The Bracken column is named after Brendan Bracken, the founding editor of The Banker in 1926 and chairman of the modern-day Financial Times from 1945 to 1958.

That scenario would also present an interesting dilemma for regulators, if the more competitive market promised by open banking starts to be dominated by a small number of big tech companies.</p><p>BUILDING UNDERSTANDING At the moment, while there is clear potential for big tech to make an impact in open banking, dominance in the EU looks a long way off. Established banks have thus far proved to be relatively resilient. There is also a broad range of challengers, neo-banks, alternative payment providers (notably PayPal) and fintechs who are chasing and winning market share.</p><p>Big tech companies (and anyone else hoping to make an impact) will need to do more to build customer understanding, trust and support for open banking services. The market is still in its infancy and, from a customer's perspective, there is not yet a 'must have' app that demands attention and engagement in open banking. It remains to be seen who will be the first to release such an app, but it will come as no surprise if one of the big tech companies enters the race.</p><p>DAVID Gardner is a partner at UK law firm tlt.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BANKER-143370660</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BANKER2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNP-N3H1-DYTY-C1NC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234197</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"970\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Banker</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59210\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 1, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The reactive approach to removing harmful comment had once again proven hopelessly ineffective.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This isn\"t the first time this has happened. Over the years, we\"ve seen random acts of violence, murder and sexual assault published and live-streamed on these sites - and it will happen again.</p><p>Neither Facebook nor YouTube have given any indication that they will suspend live-streaming until their systems can better ensure that the videos uploaded respect the decency and censorship laws, not only of New Zealand but elsewhere in the world.</p><p>Until now, many politicians have simply relegated the issue of social media regulation in the \"too difficult\" category.</p><p>This, however, wasn\"t the case for Germany, which last year started enforcing a law that could see big tech companies facing fines of as much as 50 million euros (NZ$80 million) if they failed to delete posts featuring hate speech or fake news.</p><p>Speaking to the Herald last year, US-based academic Siva Vaidhyanathan noted that this strong-handed law is often what is necessary to push the big tech companies toward changing their policies.</p><p>\"Only when they are restricted by law in other places in the world do they institute controls,\" Vaidhyanathan says.</p><p>\"Facebook has been very effective at filtering out anti-Semitic and Holocaust denial propaganda from its German-language services.\"</p><p>Critics were quick to point out that this could lead to an infringement of free speech, but German politicians, still living in the long shadow of the Nazi era, weren\"t willing to gamble of having hate spread through its society again.</p><p>When Vaidhyanathan spoke to the Herald, he hoped that New Zealand might take an international leadership role like it did in the fight against nuclear proliferation, saying you don\"t have to be big to make a difference.</p><p>\"Perhaps a country like New Zealand could lead the way in experimenting with responses to Facebook in a way a large, diffuse country, like the United States, cannot.\"</p><p>The only question is whether our lawmakers have the stomach to take on the challenge and introduce meaningful change the rest of the world is likely to follow.</p><p>So far, politicians have shown little appetite for introducing changes that could truly hit the big tech companies in the pocket.</p><p>This was evidenced recently with the revamp of privacy laws. Despite repeated calls from Privacy Commissioner John Edwards for broader power to levy fines to $1m for companies that ignore breach notices, the revamped law gave him no such power - meaning he\"ll have to settle for writing strongly-worded remonstrations, and the power of publicity to embarrass those to violate privacy law. With all the negative press Facebook and Google have been getting, it\"s questionable how much more they can be embarrassed.</p><p>But the Christchurch shooting has shifted things and there are already signs of governments ramping up efforts to hold these companies accountable for what they publish.</p><p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for live-streaming to be suspended on social media and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern plans to take the issue up directly with Facebook.</p><p>\"This is an issue that goes well beyond New Zealand but that doesn\"t mean we can\"t play an active role in seeing it resolved,\" Ardern said on Sunday.</p><p>Whatever that resolution involves, it will hopefully involve monetary penalties for the media companies at the centre of this controversy. Because Facebook and Google will be far less likely to let a little hate or racism slip in here or there if it\"s likely to hit their hefty profits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-12213791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNN-DDF1-JCBG-G16Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"641\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But other people found themselves in a quandary when confronted with the #DeleteFacebook hashtag. \"Without it I will lose contact with a great many people who I genuinely care about,\" confessed one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Anyone who followed advice to turn off connections between Facebookand third-party apps \u2013 games, news feeds, taxi services and more \u2013 would have received warnings, such as \"You will not be able to log into websites or applications,\" or \"Your friends won't be able to interact and share with you using apps and websites.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Facebookis intertwined with our lives</p><p>This prompted a realisation of how intertwined Facebookis with our lives, and the choice was stark: either undergo a highly disruptive digital detox or allow Facebookto continue using their data in ways that are still not fully understood.</p><p>How can the GDPR help?</p><p>That widespread sense of powerlessness has led the EU to introduce a new set of data protection regulations to be enforced from May 25, known as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). They come at a critical time, as the story of Cambridge Analytica and its alleged misuse of Facebookdata to create 30 million \"psychographic\" profiles continues to gather momentum. As the world gets used to the idea that frivolous online personality quizzes might be harnessed to influence national elections, the GDPR is designed to rebalance power between EU citizens and global technology firms, but its impact will be felt far beyond the EU.</p><p>Its measures include allowing people free access to their own data; the ability to extract, delete and move it; greater information about who holds that data, for what purpose and for how long; the power to deny businesses the ability to use that data for any purpose other than the reason it was collected; and, crucially, fines for non-compliance of up to 4 per cent of a firm's global annual revenue or \u20ac20 million (Dh91m) \u2013 whichever is greater. Last week, McNamee referred to GDPR as a \"brilliant idea\". \"The notion that [our] relationship with these companies should be less one-sided will fix an enormous part of the problem,\" he said.</p><p>You are the product</p><p>Privacy campaigners have pointed out for many years that if a service is free, then you yourself are the product. It's never been an easy notion to fully comprehend, but as artificial intelligence techniques become more sophisticated and our data is made to work harder, the enormous value of that data is becoming more apparent. The European Commission estimates that the value of EU citizens' data alone will reach \u20ac1 trillion by 2020.</p><p>\"We have accepted the bargain offered to us without thinking about it too much,\" said Evgeny Morozov, author of The Net Delusion, in a BBC radio interview last week. \"The bargain was that we can get services for free and the cost is underwritten by advertisers. We're beginning to see the consequences of that.\"</p><p>The Privacy Paradox</p><p>The severity of the consequences is largely down to our failure to understand the terms and conditions of the bargains we opted into. The so-called Privacy Paradox - we hate our privacy being compromised but seem willing to give it up in return for convenience - is still very much in evidence.</p><p>The smokescreen concealing how our data is actually used feeds into this paradox, and its existence has been freely admitted by the industry. Last year, Andrew Ng, then chief scientist at Chinese search engine Baidu, said: \"We often launch products not for the revenue but for the data, and monetise the data through a different product.\"</p><p>That transformation of data into cash, assisted by toothless data regulations devised many years ago, has undoubtedly boosted the corporate might of Silicon Valley.</p><p>The smokescreen, however, is lifting. \"It's becoming evident to many more people that business models relying on the collection and commercial exploitation of personal data are deeply broken,\" says Francesca Bria, co-ordinator for Decode, an EU project that develops tools to give people more control over how their data is used. \"Big tech firms are behaving like feudal lords that control the infrastructure of the digital world,\" she says.</p><p>The GDPR is an attempt to break up that feudal system, and in recent weeks Silicon Valley's biggest firms have been rushing to comply with GDPR by introducing privacy dashboards that give people access to their data. Some analysts believe that the GDPR's ban on selling advertising based upon personal information will have even greater consequences for digital firms, and while Facebookdisputes that its business model is under threat, it has reportedly assembled its biggest ever cross-departmental team to deal with implementing the EU's requirements.</p><p>Bria believes that people across the world will benefit from GDPR. \"It can become the framework for all countries,\" she says. \"It's now at the top of the agenda of policymakers in Europe, and these issues are being pushed at the level of the World Information Summit and World Trade Organisation negotiations. This way, we can reach critical mass and push forward an alternative model that preserves rights and enhances privacy.\"</p><p>Our new-found understanding of how personal data can be used to influence the democratic process has led to speculation over how it might influence our general behaviour, from spending patterns to emotional outbursts.</p><p>Francois Chollet, a researcher at Google, gave his own insight last week in a series of posts on Twitter. \"The human mind is a static, vulnerable system,\" he said, \"that will come increasingly under attack from ever-smarter AI algorithms [with] a complete view of everything we do and believe, and complete control of the information we consume.\"</p><p>Some believe that actions to try to prevent this outcome are too little too late, but while GDPR exercises its regulatory muscle, Bria's Decode project is attempting to build new data gathering systems which she hopes will underpin the future of AI across sectors such as health care, education and mobility.</p><p>\"We're at the very beginning of the Fourth Industrial Revolution,\" she says, \"There may be an argument that it's too late when these technology giants dominate the market. But actually, there is still time.\"</p><p>_______  </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/62/152200107535.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/62/152200107535.jpg</url></p><p>Screen grab of Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on CNN.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NATION-112904094</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NATION2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYC-J041-F11P-X105-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1127\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Abu Dhabi Media Company Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

But since Facebook's disclosure last month that millions of users' data were compromised, stock-picking fund managers have soured on the social network's shares. Some have either partially or completely abandoned their investments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While some money managers believe Facebook's trouble threatens to cool user and revenue growth, many say the three other stocks remain among the market's best bets.</p><p>\"Investors have been trying to lump these stocks all together for years\" even though they have different business models, said Rob Sharps, head of investments and group chief investment officer at T. Rowe Price Group. Now that Facebook's struggles have come to light, \"there may be some greater differences among the FANG stocks than in the past\".</p><p>The NYSEFANG+ index, which tracks 10 global tech heavyweights, has bounced back after last month's slide and is outperforming the S&amp;P 500 this month: it is up 1.8 per cent versus 1.4 per cent for the broad market index.</p><p>Brad Slingerlend, portfolio manager of the Janus Henderson Global Technology Fund, which has stakes in all four FANG stocks, as well as other big tech companies such as Apple, Tencent and Alibaba, says his fund started reducing its position in Facebook before the data privacy controversy.</p><p>He saw further declines ahead for the social network company despite the shares already trading 16 per cent below a 52-week high hit in February.</p><p>\"I'm not sure (Facebook shares) have come down enough to reflect that risk\" of how it handled its data, Mr Slingerlend said, adding that chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's tight control of the company's voting shares created added uncertainty for investors. \"The range of outcomes for Facebook has widened significantly.\" Vontobel Asset Management also sold shares of Facebook in the past month, according to a FactSet analysis of the social network's stakeholders, and Copper Rock Capital Partners, a boutique asset manager that overseas more than $US5 billion ($6.43bn), also pared down its holding.</p><p>Smaller retail investors appeared to be getting out of the stock as well, as several brokerage firms, including LPL Financial Holdings, reported Facebook share sales in the past month, -according to FactSet's data.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment.</p><p>The FANG stocks have together shed more than $US200bn in market value since the middle of last month, when Facebook plunged after acknowledging data privacy issues. Facebook, Amazon and Google are still off about 9 per cent or more each over that time, compared with a 4.1 per cent drop for Netflix. But investors -remain optimistic about the prospects for Amazon and Netflix as those companies continue to up-end the business segments in which they operate. And Google's diversified operations, from advertising to search to tech hardware, make it a dominant force in many fields.</p><p>Mr Slingerlend said he didn't plan to significantly reduce his fund's holdings in Google and Amazon and expected them to maintain their heady growth paths, even if politicians pushed for more regulation of tech companies. Investors who grouped those tech giants with Facebook were missing the intricacies of each business, he said, dismissing US President Donald Trump's criticism of Amazon's tax treatment and its relationship with the US Postal Service.</p><p>Many actively managed funds have a higher exposure to the FANG stocks than to the broader tech and internet segments, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a report. Google and Amazon are among the most crowded stocks. Those same investments helped fuel the funds' gains last year when all four stocks notched double-digit percentage increases.</p><p>But the FANG stocks have lost some of their influence over the broader market. Amazon and Netflix, which are up 23 per cent and 60 per cent, respectively, for the year, accounted for more than 30 per cent of the S&amp;P 500's 2018 gain at one point in February, -according to S&amp;P Dow Jones -Indices. That contribution slipped to about 24 per cent as of April 6.</p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, is among the biggest drags on the index, overshadowing the declines of even General Electric.</p><p>Scott Freeze, chief investment officer of Sabretooth Advisors, is telling current and prospective investors he is looking for the next FANG stocks that are set to expand at rates similar to how the original quartet performed.\"FANG is not a set of four companies. It's an idea,\" Mr Freeze said. \"There are FANG stocks every generation, every decade.

He said Facebook will extend new privacy safeguards designed to comply with the GDPR in Europe to its users around the world.</p><p>Zuckerberg's praise has gone over well in Brussels. MEPs and the European Commission have expressed their satisfaction over the recent pivot in public opinion to favour the GDPR.</p><p>EU Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip and Zuckerberg \"agreed that GDPR gives the right way forward\" during a meeting in Silicon Valley on Wednesday, an official Commission summary of the meeting said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GDPR is only the beginning</emphasis></p><p>But on Wednesday, the Parliament warned that the new rules are just the beginning and will not be enough to rein in big tech companies. Several MEPs pressed for a quick breakthrough in negotiations over the ePrivacy bill, a separate draft regulation that is currently stalled in tense discussions.</p><p>The controversial draft legislation includes strict privacy safeguards that will apply to telecoms companies as well as digital services like Facebook.</p><p>Dutch Liberal MEP Sophie in 't Veld singled out Parliament President Antonio Tajani, whose centre-right European People's Party pushed to reject the ePrivacy legislation last October. MEPs from Tajani's group argued the bill will restrict companies' ability to process their users' data.</p><p>\"Amongst those who are loudly voicing their outrage at Facebook are many who have consistently voted against stricter privacy protections, and continue to do so. Like those who loudly summon Zuckerberg to Parliament, but voted against ePrivacy,\" in 't Veld said.</p><h/><p>MEPs in the European Parliament's Civil Liberties Committee (LIBE) approved stricter new privacy rules for telecoms services and apps like WhatsApp and Skype that divided political groups and drew backlash from the telecoms and tech industries.</p><p>Tajani has sent two requests asking Zuckerberg to attend a Parliament hearing over the data scandal. So far, Zuckerberg has not responded to the requests. Last week, Facebook offered to send another executive to speak in the Parliament, but Tajani's office refused.</p><p>During Wednesday's debate, a number of MEPs expressed their frustration over Zuckerberg's refusal to speak before the Parliament.</p><h/><p>The European Parliament implored Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to speak before a joint hearing of four committees, a day after the 33-year old billionaire finished hours of grueling testimony before the United States Congress.</p><p>But while the debate made it clear that fierce outrage over the Facebook case spans the Parliament's political groups, tensions were most obvious whenever legislators brought the discussion back to the EU policy world. Some hurled accusations against other political parties and national governments for attempting to water down or drop the contentious ePrivacy bill altogether.</p><p>\"The GDPR in itself is not enough,\" said German Socialist MEP Birgit Sippel, who is leading the Parliament's negotiations on the legislation.</p><p>She slammed EU member states for dragging their feet. National governments have not yet agreed on their compromise version of the bill, holding up talks with MEPs. The legislation can only go into effect after it has been approved in three-way negotiations with MEPs, national governments and the Commission.</p><p>\"Member states are putting their foot on the brake and basically just acting on behalf of industry,\" Sippel said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ePrivacy bill making slow progress</emphasis></p><p>Commission officials and even Commission Vice-President Andrus Ansip have also criticised the slow pace of ePrivacy talks. But they point to the years of difficult negotiations before the GDPR was passed in 2016 as proof that privacy legislation is often hard-fought.</p><p>One Commission official close to the file recently told reporters that \"the huge lobby that was built around the GDPR moved to the ePrivacy file\". The GDPR is the most lobbied piece of EU legislation ever. It racked up a record-high 3,999 amendments from MEPs before it was approved.</p><p>For Commission officials who have struggled to push the contentious ePrivacy bill through negotiations, the Facebook scandal is a selling point that could harness support for the legislation.</p><h/><p>Facebook users \"need to know what happened with their data\" following reports over a week ago that millions of profiles on the social media platform were secretly used to help political campaigns, EU Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel said.</p><p>MEPs who support the bill are not giving up.</p><p>German Green MEP Jan Philipp Albrecht, who was the Parliament's lead negotiator on the GDPR, said during Wednesday's debate that the upcoming regulation is \"setting the global standard for protecting personal data\". But the ePrivacy bill is still the \"missing brick in this wall\", he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EPP lawmakers say GDPR\u00a0\"a first step\"</emphasis></p><p>Even MEPs from centre-right political groups that voted against ePrivacy last year admitted that the GDPR will not be enough to stop another massive data breach from happening.</p><p>Axel Voss, a German MEP from the centre-right EPP, the Parliament's largest political group, said, \"Even with the GDPR, we're still going to have this type of scandal because we can't completely regulate this misuse.\"</p><p>Other legislators from the EPP were more specific about how new regulation might rein in tech companies.</p><p>Geoffroy Didier, a French centre-right MEP, called the GDPR \"a first step in the right direction\".</p><p>\"It is a necessary step, but it is not sufficient, which is why I propose that we go further than that and we demand that these platforms are no longer able to use our data for commercial purposes,\" Didier said. He called for new rules defining how tech platforms can store and use personal data.</p><p>Despite broad agreement among MEPs that there is a need for sharper rules to stop data mishandling, only a few legislators who had previously voted against the ePrivacy bill spoke out about the draft legislation on Wednesday.</p><p>Only British Tory MEP Daniel Dalton, a member of the Parliament's conservative ECR group, said explicitly that there will be no immediate need for the ePrivacy legislation after the GDPR takes effect.</p><p>\"Let's find out what happens here, first see how well the GDPR works in practice and then, when we have a full picture, assess if more legislation is needed,\" Dalton said.</p><h/><p>Different political groups need to accept the European Parliament's agreement on the draft ePrivacy regulation, even though conservative and centre-right MEPs opposed the bill, Birgit Sippel said in an interview with EURACTIV.com.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1231032</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S4M-PPK1-JCF9-446J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1178\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 19, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Now that effort is going global, and that means Google money will become available for North American news organizations: Google announced[2] yesterday that it's looking to fund digital news projects[3] on this continent. (Well, some of this continent: just the United States, U.S. overseas territories, and only the non-Quebec portion of Canada, for some reason.) Projects will receive funding up to $300,000, with Google financing making up to 70 percent of the total project cost; applications are due July 15 at midnight PT. </p><p>(It's not just North America and Europe, by the way: Challenges for Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa[4] will open to applications soon. It's all overseen by Ludovic Blecher[5], a 2013 Nieman Fellow.) There's no indication of how many projects will be funded or what the total outlay will be; in the fine print[6], Google also notes that it may go past $300,000 or 70 percent on 'large projects that significantly benefit the broad news ecosystem.' From Google's announcement post[7]: The first North America GNI Innovation Challenge will focus on projects which generate revenue and/or increase audience engagement for local news. In this context, local means an existing, journalistic organization whose primary focus is on a specific geographical target group. All ideas are welcome, but we are requiring all projects to have a monetization component and to provide explicit plans for monetization with clear indicators showing the potential of the project to create economic value added for the business. Also note these caveats[8]: 'Editorial expenses are not part of the eligible costs for the Google-funded portion of a project and will not be coveredFunding may not be spent on general and overhead costs.' The first cut of applicants will be done by a team of Google employees, who will then make recommendations to a final jury 'composed of regional and global Google executives and up to two external experts.' This challenge is part of the broader Google News Initiative, which launched in the U.S. last year[9]. It committed '$300 million over three years toward various products and initiatives intended to help news publishers and sweeten Google's relationships with them' \u2014 think subscription tools, fake news fighting campaigns, and so on \u2014but at the time of launch it wasn't handing out grants to North American publishers. Now it is. Google's initial move into news funding[10] in 2015 came as it faced significant opposition from both European publishers[11] and European governments. (The debut of the Google News Initiative came just two weeks after the EU formally accused Google of abusing its market power[12].) Its move to North America comes as U.S. politicians (including some traditionally regulation-skeptical ones[13]) talk about breaking[14] up[15] tech[16] companies[17], including Google. (The Canadians aren't too happy[18] with Silicon Valley[19] right now either.) Facebook, which has faced a larger share of recent approbrium than Google has, is also doling out money to local news publishers[20], and earlier this month it opened a call[21] 'to support and connect people and organizations that are building community through local news,' offering grants between $5,000 and $25,000. There are a few ways to think about programs like this. On one hand: Free money! And the challenge is open to 'digital natives, startups, NGOs, industry organizations, broadcasters, traditional news organizations, freelancers, and sole proprietors' \u2014that's a wide pool of possible recipients (although at least in Europe, most of the funding has gone to Western European, for-profit, legacy media organizations[22]). On the other hand, Google and Facebook aren't exactly friends to local news. Those two companies alone accounted for 60 percent of the digital ad market in 2018[23], as print advertising continued to fall and even big digital native media outlets like BuzzFeed and Vox suffered[24]. Debate continues about whether news organizations that have been so damaged by the existence of the tech giants should also accept money from them[25]. So far, the most organized opposition has come from Europe \u2014where Schibsted Media Group, for instance, won't be taking any money that the platforms are doling out[26]. ('We decided, on a corporate level, that we should not take project money from Google and Facebook, whatever it is they're handing out money for, whether it's for interns or specific journalism projects. That's a decision made from the top,' Karin Pettersson, Schibsted's VP of public policy and a 2016 Nieman Fellow, told Nieman Lab last year.) Four large German publishers also teamed up this week[27] in an effort to pull advertising dollars back from the platforms. This type of response has been less common in the United States, where publishers have generally chosen to work with the platforms even as they decry their power. And on occasion, suspect projects have made their way through Google's grant application process. Earlier this year, for instance, Google offered funding to a mouthpiece of Hungary's authoritarian government[28]. That offer was rescinded, but it could be a harbinger of sticky situations in the U.S., though the narrower focus on local news might smoothen the process.

Many other firms are quietly shedding staff. McCarthy T\u00e9trault, one of the pillars of Bay Street law, is down from a pre-2008 high of nearly 700 lawyers to 560. Some top-tier firms are finding less expensive offices, or sloughing off a floor or two.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A rarely heard word has gained currency in this moment: de-equitization. It describes the formerly unthinkable process of removing a partner from the ranks of those with ownership shares in the firm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Up until a year, a year and a half ago, there were critics, but it seemed nothing would ever change,\" says Hudson's Bay Co.'s general counsel, David Pickwoad, formerly an associate at Stikeman Elliott. \"But now, the pace of change in the profession is breathtaking.\"</p><p>And things are tight where they were never tight before. In recent years, between 12% and 15% of law graduates have been unable to find articling posts in Ontario. Meanwhile, \"the market for associates, including senior associates, isn't nearly what it once was,\" says Christopher Sweeney, the CEO of Canada's leading legal recruitment firm, ZSA. \"We're mainly concentrating these days on partners making lateral moves and in-house hiring [at corporations].\"</p><p>Up to a point, the industry is having this existential moment for a simple reason: There's not as much deal-making going on as there used to be. But the slowdown is also exposing archaic practices in a business that is perhaps just a little too steeped in tradition, mystique and notions of prestige. Billing rates as high as $1,000 an hour don't seem sustainable in light of stark facts like the spectacular collapse of Wall Street firm Dewey &amp; LeBeouf. Technology, outsourcing, modern management methods and a spirit of transparency are finally remaking corporate law, just as they have so many other businesses. At the same time, these tectonic forces are creating opportunities for both lawyers and their clients.</p><p>*********************************</p><p>All the upheaval makes me glad I didn't stay in law myself. I followed my father into the practice, but left in the late '90s, for the riskier, lower-paid business of journalism. If I'd stayed, I'd be in the thick of the upheaval now-like Rubsun Ho, who was a year behind me at the University of Toronto's law school in the '90s. He's an affable, soft-spoken guy who, after graduating, joined Stikeman. Following that stint, he was hired as in-house counsel at a software company.</p><p>And then he became one of the revolutionaries of what is sometimes called New Law: In 2005, Ho and former Osler Hoskin &amp; Harcourt lawyer Joe Milstone founded Cognition.</p><p>That sounds like a funny name for a law firm, but it's not unusual: Big Law firms are named after venerated partners; New Law firms are branded with vaguely positive handles.</p><p>And where the offices of Big Law firms are all about the mahogany, New Law is more about particleboard.</p><p>Indeed, Cognition's loft-style offices, west of Toronto's downtown core, are a little shabby, with dog-eared law texts jumbled on Ikea shelves. An interview with Ho and Milstone is held instead at a small satellite \"intake centre\" they've set up in Toronto's MaRS Centre.</p><p>The old hospital complex where Banting and Best hopefully injected diabetes patients has lately become, in part, an incubator for innovative science- and technology-driven companies. Ho and Milstone's lawyers offer informal counsel (and free doughnuts) once a week to the incubator's denizens, hoping to catch a clean-tech or Internet start-up on its way to success.</p><p>Seems pretty entrepreneurial for a law firm, doesn't it? But the fundamentals of New Law go further than a willingness to prospect for business. The principles behind Cognition-and behind the U.S. firm, Axiom, that inspired it-include being tech-savvy, efficiency-conscious, low-overhead and partner-free.</p><p>Ho explains that something came to him one day when he was staring out his 53rd-floor window at Stikeman: His work was being billed to clients at $250 an hour, while his take-home worked out to about $40 an hour.</p><p>That rang a bell for me. A couple of years ago, I heard a Canadian-born venture capitalist working in Silicon Valley explain why he'd been happy to have a hand in backing Axiom.</p><p>\"The buy-sell in law is awfully broken,\" Chris Albinson said. \"How many lawyers do you know who enjoy their work lives? Look at the cost structure of law firms: A third of the dollars goes to the senior partners who are doing no work; one third into physical plant-marble conference rooms that add no value; one third goes to the guys and gals doing the work, the associates.</p><p>\"And all clients hate it. They want to work with the person most capable of doing the work quickly-and in a flat social web, where all our experience and capability is fully visible, they know who that person is. They think: 'Why do I need this pyramid scam that was invented 150 years ago?'\"</p><p>Axiom was the brainchild of Mark Harris, who, in the late 1990s, had the same revelatory moment as Ho. After a particularly busy January, he realized he'd almost billed out his annual salary, and so the rest of the year he'd be working to cover Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell's overhead and the partners' draws.</p><p>Harris set up a meeting with a tech entrepreneur he knew, Alec Guettel. \"It's an embarrassing clich\u00e9,\" Guettel says, \"but Mark sketched it all out-what became Axiom-on a napkin.\"</p><p>They would hire lawyers who had graduated from the best schools and trained at elite firms, and then get them to work out of client offices for the duration of a project-for as long as the businesses retaining them wanted. The client wouldn't have to bear the expense of a new staffer, but could bulk up when necessary. And the \"embedded\" lawyer would see how the world looked from the client's point of view, and therefore serve up more tailored advice.</p><p>For voluminous, repetitive work, meanwhile, Axiom would retain outside organizations adept at delivering speedily, and at a fraction of the cost that a law firm would generally bill by the hour to have young associates do the work. The new firm would, for instance, send corporate due diligence and document review to groups of lawyers working in India and routine contract drafting to a high-volume shop in Houston.</p><p>But why would a top lawyer want to give up all the perks and parent-impressing prestige of Big Law for what skeptics have called a glorified temp agency? \"It's not for everyone, but we give attorneys more flexibility in their careers,\" Guettel says. \"We knew a lot of incredibly talented, incredibly unhappy attorneys working incredibly hard. For them, partnership is not the brass ring that it once was. And we saw a lot of clients who felt it wasn't an efficient system and getting top-tier legal advice was too expensive.\"</p><p>Founded in 2000, Axiom limped through its first few years, but soon enough, big tech, seeing a firm speaking its language, came calling; it was followed by other, more traditional businesses-Google, Yahoo and Cisco were joined by Thomson Reuters, Avon and Citigroup. Today even the most complacent senior lawyers at major firms are taking notice of the numbers Axiom is racking up: annual revenues that have grown to a reported $150 million (U.S.), 1,000 employees and 12 modestly appointed offices in America and the U.K.</p><p>As yet, Axiom's Canadian equivalent doesn't pose a substantial threat to the top firms on Bay Street. But, unlike them, it's growing. As at Axiom, Cognition places lawyers at client businesses-and the firm has grown to 32 roving lawyers, almost all, like the founders, ex-\"downtowners.\" The clients are growing from small or mid-size concerns to the likes of Volkswagen Canada, Torstar Corp. and the operator of the Rexall drugstore chain.</p><p>Cognition is about to hire another six attorneys and anticipates taking on another half-dozen by the end of the year. Ho and Milstone haven't needed to work too hard to find qualified candidates-with minimal advertising, they had 260 applications come their way last year.</p><p>Milstone plans to open a small Calgary office, and perhaps then expand to Vancouver and Montreal. Though he and Ho won't disclose the hard figures, they say Cognition's revenues have grown in the past five years at a compound annual rate of more than 25%, placing the firm on Profit magazine's list of Canada's fastest-growing companies.</p><p>*********************************</p><p>Kevin West is not the sort of lawyer who would likely ever have gone the boutique route in generations past. After graduating from Dalhousie, he clerked at the Supreme Court, landed plum jobs at the New York and Sydney offices of Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, and then became a partner at what is arguably Toronto's pre-eminent business firm, Davies Ward Phillips &amp; Vineberg. In 2010, he left downtown for a basic office at Yonge and St. Clair, calling his new start-up SkyLaw.</p><p>His approach is to cherry-pick top lawyers from different firms to consult on various aspects of a deal. \"I want the right person to answer a tax problem-not just whoever is in the firm I've retained's tax department. The idea is that through my network, I'll be able to find out who that [right person] is.\"</p><p>West's first partner at SkyLaw didn't stay long, perferring to work at a Big Law firm in London. The parting was amicable, West says. The new, entrepreneurial approach to the the business isn't the right one for every talented young lawyer. For now, West has on board an experienced law clerk, an articling student, and a former senior counsel at a Bay Street firm, who decided not to retire after leaving downtown but to keep doing work for some key clients, using SkyLaw as a base of operations. On the day we meet, West is delighted to have just cut cheques for some serious bonuses for his small staff.</p><p>The founder of another new-school firm, Peter Carayiannis, is a former corporate associate at what is now the nation's second-largest firm, the 700-lawyers-plus Gowling Lafleur Henderson. Founded in 2012, his firm, Conduit Law, fits into a single room whose one swanky touch, apart from the exposed brick, is a cabinet housing state-of-the-art IT equipment. The desks, except for Carayiannis's, are devoid of personal effects, since his 12 lawyers work there only occasionally-\"hotelling\" at any desk that's available on a given day.</p><p>Carayiannis rejects law's long-time cornerstone: the billable hour. \"We bill based on the value the client receives-the amount of work it takes to get there is relevant, but we want to take less time, often using tech, outsourcing, or by matching a lawyer with relevant skills to the problem at hand.\"</p><p>When we speak, Carayiannis has just returned from a gathering of the New Law tribe in Manhattan, called ReInvent Law NYC. The packed one-day conference heard a keynote address from the movement's leading thinker, British academic Richard Susskind.</p><p>Susskind's essential message, contained in books such as The End of Lawyers?, is that project-management principles, of the Six Sigma variety, ought to be injected into the legal sphere. Firms should break projects into parts, then match the work with whoever can do it most efficiently-whether they be lawyers or not, in-house or not.</p><p>Compared with the U.S., the Canadian legal outsourcing industry is still in a rudimentary state, but not as rudimentary as when Shelby Austin left Davies to start ATD Legal Services in 2010. \"I was just a dutiful young female partner-I always did everything by the book,\" she says. \"But then I went home over the December holidays one year, thought about it, came back in January and quit.\" Her company contracts about 200 attorneys to review and organize documents in big litigation files, and to conduct due diligence. Many of these freelancers are young; Austin is benefitting from the tough job market for freshly minted lawyers.</p><p>Not that she had it easy herself starting out. \"To land work, I met with anyone and everyone early on-the firm's janitor, someone's cousin's sister,\" Austin jokes. She is cagey about her private company's revenues, but will say they were between $2 and $5 million in 2012, and have grown \"significantly\" since then. In January, ATD was acquired by Deloitte-\"my posh buyer\" she calls the professional-services giant.</p><p>Rob Centa, one of Toronto's top young litigators, working out of the boutique firm Paliare Roland Rosenberg Rothstein, has made extensive use of Austin's services. \"It's great to have someone, a trained lawyer, at a relatively low cost, going through the reams and reams of documents-sorting out relevant documents from the e-mails that just say, 'Are you going home for Mother's Day this weekend?'\" Centa says. \"We want our junior lawyers to have the experience of doing that, at least once, so they know what it's like and can manage that process appropriately. But it's not always a good use of their time, and our clients don't want to pay their rates for that. It's good that Shelby's here [in Canada], because you can meet with the reviewing lawyer and have this comfort-you can spot-check 100 documents in the less-relevant pile, make sure nothing was missed.\"</p><p>Austin herself is \"bullish on the India story. Maybe local lawyers aren't ready for that yet, but I can see a time when they might be.\"</p><p>*********************************</p><p>When that time comes, it will likely be in-house counsel that makes the call. Indeed, one of the shifts under way in corporate law is a movement in power from outside counsel to inside.</p><p>When David Allgood left Osler to join RBC in 1998, it wasn't common for someone who'd achieved the brass ring of partnership, as he had, to go in-house. \"It used to be like they said of teaching, those who could, did.  Those who could succeed downtown did and stayed down there,\" he says. But after he made the switch, \"soon all the banks had taken on former partners.\"</p><p>The prestige and size of the in-house bar have both grown, according to observers, and RBC's 240-lawyer complement is larger than most Canadian firms. Allgood, who is the bank's general counsel, and Emily Jelich, who is associate general counsel, have striven to make the department efficient, applying Six Sigma-style principles to work that ranges from regulatory compliance to drafting standard financial instruments to real estate.</p><p>With the help of consultants, they dutifully analyzed their work, broke it into chunks and figured out who could best do it; they looked at the risks in their practice and what was a manageable level for each activity.</p><p>Employees now train in the project-management system, receiving recognition in the form of martial-arts-style belts. \"We've found savings of more than $7 million, and $20 million in avoided costs,\" Jelich says. As in so many legal departments, they have been, and remain, under considerable pressure to reduce their own budgets and the amount they spend on outside counsel. (Corporate counsel have, post-downturn, become increasingly proactive-even activist-about how, and for how much, their external counsel will work.)</p><p>Having been through their own up-with-efficiency processes, Allgood and Jelich have looked to the firms they do business with to follow their lead. They want more certainty in their bills; they're not, as a rule, happy with just the billable-hour system. \"We're waiting for a firm to mine its own data and price to us on a value basis-it's very early days on that,\" Jelich says. \"Lawyers provide a service; they aren't special.\"</p><p>At Hudson's Bay Co., general counsel Pickwoad is also pushing his outside counsel to give him more certainty in billing. In an increasingly common practice, he drafts detailed requests for proposals, getting outside lawyers to indicate how they'd handle a job and what it might cost. Having worked outside law-at Deloitte, and at a steel company when he was young-he, like Jelich, doesn't buy into a model that treats lawyers as exceptional cases. \"For many years, in a way, the onus has been on the client to manage the lawyers, to manage the cost. In my view, that should be something they should increasingly do themselves.\"</p><p>*********************************</p><p>It's not as if Big Law has been twiddling its thumbs while all this change-economic, cultural, technological-swirls around it. The most obvious attempt at 21st-century renewal is a series of cross-border mergers. Most striking among them is Norton Rose Fulbright, formed when the old Montreal firm OgilvyRenault threw in its lot with an even older City of London firm, and others, to create a 3,800-lawyer international practice.</p><p>Meanwhile Carayiannis's former firm, Gowling, recently hired (from McCarthy T\u00e9trault) a legal project management specialist to help recalibrate its practice. A partner in the firm's Hamilton office, Mark Tamminga, has developed a computer-aided system to process work relating to mortgages, allowing Gowling to get a huge volume of work done efficiently. And the firm where my father was a partner, Borden Ladner Gervais, has adopted something they call Adroit, seemingly inspired (again) by the Six Sigma system.</p><p>Osler recently employed a computer program developed in part by a young Canadian lawyer to aid in due diligence on a $900-million (U.S.) deal that closed in January-Chemtrade Logistics's acquisition of General Chemical Holding Co. Built over three years, Noah Waisberg's DiligenceEngine searches contracts for relevant clauses and puts its findings into summary charts. The tool is used (after training) by lawyers. It's not outsourcing per se, but it can dramatically reduce the time an associate spends on due diligence.</p><p>At Osler, partner Terry Burgoyne and chief knowledge officer Mara Nickerson talk animatedly about disaggregation (the buzzword for dividing up a big project), about budgeting, about scope-setting meetings with clients, about the sophisticated software they've found to track progress on each file and about how they're using the data to manage the next similar one more efficiently.</p><p>They talk too about the process of persuading sometimes technophobic lawyers to change tack. There is an energy and enthusiasm in the room-which makes me think back to a comment by Shelby Austin.</p><p>Although she admires Axiom's founders, I was surprised to find she's not a disciple of Susskind's. \"As far as the big firms are concerned, Susskind's got it wrong,\" Austin said. \"They have some of the smartest people in the country working in them. I know-I was there, inside. It's crazy for anyone to count them out, to think they aren't going to be among those able to adjust to whatever changes there are in the marketplace.\"</p><p>*********************************</p><p>THE LIFE OF BIG LAW</p><p>A slow start, a rush to bulk up-and then mishaps and splintering</p><p>1856-1862</p><p>D'Alton McCarthy, Britton Bath Osler and Edward Blake begin practising law in Upper Canada, incubating firms that would become large and prestigious in the Toronto market. McCarthy went on to serve as an influential (if intolerant) MP, Osler to prosecute Louis Riel and Blake to serve as Ontario's premier.</p><p>1981</p><p>The firm McCarthys seeks to open a Calgary office, over the Alberta Law Society's objections to the Upper Canadian interloper.</p><p>1989</p><p>The Supreme Court allows McCarthys to set up shop in Alberta-and a high-stakes game of musical chairs results. Most major Toronto, Calgary, Montreal and Vancouver firms merge their way into national powerhouses with ever-morphing names.</p><p>1992</p><p>Five barristers exit McCarthys, led by Alan Lenczner, to set up an elite commercial litigation boutique.</p><p>1996</p><p>Toronto firm Holden Day Wilson (55 lawyers) closes a couple of years after a senior associate bursts through the TD Centre conference-room glass and falls 24 storeys to his death.</p><p>1998</p><p>Osler Hoskin Harcourt partner David Allgood goes in-house at RBC. It was then rare for a downtown-firm partner to go client-side, but it soon becomes common as the prestige of the in-house bar grows.</p><p>2000</p><p>Tory Tory DesLauriers &amp; Binnington, a Toronto partnership founded in 1941, becomes the first major Canadian firm to merge with an American one: New York's Haythe &amp; Curley, forming the 300-lawyer Tory Haythe. (After accusations of sexual harassment surface against Tom Haythe, the firm rebranded as Torys.)</p><p>2000</p><p>Former New York firm associate Mark Harris and serial tech entrepreneur Alec Guettel found Axiom, a legal services organization predicated on low overhead, project-to-project lawyers and no partners.</p><p>2005</p><p>Rubsun Ho (ex of Stikeman Elliott) and Joe Milstone (ex of Osler) found Cognition, an early Canadian exponent of the Axiom approach.</p><p>2007</p><p>Goodman and Carr (140 lawyers at its peak) closes, after bleeding partners and the failure of merger talks with global behemoth Baker &amp; McKenzie.</p><p>2009</p><p>Osler invites Richard Susskind, the savage English critic of Big Law, to address its partners.</p><p>2010</p><p>Partner Shelby Austin leaves premier Toronto firm Davies Ward Phillips &amp; Vineberg to found ATD Legal Services, which employs specialist lawyers to do document review; Deloitte later purchases her company.</p><p>2011</p><p>OgilvyRenault, a firm with roots in 19th-century Montreal, merges with a storied City of London firm (founded in 1794) to become part of what is now the 3,800-lawyer, 54-office Norton Rose Fulbright.</p><p>2013</p><p>Canadian firm Fraser Milner Casgrain merges with second-tier English and American firms to form colossus Dentons (2,600 lawyers). Meanwhile, the pre-Confederation firms soldier on as some of the country's oldest businesses: McCarthy T\u00e9trault (560 lawyers), Blake Cassels &amp; Graydon (555) and Osler Hoskin &amp; Harcourt (403).</p><p>2014</p><p>Canada's seventh-largest firm, Heenan Blaikie (about 500 lawyers), suddenly collapses-and then the world's biggest firm, DLA Piper (4,200 lawyers), exits talks to found a Canadian office with some of Heenan's former lawyers. A suddenly displaced lawyer remarks to The Globe and Mail: \"The freight train that is headed towards Big Law slammed into our firm.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20140327escenic_17692894</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BV7-D6F1-F072-J111-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3688\"/><timeReceived>1:25 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Well, it's great for fodder, and maybe it helps psychologically to see a new first-digit for the SPX for the first time since 2014. The challenge to that psychological lift probably comes when earnings season starts next week. Expectations on Wall Street are already pretty soft, meaning companies have a low bar for beating projections. Companies that do beat might get a small reward in the stock market, but companies that miss low expectations are likely to get taken out to the woodshed. </p><p>That's one reason why some analysts think the SPX might be approaching the top of its range for the moment. The earnings rewards look like they might be unremarkable, while the punishments look like they could be significant. If we see a couple of big-name stocks miss earnings expectations, that could hurt sentiment across the market. When you look at the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), the 'P' has been rising much faster than the 'E,' for a lot of companies. That potentially raises questions about current market values when you look ahead to an earnings season where many analysts expect average S...00 earnings to actually fall year over year. Even if earnings turn out better than expected, the market faces more tests in the months ahead, including the tariff overhang, Brexit, and, as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reminded people in his testimony Wednesday, the U.S. debt ceiling debate. Yes, based on Powell's testimony Wednesday, a rate cut later this month looks extremely likely. That news is now basically built in and it's on to earnings, a key test to see if this rally can continue. Speaking of earnings, Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE: DAL[1]) reported strong Q2 results early Thursday, easily beating third-party consensus estimates on earnings per share and coming in slightly higher on revenue. The company also raised its fiscal year guidance. Shares rose about 2% in pre-market trading. The other earnings news this morning didn't get so much applause, with Bed Bath ...yond Inc. (NASDAQ: BBBY[2]) beating bottom-line estimates but apparently disappointing on guidance. Shares fell 4%. On the trade front, France and the U.S. are having a skirmish. The U.S. Trade Representative is investigating whether a new 3% French 'digital' tax on company revenue 'is unfairly targeting' certain U.S.-based technology companies. Some of the companies potentially affected by the tax include Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG[3]), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN[4]), and Facebook Inc.(NASDAQ: FB[5]). The French Senate approved the tax early Thursday. Meanwhile, crude continues to find momentum, with U.S. prices trading above $60 a barrel\u2014a six-week high\u2014amid hurricane concerns in the Gulf of Mexico and a big weekly U.S. supply draw. Powell continues his Capitol Hill testimony this morning.Powell Delivers for StocksFor the second time in two weeks, the market got what it wanted from the Fed yesterday. Back in late June, stocks rallied after the Fed's meeting when Powell expressed new concerns about the economy and raised hopes of a July rate cut. Then on Wednesday in his 'Humphrey Hawkins' testimony to Congress, he renewed those hopes by again talking about economic uncertainty and noting that the big June job gains didn't mean all was well. It seemed to signal that Powell is ready to cut rates later this month. The odds of a 50 basis-point cut in July rose from under 4% early Wednesday to more than 26% by the end of the day after Powell spoke, according to CME Group futures. Chances for another Fed easing in September are now above 70%, up from around 60% earlier this week. We often emphasize here that a single piece of data doesn't represent a trend, and Powell made that clear in his Q...ith Congress on Wednesday. At one point, a House member asked Powell if strong jobs growth had changed his negative views about the economy. 'The straight answer to your question is no,' Powell replied, adding that weakness in overseas economies continues to weigh on the U.S. economy. Economists' forecasts for U.S. economic growth arguably back up Powell's concerns. For instance, the New York Fed Staff 'Nowcast' predicts gross domestic product (GDP) to rise just 1.48% in Q2. That improves just slightly to 1.74% in Q3. Compare that to the 3% growth in Q1 and nearly 3% growth for the full year of 2018 and it looks clear that things are slowing down. Softness overseas, which Powell referred to, plays a role, but it's not the only factor. Trade worries are another major weight. The New York Fed's probability model now signals around a 32% chance of a U.S. recession next year. That's a big leap from 12-month recession odds of just around 10% at the start of 2019. One analyst on CNBC said Wednesday that the New York Fed's probability data rising above 30% has often been a good, but not perfect, indicator of near-term recession risk. All this leads to a question many investors might be asking themselves today: If things look so tepid, why did stocks rally to record highs on Powell's testimony? Yes, rates look like they'll probably be going down, maybe more than once this year. But the Fed lowering rates isn't necessarily the best news. The Fed doesn't ease its policy when the economy is rolling along. A stronger economy would ultimately be a better argument for record highs on Wall StreetQ2 Results Could Help Finish Story Started by PowellEarnings season isn't a panacea, but it might help answer some questions that seem more theoretical now. If executives back up Powell's assertions about economic weakness and earnings come in as bad or worse than analysts expect, it's possible that might be a wet blanket thrown over the market. At this point, however, it looks like investors are hoping low rates can keep companies interested in making new investments and keeping workers on the job. That also depends on consumer demand, which could be buffeted by lower borrowing costs. The other thing earnings season can do is help crystalize what executives think of the tariff situation. They were relatively quiet about that on their Q1 calls, but now there are 89 companies in the S...00 issuing negative Q2 guidance, and a lot of them probably are doing this partly because of tariff worries. We're coming to a point where CEOs of multinational companies will almost be forced to comment on tariffs. Powell pointed to persistent low inflation as another concern, and today marked the release of the June consumer price index (CPI). The core CPI, which strips out food and energy, came in above expectations at 0.3% for the month and 2.1% year-over-year, up from May's 2%. However, headline inflation of 0.1% in June was only slightly above third-party estimates for a flat number, while the year-over-year headline CPI increase of 1.6% was in line with Wall Street's expectations. It seems unlikely that these data would give the Fed any pause about the anticipated rate cut, but Powell might get asked about it as he testifies in Congress today. More inflation data are due tomorrow with the June Producer Price Index (PPI). At this point, analysts expect PPI to come in flat, with core PPI (stripping out energy and food) rising 0.2%, according to Briefing.com. That's pretty similar to the previous month and not too remarkable. Also on the data side, Fed minutes from June came out Wednesday but kind of got lost in the shuffle with Powell providing so much updated analysis during his testimony. We all heard straight from the horse's mouth on Wednesday, and that continues today with more Powell testimony in D.C. The minutes showed Fed officials backing Powell's views about economic risks increasing. From a technical standpoint, there's some significance in the SPX crossing a major barrier like 3000, but it might be more important if it can close above that, which it didn't do Wednesday. Sometimes you see a big number get breached intraday and then several days of the market toying with it again but not closing above it. That can't be ruled out here, but if the SPX can make several closes above 3000, that could help cement that round number as a support level.Figure 1: A MAN AND A MARKET: Any doubt that a single person can have an outsized effect on the entire market arguably vanishes with a look at this intraday chart of the S...00 (candlestick) and 10-year Treasury yield (TNX) over the Tuesday to Wednesday timeframe. Look at the jump in stocks and the drop in yields early Wednesday right after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony went public. Data Source: Cboe Global Markets, S...ow Jones Indices.

FAANGs Soon Back in the Hot Seat: Feel like taking a summer vacation to steamy Washington, D.C.? Some executives at the 'FAANG' companies have no choice, but might wish they were somewhere cooler. Officials from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL[6]), Amazon, Facebookand Google are scheduled to testify next week as part of House lawmakers' wide-ranging investigation into big tech companies and potential threats they may pose to competition, according to the Washington Post. It's been a while since these executives got called out on the carpet by Congress, but this might put them and these issues back in focus. While Democrats lead the House and some of their standard bearers are calling for more regulation in the technology business, Republicans have also raised concerns about possible competitive threats in the industry. Also, President Trump told reporters last month that, 'Obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly,' when asked about antitrust issues with large tech firms like FB and GOOGL. Stay tuned, because this sort of hearing can sometimes cause stocks to move, especially if it looks like the executives are turning into punching bags for Congress. Mixing and Matching Bank Earnings: Though investors often think of the big banks as one entity responding to various economic cues, that isn't really the case. Sometimes the bank stocks move in sync, but it's also important to distinguish them, because they're not a solid bloc. For instance, falling mortgage levels\u2014with the average 30-year mortgage now at around 3.75% vs. 4.52% a year ago\u2014probably meant more for Wells Fargo than the other banks reporting next week, due to WFC's huge presence in the mortgage space. If consumer spending slows, that could show up in C's or JPM's results due to their massive credit card businesses. Another thing to consider keeping in mind as bank earnings approach next week is the wide views bank executives have of the economy. The very nature of their business means they tend to keep a close eye on trends that really can make a difference for the entire stock market. These include U.S. trade disputes with China and Europe, immigration, Fed policy, and infrastructure. Commodity price trends are another place bank executives might be able to offer some pertinent thoughts. That's why if you have time to listen, it might be prudent to consider tuning in and hearing what they have to say on their earnings calls. Steep Road Ahead?The Fed could be trying to steepen the yield curve a little by keeping short-term borrowing costs low. If that's its strategy, it seemed to work on Wednesday, though one day is never enough to be a trend. As Fed Chairman Powell testified to Congress and made it clear to investors that the Fed is eyeing a possible July rate cut, the 30-year Treasury note sold off, while 10-year and two-year notes rose slightly. While the 10-year yield didn't probe lows below 2% the way it did recently, it did come down pretty solidly from its early highs of around 2.1% posted before Powell's remarks went public, finishing the day at 2.06%. More significantly, maybe, is that the two-year note did well compared to the 30-year. So the yield curve did steepen slightly on Wednesday, and that could be good news overall for the market. However, we'd probably have to see this continue for a few days for it to look significant, and one negative side effect (which was evident Wednesday) could be pressure on the Financial sector. Meanwhile, the Fed's signaling seemed to weigh on the U.S. dollar and might have aided crude prices as well, though a big U.S. weekly crude draw also played a role. Energy shares led the leaderboard Wednesday in part due to the crude rally.

The app is widely credited with reinvigorating the team collaboration market, now worth $3.5 billion globally, and has attracted a host of big-name competitors including Microsoft, Google and Facebook.</p><p><br/>Slack rebuffed early acquisition attempts by several big tech firms (reportedly including Microsoft and Amazon) to show it can succeed on its own. Now, the company is poised to capitalize on the booming interest in team collaboration and channel-based communications. The company still sees opportunity ahead: in a recent S1 filling, Slack pegged the overall market value at $28 billion.<br/>\u00a0<br/>There are a number of tactics it can take as it looks to push further into the enterprise, fend off rivals while also evolving its own software to meet the changing needs of an increasingly digital workforce.<br/>Winning over large enterprises<br/>In many cases, Slack first enters an organization with smaller deployments on a team-by-team basis, with pockets of usage popping up across different divisions. In recent years, the company has sought bigger, wall-to-wall deployment deals, leading to the creation of its Enterprise Grid offering. At the same time, it has added security and management features designed to appeal to CIOs and IT admins as well as compliance certification to ease entry into highly regulated sectors.<br/>But with established vendors like Cisco and Microsoft also turning their focus to team messaging, a relative newcomer like Slack faces competition for those lucrative enterprise deals.<br/>The ability to win over these large organizations may come down to Slack's ability to convince CIOs to invest in a standalone collaboration setup rather than choosing apps offered by rival products' suites. To do so, Slack needs to show it can serve as the central hub for getting work done across all business teams.<br/>\"Slack's success will be determined in the short-term based on the answer to one question: 'Can Slack prove to the enterprise buyer that it is more than a chat app, more than a collaboration tool, but instead an enterprise collaboration platform?'\" said Michael Facemire, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester.<br/>\"If Slack can do this, expanding out of a tech-savvy user base and into all parts of the business become much easier as it starts to do work for everyone,\" Facemire said.<br/>Converting users from its free to paid tiers or Enterprise Grid is another challenge, he said. \"Many companies have multiple instances of free Slack in use. But this group of users faces their first hurdle when these free accounts need enterprise governance (single sign-on, message retention rules, etc.).<br/>\"Will Slack be able to prove the value of both paying the fee and doing the work to integrate in with existing systems? This question will also signal how quickly it can succeed in an enterprise market,\" Facemire said.<br/>Expanding its reach<br/>Slack quickly won over a devoted following among developers and engineering teams with a vast array of third-party integrations and in-depth functionality. And it's generally regarded as having an intuitive user interface. But winning over employees that are less receptive to new technologies and ways of working can be challenging.<br/>\"As it tries to expand beyond its initial core base - including dev ops, IT and knowledge workers - it will have to make its user interface more friendly to employees that might not be as tech-savvy, but can benefit from workflow automation and third-party integrations,\" said Ra\u00fal Casta\u00f1\u00f3n-Mart\u00ednez, a senior analyst at 451 Research.<br/>A more simplified user interface could help, said Angela Ashenden, a principal analyst at CCS Insight. \"Although it's fundamentally based on chat and messaging, which should be straightforward for people to embrace, the extensive use of hashtags and slash commands give the platform a very technical feel, which can be off-putting for non-technical users,\" she said.<br/>\"The mobile experience also needs a lot of attention, as it's currently more of an add-on rather than a core experience,\" Ashenden said.<br/>The mobile app is particularly important for engaging users who may not be desk-based and for whom the app would be their primary way of using Slack, said Ashenden. \"Right now, the platform orients around the desktop/browser experience, and its usage reflects that.'<br/>Slack has had success attracting knowledge workers. But other types of front-line roles, such as clinical, retail or hospitality staffers - often regarded as underserved by digital technology - also represent an opportunity to widen the app's use across organizations.<br/>\"Slack has done extraordinarily well, but we can expect it will continue to prioritize user growth,\" said Casta\u00f1\u00f3n-Mart\u00ednez. \"To do so, it could consider going after 'deskless' workers, including front-line workers in verticals such as retail, manufacturing and healthcare. This is something that competitors like Microsoft Teams and Workplace by Facebook are already doing.\"<br/>To attract these workers, Slack could look to third-party AI partners that offer alternative interface options, such as voice commands, he said.<br/>\"An interesting idea could be integrating speech-enabled applications for workers in professions or verticals where a 'hands-free/heads up' approach - as in the case of workers in healthcare and manufacturing, for example - makes more sense than a text-driven user interface.\"<br/>Outside the U.S., more opportunities<br/>Slack, unsurprisingly, has a strong presence in the U.S., but more than half of its daily active users are located outside of the country; Japan is its second-biggest market and one of its fastest growing. However, all Slack data currently resides on Amazon Web Services in the U.S., which could have implications for customers operating in countries with strict data sovereignty laws.<br/>As a result, the company will need to consider establishing data centers in other regions to support growth.<br/>\"One other major thing Slack needs to invest in is hosting locations outside the US - this is very important if Slack wants to build its growth in Europe, in particular,\" said Ashenden. \"It's also going to be critical for global enterprise customers that need to meet different compliance requirements in different regions.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1173672</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609J-WCK1-DYDW-73FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 3, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Next up, <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos?</nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While no one has accused Mr. Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, the world's richest man and the owner of The Washington Post, of mishandling the data of tens of millions of customers (although Amazon has been the victim of hackers) or making his platform safe for Russian infiltration, the man is becoming the embodiment of Big Tech, for better or for worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Amazon expands in every direction, boosting by the day its already formidable power in retail, logistics, data, cloud computing, entertainment, electronic devices, payment services, web services and groceries, it's time to question whether the company has gone from benign online seller of books to corporate behemoth potentially capable of terrible societal disruption.</p><p>We all know that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has no love for Amazon, a global digital and hardware empire valued at US$700-billion, up by almost two-thirds in one year. The Trumpian tweet machine gun has blasted Amazon for allegedly dodging taxes, ripping off the U.S. Postal Service and gutting retailers. We could dismiss his anti-Amazon rants as cynical attacks on Mr. Bezos himself, in his role as the owner of a newspaper that delights in highlighting Mr. Trump's every flaw and boneheaded decision. But Mr. Trump isn't all wrong on the Amazon file, in the sense that Amazon's sheer heft and influence in almost every aspect of everyday commercial life means the consequences of the company's reach deserve examination.</p><p>Already, society is seeing some of the negative effects of Amazon's relentless expansion. Last year, it delivered five billion packages worldwide through its premium Prime service alone. They came in cardboard boxes that were thrown away or had to be recycled, mostly at taxpayer expense. Amazon delivers those packages by truck to your door. As home deliveries soar, so too will road congestion and pollution spewed from the trucks. Whether or not you are an Amazon customer, you are already paying the price for its phenomenal success.</p><p>At the same time, Amazon, which may soon surpass Apple as the world's most valuable company, has the chutzpah to hold a municipal shakedown competition to find a spot suitable for its second headquarters. Cities across the United States and Canada, some with rotted bridges and schools and potholed streets, are trying to attract Amazon by offering lavish tax breaks (New Jersey offered US$7-billion incentives if Amazon were to pick Newark). Amazon's popularity has been bad news for traditional retailers. Many are dying. One investment firm publishes a \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bespokepremium.com/big-tips/bespokes-death-by-amazon-index-makes-4-year-low/\">https://www.bespokepremium.com/big-tips/bespokes-death-by-amazon-index-makes-4-year-low/</url>\" list of the retailers suffering the most from Amazon's onslaught: Macy's trades at less than half its 2015 high; Sears Canada has gone bankrupt and so has Toys R Us.</p><p>\"We believe [retail] defaults in 2018 could match or exceed last year's record level,\" S&amp;P Global Ratings analyst Robert Schulz said in a recent report. Even as retailers big and small vanish at alarming rates, municipal governments are asking few questions about the consequences of declining Main Street employment and shuttered stores. The lost tax income has to be replaced and squeezing house owners is the obvious solution. Watch your house taxes rise as online retailing takes off. The bigger concern may be concentration of power.</p><p>While Amazon's overall share of total retail sales is still small, at about 4 per cent in the United States in 2017, its share of online commerce is estimated at 40 to 50 per cent. It is the third largest streaming media company and the top provider of cloud computing. It is, or soon will be, the biggest clothing retailer. So far, the anti-trust case against Amazon is not clear, since competition regulators in the Western world seem more concerned about price than market power and the preservation of competition. Amazon cannot be accused of price gouging, though it could raise prices substantially once it's dominant in certain retail categories.</p><p>But there is no doubt that Amazon can, and has, clobbered competitors. Look what its arrival did to the traditional book market. Sometimes Amazon can affect competition even before it actually launches a competing service. The Blue Apron case comes to mind. Shortly before the American company, which provides recipes and packaged ingredients for home cooking, went public last June, Amazon filed a trademark to launch a copycat service. Blue Apron shares immediately plummeted on investor fears that Amazon would get into the same game (the shares have since gone from US$11 to less than US$2).</p><p>The bigger threat may not come from Amazon's clout in retailing, but in search. Today, you might search a product on Google and buy it on Amazon. Tomorrow, you may do both on Amazon. As Amazon's search capabilities expand, Google may become redundant. As its logistics business expands, FedEx, DHL and other delivery companies will come under pressure. If they were smart, they would band together and set up a shopfront to compete with Amazon, but they are running out of time. Amazon's logistics, retailing and data power is becoming hard to beat. As Mr. Big Tech, Mr. Bezos has been celebrated more than scrutinized. Mr. Zuckerberg's long honeymoon is over.

Facebook later clarified that the graphic video was uploaded after the event[3], but the incident called public attention to the risks of livestreaming violence.  In the wake of Godwin's murder, I recommended that Facebook Live broadcasts be time-delayed[4], at least for Facebook users who had told the company they were under 18. That way, adult users would have an opportunity to flag inappropriate content before children were exposed to it. Facebook Live has broadcast killings[5], as well as other serious crimes such as sexual assault, torture, and child abuse[6]. Though the company has hired more than 3,000 additional human content moderators[7], Facebook has not gotten any better at keeping horrifying violence from streaming live without any filter or warning for users. </p><p>In the 24 hours after the New Zealand massacre, 1.5 million videos and images of the killings[8] were uploaded to Facebook's servers, the company said. Facebook highlighted the fact that 1.2 million of them 'were blocked at upload[9].' However, as a social media researcher and educator[10], I heard that as an admission that 300,000 videos and images of a mass murder passed through its automated systems and were visible on the platform. The company noted that fewer than 200 people viewed[11] the livestream of the massacre and that, surprisingly, no users reported it to Facebook until after it ended. These details make painfully clear how dependent Facebook is on users to flag harmful content. They also suggest that people don't know how to report inappropriate content \u2014 or don't have confidence the company will act on the complaint. The video that remained after the livestream ended was viewed nearly 4,000 times \u2014 which doesn't include the many copies of the video[12] uploaded to other sites and to Facebook by other users. It's unclear how many of the people who saw it were minors; children as young as 13 are allowed to set up Facebook accounts and could have encountered unfiltered footage of murderous hatred. It's past time for the company to step up and fulfill the promise founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg made two years ago, after Godwin's murder: 'We will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening[13].'A simple time delayIn the television industry, short time delays of a few seconds are typical[14] during broadcasts of live events. That time allows a moderator to review the content and confirm that it's appropriate for a broad audience.  Facebook relies on users as moderators, and most livestreams don't have as large an audience as TV, so its delay would need to be longer \u2014 perhaps a few minutes. Only then would enough adult users have screened it and had the opportunity to report its content. Major users, including publishers and corporations, could be permitted to livestream directly after completing a training course. Facebook could even let people request a company moderator[15] for upcoming livestreams. Facebook has not yet taken this relatively simple step, and the reason is clear. Time delays took hold in TV only because broadcasting regulators penalized broadcasters[16] for airing inappropriate content during live shows. There is effectively no regulation[17] for social media companies; they change only in pursuit of profits[18] or to minimize public outcry[19]. Whether and how to regulate social media is a political question, but many U.S. politicians have developed deep ties with platforms like Facebook[20]. Some have relied on social media to collect donations, target supporters with advertising and help them get elected[21]. Once in office, they continue to use social media to communicate with supporters[22] in hopes of getting reelected. Federal agencies also use social media to communicate with the public and influence people's opinions[23] \u2014 even in violation of U.S. law[24]. In my view, Facebook's role as a tool to gain, keep, and spread political power makes politicians far less likely to rein it in. Congress has not yet taken any meaningful action to regulate social media companies. Despite strong statements from politicians and even calls for hearings about social media in response to the New Zealand attack[25], U.S. regulators aren't likely to lead the way. European Union officials[26] are handling much of the work, especially around privacy[27]. New Zealand's government has stepped up, too, banning the livestream video[28] of the mosque massacre, meaning anyone who shares it could face up to NZ$10,000 in fines and 14 years in prison[29]. At least two people have already been arrested[30] for sharing it online[31]. Facebook could \u2014 and should \u2014 act nowMuch of the discussion about regulating social media has considered using antitrust and monopoly laws[32] to force the enormous technology giants like Facebook to break up into smaller separate companies. But if it happens at all, that will be very difficult \u2014 breaking up AT...ook a decade[33], from the 1974 lawsuit to the 1984 launch of the 'Baby Bell' companies. In the interim, there will be many more dangerous and violent incidents that people will try to livestream. Facebook should evaluate its products' potential for misuse[34] and discontinue them if the effects are harmful to society. No child should ever see the sort of 'raw and visceral content[35]' that has been produced on Facebook Live \u2014 including mass murder. I don't think adult users should be exposed to witnessing such heinous acts either, as studies have shown that viewing graphic violence has health risks[36], such as post-traumatic stress. That's why I'm no longer recommending just a livestream delay for adolescent users \u2014 it was an appeal to protect children when more major platform changes are unlikely. But all people deserve better and safe social media. I'm now calling on Mark Zuckerberg to shut down Facebook Live in the interest of public health and safety. In my view, that feature should be restored only if the company can prove to the public \u2014 and to regulators \u2014 that its design is safer.  Handling livestreaming safely includes having more than enough professional content moderators to handle the workload. Those workers also must have appropriate access to mental health support[37] and safe working environments, so that even Facebook employees and contractors are not unduly scarred by brutal violence posted online.

It will require goodwill and pragmatism on both sides of the negotiating table. I believe there is a huge incentive for the EU to demonstrate that goodwill, given our trading relationship. We have a deficit in trading in goods with the EU of 96 billion, which means we buy more from the EU than the other way round, there are millions of jobs in Germany alone that depend on British custom so it's in the economic interests of the EU political leaders to be pragmatic, show goodwill and come to the table. </p><p>Thanks very much for your time. One of the issues we would like to be able to debate with Boris Johnson but, as we know, at the moment he is proving rather difficult to get into the television and radio studios. Sky News saying that they will not go ahead tomorrow unless he changes his mind, one is a schedule for ITV, and what else? That's it. They are at the leadership hustings, around 16 in total for party members around the country but in terms of detailed media scrutiny the only one we know about is this one on ITV but that is after the ballot papers have been sent out, presumably quite a few members will have decided before they get to see Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson go head to head, which is why we had Jeremy Hunt this morning in effect appealing to the BBC saying why don't you hold a head to head before the ballot papers go out? It is a given that they can come on the show anytime, you and I can sort that out. Please, please, Boris Johnson, if you are watching, you very welcome. Thank you very much. The former Deputy Prime Minister and Labour peer Lord Prescott has been admitted to hospital after suffering a stroke. His family announced that the 81-year-old was taken ill on Friday. They praised staff at Hull Royal Infirmary and asked for privacy to allow him \"time and space to make a full recovery\". Facebook's head of global affairs, the former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg, has told the BBC that the social media platform is in favour of new industry rules and regulations. Speaking to the Today Programme, Sir Nick said he wants to create an \"oversight board\", with the power to make independent rulings on whether questionable content should be removed from the site. And he said there was no evidence that Facebook affected the result of the EU referendum. These companies are huge and affect every aspect of our lives, our social lives, business lines, everyday lives, a third of the world's populations uses one or other of Facebook's menu of products, WhatsApp and Instagram and so on. Nonetheless it has all happened in such a short period of time I think we are somewhat breathlessly trying to catch up with the pace of growth and put guardrails in place, rules in place, and it's not for private companies, however big or small, to come up with those rules. It is for democratic politicians and the democratic world to do so on privacy, on how elections are conducted, on hateful content, all those things. Let's talk about the principle, first of all. The cynics might say, here is Nick Clegg, effectively a PR man for Mark Zuckerberg, who has had a lot of flak, saying, look this is your problem, not our problem. If you're worried about these things, you do something about it, don't ask us to do something. I'm not just providing a PR gloss, in my new job I am responsible for how these policies are set and they're very substantive on how to tackle terrorist content online, how to protect elections from outside interference and so on. But you are accepting... To some, it will sound as if you're saying, don't blame us, nothing we can do, if you think there's a problem you go and sort it out. I don't think it's an issue of blame, I think it is right that companies like Facebook acknowledge the mistakes that they have made. And of course mistakes have been made. It is just that I don't think that it is in any way conceivable, and more than that, I don't think it's right for private companies to set the rules of the road for something which is as profoundly important as how technology serves society. And in the end, this is not something that big tech companies, from the United States or elsewhere, can or should do on their own. And I'm of the view that some people sort of yell at tech, I think it's important that we fix tech and resolve this tension that does exist between the amazing benefits that technology brings but it also brings risks to society. And I want to see, and that's part</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-800ea27f283b43588c376c14983e06c9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDJ-XJN1-DY08-32P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"789\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

We agree on some things, but disagree on quite a lot. I think there is a fair level of relief within the Irish Government that Boris Johnson toned down a lot of his language at that press conference in Dublin today. He clearly didn't come looking for a row but the question I suppose Dublin has is, what was the motive behind it then?</p><p> Was it a reaction to Amber Rudd's suggestion that not enough is being done to get a deal? Boris Johnson was making the point that he came in the spirit of compromise, the problem being he didn't bring a lot with him or any huge details about the proposals he says there is as alternatives to the backstop. Boris faces this question, what are your preparations for a no-deal Brexit? I know Leo Varadkar faces similar questions within the Republic and no one seems to have answers. I think I've lost Kevin. That's a shame. We'll try and re-establish communication with Kevin from Dublin. Sorry about that. Let's go back to the studio and get some business news. Here's your business headlines on Afternoon Live: The UK economy appears to have avoided recession over the summer, with GDP growing 0.3% in July versus June. That's according to the Office for National Statistics. However, it also revealed that output was flat in the three months to July, confirming that the economy has lost momentum compared with last year. Lloyds Banking Group is counting the cost of a last minute surgee in claims for the mis-selling of Payment Protection Insurance. The Bank says the extra bill could reach #1.8 billion after it saw more than four times the number of cases it had expected ahead of the 29th August deadline. Others, including RBS and CYBG, have also set aside more money for compensation. Graduates from wealthier families are more than twice as likely to start work on a higher salary than their working-class peers. That's according to trade union body the TUC. It's called for legal action to tackle discrimination based on class at work. Tech firms are facing a fresh round of scrutiny in the US. We're expecting to hear details of an investigation into whether they've behaving in an anti-competitive way. Alphabet - the owner of Google, which last year earned over #100 billion - is likely to be in the spotlight. This follows a probe launched last week into Facebook, in which the New York's Attorney General is examining if the social media giant endangered consumer data, reduced people's choice and raised the cost of advertising. Vivienne Nunis is in New York. Quite a lot to look at but let's start with what this probe is likely to look at. Hi. We haven't had it confirmed which company this probe will focus on but it is widely suspected to be looking into Google and particularly into how Google has operated and impacted the digital advertising market. You might not know this but Google actually has a dominant share in that market, it sells more advertising online than any other company and Ashley has about a 40% share and there are those who say Google has been able to rig the system to its advantage and influence pricing because of that dominant share. This comes hot on the heels of an investigation announced into Facebook on Friday so we are starting to see more investigations and a higher level of scrutiny of these big tech firms in the United States. it's fascinating because the heat is being turned up. The Facebook probe, we have seen them coming in and almost a daily basis. How does this reflect the mood over there? Absolutely, we saw not just the potential Google announcement today and Facebook on Friday but also at a federal level we are seeing investigations by top regulators including the Department of Justice in the US, looking into companies like Facebook, Apple and Google. At Facebook they are looking at things like should Facebook have been allowed to become so big in the social media space? It has already bought Instagram and WhatsApp. Has it been allowed to become too big and too powerful? That's on a really concentrated space. Plenty to keep investors' mind is occupied but there is a lot in the calendar, economic as well as corporate news. And also financial news. On Wall Street we are expecting IPOs listings so a a couple of companies going public including one called Smile Direct which does dentistry and another one called cloud fair. Investors will be watching how they</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-f8fab5572aac4f8b9db89b5585459a7c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X10-V911-DY08-3524-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

STUDIO: Thanks for joining us. Leading psychiatrists have said companies like Facebook should be forced to hand over their data to researchers, so they can study whether social media technology is harmful to children. The Royal College of Psychiatrists wants independent experts to assess how youngsters are affected by their experiences online, amid concern from parents and schools. Here's Angus Crawford. She had so much to offer. Molly Russell's death... And that's gone. ..sparked a national outcry. These are companies that count their profits in the billions, and they turn round and say to us that they can't protect our children? Questions about young people and mental health. Do you have the power to compel them to do what you think needs to be done? Yes, absolutely. Focussing public anger on the tech giants and demands for greater regulation. Announced in the Queen's Speech, the Government's plans for a new independent regulator and a statutory duty of care. My ministers will develop legislation to improve internet safety for all. But the Royal College of Psychiatrists wants tougher action. Social-media companies are very wealthy, they have got a huge amount of knowledge, they can create complex algorithms which hook young people into their platforms. Why can't they be using that same amount of energy, knowledge and funding to try and harness the positive benefits, and help try and protect children and young people more? Tech giants should be forced to share data with university researchers. And be taxed on their global turnover. New apps should be designed to be age-appropriate. Molly Russell's father Ian fully backs the plans. And if there was a levy that was forced upon them so that they had to pay, it would be a tiny amount in terms of their profits, but it only needs to provide for good, proper academic research with anonymised data so that the whole world can better understand the sort of problems that are driving young people into desperate places. Radical solutions which may not be popular with an industry making billions from the children using its products. Angus Crawford, BBC News. We have a guest from the Big Brother watch group now, what is your view on the idea of gathering data so we can look at the impact of online abuse? Gathering data and doing research is very welcome and a very good idea, but what we are very cautious about is any call that suggests that data subjects, those using social media platforms, are taken out of the equation. It is important for trust online and people's data rights and their health and well-being that when they are using the internet, they feel they have full control over who has their data, where it goes and what purpose it is used for, and what we are cautious about is the suggestion that it should be between researchers and big tech companies, not involving the users themselves who should have autonomy to decide how their data is used and be empowered to make those decisions. How can young children under the age of 16, 18, who might be of interest to these researchers because they are at the very impressionable age, how can they give consent when for everything else they are regarded as too young to do so? Very good question. It goes to show where there is a disparity between how research ethics normally work and what it sounds like might be being suggested here, because normally</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-5e481f96f7db47d2a8967649b55aa2d5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0R-2DN1-DY08-31VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"728\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

We will be back to you later, Emma Vardy, thank you very much. Social media companies could see their services blocked - and senior managers held personally liable - under new government plans designed to safeguard people using the internet. In proposals published this morning, ministers suggest a new code of conduct for internet firms, enforced by a watchdog. </p><p>The consultation comes amid rising public concern about the availability of harmful material online. But critics say the plans threaten freedom of speech. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda, such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand, have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. The actress and campaigner Domenique Fragale lost her friend, when she killed herself after being bullied online. She thinks this white paper should have come sooner. A lot of messages were being sent to her, and they were encouraging her to kill herself, actually. And because of that, I wish I'd known. I wish she could speak out to me, or she could actually contact the platforms and say, you know, this is happening. Help me. What do I do? This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world, that a little progress here and there is acceptable while countless people, their lives are being destroyed. Enough. Internet companies have taken huge steps to protect people from harmful content online, and they want to do more of that. They are investing in systems to take down content and investing in teams to scan for content and remove harmful images. The next stage is getting to a regulatory regime with the government to help companies do that. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. That can only be a good thing, and that will fundamentally ensure that we can see really a game changer in terms of protections for children. The new rules would apply to any company that allow people to share You are before or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Let's talk mnore on this now with the Associate Head of Online Safety at the NSPCC, Andy Burrows. Andy, good of you to come in. I'm guessing you welcome this? Today is a really significant moment. The NSPCC had been campaigning for the last two years to get to this point today. The reason why regulation, playing a legal duty of care on tech firms are so important is because in the last decade we have seen those companies being able to set their own rules and all too often they have sat on their hands when it comes to children's safety. That is quite an accusation, sitting on their hands when it comes to children's safety? We can see the scale of the risk has been growing in terms of scale and complexity, so thinking for example in terms of online grooming, in the first 18 months since it became an offence to send children a sexual message on social networks, there were more than 5000 offences recorded. 70% of those cases took place on three sites, Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. So you have the bigger sites with the biggest resources to tackle these problems but nevertheless they are the ones who have the biggest issues. And you are convinced they have the technology and the wherewithal to deal with this? When it comes to something like grooming, there are very simple steps that could be put in place today if platforms wanted to do that. For example, is a groomer making a really disproportionately high number of friend requests to children and young people? We know that groomers will try to contact</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-d5ef7d193a234463ac986bf3f52cf992</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV5-B221-JBH6-C1GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"912\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

It feels to me that they are doing it now because they are trying to show users about trust, they want users to trust in the platform. But they also, I believe, this is to avoid legislation from governments. Silicon valley and the big tech companies have done very well up to this point not to be regulated by governments. They have self regulated. They want to show they are taking this seriously. How likely is it they will escape all regulation? I think it will be very hard for them to escape all regulation despite their best efforts. I think we will see more and more of this. The problem with fake news, it used to be something governments themselves would control. Now anybody can post something onto platforms. It would be very easy for me this afternoon to claim I have seen Tony Hall from the BBC riding a horse in Bristol. Somebody on the Internet would believe it. That's the problem we have now. It's very difficult to distinguish from real news and that someone has created. It's very hard to distinguish between two sides of the story now and it's really hard for people to know what is real and what isn't online. How much of it is down to us as the public to be more sensible about what we believe? That's a fair statement.

Fears rise for the UK economy - as retail sales unexpectedly fall. Official figures show sales growth is at its weakest for 18 months. All categories fell, with the exception of food. </p><p>Hong Kong protests dent at Burberry. Hong Kong protests have dented overseas sales at Burberry. The luxury goods group cuts the value of stores in the territory amid months-long disturbances Women should have the right to know what their male colleagues are being paid if they suspect pay discrimination - that's according to the Fawcett Society. The gender equality charity is calling for a change in the law to try to cut down on instances of unequal pay. When people think of Google, they don't think necessarily about banking. They don't. That is about to change. That is rate. Google has announced that it's to offer current accounts from next year through its Google Pay app. It is questionable to why they are doing it. They have a huge user base. We have something like 1.4 billion people around the world who have e-mail accounts. They are trying to make themselves more indispensable to people but they are not the first big tech company to go into this. We have had Facebook, Amazon, Apple, but even the likes of Uber are going into these products. It has spiked fears that Silicon Valley has so much data on people. What are they doing with all the data and is it all safe? It has just come off the news that we have heard in the United States that Google has signed a deal with the US health care provider, giving it access to the medical data of millions of Americans. There are lots of privacy concerns around this. No doubt people will be thinking about banking with Google. Vivienne Nunis is joins us now from New York. Why do you think Google has decided to do this? Google is really following any other major tech firms into this world of banking and personal finance, as you have mentioned. We have seen Facebook talk about crypto currency, Apple pay has been very successful on phones. Amazon has introduced credit cards and paper introduce debit cards and accounts for its drivers. Google is rather late to the party here in the US. There has been a flurry of activity moving into finance in the last year for tech sector. It is quite late to what has been happening in China. Over there, the technology firm has a dominant position in online payments over there. We are seeing US firms copying what has already been happening in China. Google will be building on that huge user base, hoping to make another revenues scheme extreme and have been to keep users and its ecosystem, rather than you having to change what you are looking at on your browser, you will stay looking at Google when you go to make a payment. I people concerned about this? I the regulator is taking a look at this? Regulators do have concerns. What are they going to do with all our data? They already have so much data, what they do with our financial data? Will they try to sell us products, depending on how much we have in our bank accounts. They will keep their financial data very separate. Regulators are concerned about the infrastructures, detect firms know how to carry out banking services? Google has tried to allay those by partnering with a real-world banking group, Citigroup, it will be hoping they will be able to carry out the nuts and of these data protection sides of things. That is why to limit how they are hoping to relate regulation concerns. Users may have concerns of their own when it comes to privacy. Another company that has news out today, Walmart. And there are massive retail business. We were talking about retail sales in the UK following. Walmart own Asda, the supermarket here. What the numbers look like? Interesting you say that. That was echoed by the Walmart to this morning. He said revenue was slightly down, earnings are slightly down in the UK, the supermarket sector, Asda, because a Brexit. The Walmart CEO said shoppers continue to be hesitant because of concerns about the economy and that are showing up in their results. There were some bright spots in the online sector. Online grocery shopping is growing for Asda. That is reflected in Walmart's largest sales as well. The online business is also growing in the US. Walmart thinks there is a long way for it to go in that sector as well. Thank you. Interesting. Thank you. As we were saying earlier, everyone needs to eat,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-a40360205aa9473c87b064e4e433507f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH2-XF91-JBH6-C4HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The interesting thing about this case is that if you are under the age of 13 here in the United States then it is illegal for Google to collect your data. The concern being raised in this lawsuit by the New Mexico Attorney General is that through in loophole this is precisely what Google is doing, basically saying that people's personal accounts have been fused with their educational accounts, because if you are under 13 you are allowed to open an educational account, and that is how Google is able to collect this data, like your contacts, what websites you are browsing, video she might have watched on YouTube. Google gave us a statement saying the allegations made in this lawsuit are factually wrong and that they do not use information from primary and secondary schools to target ads, but this just raises and touches on broader concerns but I think everyone has about our privacy when it comes to these big tech companies. </p><p>Yes, and increased focused on what tech companies are doing with our data, but I wonder, do you think they will be watching this case in Google HQ, because do you think if this goes against the new Mexico that that sets a precedent for elsewhere in the US? Listen, even if this does not set a precedent for elsewhere in the US there is a sense that the tide is turning on these tech companies on issues of privacy. In the State of New YorkGoogle already had to do a big pay-out although they did not admit any wrongdoing, but they did come to an agreement over whether or not they targeted young kids using their YouTube services. As I said, they did not admit any wrongdoing but they did pay a hefty fine. You also have the Department of Justice and other regulators here in the United States now considering anti-trust investigations into Google so I think the legal words of these companies certainly are mounting. I think that is a first initial stage of these company's lives where we have all enjoyed the benefits of these free services and I think now the idea of self-regulation is going to move into a new era where we see more regulation coming from government authorities whether that is here in the United States or in the EU where they have said that too is a priority. Thank you for bringing is up-to-date on that. That's it for me. A young Manchester United fan who wrote to Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp in a bid to stop his team winning the Premier League title has received a personal reply from the Reds' boss. Daragh Curley, from County Donegal, wrote to Jurgen Klopp for a school assignment. The 10-year-old asked if it would be possible for Liverpool to lose some games so they would not win the league. Klopp wrote back, praising Daragh's passion, but explaining Liverpool could not drop points on his behalf. Liverpool are on course to win the Premier League and have not lost a league fixture so far this season. Well, we were just practising how to write letters, we weren't going to actually send it, but then the SNA Paddy McFadden liked it so much that he... He's a Liverpool supporter and he said, oh, we should send it, and I thought he was joking but he actually wasn't so I got this damp and licked one and I said, oh, this isn't a joke, and then he sent it. So what was in the letter that you sent to Juergen Klopp? \"Dear Juergen Klopp, my name is Daragh. I am ten years old. I go to Glenswilly NS. I support Man United and the reason I am writing is to complain. Liverpool are winning too many games! If you win nine more games then you have the best unbeaten run in English football. Being a United fan that is very sad. So the next time Liverpool play, please make them lose. You should just let the other team score. I hope I have convinced you to not win the league or win another match ever again. Take care. Yours sincerely, Daragh.\" There was a little bit in the back of my brain that maybe because it's a complaint and he doesn't get many of those he might, just might, respond but I didn't think he would. But he did. But then he did. When did the letter come? It was Monday night, mammy went up to McFadden's to get some cheese, and the person who owns the shop said oh, there's a letter for you, and before I opened it I was like, oh, it might be Jurgen Klopp because it had Royal Mail on the stamp. Royal, OK. And then mammy was like, no, it's not. And then I opened it and it was Jurgen Klopp! It's there in front of you. He wrote, \"Dear Daragh, firstly I would like to thank you for writing to me. I know you did not send me good luck or anything like that but it is always good to hear from a young football fan no matter what so I appreciate you getting in touch. Unfortunately on this occasion I cannot grant your request, not through choice anyway.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-7676dae4eb53403390eda7c377584fc2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y86-6601-JBH6-C2SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

Social media companies could see their services blocked - and senior managers held personally liable - under new government plans designed to safeguard people using the internet. In proposals published this morning, ministers suggest a new code of conduct for internet firms, enforced by a watchdog. The consultation comes amid rising public concern about the availability of harmful material online. </p><p>But critics say the plans threaten freedom of speech. Here's our media editor, Amol Rajan. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda, such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand, have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. The actress and campaigner Domenique Fragale lost her friend, when she killed herself after being bullied online. She thinks this white paper should have come sooner. A lot of messages were being sent to her, and they were encouraging her to kill herself, actually. And because of that, I wish I'd known. I wish she could speak out to me, or she could actually contact the platforms and say, you know, this is happening. Help me. What do I do? This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world, that a little progress here and there is acceptable while countless people, their lives are being destroyed. Enough. Internet companies have taken huge steps to protect people from harmful content online, and they want to do more of that. They are investing in systems to take down content and investing in teams to scan for content and remove harmful images. The next stage is getting to a regulatory regime with the government to help companies do that. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. That can only be a good thing, and that will fundamentally ensure that we can see really a game changer in terms of protections for children. The new rules would apply to any company that allow people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Now let's have a look at the weather with Tomasz Schafernaker, described as a man for all seasons, and you need to be, because at the moment we have all season is out there. Sort of, let me put it in context first. Obviously, satellite picture, nothing particularly unusual about that. It is this ribbon of cloud that has caused cool cloudy and at times rainy weather from say mid Wales just about through the South Midlands to the London area. Notice it is clear here. This is a slightly different view on it. Now I am going to mix on the temperature, and noticed that there is an area here sort of in lime green, that is where the cool weather is, the little area of orange there, take a look at these temperatures. That is right now, is it? That is right now, it is pretty extraordinary that we have London, the capital, at round about 12 degrees, then you go may say let's call it 50 to 100 miles north of that, and it is around 20 degrees, and then you go on to the north coast of Yorkshire, and its 6 degrees, so we have multiple climactic regions across the UK. What is going on? I was hoping you would say that, a couple of things. So first of all here where you see the lime green colours, that is where the cloud is, where that unpleasant weather has been today, and incidentally here also is where we could see some thunderstorms developing. Here we just have a little bit of warm air in the sunshine in land, but on the north Sea coasts, because the wind is blowing out to the east and this time of the year the water temperature in the North Sea is very low, about as cold as it gets throughout the seasons, you've got hats and gloves weather. Hats and gloves here, sunglasses and sunscreen there, what do we do with the 12? Sort of in between, isn't</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-4f9be2dc651b40d292ded74618cf85e4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV5-GM81-JBH6-C26P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

That is illegal. They were found to have broken the law and this huge vine has been imposed upon them. -- fine. </p><p>Now - did you know that when you talk to smart speaker devices like Alexa or Siri, someone could be listening in to what you say? It's been revealed that Amazon, Google and Apple all employ staff to listen to recordings of customer interactions with their smart speakers. News website Bloomberg highlighted the issue after speaking to Amazon staff who listened to Alexa recordings. The companies say voice recordings are occasionally reviewed to improve speech recognition. Martin Bryant, the founder of tech consultancy 'Big Revolution', me now from Manchester via webcam. Thank you for joining us. How many people do you think will now think twice about choosing one of these devices? I think he few people have been freaked out and maybe but think twice about using one of these devices but at the same time, you are allowing a Internet connected microphone into your House and you have to be aware of the risks. Any kind of device you bring into your House, you have to at least be aware the information you are giving it will be used mostly exactly how you are expecting it to be used but there is always the chance it will be used in different ways, whether legally or illegally, whether the company is using Apple or Amazon, using that data for quality assurance purposes or whether it is hacked. You are going to get your information used likely, some of your information, in ways you do not expect at some point. It is one of the risks of using the Internet really. Amazon are saying their employees do not have direct access to information that could actually identify a person or account. It is more like meta data and personal data at the moment. Why do you think these companies have not been clearer about the fact human skeleton into the recordings? There are a couple of reasons it could be. When reasons is it might worry people. -- one reason might be it might worry people. The other reason, and we see this a lot with tech companies, but doesn't seem like an issue to a Silicon Valley engineer might be a huge issue to a member of the public. We are starting to see a bit more understanding in terms of the way technology is built versus what the majority of people expecting terms of privacy. We are starting to see this come together, whether that is through the fact governments around the world are starting to wake up to the needs for more protection for people online whether that is just that they are getting more concerned for people when they read news stories such as the one from Bloomberg. Things are getting better in that regard but for a lot of the time engineers just have not traditionally thought about people's individual privacy. How effective is customer power, if enough people were to say we really do not like you doing this. You need to stop. Of course, you do not need to buy one of these things in the first place. I think we will see more in the way of privacy controls in the future. People are aware of this kind of thing a lot more now. We have seen a lot more in the news, we are seeing people thinking about it, talking about it more and conversation around it. Tech companies, one thing that big tech companies are wary of is increased regulation and so they are doing everything they can to be appearing to pray for -- play ball and play nice. Thank you. Time for a look at the weather... It is hard to believe pollen season is with us. I know, and if you suffer from hay fever you do not need us to tell you it is a bit of an issue. It is tree pollen that is the issue at the moment, late March to mid May. If you are suffering it is probably from the ash, oak, willow and birch. After that comes the grass pollen. That comes at around mid May to July. So if you are sitting your GCSEs it is not much fun when you suffer from grass pollen. Hot on the heels of that we have got weed pollen. That is end of June to September so quite a long stretch of the year. If you're a hay fever sufferer you are going to be effected at some point, so it is not</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-0d19825b6ea64296aa79fed772c2ed06</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW1-C9X1-DY08-3049-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I can't be fairer than that, can I? He's also changed its website because anyone found using red diesel on the road faces prosecution. Jonathan Gibson, BBC News. </p><p>In a moment, the latest business news. First a look at the headlines on Afternoon Live. Released days after serving half his sentence and under surveillance - as questions are asked about why a terrorist was free to stab victims in London, the government says it will act. Boris Johnson says the UK won't bind itself to EU rules in order to get a trade deal by the end of the year. Built in just eight days - a 1,000 bed hospital opens in Wuhan for coronavirus patients, as one of the passengers who landed in the UK from Wuhan is taken ill and escorted to hospital. Here's your Business headlines on Afternoon Live: Chinese shares saw their biggest fall in four years because of the coronavirus. The fall was amplified by pent up demand - the markets have been shut for over a week because of the annual Lunar New Year holiday. Consumer goods company shares were hit hard. But investors expected one group of companies to do well - healthcare ones - shares for that sector soared. Credit card providers should consider cutting or letting people off fees for what's called persistent debt - people whose repayments don't keep up with interest and other charges so their debt spirals. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has written to credit card providers, telling them to review their approach to borrowers who are stuck in persistent debt. How's the manufacturing sector in the UK doing amid the political uncertainty? Not bad, according to figures from the data gathering service IHS Markit. Its PMI measure was at a nine-month high in January of 50, up from 47.5 in December. A score higher than 50 means the sector is growing, below 50 means it's shrinking. Markets, what is going on? We will talk to Kathleen Brooks in a minute. Ryanair shares rose 4% earlier today on news that it turned a profit in the third quarter of this year. Compared with a loss. Coronavirus does come into it, Kathleen would suggest. Kathleen, can you explain? What we will see is a bit more differentiation in airline stocks. Since the coronavirus has hit, we have been sold aggressively. Ryanair have seen their share price increase is largely because of those results but also because more European focused airliners, Ryanair, easyJet as well, they could benefit from holiday-makers staying in Europe rather than going to other exotic locations. Some of the more global airlines, they could still continue to struggle while coronavirus is ongoing while Ryanair and easyJet could be some of the bigger winners. Let's look at the losers. The Chinese markets were playing catch up for all sorts of news that has been coming out while the markets have been shot in that part of the world for the lunar New Year holiday. Were there any knock-on surprises in this part of the world, something the markets hadn't prepared for? Everyone thinks manufacturing, car production, that is very big in China, very important for some of the European and American companies, but car manufacturers have been under pressure today. Nissan are down more than 1% and that is because they rely on China for their production. Wuhan is in a province, the capital of a province that is a massive manufacturing hub. That has been shut down. What does that mean for sales going forward? Now the Chinese stock markets have opened, we have seen big falls for manufacturers, but has focused minds to what is going on in China. Apple very vulnerable, however it has done better today, up about 1%. That is largely because it is Apple and has done well. Someone like Nissan and other car-makers, they are vulnerable, their earnings have been falling, people have been moving away from some of their gas guzzling cars and the coronavirus is the latest issue to affect them. We could talk about the coronavirus for longer but let's move away now. Apple, big tech company, the other company reporting results, Google, any effects of the coronavirus expected on Google's profit</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-58b2ee927a3e4e259181f956470c7604</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4B-WFY1-DY08-30X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

It was 30 years ago Tuesday that computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee sketched out his plan for an invention he called the World Wide Web.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That invention has been, on the whole, an enormous force for good. But it has also introduced a host of unanticipated new social problems that the attack in Christchurch throws into stark relief.</p><p>The Web, and in particular social media platforms, has provided a fertile environment for hate groups to form and grow, and for far-flung and isolated racists to find a community that affirms and reinforces their beliefs. Although many details remain unclear, it appears that the accused shooter, Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, was part of the international online community of white supremacists. He may have discussed some of the planning for the attack in a chat room, according to reports, and social media also gave him a venue to broadcast his slaughter for 17 minutes, despite the safeguards tech companies say they employ against violent content.</p><p>Social media companies haven't done enough to disrupt these groups. Any group or individual could be targeted. Friday's targets were Muslims. But social-media radicalization and incitement has also been linked to right-wing mass shooters in Norway, South Carolina, Pittsburgh; foot soldiers of genocide in Myanmar; a would-be assassin in Virginia; and ISIS volunteers in Syria.</p><p>It's no longer possible to brush off such events as isolated incidents or to minimize the role of social media companies in enabling them. The Web has poured gasoline on burning social divisions, created whole new categories of hate (there was no movement of \"incels\" to foment misogynistic violence before the Internet helped them find one another), and reduced the in-person interactions that can moderate extremism.</p><p>Tech companies can't be allowed to shrug off the violence and social division abetted by their products as if it all would have happened anyway\u2014 as if they're as blameless as the phone company when crooks make a phone call.</p><p>\"The global network of white nationalist extremism depends on the framework of social media,\" said David Ibsen, executive director of the Counter Extremism Project. \"The inaction of social media platforms in addressing this problem serves to perpetuate it.\"</p><p>On Friday, the social media giants issued their version of \"thoughts and prayers,\" even as it reportedly took Google 12 hours to remove all versions of the attack video from YouTube. Twitter and Facebook also struggled to remove the video, which was repeatedly copied and reposted with tiny alterations that may have helped the copies avoid automatic detection. Platforms have to do better at preventing the spread of violent imagery. They should employ human moderators if their artificial intelligence continues to fail, or shut down services they can't run responsibly.</p><p>But it's doubtful Silicon Valley will ever truly police itself. And while terrorism is clearly the most urgent problem, that's not where the problems caused by social media end. Trolls and hackers and bots and bullies wear away at society and democracy in less overt ways, and they need to be addressed too. Governments, ultimately, have to protect their citizens from Silicon Valley with more muscular regulation.</p><p>Earlier this week, when Berners-Lee (now an MIT professor) reflected on his creation, he acknowledged that for all its successes, the Web \"has also created opportunity for scammers, given a voice to those who spread hatred, and made all kinds of crime easier to commit.\"</p><p>Yet, he wrote, \"it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can't be changed for the better in the next 30 [years].\"</p><p>We can't wait 30 years for a better Web. Silicon Valley needs to start now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-66212afa-473a-11e9-841b-92bdb292ec67</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN7-6JD1-DYHJ-30CV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 16, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Perhaps.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The six-foot-four son of a brigadier general is well on his way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Heaslip, 36, is becoming a textbook example of how to transition from sport into modern business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Eschewing the role of a corporate mascot, wheeled out on game days to entertain cigar-chomping clients, Heaslip has chosen the role of tech investor and promoter, meeting young startups to see whether they're worth a punt.</p><p>Some are. One of his earliest bets has just paid off spectacularly. Pointy, the retail listing startup co-founded by Charles Bibby and Mark Cummins, recently announced its acquisition by Google in a nine-figure deal. Heaslip is understood to have made a six-figure sum from his initial investment.</p><p>Other bets, such as the analytics firm Kitman Labs, look promising for a significantly augmented return in the near future too.</p><p>And if tech hits another bubble, he has a few Dublin pubs to fall back on, such as The Bridge 1859 and Lemon &amp; Duke, as well as a job at Google he could probably return to.</p><p>But Heaslip doesn't think that startup tech is going south any time soon. He has just taken a deeper role in a fintech firm, Flender, that has created a new online platform to match lenders with small businesses who want to borrow sums up to (EURO)300,000.</p><p>Adrian Weckler sat down with Heaslip to ask him about tech, trends, culture and the transition from sport to investing.</p><p>Adrian Weckler (AW): Why did you initially choose tech? Jamie Heaslip (JH): I wanted to work at something that did things at scale and that was based out of Ireland. I looked at aviation leasing, a huge industry which is largely based on the Shelbourne Road in Dublin. But that was just too much travel for me. So I chose tech.</p><p>AW: We often see well-known sporting figures taken on by businesses as brand ambassadors. Sometimes it can almost seem that they become mascots, rather than full executives. Was that ever a danger for you? Do you ever feel like one now? JH: Yeah, it's a line that you have to be careful with. But at Google, for example, that just wouldn't fly. Most people wouldn't have recognised me. And that was half the attraction of going there.</p><p>AW: You've just made a very substantial return from your early investment in Pointy, bought by Google for over (EURO)100m. How and why did you pick that company to invest in? JH: I didn't know much about SEO optimisation or retail, but I understood the opportunity and the potential scale.</p><p>I understood the problems facing a company like Google, who we think never has any problems, versus what Amazon is doing. And that the person losing out is the SME or the corner shop. I also invest as much in teams as in the idea.</p><p>With Mark [Cummins] and Charles [Bibby, Pointy's co-founders], you could see a dynamic in the way they carried themselves and how they do business.</p><p>AW: You now have a fairly sizeable portfolio of investments, from pubs to media to tech. Would you say you've had more hits than misses? JH: I know how lucky I am to be in a time and place when you meet good people.</p><p>You make your own luck a little bit by being curious and going out and meeting these people. But it's a bit like sport. I've often been asked why, for years, I never got injured. It was blind luck.</p><p>AW: While all this was going on, you worked as a regular staff member at Google for about a year. Why there? JH: I had invested in a couple of tech companies that were scaling and doing OK. I thought that I might go into one of them. But that seemed too easy in a way; I'd just be going in as a name.</p><p>So I wanted to pick a company where I wouldn't go in as a name, where I would just have to learn the trade effectively. And that's what happened in Google.</p><p>AW: What exactly did you do at Google? JH: It was called 'large client services'.</p><p>Some of Google's top clients, big-name brands, are spending a lot of money. So it's a more hands-on service. I was a senior account manager, looking over a couple of different clients. I got to work with loads of different businesses and different advertising models. I learned a lot.</p><p>AW: But of all your investment companies, you've picked one to run with in a deeper way - Flender.</p><p>JH: Yes, they came to me as they were scaling very well. I was already an investor. They've gone from one million originations in 2017 to four million in 2018 to just under 13 million last year. It's the fastest-growing digital lending platform in Ireland with fast finance to SMEs. Our average loan size is about (EURO)100,000.</p><p>AW: This isn't regulated in the same way as Bank of Ireland or another lender? JH: No, they're unsecured loans. There's risk, like any investment. But our default rate is less than 1pc.</p><p>The real attraction is speed. You can upload your information and get a decision today and then your money tomorrow. A bank will take anywhere from six to eight weeks, which may even be a slow no. We have split it into retail and institutional lending.</p><p>Retail is where you and I can come on to the platform, put 50 grand in and decide who you want to lend to.</p><p>But that is actually becoming a smaller part of the business. We secured a (EURO)75m credit line in the fourth quarter of last year of institutional money. That's institutional money which wouldn't be on the market and that goes to business.</p><p>AW: So that means you have up to (EURO)75m to lend out? JH: Yes, we want to loan (EURO)100m this year. We're about to hit 20 million worth of business loans since starting. That's a big milestone for us.</p><p>AW: What happens regarding a default situation? JH: We have teams that manage that.</p><p>AW: Does that mean you knock on someone's door at 1am in the morning? JH: Nope. Luckily, it's not something we've had to deal with a lot.</p><p>My job is to step into a leadership role and help that team scale. For me, it's going from such a big global company [Google] and seeing their processes and how they orchestrate things. And it's also looking over to Kitman and Pointy and seeing what we might learn from them.</p><p>AW: With your increasing dive into the tech world, have you ever worried that you might become part of a 'tech bro' culture? JH: I'm not sure what that is.</p><p>AW: In some tech companies, there have been problems of toxicity, and where the culture has resulted in female staff being marginalised. Companies like Uber have had significant challenges with that.</p><p>JH: I haven't seen that in any of the ones that I'm involved in. Flender is very small, but there are more men there than women.</p><p>But in terms of having a diverse group, you definitely need that. Without it, you'll get blind spots and group-think.</p><p>If you don't create a place where people feel safe to work, where they enjoy working, they'll leave.</p><p>AW: What about tech, in general? The industry used to be described in terms of being a plucky disrupter, a business model with a moral compass and a conscience.</p><p>Now it's often painted as an agent of cynical manipulation and moral decline. Do you think the 'tech is evil' narrative holds any water? JH: I'm not sure. I'm still undecided about things like smart home technology.</p><p>You insert this device into your house for convenience but then you give up more data.</p><p>On the one hand, it's your data you're giving away free. But then again, I walk around with a smartphone.</p><p>AW: Let me ask you about your former occupation. What did you make of the schadenfreude in some parts of the press and on social media when Ireland were beaten by Japan and New Zealand in the World Cup a few months back? JH: I don't know why some people were revelling in the failure of the team to get past the quarter final.</p><p>I can't speak for them. Maybe they just, you know, didn't like all the hype that was around the team in the first place.</p><p>AW: There was definitely a strain of opinion out there that rugby is a private posh boys' sport. There were quite a few who seemed to really enjoy the defeat, maybe from a position of resentment or social division.</p><p>JH: There are clearly people who don't feel connected to this team. Maybe there's something we have to do about that, to look at where the majority of our players are coming from in terms of clubs, schools and catchment areas.</p><p>AW: But in terms of the schadenfreude and the revelling, as a former player, how did you feel about that? JH: If we all had the same opinion, it might be very boring.</p><p>You need people who have a different voice, who question and maybe go against what is the common or easy narrative at the time.</p><p>But we shouldn't get really carried away. This is just a sport. There are some other properly serious things going on.</p><p>AW: What about pay TV and rugby? Do you think it would hit the game's popularity? JH: I believe it would. I think you have to keep the national events, like the Six Nations, on free-to-air TV. Rugby is still quite a niche sport.</p><p>To hear a full podcast with Jamie Heaslip, listen to The Big Tech Show on Spotify, Soundcloud or on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.independent.ie/podcasts\">www.independent.ie/podcasts</url> this Friday lunchtime</p><p>'In terms of having a diverse group, you  ;  ;  definitely need that.

The commission said it had also started a separate investigation to see whether Apple was boxing out rivals to its mobile payments system, Apple Pay.</p><p>  In both Brussels and Washington, officials have been scrutinizing the power of the world's largest technology platforms. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are being investigated by antitrust authorities over their growing power, particularly their position as gatekeepers upon which other companies depend on to reach customers.</p><p>  ''Apple obtained a 'gatekeeper' role when it comes to the distribution of apps and content to users of Apple's popular devices,'' said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president in charge of competition policy. ''We need to ensure that Apple's rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers.''</p><p>  The case against Apple arises from a complaint made last year by Spotify, whose music-streaming service competes with Apple Music. Spotify and others have criticized Apple for imposing rules and charging a fee of up to 30 percent on digital services sold through its App Store. Spotify argued that the fee constituted a tax that violated competition laws and merited an investigation. In March, the European Commission said an e-book and audiobook distributor, which it didn't identify, had filed a similar complaint.</p><p>  ''At the heart of our case is the fact that Apple acts as the stadium owner, referee and player, and tilts the playing field in favor of its own services,'' Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify's chief legal officer, told reporters on Tuesday. ''This case is not just about Spotify. The commission's decision to take on this case against Apple is an important first step toward developing new rules of the road that will govern the conduct of online platforms for years to come.''</p><p>  On Tuesday, European authorities said a preliminary investigation showed the complaints had merit.</p><p>  Josh Rosenstock, a spokesman for Apple, said the company disagreed with the European Commission's decision to start the investigations, describing the complaints that it is breaking antitrust laws as ''baseless.'' The company has defended its tight control of the App Store as a means to preserve quality, privacy and security.</p><p>  ''Throughout our history, Apple has created groundbreaking new products and services in some of the most fiercely competitive markets in the world,'' he said. ''We follow the law in everything we do, and we embrace competition at every stage because we believe it pushes us to deliver even better results.''</p><p>American investigations of Big Tech's power, including those by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, have tended to lump Apple in with Google, Facebook and Amazon. But  Apple was thought to be at the least risk of punishment there because its business practices appeared to be less problematic than its closest peers.</p><p>  But now Europe's formal investigations show Apple still faces at least one big regulatory fight.</p><p>  In Europe, the world's largest technology companies have long been viewed with suspicion as they have consolidated power over the digital economy. In 2016, the European Commission ordered Ireland to collect 13 billion euros in unpaid taxes from Apple, worth about $14.7 billion today. The antitrust authorities have also issued billions of dollars in fines against Google for antitrust violations in recent years, while Amazon and Facebook are also facing fresh scrutiny.</p><p>Spotify has been discussing Apple's practices with European regulators for about five years, according to a person involved in the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were private. Tuesday's announcement is a major milestone, yet the commission could still spend a year or more investigating the company's practices before determining whether to bring charges.</p><p>  Since Spotify made its formal complaint in Europe in March 2019, regulators have been considering how to show harm from Apple's actions, according to the person involved. They eventually concluded that Apple's 30 percent share of some revenues collected via the App Store raised competitors' costs, eventually leading to higher prices for consumers, this person said.</p><p>Spotify said it had raised its monthly subscription price to $13 from $10 in 2014 to make up for Apple's cut. A year later, Apple introduced its streaming-music competitor, Apple Music, priced at $10 a month. Spotify then decided to pull out of the App Store payment system, restricting Apple from taking a share and prompting Spotify to drop its price back to $10 a month. It then became more complicated to sign up for Spotify's paid service; customers now have to go to a website instead of simply tapping a button in the app.</p><p>Apple has faced other scrutiny of how it uses its influence over the App Store. For years it has packed the top of many App Store search results with its own apps, even when they were less popular or relevant than competitors' offerings, according to an investigation by The New York Times. In 2018, Apple also began restricting or removing many popular apps that helped people limit the time they and their children spent on their iPhones, just after Apple released competing tools. After the makers of two parental-control apps complained to European regulators and The Times reported on Apple's moves, Apple quietly reversed its policy and let the apps back into the App Store.</p><p>  In addition to App Store policies, European authorities are investigating Apple Pay, which allows people to make purchases within apps or in shops with an iPhone or Apple Watch. The questions surround requirements companies must agree to when integrating Apple Pay into apps or websites. The commission said it would review how the company controlled access to ''tap and go'' technology for rival payment systems on Apple devices.</p><p>  ''It is important that Apple's measures do not deny consumers the benefits of new payment technologies, including better choice, quality, innovation and competitive prices,'' Ms. Vestager said.</p><p>  The Apple investigations are part of a multifront challenge that the biggest tech companies are grappling with around the world.</p><p>  In Germany and Britain, lawmakers are debating changes to antitrust laws that would make it easier for the authorities to bring tech cases. European Union officials are exploring a digital services law with wide-ranging implications, including potential liability rules for harmful content spread on social media, as well as expanded powers for regulators to quickly step in against what they conclude are unfair business practices. Australia, India and Brazil are also cracking down.</p><p>Spotify said that federal and state regulators in the United States had approached the company about Apple and that it had provided information, but that it expects real action to come in Europe.</p><p>  Gene Kimmelman, a former chief counsel of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said Europe continued to lead on enforcement.</p><p>  ''Europe is moving much more quickly and much more aggressively with both antitrust and regulation,'' said Mr. Kimmelman, now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. ''I think the U.S. will respond to that.''</p><p>  Adam Satariano reported from London, and Jack Nicas from Centerville, Mass.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: An Apple store in Paris.

Picture: Getty Images <br/><br/>People, of course, can and are taking legal action to protect their rights, but this is a slow process using old law designed for another age. <br/><br/>International ride-share giant Uber is facing a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-03/uber-to-face-class-action-against-taxi-and-private-drivers/11073640\">class action from Australian taxi drivers</url>, while another class action has been launched against the government over the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/robodebt-class-action-lawsuit-to-go-ahead/11722712\">robodebt</url> scandal. <br/><br/>But when litigation is being brought, the onus is on the consumer or citizen to prove that there is a problem. This leaves an enormous gap for corporations and governments to act with potential impunity, or at least a lag between their poor behaviour and consumer rights being restored. <br/><br/>At a conference held by the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cprc.org.au/\">Consumer Policy Research Centre</url> in November last year,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/about/commissioners/human-rights-commissioner-mr-edward-santow\">Australian Human Rights Commissioner Edward Santow</url> referred to this gap as 'in due course' (ie in due course it was fixed). <br/><br/>But as Santow also pointed out, in the time period of those three little words, a lot can go wrong. <br/><br/>For example in the case of robodebt, some of the most vulnerable people in Australia were unfairly harassed for debt they didn't owe. <br/><br/>The stress and harm caused by these automated decisions, without accountability and transparency, is impossible to accurately calculate. <br/><br/>New regulations to respond to the use of technology are coming out regularly in Australia, the most notable is the new       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0\">Consumer Data Right Legislation</url>, passed by the Australian government on 1 August 2019. <br/><br/>But these new and piecemeal legislative responses aren't enough. <br/><br/>Some of this legislation is in response to an increase in the number of cases of automated decisions, lacking transparency or oversight, that are made about our everyday lives. <br/>Going to court to protect consumer and citizen rights can be a slow process. Picture: Getty Images<br/>But some is based on the government's desire to profit from the rise in capabilities of collecting data, and this can be seen in the rise of the use of biometric data (mostly facial recognition) from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-08/city-of-perth-rolls-out-new-facial-recognition-cctv-cameras/11147780\">councils in Perth</url> to trials in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/techandscience/china-style-facial-recognition-technology-in-australian-schools/ar-AAJJ6Ee?li=AA4Zor\">public schools in Victoria</url>. <br/><br/>The law is always behind the technology - if law were to change in response to every technology, it is argued, it couldn't be relied upon. <br/><br/>But the sweeping nature of the new technologies we are dealing with means legislators need to get more in front of the issue, rather than confront it piecemeal, or with a lag that allows the damage discussed above, or even worse. <br/><br/>Issues of cybersecurity, democracy, rights and consumer protection all go hand in hand. <br/><br/>Legislating on these issue individually, often without the necessary technical wherewithal to fully understand or appreciate the implications and amid heavy lobbying by technology companies, the risk is that potential outcomes are skewed against citizens and consumers. <br/><br/>One response has been a focus on better embedding ethics into machine learning. <br/><br/>There are numerous movements in ethics --       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fatml.org/\">FAT (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency</url>) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ethics.org.au/ethical-by-design/\">Ethics by Design</url> -- and many corporations and even universities are embedding staff to represent an ethical point of view in the design of technology. <br/><br/>Hundreds of papers are circulating the internet, from both government and industry, outlining their ethics strategy, often without implementation mechanisms or clarification of terms. <br/><br/>But a focus on ethics won't be enough. <br/><br/>The recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2019-fsrc-final-report\">royal commission into misconduct in the finance sector</url>, for example, highlights the shortcomings of relying on ethics to protect consumer rights. <br/>The huge influence of technology on our lives means the law have to get in front of what's happening. Picture: Shutterstock<br/>We don't yet have model laws, but there are many working to build them. <br/><br/>These laws need to place the onus squarely back on the companies building the technology to comply with long-standing law and principles, and be able to regularly provide audits to show that this is the case. <br/><br/>When cars were first introduced onto roads, there was no term for jaywalking. <br/><br/>This was a      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history\">term later introduced by the car industry</url> to place the responsibility back on pedestrians when they were hit by cars. However, over time, we developed laws that protected pedestrians, and road rules now make clear that car drivers are responsible. <br/><br/>At the moment, by focusing on the individual responsibilities of the consumer or citizen, technology companies are effectively accusing technology users of jaywalking. <br/><br/>Eventually, this can be expected to shift and place greater responsibility on the technology companies to ensure that their tools don't remove human autonomy, undermine democracies and fundamentally ignore basic human rights and legal obligations. <br/><br/>US Politicians such as Bernie Saunders and Elizabeth Warren are calling for antitrust rules to break up the big tech companies. <br/><br/>In Australia, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-29/google-faces-accc-federal-court-misleading-use-of-data/11649356\">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</url> is suing Google over allegations it misled consumers on the use of their personal location data. <br/><br/>Consumers are being exploited, and the awareness of citizens and consumers is changing. Now is the time for their rights to be protected, and for systems to be built with existing law in mind, and democratic values to be upheld. <br/><br/>This article was first published on\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/\">Pursuit</url>.

Picture: Getty Images<br/>But some is based on the government's desire to profit from the rise in capabilities of collecting data, and this can be seen in the rise of the use of biometric data (mostly facial recognition) from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-08/city-of-perth-rolls-out-new-facial-recognition-cctv-cameras/11147780\">councils in Perth</url> to trials in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/techandscience/china-style-facial-recognition-technology-in-australian-schools/ar-AAJJ6Ee?li=AA4Zor\">public schools in Victoria</url>. <br/><br/>The law is always behind the technology - if law were to change in response to every technology, it is argued, it couldn't be relied upon. <br/><br/>But the sweeping nature of the new technologies we are dealing with means legislators need to get more in front of the issue, rather than confront it piecemeal, or with a lag that allows the damage discussed above, or even worse. <br/><br/>Issues of cybersecurity, democracy, rights and consumer protection all go hand in hand. <br/><br/>Legislating on these issue individually, often without the necessary technical wherewithal to fully understand or appreciate the implications and amid heavy lobbying by technology companies, the risk is that potential outcomes are skewed against citizens and consumers. <br/><br/>One response has been a focus on better embedding ethics into machine learning. <br/><br/>There are numerous movements in ethics --       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fatml.org/\">FAT (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency</url>) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ethics.org.au/ethical-by-design/\">Ethics by Design</url> -- and many corporations and even universities are embedding staff to represent an ethical point of view in the design of technology. <br/><br/>Hundreds of papers are circulating the internet, from both government and industry, outlining their ethics strategy, often without implementation mechanisms or clarification of terms. <br/><br/>But a focus on ethics won't be enough. <br/><br/>The recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2019-fsrc-final-report\">royal commission into misconduct in the finance sector</url>, for example, highlights the shortcomings of relying on ethics to protect consumer rights. <br/>The huge influence of technology on our lives means the law have to get in front of what's happening. Picture: Shutterstock<br/>We don't yet have model laws, but there are many working to build them. <br/><br/>These laws need to place the onus squarely back on the companies building the technology to comply with long-standing law and principles, and be able to regularly provide audits to show that this is the case. <br/><br/>When cars were first introduced onto roads, there was no term for jaywalking. <br/><br/>This was a      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history\">term later introduced by the car industry</url> to place the responsibility back on pedestrians when they were hit by cars. However, over time, we developed laws that protected pedestrians, and road rules now make clear that car drivers are responsible. <br/><br/>At the moment, by focusing on the individual responsibilities of the consumer or citizen, technology companies are effectively accusing technology users of jaywalking. <br/><br/>Eventually, this can be expected to shift and place greater responsibility on the technology companies to ensure that their tools don't remove human autonomy, undermine democracies and fundamentally ignore basic human rights and legal obligations. <br/><br/>US Politicians such as Bernie Saunders and Elizabeth Warren are calling for antitrust rules to break up the big tech companies. <br/><br/>In Australia, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-29/google-faces-accc-federal-court-misleading-use-of-data/11649356\">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</url> is suing Google over allegations it misled consumers on the use of their personal location data. <br/><br/>Consumers are being exploited, and the awareness of citizens and consumers is changing. Now is the time for their rights to be protected, and for systems to be built with existing law in mind, and democratic values to be upheld. <br/><br/>This article was first published on\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/\">Pursuit</url>.

After all, a crime is a crime whether it is committed by paper or computer, isn't it? <br/><br/>Well, yes and no. <br/><br/>Certainly, there is a lot of law that already applies to consumers and citizens. Human rights, consumer rights, corporate rights (even arguably board responsibilities), tort and contract law, just to name a few, all protect us in certain ways. <br/><br/>But the technological advances we are living through present special challenges. <br/><br/>For example, given the length of the terms and conditions on each of the online contracts people have to consent to when they sign up for different apps, it is questionable whether the term 'consent' can even have any meaning in a digital age where people never take the time to read the contracts in the first place. <br/><br/>The 'robodebt' scandal highlights the damage that can be inflicted on people with artificial intelligence is misused. Picture: Getty Images <br/><br/>People, of course, can and are taking legal action to protect their rights, but this is a slow process using old law designed for another age. <br/><br/>International ride-share giant Uber is facing a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-03/uber-to-face-class-action-against-taxi-and-private-drivers/11073640\">class action from Australian taxi drivers</url>, while another class action has been launched against the government over the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/robodebt-class-action-lawsuit-to-go-ahead/11722712\">robodebt</url> scandal. <br/><br/>But when litigation is being brought, the onus is on the consumer or citizen to prove that there is a problem. This leaves an enormous gap for corporations and governments to act with potential impunity, or at least a lag between their poor behaviour and consumer rights being restored. <br/><br/>At a conference held by the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cprc.org.au/\">Consumer Policy Research Centre</url> in November last year,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/about/commissioners/human-rights-commissioner-mr-edward-santow\">Australian Human Rights Commissioner Edward Santow</url> referred to this gap as 'in due course' (ie in due course it was fixed). <br/><br/>But as Santow also pointed out, in the time period of those three little words, a lot can go wrong. <br/><br/>For example in the case of robodebt, some of the most vulnerable people in Australia were unfairly harassed for debt they didn't owe. <br/><br/>The stress and harm caused by these automated decisions, without accountability and transparency, is impossible to accurately calculate. <br/><br/>New regulations to respond to the use of technology are coming out regularly in Australia, the most notable is the new       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0\">Consumer Data Right Legislation</url>, passed by the Australian government on 1 August 2019. <br/><br/>But these new and piecemeal legislative responses aren't enough. <br/><br/>Some of this legislation is in response to an increase in the number of cases of automated decisions, lacking transparency or oversight, that are made about our everyday lives. <br/>Going to court to protect consumer and citizen rights can be a slow process. Picture: Getty Images<br/>But some is based on the government's desire to profit from the rise in capabilities of collecting data, and this can be seen in the rise of the use of biometric data (mostly facial recognition) from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-08/city-of-perth-rolls-out-new-facial-recognition-cctv-cameras/11147780\">councils in Perth</url> to trials in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/techandscience/china-style-facial-recognition-technology-in-australian-schools/ar-AAJJ6Ee?li=AA4Zor\">public schools in Victoria</url>. <br/><br/>The law is always behind the technology - if law were to change in response to every technology, it is argued, it couldn't be relied upon. <br/><br/>But the sweeping nature of the new technologies we are dealing with means legislators need to get more in front of the issue, rather than confront it piecemeal, or with a lag that allows the damage discussed above, or even worse. <br/><br/>Issues of cybersecurity, democracy, rights and consumer protection all go hand in hand. <br/><br/>Legislating on these issue individually, often without the necessary technical wherewithal to fully understand or appreciate the implications and amid heavy lobbying by technology companies, the risk is that potential outcomes are skewed against citizens and consumers. <br/><br/>One response has been a focus on better embedding ethics into machine learning. <br/><br/>There are numerous movements in ethics --       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fatml.org/\">FAT (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency</url>) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ethics.org.au/ethical-by-design/\">Ethics by Design</url> -- and many corporations and even universities are embedding staff to represent an ethical point of view in the design of technology. <br/><br/>Hundreds of papers are circulating the internet, from both government and industry, outlining their ethics strategy, often without implementation mechanisms or clarification of terms. <br/><br/>But a focus on ethics won't be enough. <br/><br/>The recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2019-fsrc-final-report\">royal commission into misconduct in the finance sector</url>, for example, highlights the shortcomings of relying on ethics to protect consumer rights. <br/>The huge influence of technology on our lives means the law have to get in front of what's happening. Picture: Shutterstock<br/>We don't yet have model laws, but there are many working to build them. <br/><br/>These laws need to place the onus squarely back on the companies building the technology to comply with long-standing law and principles, and be able to regularly provide audits to show that this is the case. <br/><br/>When cars were first introduced onto roads, there was no term for jaywalking. <br/><br/>This was a      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history\">term later introduced by the car industry</url> to place the responsibility back on pedestrians when they were hit by cars. However, over time, we developed laws that protected pedestrians, and road rules now make clear that car drivers are responsible. <br/><br/>At the moment, by focusing on the individual responsibilities of the consumer or citizen, technology companies are effectively accusing technology users of jaywalking. <br/><br/>Eventually, this can be expected to shift and place greater responsibility on the technology companies to ensure that their tools don't remove human autonomy, undermine democracies and fundamentally ignore basic human rights and legal obligations. <br/><br/>US Politicians such as Bernie Saunders and Elizabeth Warren are calling for antitrust rules to break up the big tech companies. <br/><br/>In Australia, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-29/google-faces-accc-federal-court-misleading-use-of-data/11649356\">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</url> is suing Google over allegations it misled consumers on the use of their personal location data. <br/><br/>Consumers are being exploited, and the awareness of citizens and consumers is changing. Now is the time for their rights to be protected, and for systems to be built with existing law in mind, and democratic values to be upheld. <br/><br/>This article was first published on\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/\">Pursuit</url>.

After all, a crime is a crime whether it is committed by paper or computer, isn't it? <br/><br/>Well, yes and no. <br/><br/>Certainly, there is a lot of law that already applies to consumers and citizens. Human rights, consumer rights, corporate rights (even arguably board responsibilities), tort and contract law, just to name a few, all protect us in certain ways. <br/><br/>But the technological advances we are living through present special challenges. <br/><br/>For example, given the length of the terms and conditions on each of the online contracts people have to consent to when they sign up for different apps, it is questionable whether the term 'consent' can even have any meaning in a digital age where people never take the time to read the contracts in the first place. <br/><br/>The 'robodebt' scandal highlights the damage that can be inflicted on people with artificial intelligence is misused. Picture: Getty Images <br/><br/>People, of course, can and are taking legal action to protect their rights, but this is a slow process using old law designed for another age. <br/><br/>International ride-share giant Uber is facing a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-03/uber-to-face-class-action-against-taxi-and-private-drivers/11073640\">class action from Australian taxi drivers</url>, while another class action has been launched against the government over the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/robodebt-class-action-lawsuit-to-go-ahead/11722712\">robodebt</url> scandal. <br/><br/>But when litigation is being brought, the onus is on the consumer or citizen to prove that there is a problem. This leaves an enormous gap for corporations and governments to act with potential impunity, or at least a lag between their poor behaviour and consumer rights being restored. <br/><br/>At a conference held by the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cprc.org.au/\">Consumer Policy Research Centre</url> in November last year,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/about/commissioners/human-rights-commissioner-mr-edward-santow\">Australian Human Rights Commissioner Edward Santow</url> referred to this gap as 'in due course' (ie in due course it was fixed). <br/><br/>But as Santow also pointed out, in the time period of those three little words, a lot can go wrong. <br/><br/>For example in the case of robodebt, some of the most vulnerable people in Australia were unfairly harassed for debt they didn't owe. <br/><br/>The stress and harm caused by these automated decisions, without accountability and transparency, is impossible to accurately calculate. <br/><br/>New regulations to respond to the use of technology are coming out regularly in Australia, the most notable is the new       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0\">Consumer Data Right Legislation</url>, passed by the Australian government on 1 August 2019. <br/><br/>But these new and piecemeal legislative responses aren't enough. <br/><br/>Some of this legislation is in response to an increase in the number of cases of automated decisions, lacking transparency or oversight, that are made about our everyday lives. <br/>Going to court to protect consumer and citizen rights can be a slow process. Picture: Getty Images<br/>But some is based on the government's desire to profit from the rise in capabilities of collecting data, and this can be seen in the rise of the use of biometric data (mostly facial recognition) from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-08/city-of-perth-rolls-out-new-facial-recognition-cctv-cameras/11147780\">councils in Perth</url> to trials in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/techandscience/china-style-facial-recognition-technology-in-australian-schools/ar-AAJJ6Ee?li=AA4Zor\">public schools in Victoria</url>. <br/><br/>The law is always behind the technology - if law were to change in response to every technology, it is argued, it couldn't be relied upon. <br/><br/>But the sweeping nature of the new technologies we are dealing with means legislators need to get more in front of the issue, rather than confront it piecemeal, or with a lag that allows the damage discussed above, or even worse. <br/><br/>Issues of cybersecurity, democracy, rights and consumer protection all go hand in hand. <br/><br/>Legislating on these issue individually, often without the necessary technical wherewithal to fully understand or appreciate the implications and amid heavy lobbying by technology companies, the risk is that potential outcomes are skewed against citizens and consumers. <br/><br/>One response has been a focus on better embedding ethics into machine learning. <br/><br/>There are numerous movements in ethics --       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fatml.org/\">FAT (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency</url>) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ethics.org.au/ethical-by-design/\">Ethics by Design</url> -- and many corporations and even universities are embedding staff to represent an ethical point of view in the design of technology. <br/><br/>Hundreds of papers are circulating the internet, from both government and industry, outlining their ethics strategy, often without implementation mechanisms or clarification of terms. <br/><br/>But a focus on ethics won't be enough. <br/><br/>The recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2019-fsrc-final-report\">royal commission into misconduct in the finance sector</url>, for example, highlights the shortcomings of relying on ethics to protect consumer rights. <br/>The huge influence of technology on our lives means the law have to get in front of what's happening. Picture: Shutterstock<br/>We don't yet have model laws, but there are many working to build them. <br/><br/>These laws need to place the onus squarely back on the companies building the technology to comply with long-standing law and principles, and be able to regularly provide audits to show that this is the case. <br/><br/>When cars were first introduced onto roads, there was no term for jaywalking. <br/><br/>This was a      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history\">term later introduced by the car industry</url> to place the responsibility back on pedestrians when they were hit by cars. However, over time, we developed laws that protected pedestrians, and road rules now make clear that car drivers are responsible. <br/><br/>At the moment, by focusing on the individual responsibilities of the consumer or citizen, technology companies are effectively accusing technology users of jaywalking. <br/><br/>Eventually, this can be expected to shift and place greater responsibility on the technology companies to ensure that their tools don't remove human autonomy, undermine democracies and fundamentally ignore basic human rights and legal obligations. <br/><br/>US Politicians such as Bernie Saunders and Elizabeth Warren are calling for antitrust rules to break up the big tech companies. <br/><br/>In Australia, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-29/google-faces-accc-federal-court-misleading-use-of-data/11649356\">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</url> is suing Google over allegations it misled consumers on the use of their personal location data. <br/><br/>Consumers are being exploited, and the awareness of citizens and consumers is changing. Now is the time for their rights to be protected, and for systems to be built with existing law in mind, and democratic values to be upheld. <br/><br/>This article was first published on\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/\">Pursuit</url>.

After all, a crime is a crime whether it is committed by paper or computer, isn't it? <br/><br/>Well, yes and no. <br/><br/>Certainly, there is a lot of law that already applies to consumers and citizens. Human rights, consumer rights, corporate rights (even arguably board responsibilities), tort and contract law, just to name a few, all protect us in certain ways. <br/><br/>But the technological advances we are living through present special challenges. <br/><br/>For example, given the length of the terms and conditions on each of the online contracts people have to consent to when they sign up for different apps, it is questionable whether the term 'consent' can even have any meaning in a digital age where people never take the time to read the contracts in the first place. <br/><br/>The 'robodebt' scandal highlights the damage that can be inflicted on people with artificial intelligence is misused. Picture: Getty Images <br/><br/>People, of course, can and are taking legal action to protect their rights, but this is a slow process using old law designed for another age. <br/><br/>International ride-share giant Uber is facing a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-03/uber-to-face-class-action-against-taxi-and-private-drivers/11073640\">class action from Australian taxi drivers</url>, while another class action has been launched against the government over the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/robodebt-class-action-lawsuit-to-go-ahead/11722712\">robodebt</url> scandal. <br/><br/>But when litigation is being brought, the onus is on the consumer or citizen to prove that there is a problem.

Picture: Getty Images<br/>But some is based on the government's desire to profit from the rise in capabilities of collecting data, and this can be seen in the rise of the use of biometric data (mostly facial recognition) from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-08/city-of-perth-rolls-out-new-facial-recognition-cctv-cameras/11147780\">councils in Perth</url> to trials in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/techandscience/china-style-facial-recognition-technology-in-australian-schools/ar-AAJJ6Ee?li=AA4Zor\">public schools in Victoria</url>. <br/><br/>The law is always behind the technology - if law were to change in response to every technology, it is argued, it couldn't be relied upon. <br/><br/>But the sweeping nature of the new technologies we are dealing with means legislators need to get more in front of the issue, rather than confront it piecemeal, or with a lag that allows the damage discussed above, or even worse. <br/><br/>Issues of cybersecurity, democracy, rights and consumer protection all go hand in hand. <br/><br/>Legislating on these issue individually, often without the necessary technical wherewithal to fully understand or appreciate the implications and amid heavy lobbying by technology companies, the risk is that potential outcomes are skewed against citizens and consumers. <br/><br/>One response has been a focus on better embedding ethics into machine learning. <br/><br/>There are numerous movements in ethics --       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fatml.org/\">FAT (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency</url>) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ethics.org.au/ethical-by-design/\">Ethics by Design</url> -- and many corporations and even universities are embedding staff to represent an ethical point of view in the design of technology. <br/><br/>Hundreds of papers are circulating the internet, from both government and industry, outlining their ethics strategy, often without implementation mechanisms or clarification of terms. <br/><br/>But a focus on ethics won't be enough. <br/><br/>The recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2019-fsrc-final-report\">royal commission into misconduct in the finance sector</url>, for example, highlights the shortcomings of relying on ethics to protect consumer rights. <br/>The huge influence of technology on our lives means the law have to get in front of what's happening. Picture: Shutterstock<br/>We don't yet have model laws, but there are many working to build them. <br/><br/>These laws need to place the onus squarely back on the companies building the technology to comply with long-standing law and principles, and be able to regularly provide audits to show that this is the case. <br/><br/>When cars were first introduced onto roads, there was no term for jaywalking. <br/><br/>This was a      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history\">term later introduced by the car industry</url> to place the responsibility back on pedestrians when they were hit by cars. However, over time, we developed laws that protected pedestrians, and road rules now make clear that car drivers are responsible. <br/><br/>At the moment, by focusing on the individual responsibilities of the consumer or citizen, technology companies are effectively accusing technology users of jaywalking. <br/><br/>Eventually, this can be expected to shift and place greater responsibility on the technology companies to ensure that their tools don't remove human autonomy, undermine democracies and fundamentally ignore basic human rights and legal obligations. <br/><br/>US Politicians such as Bernie Saunders and Elizabeth Warren are calling for antitrust rules to break up the big tech companies. <br/><br/>In Australia, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-29/google-faces-accc-federal-court-misleading-use-of-data/11649356\">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</url> is suing Google over allegations it misled consumers on the use of their personal location data. <br/><br/>Consumers are being exploited, and the awareness of citizens and consumers is changing. Now is the time for their rights to be protected, and for systems to be built with existing law in mind, and democratic values to be upheld. <br/><br/>This article was first published on\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/\">Pursuit</url>.

After all, a crime is a crime whether it is committed by paper or computer, isn't it? <br/><br/>Well, yes and no. <br/><br/>Certainly, there is a lot of law that already applies to consumers and citizens. Human rights, consumer rights, corporate rights (even arguably board responsibilities), tort and contract law, just to name a few, all protect us in certain ways. <br/><br/>But the technological advances we are living through present special challenges. <br/><br/>For example, given the length of the terms and conditions on each of the online contracts people have to consent to when they sign up for different apps, it is questionable whether the term 'consent' can even have any meaning in a digital age where people never take the time to read the contracts in the first place. <br/><br/>The 'robodebt' scandal highlights the damage that can be inflicted on people with artificial intelligence is misused. Picture: Getty Images <br/><br/>People, of course, can and are taking legal action to protect their rights, but this is a slow process using old law designed for another age. <br/><br/>International ride-share giant Uber is facing a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-03/uber-to-face-class-action-against-taxi-and-private-drivers/11073640\">class action from Australian taxi drivers</url>, while another class action has been launched against the government over the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/robodebt-class-action-lawsuit-to-go-ahead/11722712\">robodebt</url> scandal. <br/><br/>But when litigation is being brought, the onus is on the consumer or citizen to prove that there is a problem. This leaves an enormous gap for corporations and governments to act with potential impunity, or at least a lag between their poor behaviour and consumer rights being restored. <br/><br/>At a conference held by the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cprc.org.au/\">Consumer Policy Research Centre</url> in November last year,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/about/commissioners/human-rights-commissioner-mr-edward-santow\">Australian Human Rights Commissioner Edward Santow</url> referred to this gap as 'in due course' (ie in due course it was fixed). <br/><br/>But as Santow also pointed out, in the time period of those three little words, a lot can go wrong. <br/><br/>For example in the case of robodebt, some of the most vulnerable people in Australia were unfairly harassed for debt they didn't owe. <br/><br/>The stress and harm caused by these automated decisions, without accountability and transparency, is impossible to accurately calculate. <br/><br/>New regulations to respond to the use of technology are coming out regularly in Australia, the most notable is the new       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0\">Consumer Data Right Legislation</url>, passed by the Australian government on 1 August 2019. <br/><br/>But these new and piecemeal legislative responses aren't enough. <br/><br/>Some of this legislation is in response to an increase in the number of cases of automated decisions, lacking transparency or oversight, that are made about our everyday lives. <br/>Going to court to protect consumer and citizen rights can be a slow process. Picture: Getty Images<br/>But some is based on the government's desire to profit from the rise in capabilities of collecting data, and this can be seen in the rise of the use of biometric data (mostly facial recognition) from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-08/city-of-perth-rolls-out-new-facial-recognition-cctv-cameras/11147780\">councils in Perth</url> to trials in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/techandscience/china-style-facial-recognition-technology-in-australian-schools/ar-AAJJ6Ee?li=AA4Zor\">public schools in Victoria</url>. <br/><br/>The law is always behind the technology - if law were to change in response to every technology, it is argued, it couldn't be relied upon. <br/><br/>But the sweeping nature of the new technologies we are dealing with means legislators need to get more in front of the issue, rather than confront it piecemeal, or with a lag that allows the damage discussed above, or even worse. <br/><br/>Issues of cybersecurity, democracy, rights and consumer protection all go hand in hand. <br/><br/>Legislating on these issue individually, often without the necessary technical wherewithal to fully understand or appreciate the implications and amid heavy lobbying by technology companies, the risk is that potential outcomes are skewed against citizens and consumers. <br/><br/>One response has been a focus on better embedding ethics into machine learning. <br/><br/>There are numerous movements in ethics --       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fatml.org/\">FAT (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency</url>) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ethics.org.au/ethical-by-design/\">Ethics by Design</url> -- and many corporations and even universities are embedding staff to represent an ethical point of view in the design of technology. <br/><br/>Hundreds of papers are circulating the internet, from both government and industry, outlining their ethics strategy, often without implementation mechanisms or clarification of terms. <br/><br/>But a focus on ethics won't be enough. <br/><br/>The recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2019-fsrc-final-report\">royal commission into misconduct in the finance sector</url>, for example, highlights the shortcomings of relying on ethics to protect consumer rights. <br/>The huge influence of technology on our lives means the law have to get in front of what's happening. Picture: Shutterstock<br/>We don't yet have model laws, but there are many working to build them. <br/><br/>These laws need to place the onus squarely back on the companies building the technology to comply with long-standing law and principles, and be able to regularly provide audits to show that this is the case. <br/><br/>When cars were first introduced onto roads, there was no term for jaywalking. <br/><br/>This was a      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history\">term later introduced by the car industry</url> to place the responsibility back on pedestrians when they were hit by cars. However, over time, we developed laws that protected pedestrians, and road rules now make clear that car drivers are responsible. <br/><br/>At the moment, by focusing on the individual responsibilities of the consumer or citizen, technology companies are effectively accusing technology users of jaywalking. <br/><br/>Eventually, this can be expected to shift and place greater responsibility on the technology companies to ensure that their tools don't remove human autonomy, undermine democracies and fundamentally ignore basic human rights and legal obligations. <br/><br/>US Politicians such as Bernie Saunders and Elizabeth Warren are calling for antitrust rules to break up the big tech companies. <br/><br/>In Australia, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-29/google-faces-accc-federal-court-misleading-use-of-data/11649356\">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</url> is suing Google over allegations it misled consumers on the use of their personal location data. <br/><br/>Consumers are being exploited, and the awareness of citizens and consumers is changing. Now is the time for their rights to be protected, and for systems to be built with existing law in mind, and democratic values to be upheld. <br/><br/>This article was first published on\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/\">Pursuit</url>.

After all, a crime is a crime whether it is committed by paper or computer, isn't it? <br/><br/>Well, yes and no. <br/><br/>Certainly, there is a lot of law that already applies to consumers and citizens. Human rights, consumer rights, corporate rights (even arguably board responsibilities), tort and contract law, just to name a few, all protect us in certain ways. <br/><br/>But the technological advances we are living through present special challenges. <br/><br/>For example, given the length of the terms and conditions on each of the online contracts people have to consent to when they sign up for different apps, it is questionable whether the term 'consent' can even have any meaning in a digital age where people never take the time to read the contracts in the first place. <br/><br/>The 'robodebt' scandal highlights the damage that can be inflicted on people with artificial intelligence is misused. Picture: Getty Images <br/><br/>People, of course, can and are taking legal action to protect their rights, but this is a slow process using old law designed for another age. <br/><br/>International ride-share giant Uber is facing a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-03/uber-to-face-class-action-against-taxi-and-private-drivers/11073640\">class action from Australian taxi drivers</url>, while another class action has been launched against the government over the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/robodebt-class-action-lawsuit-to-go-ahead/11722712\">robodebt</url> scandal. <br/><br/>But when litigation is being brought, the onus is on the consumer or citizen to prove that there is a problem.

Picture: Getty Images<br/>But some is based on the government's desire to profit from the rise in capabilities of collecting data, and this can be seen in the rise of the use of biometric data (mostly facial recognition) from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-08/city-of-perth-rolls-out-new-facial-recognition-cctv-cameras/11147780\">councils in Perth</url> to trials in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/techandscience/china-style-facial-recognition-technology-in-australian-schools/ar-AAJJ6Ee?li=AA4Zor\">public schools in Victoria</url>. <br/><br/>The law is always behind the technology - if law were to change in response to every technology, it is argued, it couldn't be relied upon. <br/><br/>But the sweeping nature of the new technologies we are dealing with means legislators need to get more in front of the issue, rather than confront it piecemeal, or with a lag that allows the damage discussed above, or even worse. <br/><br/>Issues of cybersecurity, democracy, rights and consumer protection all go hand in hand. <br/><br/>Legislating on these issue individually, often without the necessary technical wherewithal to fully understand or appreciate the implications and amid heavy lobbying by technology companies, the risk is that potential outcomes are skewed against citizens and consumers. <br/><br/>One response has been a focus on better embedding ethics into machine learning. <br/><br/>There are numerous movements in ethics --       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fatml.org/\">FAT (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency</url>) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ethics.org.au/ethical-by-design/\">Ethics by Design</url> -- and many corporations and even universities are embedding staff to represent an ethical point of view in the design of technology. <br/><br/>Hundreds of papers are circulating the internet, from both government and industry, outlining their ethics strategy, often without implementation mechanisms or clarification of terms. <br/><br/>But a focus on ethics won't be enough. <br/><br/>The recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2019-fsrc-final-report\">royal commission into misconduct in the finance sector</url>, for example, highlights the shortcomings of relying on ethics to protect consumer rights. <br/>The huge influence of technology on our lives means the law have to get in front of what's happening. Picture: Shutterstock<br/>We don't yet have model laws, but there are many working to build them. <br/><br/>These laws need to place the onus squarely back on the companies building the technology to comply with long-standing law and principles, and be able to regularly provide audits to show that this is the case. <br/><br/>When cars were first introduced onto roads, there was no term for jaywalking. <br/><br/>This was a      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history\">term later introduced by the car industry</url> to place the responsibility back on pedestrians when they were hit by cars. However, over time, we developed laws that protected pedestrians, and road rules now make clear that car drivers are responsible. <br/><br/>At the moment, by focusing on the individual responsibilities of the consumer or citizen, technology companies are effectively accusing technology users of jaywalking. <br/><br/>Eventually, this can be expected to shift and place greater responsibility on the technology companies to ensure that their tools don't remove human autonomy, undermine democracies and fundamentally ignore basic human rights and legal obligations. <br/><br/>US Politicians such as Bernie Saunders and Elizabeth Warren are calling for antitrust rules to break up the big tech companies. <br/><br/>In Australia, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-29/google-faces-accc-federal-court-misleading-use-of-data/11649356\">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</url> is suing Google over allegations it misled consumers on the use of their personal location data. <br/><br/>Consumers are being exploited, and the awareness of citizens and consumers is changing. Now is the time for their rights to be protected, and for systems to be built with existing law in mind, and democratic values to be upheld. <br/><br/>This article was first published on\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/\">Pursuit</url>.

After all, a crime is a crime whether it is committed by paper or computer, isn't it? <br/><br/>Well, yes and no. <br/><br/>Certainly, there is a lot of law that already applies to consumers and citizens. Human rights, consumer rights, corporate rights (even arguably board responsibilities), tort and contract law, just to name a few, all protect us in certain ways. <br/><br/>But the technological advances we are living through present special challenges. <br/><br/>For example, given the length of the terms and conditions on each of the online contracts people have to consent to when they sign up for different apps, it is questionable whether the term 'consent' can even have any meaning in a digital age where people never take the time to read the contracts in the first place. <br/><br/>The 'robodebt' scandal highlights the damage that can be inflicted on people with artificial intelligence is misused. Picture: Getty Images <br/><br/>People, of course, can and are taking legal action to protect their rights, but this is a slow process using old law designed for another age. <br/><br/>International ride-share giant Uber is facing a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-03/uber-to-face-class-action-against-taxi-and-private-drivers/11073640\">class action from Australian taxi drivers</url>, while another class action has been launched against the government over the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/robodebt-class-action-lawsuit-to-go-ahead/11722712\">robodebt</url> scandal. <br/><br/>But when litigation is being brought, the onus is on the consumer or citizen to prove that there is a problem. This leaves an enormous gap for corporations and governments to act with potential impunity, or at least a lag between their poor behaviour and consumer rights being restored. <br/><br/>At a conference held by the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cprc.org.au/\">Consumer Policy Research Centre</url> in November last year,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.humanrights.gov.au/about/commissioners/human-rights-commissioner-mr-edward-santow\">Australian Human Rights Commissioner Edward Santow</url> referred to this gap as 'in due course' (ie in due course it was fixed). <br/><br/>But as Santow also pointed out, in the time period of those three little words, a lot can go wrong. <br/><br/>For example in the case of robodebt, some of the most vulnerable people in Australia were unfairly harassed for debt they didn't owe. <br/><br/>The stress and harm caused by these automated decisions, without accountability and transparency, is impossible to accurately calculate. <br/><br/>New regulations to respond to the use of technology are coming out regularly in Australia, the most notable is the new       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/consumer-data-right-cdr-0\">Consumer Data Right Legislation</url>, passed by the Australian government on 1 August 2019. <br/><br/>But these new and piecemeal legislative responses aren't enough. <br/><br/>Some of this legislation is in response to an increase in the number of cases of automated decisions, lacking transparency or oversight, that are made about our everyday lives. <br/>Going to court to protect consumer and citizen rights can be a slow process. Picture: Getty Images<br/>But some is based on the government's desire to profit from the rise in capabilities of collecting data, and this can be seen in the rise of the use of biometric data (mostly facial recognition) from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-06-08/city-of-perth-rolls-out-new-facial-recognition-cctv-cameras/11147780\">councils in Perth</url> to trials in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/techandscience/china-style-facial-recognition-technology-in-australian-schools/ar-AAJJ6Ee?li=AA4Zor\">public schools in Victoria</url>. <br/><br/>The law is always behind the technology - if law were to change in response to every technology, it is argued, it couldn't be relied upon. <br/><br/>But the sweeping nature of the new technologies we are dealing with means legislators need to get more in front of the issue, rather than confront it piecemeal, or with a lag that allows the damage discussed above, or even worse. <br/><br/>Issues of cybersecurity, democracy, rights and consumer protection all go hand in hand. <br/><br/>Legislating on these issue individually, often without the necessary technical wherewithal to fully understand or appreciate the implications and amid heavy lobbying by technology companies, the risk is that potential outcomes are skewed against citizens and consumers. <br/><br/>One response has been a focus on better embedding ethics into machine learning. <br/><br/>There are numerous movements in ethics --       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fatml.org/\">FAT (Fairness, Accountability and Transparency</url>) and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ethics.org.au/ethical-by-design/\">Ethics by Design</url> -- and many corporations and even universities are embedding staff to represent an ethical point of view in the design of technology. <br/><br/>Hundreds of papers are circulating the internet, from both government and industry, outlining their ethics strategy, often without implementation mechanisms or clarification of terms. <br/><br/>But a focus on ethics won't be enough. <br/><br/>The recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2019-fsrc-final-report\">royal commission into misconduct in the finance sector</url>, for example, highlights the shortcomings of relying on ethics to protect consumer rights. <br/>The huge influence of technology on our lives means the law have to get in front of what's happening. Picture: Shutterstock<br/>We don't yet have model laws, but there are many working to build them. <br/><br/>These laws need to place the onus squarely back on the companies building the technology to comply with long-standing law and principles, and be able to regularly provide audits to show that this is the case. <br/><br/>When cars were first introduced onto roads, there was no term for jaywalking. <br/><br/>This was a      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history\">term later introduced by the car industry</url> to place the responsibility back on pedestrians when they were hit by cars. However, over time, we developed laws that protected pedestrians, and road rules now make clear that car drivers are responsible. <br/><br/>At the moment, by focusing on the individual responsibilities of the consumer or citizen, technology companies are effectively accusing technology users of jaywalking. <br/><br/>Eventually, this can be expected to shift and place greater responsibility on the technology companies to ensure that their tools don't remove human autonomy, undermine democracies and fundamentally ignore basic human rights and legal obligations. <br/><br/>US Politicians such as Bernie Saunders and Elizabeth Warren are calling for antitrust rules to break up the big tech companies. <br/><br/>In Australia, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-10-29/google-faces-accc-federal-court-misleading-use-of-data/11649356\">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</url> is suing Google over allegations it misled consumers on the use of their personal location data. <br/><br/>Consumers are being exploited, and the awareness of citizens and consumers is changing. Now is the time for their rights to be protected, and for systems to be built with existing law in mind, and democratic values to be upheld. <br/><br/>This article was first published on\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/\">Pursuit</url>.

The benchmark index had recorded two-consecutive days of declines this week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 112.09 points to 11,103.01 on weakness from the blue chip retail, food and beverage issues as well as heavyweight International Business Machines Corp.</p><p>Brokerage J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.Ltd. (JPM-NYSE) was one of the few Dow gainers, advancing almost 1.5 per cent to $151.06 (U.S.) after ING Barings upped its rating to \"buy\" from \"hold.\"</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market's composite index pushed forward 21.64 points to 4,103.81. Internet retailer Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN-Nasdaq) posted a 8-per-cent gain to $42.94 after brokerage Goldman Sachsreleased some upbeat comments on the Seattle-based company.</p><p>The broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.25 points to 1,502.59.</p><p>The Canadian small caps pushed the CDNX up 26.65 points to 3,447.25. At the beginning of the session, the exchange experienced server problems that prevented it from sending data out to the public. Trading operations were not affected. The problem was fixed within the first hour of trading.</p><p>In economic news, the U.S. Conference Board reported that its index of leading economic indicators fell last month, showing the country's economy may in fact be headed for a soft landing. The index declined by 0.1 per cent in July to 105.8. Economists had expected the index to come in unchanged.</p><p>Before the opening bell, Credit Suisse Group AGsaid it was buying the brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc. (DLJ-NYSE) for $11.5-billion (U.S.). The high-profile Wall Street money manager rose 5 per cent to $88.38 following the announcement.</p><p>Also, Toronto-based AGF Management Ltd.is paying $438-million (Canadian) to buy rival mutual fund company Global Strategy Holdings Inc.AGF fell 15 cents to $24.25. Over all, the TSE's financial services sector gained 1.5 per cent as four of the Big-Six banks advanced.</p><p>In other acquisition news, Canadian media company Corus Entertainment Inc.(CJR.B-TSE) is gobbling up Metromedia's Montreal radio stations for $165-million. The deal, which includes debt, will see Corus take the highly profitable CKOI-FM and CFQR-FM. Corus's stock closed unchanged at $44.50.</p><p>But that wasn't the only media-related news coming out of Canada. Sector heavyweight Seagram Co. Ltd. (VO-TSE), which is about to be acquired by Vivendi SA of France, surged another $5.20 to $91.20 after the companies' marriage received the go-ahead from Canadian regulators. Over all, the communications and media sector posted the strongest gain of the TSE's 14 subindexes, moving up more than 2.5 per cent.</p><p>The tech-heavy industrial products grouping also climbed after a two-day tumble. Market mover Nortel Networks Corp. (NT-TSE), which comprises more than 30 per cent of the weighting on the TSE-300, gained 65 cents to $118.95 and took credit for a significant chunk of the advance.</p><p>The latest deal involving Toronto-based wireless Internet software company 724 Solutions Inc. continued to fare well with investors. 724 saw its share price add $3.05 to $69 in the wake of its contract with Bank of America.</p><p>Certicom Corp., Com Dev International Ltd., Norsat International Inc., Sierra Wireless Inc., Cognicase Inc., Corel Corp. and Descartes Systems Group Inc. were among the group of gainers.

[1]In 2017, 13,024 U.S. companies merged, a record number. In the first six months of 2018, $2.5 trillion in merger deals were announced worldwide, a record value. New business formation is half of what it was in the 1970s. In October 2018, researchers Gustavo Grullon, Yelena Larkin, and Roni Michaely identified increased market concentration in 75 percent of all industries over the past two decades.But this period could soon look like a golden age of competition if the coronavirus crisis continues its heartbreaking trajectory.We effectively stopped enforcing antitrust laws in the early 1980s, and markets predictably consolidated as a result, with drastic consequences for worker wages, innovation, entrepreneurship, inequality, and democracy itself. </p><p>But those 40 years have not seen an accelerant like the Corona Depression could provide, handing over even more power to a select few.Banks and financiers, already riding a wave of deregulation to record profits before the pandemic, will be primary beneficiaries. The entire retail sector is at risk, putting even more economic activity at the whim of a few executives. Already-dominant platforms could find themselves in position to dominate like never before. And the post-corona economy could further transform who grows our food, who heals our ailments, and who tells us what's happening in the world.More from David Dayen[2]This doesn't have to be the end of the story, however. Laws on the books intended to protect citizens from monopolies still exist, needing only sufficient political will to snap into action. Our economy is poised to suffer the greatest shock of our lifetimes. But policymakers still set policy, and we all have the opportunity to affect who acts in our name. The extraordinary nature of this crisis, and the community it is building in the struggle in real time, could provide the necessary spark for a movement that demands democracy work for all of us. But it will take massive organizing and leadership to climb out of the deep hole the crisis will create.MONTHS OF lockdowns will produce economic carnage, and Congress's current response could prove even more damaging, because of its disproportionate nature. The CARES Act and follow-up legislation bifurcated relief between smaller and larger businesses. Collectively, both bills send about $700 billion to the small-business sector. But larger businesses have access to Federal Reserve credit facilities with about six and a half times as much in funding.Plenty of outrage has been expended on midsized restaurant chains and franchises and publicly traded companies grabbing forgivable small-business loans. But the Paycheck Protection Program's forgivable loans are capped at $10 million, a minuscule fraction of what firms are liable to receive from the Fed. The first come, first served nature of the PPP pitted desperate businesses against one another, distracting from the bailout's real beneficiaries.Furthermore, if the PPP had enough funding to meet demand, nobody would care about 'undeserving' recipients at the margins. In its current form, the effort to save small businesses will simply not save very many. Only 5.7 percent of small businesses got aid in the first round of PPP loans; even fewer dollars are available for round two. Moreover, these loans are intended only to keep small businesses' payrolls afloat for two months; few expect the economy to turn around completely in that time.

Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT To the extent there was any real winner in the PPP, it was the banks, which earned $10 billion in PPP round one, and are in line for another $10 billion in round two, merely for substituting as processors for an overmatched Small Business Administration (see Alexander Sammon's story in this issue). For small businesses, this temporary, underweight relief will not stop a rash of closures, destroying the fabric of local communities and ushering in the depressing uniformity of surviving chain stores. Though we mostly think of that in terms of local restaurants and the corner dry cleaner, countless niche manufacturers and exporters, startups, and service providers will be crushed, across every economic sector. Industries that managed to retain competition will see the low end vanish.The Fed's $4.5 trillion money cannon, by contrast, is robust enough to accommodate whoever needs to be nursed back to health. Where you stand in America and in its pandemic response depends on where you already stood. Individuals desperate for survival aid must endure rickety systems and fend off private debt collectors; small businesses must fight one another for scarce funds; state and local governments are advised to give bankruptcy a spin. But the largest corporations in America enjoy concierge service, let inside the velvet rope and handed fistfuls of cash.The Fed has set up a 'Main Street' lending program, where your idea of Main Street must include companies with up to 10,000 employees. There are primary and secondary credit facilities ready to purchase virtually any manner of corporate debt, including exchange-traded funds exposed to the riskiest junk bonds. The Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) will slurp up securitized consumer and business loans, backed by auto payments, student debt, credit card arrears, corporate bonds, you name it. There's a municipal-debt program that's curiously more muted than the corporate facilities. It's a short-term loan that localities will have to pay back, in contrast with the Fed taking underwater securities off bank and hedge fund books. And less than half of the money cannon has been loaded; the Fed's balance sheet is expected to swell past $9 trillion, if you count the surge in liquidity for a host of credit markets.Before one dollar was spent, the money cannon nailed its target: owners of capital. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 6,000 points between March 23, the day before the Senate reached a deal on the CARES Act that blessed the money cannon, and April 29. The mere announcement of corporate debt and junk bond purchases similarly served to re-inflate asset prices, protecting the investor class. Bloomberg reported in early April on Citigroup enjoying a $100 million windfall from a single trade of commercial real estate loans. Revenue-less Carnival Cruise Line was ready to tap hedge fund loan sharks for survival cash until the Fed opened the spigot on junk bond markets; Carnival raised $6 billion in cheaper loans within days.Anything that helps traders also helps banks, already the recipients of deregulatory actions throughout Donald Trump's term in office. The Fed has obliged further, scaling back bank examinations and removing capital requirements. This sets the stage for increased risk and asset bubble formation, a secondary shock that could come amidst the coronavirus recovery. Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT The airline and aviation bailouts have a few concrete conditions; the Treasury Department is seeking minor equity stakes, for example. Every other company in line for low-interest loans has effectively no restrictions on the cash. Congress established a few guardrails, from holds on buybacks and dividends to payroll maintenance to executive compensation caps. But Steve Mnuchin, a mediocrity who has dabbled in foreclosure profiteering and Hollywood producing\u2014an unmatched combination of corporate sleaze\u2014can as Treasury Secretary waive any condition at his personal whim.Moreover, the Fed didn't extend conditions to its bond purchases, meaning the downstream corporate beneficiaries of the relief have no strings attached. It took a herculean effort just to get the Fed to commit in late April to release the names of the recipients of its largesse. Whether it will ensure the cannon supports people outside of Wall Street or the executive suites is another matter. At the moment, there is really nothing stopping a company from using bailout funds to pad stock prices while canning workers, outsourcing production, busting unions, and seizing the opportunity of a crushed small-business sector to buy up rivals and market share on the cheap.This disconnection\u2014where capital owners and large corporations get superior service, and everyone else gets screwed\u2014cannot help but fuel corporate power. With small retailers mostly shuttered, big-box stores like Costco, Walmart, and Target have surged, along with e-commerce leviathan Amazon. While 26 million people lost jobs in the first month of the crisis, the retail monopolists hired 500,000. Google and Apple are taking on governing functions, building a global contact tracing system for the cellphones they control.About 36,000 journalists have lost their jobs during the crisis as of late April, as the news media continues to shrink. The dichotomy of empty grocery shelves and massive dumping and bulldozing in the fields is the consequence of a concentrated food supply chain that cannot easily switch from commercial to consumer markets. The disaster will likely knock out even more small players and entrench industrial agriculture further. Hospital collapses and disproportionate shares of aid going to large for-profit chains like HCA are likely to narrow provider networks.Policymakers can disallow a nation of monopolies, prevent Wall Street control, safeguard citizens and promote their welfare. Even unlikely winners from the pandemic may not stay that way. To Zoom is now a verb, after the company's easy-to-use multi-user video chat service became ubiquitous. But Facebook created a knockoff within weeks, and Google's version is expanding as well. Both platforms can leverage billions of existing users to crush the nascent competition.The victory for our leading oligarchs is near-total. According to the Institute for Policy Studies, from March 18 to April 10, a time when tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs, U.S. billionaires saw their wealth increase by 9.3 percent. Since January 1, eight billionaires have added at least another $1 billion to their bankrolls.With mass starvation at the low end of the business chain, and a bounty of available support at the top, the power structure in America is fated to transform. But the path to a corporate state is not foreordained.IT MAY NOT be immediately obvious, but not every outcome of the coronavirus crisis automatically favors monopolization and financialization. In many respects, it has revealed the need for more modest, more redundant, more resilient economic structures.Big banks failed to pump out PPP loans at the level of their community bank counterparts, a high-profile display of ineptitude while the nation watched. Loans, especially commercial loans, are what most people think of when they think of a bank. The Federal Reserve, for better or worse, is designed to push capital to banks in a crisis for them to lend out to the real economy. If the Fed is now lending directly to companies, because large money center banks are poorly managed for rapid lending and even disinclined to lend, and if non-banks and online banks and even community banks are better at this core function, a smart regulator might ask: What purpose do big banks really serve? And if so, why are we loosening regulations so they can take further risks and threaten the economy through their unproductive casino-gambling side hustles?One of the biggest concerns after the crisis lifts is that the private equity industry, loaded with trillions in undeployed funds, could achieve dominance. After all, firms would have their pick of struggling businesses, with discounted deals and cheap credit helping them along. But recent purchases are now vastly overvalued, and the highly leveraged business model magnifies such losses. The industry is holding a bunch of bankrupt companies, shrinking assets that they cannot unload. Top firms may not make it to the other side where the bargains await.Industrial agriculture cannot turn the battleship around fast enough to get food into people's hands, another high-profile signal of incompetence. Maybe we're all better off with smaller processors where any single failure doesn't threaten food supply chains. Local farms have adapted much more quickly, with an emphasis on community support agriculture (CSA) and online ordering and delivery. The entire disaster of concentrated supply chains begs for a more self-reliant solution based on diverse domestic manufacturing.Even Big Tech, seen as likely to amass more power post-crisis, won't emerge unscathed. Google and Facebook are really advertising companies, and the ad market has cratered enough to make them unsteady. Google's revenue rose in the first quarter of 2020, but mainly due to frontloaded ad sales in January; there was a 'significant and sudden slowdown' in March, which should continue. Apple's hardware sales are almost sure to drop given the global downturn, and its huge manufacturing bet on China has proved hazardous.Amazon is supposed to be tech's big winner, given that it sells physical goods in socially distanced fashion. Indeed, it has seen outsized demand, both in e-commerce sales and cloud computing (many of those Zoom calls run off Amazon Web Services). But like many in the crisis, Amazon is finding itself too big to manage. Prime orders are taking as long as a month, and the company discontinued nonessential sales for weeks, destroying third-party businesses. This fallback in convenience and selection contrasts with every single retailer in America being forced by circumstance to get smart about delivery, putting millions of companies in direct competition with Amazon. Many will fade away, but not all, and it's always going to be quicker to get a box of tissues or pet food delivered from down the street than from an Amazon warehouse. With local delivery surging, Amazon, incredibly, may lose the loyalty of its customers.Most of these hazards can be papered over with more bailout funds and hollowed-out competition, and that could happen. But that's where policymakers, the wild card in our post-corona world, can check in. They can choose laissez-faire bailouts, by-standing as America becomes unrecognizable. Or they can choose to act, to disallow a nation of monopolies, prevent Wall Street control, safeguard citizens and promote their welfare.This would mean stopping any company receiving bailout funds from using them to merge with a rival. When the carnage shakes out, the Federal Trade Commission and the antitrust division of the Justice Department should undertake a critical review of key markets, with the presumption that any market share over a certain threshold must necessitate a breakup.Robust grants and loans to small business throughout the recovery, so we don't get the monopolization in the first place, would be critical. New rules on banks now exposed as useless to the real economy are critical, to fill in the gaps where Dodd-Frank fell short and arrest the trend toward bigness and risk that comes with over-financialization. And we should outright eliminate private equity and hedge funds, so they cannot roll up the economy ever again.I recognize that the track record for economic policy interventions is virtually nonexistent in recent memory. But this crisis is bigger and the stakes higher than ever before. And early signs are relatively promising. House Antitrust Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline (D-RI) proposed a ban on mergers throughout the pandemic's duration, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) joined him. Cicilline and members of his antitrust subcommittee are questioning Amazon for committing perjury, after a Wall Street Journal article found that the company scraped data from its third-party sellers to devise competing products under its house brand, at odds with its sworn testimony.The gradual construction of an anti-monopoly movement, inside and outside Congress, fits this moment. There are enough headlines of bad behavior to spur public outcry. Many investigations are proceeding at the state and federal level. Regulators and politicians, stuck at home and cut off from lobbyists, do not have to act like inert puppets, only ambulatory when corporate America pulls their strings. They can use existing tools to block mergers, to end market manipulation, to really prevent a takeover of modern society.In the New Deal era, public anger forced experimentation and action from government rather than neglect and decay. We have that forcing event again.
