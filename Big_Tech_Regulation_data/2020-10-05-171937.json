It is, in many different ways and especially technology sector. You mentioned Microsoft, Amazon, Google scaling back, Apple came out with their announcement earlier this week and they gave guidance this year because they simply don't know how their business is going to be impacted in terms of sales of iPhones. </p><p>But their production and supply chain will be hit hard by this. It's quite interesting. You read the article in the New York Times talks about the company is taking action. I read Facebook is stopping the movement of staff to a degree. But a company like Facebook isn't affected in the same way as say Apple, for example. There are not and it's an interesting indicator of how a social media business operates in this era of global tech. They don't have to worry about it as much, they are not sending their employees there but they don't necessarily have the deep infrastructure in China away say, Apple dollars and can help it. Talking about dependence on China. We are talking about Huawei. We have been all week. About whether the UK should allow it into its five G network and the infrastructure. Talking about in the Telegraph, Sleepy business park on the edge of Banbury, special unit set up to look into the activity of Huawei. Tell us. It's cold the cell and it's really interesting, doesn't get enough coverage in terms of the debate and discussion around Huawei. I think this is a unique way for the UK and UK Government to say, any software or hardware that gets sent in from Huawei needs to go through this independent evaluation Centre, I think they employ 40 people and they give the green light or the red light on any thing that gets deployed and I think in this age of where the US are simply blocking companies like Huawei, the UK and its government is right to say we have another solution. We need to make sure they adhere to our standards under principles and data privacy rules. But, you know, if they pass all of those inspections, they should be able to come in. Are you concerned about where this is going in terms of the relationship between the US and the UK? It will have an impact because clearly the US is upping the pressure on the UK in terms of wanting to just block anything related to China. I think, you know, as long as the UK can stand its ground and demonstrate why these decisions are being taken, it will create tensions, especially if we are talking about a future trade deal between the US in the UK, I'm sure it will have some degree of impact. But I think ultimately, the UK has to do what is right for the UK. Time for a look at our B&amp;B, landmark case. That's decided it's an online platform rather than an actual property agent but what does that mean or change? I think for them it puts them into a different regulatory space. They are not treated like a property company facing all of those rules and platform, it may be closer to Google or Facebook which I think is good news, especially in advance of their potential IPO this year so I think for them, it's a win but what they are now saying is we want a global regulator to look at how to address the business across Europe. And to me, that's also an indication, when we've talked a lot about digital tax, France, UK, potentially going on its own, the company is saying it would be much better if there were one European wide regulator that we could deal with. It would help them with their business. And I think there a good template out there for GDPR. Is that quite unusual for them to say that, do you think? It's not what you hear from the other tech giants. Sally, I think it's starting to change and more big tech companies are saying, we are OK to be regulated. There is advantages to them if they are regulated in certain areas, especially if you have disruptors coming out there who potentially have to adhere to the same regulators. They have the size and scale to deal with regulation, hire the lawyers to manage through it and it ensures that others won't necessarily get into their space. I think we will see more of it. Interesting. We appreciate your time. Thank you. Still to come ... What's the best way to sell your home?

The Government is no longer in charge of this process. </p><p>Vicki Young in Westminster, thank you. There have been reports in the beer of both sides using air strikes. More than 20 people are reported to have died in clashes -- there have been reports of both sides using air strikes. Dozens of militias operate their macro. They are linked either to the UN backed government under the Prime Minister. It has struggled to assert control. Or they are linked to the rebel army led by General Khalifa Haftar. Since Thursday, it's advanced on the capital, Tripoli, igniting fears of an all-out war. Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, has more. This is a battle fought largely by pick-up truck. Makeshift armoured vehicles jamming the routes in and out of Tripoli. These belong to militias loyal to the Government of National Accord that's backed by the United Nations. They are rushing to defend the capital. A government spokesman insisted they had slowed the advance of rebel forces. TRANSLATION: On this day, the Libyan Armed Forces declare the launch of the operation Volcano Of Anger to purge all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces. These are the aggressive forces he is talking about, from the so-called Libyan National Army - the loose alliance of armed groups that control much of the east and south of Libya - here preparing for battle at their Benghazi headquarters. Today, as these forces continue to head west, there were clashes south of Tripoli, particularly around the disused international airport. And there were also reports of air strikes by both sides. The UN mission in Libya called for a short truce to evacuate civilians but was ignored. The government said 21 people have been killed and 27 wounded. So, why does the crisis in Libya matter? Well, ever since Western forces helped depose Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has been gripped by violence and political instability. The UN has attempted to broker a political deal between General Haftar and Prime Minister Sarraj, but so far, it's failed and the fear among Western governments is that full-blown civil war could mean Libya once again becomes a source of migration and extremism on Europe's southern flank. Haftar clearly believes there is a military solution to this conflict. He believes that if he captures Tripoli, he doesn't have to negotiate politically, but this is a big gamble and it's certainly unclear whether it's going to be successful. At the moment, it's in the balance, but it looks like it's unlikely for his forces to succeed. Some countries are now acting to protect their nationals. These unverified pictures appear to show the United States evacuating some of its forces by hovercraft. EU foreign ministers will discuss the crisis in Brussels tomorrow, but few expect the fighting to end soon. James Landale, BBC News. The Government is due to reveal long-awaited proposals for tackling harmful online content. It follows sustained pressure on big tech companies, who have been under attack on several fronts, from the streaming of terror attacks, such as Christchurch, to child grooming. Earlier this year, there was an outcry after it was revealed that 14-year-old Molly Russell had seen images of self-harm on Instagram before she took her own life. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, is here. What can we expect to see tomorrow? You say the proposals along long-awaited, the negotiations around and have made Brexit look simple. It has been a long time in the making. Brexit has taken a punt with in what will and there was a consensus from Australia to America we need regulation of the internet -- Brexit has taken up bandwidth. It is no wonder there should be a big debate in Whitehall.

More than 20 people are reported to have died in clashes -- there have been reports of both sides using air strikes. Dozens of militias operate their macro. They are linked either to the UN backed government under the Prime Minister. It has struggled to assert control. Or they are linked to the rebel army led by General Khalifa Haftar. Since Thursday, it's advanced on the capital, Tripoli, igniting fears of an all-out war. Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, has more. This is a battle fought largely by pick-up truck. Makeshift armoured vehicles jamming the routes in and out of Tripoli. These belong to militias loyal to the Government of National Accord that's backed by the United Nations. They are rushing to defend the capital. A government spokesman insisted they had slowed the advance of rebel forces. TRANSLATION: On this day, the Libyan Armed Forces declare the launch of the operation Volcano Of Anger to purge all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces. These are the aggressive forces he is talking about, from the so-called Libyan National Army - the loose alliance of armed groups that control much of the east and south of Libya - here preparing for battle at their Benghazi headquarters. Today, as these forces continue to head west, there were clashes south of Tripoli, particularly around the disused international airport. And there were also reports of air strikes by both sides. The UN mission in Libya called for a short truce to evacuate civilians but was ignored. The government said 21 people have been killed and 27 wounded. So, why does the crisis in Libya matter? Well, ever since Western forces helped depose Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has been gripped by violence and political instability. The UN has attempted to broker a political deal between General Haftar and Prime Minister Sarraj, but so far, it's failed and the fear among Western governments is that full-blown civil war could mean Libya once again becomes a source of migration and extremism on Europe's southern flank. Haftar clearly believes there is a military solution to this conflict. He believes that if he captures Tripoli, he doesn't have to negotiate politically, but this is a big gamble and it's certainly unclear whether it's going to be successful. At the moment, it's in the balance, but it looks like it's unlikely for his forces to succeed. Some countries are now acting to protect their nationals. These unverified pictures appear to show the United States evacuating some of its forces by hovercraft. EU foreign ministers will discuss the crisis in Brussels tomorrow, but few expect the fighting to end soon. James Landale, BBC News. The Government is due to reveal long-awaited proposals for tackling harmful online content. It follows sustained pressure on big tech companies, who have been under attack on several fronts, from the streaming of terror attacks, such as Christchurch, to child grooming. Earlier this year, there was an outcry after it was revealed that 14-year-old Molly Russell had seen images of self-harm on Instagram before she took her own life. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, is here. What can we expect to see tomorrow? You say the proposals along long-awaited, the negotiations around and have made Brexit look simple. It has been a long time in the making. Brexit has taken a punt with in what will and there was a consensus from Australia to America we need regulation of the internet -- Brexit has taken up bandwidth. It is no wonder there should be a big debate in Whitehall. Lots of leaks, lots of talk in recent months about a new regulator, whether it is an entirely new body is not clear, how it is funded is not clear, probably the tech companies, lots of talk about statutory duty of care, heavy fines and potential criminal prosecutions for directors of companies if they leave out harmful material for too long.

It follows sustained pressure on big tech companies, who have been under attack on several fronts, from the streaming of terror attacks, such as Christchurch, to child grooming. Earlier this year, there was an outcry after it was revealed that 14-year-old Molly Russell had seen images of self-harm on Instagram before she took her own life. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, is here. What can we expect to see tomorrow? You say the proposals along long-awaited, the negotiations around and have made Brexit look simple. It has been a long time in the making. Brexit has taken a punt with in what will and there was a consensus from Australia to America we need regulation of the internet -- Brexit has taken up bandwidth.

More than 20 people are reported to have died in clashes -- there have been reports of both sides using air strikes. Dozens of militias operate their macro. They are linked either to the UN backed government under the Prime Minister. It has struggled to assert control. Or they are linked to the rebel army led by General Khalifa Haftar. Since Thursday, it's advanced on the capital, Tripoli, igniting fears of an all-out war. Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, has more. This is a battle fought largely by pick-up truck. Makeshift armoured vehicles jamming the routes in and out of Tripoli. These belong to militias loyal to the Government of National Accord that's backed by the United Nations. They are rushing to defend the capital. A government spokesman insisted they had slowed the advance of rebel forces. TRANSLATION: On this day, the Libyan Armed Forces declare the launch of the operation Volcano Of Anger to purge all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces. These are the aggressive forces he is talking about, from the so-called Libyan National Army - the loose alliance of armed groups that control much of the east and south of Libya - here preparing for battle at their Benghazi headquarters. Today, as these forces continue to head west, there were clashes south of Tripoli, particularly around the disused international airport. And there were also reports of air strikes by both sides. The UN mission in Libya called for a short truce to evacuate civilians but was ignored. The government said 21 people have been killed and 27 wounded. So, why does the crisis in Libya matter? Well, ever since Western forces helped depose Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has been gripped by violence and political instability. The UN has attempted to broker a political deal between General Haftar and Prime Minister Sarraj, but so far, it's failed and the fear among Western governments is that full-blown civil war could mean Libya once again becomes a source of migration and extremism on Europe's southern flank. Haftar clearly believes there is a military solution to this conflict. He believes that if he captures Tripoli, he doesn't have to negotiate politically, but this is a big gamble and it's certainly unclear whether it's going to be successful. At the moment, it's in the balance, but it looks like it's unlikely for his forces to succeed. Some countries are now acting to protect their nationals. These unverified pictures appear to show the United States evacuating some of its forces by hovercraft. EU foreign ministers will discuss the crisis in Brussels tomorrow, but few expect the fighting to end soon. James Landale, BBC News.

The UN has attempted to broker a political deal between General Haftar and Prime Minister Sarraj, but so far, it's failed and the fear among Western governments is that full-blown civil war could mean Libya once again becomes a source of migration and extremism on Europe's southern flank. Haftar clearly believes there is a military solution to this conflict. He believes that if he captures Tripoli, he doesn't have to negotiate politically, but this is a big gamble and it's certainly unclear whether it's going to be successful. At the moment, it's in the balance, but it looks like it's unlikely for his forces to succeed. Some countries are now acting to protect their nationals. These unverified pictures appear to show the United States evacuating some of its forces by hovercraft. EU foreign ministers will discuss the crisis in Brussels tomorrow, but few expect the fighting to end soon. James Landale, BBC News. The Government is due to reveal long-awaited proposals for tackling harmful online content. It follows sustained pressure on big tech companies, who have been under attack on several fronts, from the streaming of terror attacks, such as Christchurch, to child grooming.

More than 20 people are reported to have died in clashes -- there have been reports of both sides using air strikes. Dozens of militias operate their macro. They are linked either to the UN backed government under the Prime Minister. It has struggled to assert control. Or they are linked to the rebel army led by General Khalifa Haftar. Since Thursday, it's advanced on the capital, Tripoli, igniting fears of an all-out war. Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, has more. This is a battle fought largely by pick-up truck. Makeshift armoured vehicles jamming the routes in and out of Tripoli. These belong to militias loyal to the Government of National Accord that's backed by the United Nations. They are rushing to defend the capital. A government spokesman insisted they had slowed the advance of rebel forces. TRANSLATION: On this day, the Libyan Armed Forces declare the launch of the operation Volcano Of Anger to purge all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces. These are the aggressive forces he is talking about, from the so-called Libyan National Army - the loose alliance of armed groups that control much of the east and south of Libya - here preparing for battle at their Benghazi headquarters. Today, as these forces continue to head west, there were clashes south of Tripoli, particularly around the disused international airport. And there were also reports of air strikes by both sides. The UN mission in Libya called for a short truce to evacuate civilians but was ignored. The government said 21 people have been killed and 27 wounded. So, why does the crisis in Libya matter? Well, ever since Western forces helped depose Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has been gripped by violence and political instability. The UN has attempted to broker a political deal between General Haftar and Prime Minister Sarraj, but so far, it's failed and the fear among Western governments is that full-blown civil war could mean Libya once again becomes a source of migration and extremism on Europe's southern flank. Haftar clearly believes there is a military solution to this conflict. He believes that if he captures Tripoli, he doesn't have to negotiate politically, but this is a big gamble and it's certainly unclear whether it's going to be successful. At the moment, it's in the balance, but it looks like it's unlikely for his forces to succeed. Some countries are now acting to protect their nationals.

Since Thursday, it's advanced on the capital, Tripoli, igniting fears of an all-out war. Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, has more. This is a battle fought largely by pick-up truck. Makeshift armoured vehicles jamming the routes in and out of Tripoli. These belong to militias loyal to the Government of National Accord that's backed by the United Nations. They are rushing to defend the capital. A government spokesman insisted they had slowed the advance of rebel forces. TRANSLATION: On this day, the Libyan Armed Forces declare the launch of the operation Volcano Of Anger to purge all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces. These are the aggressive forces he is talking about, from the so-called Libyan National Army - the loose alliance of armed groups that control much of the east and south of Libya - here preparing for battle at their Benghazi headquarters. Today, as these forces continue to head west, there were clashes south of Tripoli, particularly around the disused international airport. And there were also reports of air strikes by both sides. The UN mission in Libya called for a short truce to evacuate civilians but was ignored. The government said 21 people have been killed and 27 wounded. So, why does the crisis in Libya matter? Well, ever since Western forces helped depose Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has been gripped by violence and political instability. The UN has attempted to broker a political deal between General Haftar and Prime Minister Sarraj, but so far, it's failed and the fear among Western governments is that full-blown civil war could mean Libya once again becomes a source of migration and extremism on Europe's southern flank. Haftar clearly believes there is a military solution to this conflict. He believes that if he captures Tripoli, he doesn't have to negotiate politically, but this is a big gamble and it's certainly unclear whether it's going to be successful. At the moment, it's in the balance, but it looks like it's unlikely for his forces to succeed. Some countries are now acting to protect their nationals. These unverified pictures appear to show the United States evacuating some of its forces by hovercraft. EU foreign ministers will discuss the crisis in Brussels tomorrow, but few expect the fighting to end soon. James Landale, BBC News. The Government is due to reveal long-awaited proposals for tackling harmful online content. It follows sustained pressure on big tech companies, who have been under attack on several fronts, from the streaming of terror attacks, such as Christchurch, to child grooming.

More than 20 people are reported to have died in clashes -- there have been reports of both sides using air strikes. Dozens of militias operate their macro. They are linked either to the UN backed government under the Prime Minister. It has struggled to assert control. Or they are linked to the rebel army led by General Khalifa Haftar. Since Thursday, it's advanced on the capital, Tripoli, igniting fears of an all-out war. Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, has more. This is a battle fought largely by pick-up truck. Makeshift armoured vehicles jamming the routes in and out of Tripoli. These belong to militias loyal to the Government of National Accord that's backed by the United Nations. They are rushing to defend the capital. A government spokesman insisted they had slowed the advance of rebel forces. TRANSLATION: On this day, the Libyan Armed Forces declare the launch of the operation Volcano Of Anger to purge all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces. These are the aggressive forces he is talking about, from the so-called Libyan National Army - the loose alliance of armed groups that control much of the east and south of Libya - here preparing for battle at their Benghazi headquarters. Today, as these forces continue to head west, there were clashes south of Tripoli, particularly around the disused international airport. And there were also reports of air strikes by both sides. The UN mission in Libya called for a short truce to evacuate civilians but was ignored. The government said 21 people have been killed and 27 wounded. So, why does the crisis in Libya matter? Well, ever since Western forces helped depose Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has been gripped by violence and political instability. The UN has attempted to broker a political deal between General Haftar and Prime Minister Sarraj, but so far, it's failed and the fear among Western governments is that full-blown civil war could mean Libya once again becomes a source of migration and extremism on Europe's southern flank. Haftar clearly believes there is a military solution to this conflict. He believes that if he captures Tripoli, he doesn't have to negotiate politically, but this is a big gamble and it's certainly unclear whether it's going to be successful. At the moment, it's in the balance, but it looks like it's unlikely for his forces to succeed. Some countries are now acting to protect their nationals. These unverified pictures appear to show the United States evacuating some of its forces by hovercraft. EU foreign ministers will discuss the crisis in Brussels tomorrow, but few expect the fighting to end soon. James Landale, BBC News. The Government is due to reveal long-awaited proposals for tackling harmful online content. It follows sustained pressure on big tech companies, who have been under attack on several fronts, from the streaming of terror attacks, such as Christchurch, to child grooming. Earlier this year, there was an outcry after it was revealed that 14-year-old Molly Russell had seen images of self-harm on Instagram before she took her own life. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, is here. What can we expect to see tomorrow? You say the proposals along long-awaited, the negotiations around and have made Brexit look simple. It has been a long time in the making. Brexit has taken a punt with in what will and there was a consensus from Australia to America we need regulation of the internet -- Brexit has taken up bandwidth. It is no wonder there should be a big debate in Whitehall. Lots of leaks, lots of talk in recent months about a new regulator, whether it is an entirely new body is not clear, how it is funded is not clear, probably the tech companies, lots of talk about statutory duty of care, heavy fines and potential criminal prosecutions for directors of companies if they leave out harmful material for too long.

More than 20 people are reported to have died in clashes -- there have been reports of both sides using air strikes. Dozens of militias operate their macro. They are linked either to the UN backed government under the Prime Minister. It has struggled to assert control. Or they are linked to the rebel army led by General Khalifa Haftar. Since Thursday, it's advanced on the capital, Tripoli, igniting fears of an all-out war. Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, has more. This is a battle fought largely by pick-up truck. Makeshift armoured vehicles jamming the routes in and out of Tripoli. These belong to militias loyal to the Government of National Accord that's backed by the United Nations. They are rushing to defend the capital. A government spokesman insisted they had slowed the advance of rebel forces. TRANSLATION: On this day, the Libyan Armed Forces declare the launch of the operation Volcano Of Anger to purge all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces. These are the aggressive forces he is talking about, from the so-called Libyan National Army - the loose alliance of armed groups that control much of the east and south of Libya - here preparing for battle at their Benghazi headquarters. Today, as these forces continue to head west, there were clashes south of Tripoli, particularly around the disused international airport. And there were also reports of air strikes by both sides. The UN mission in Libya called for a short truce to evacuate civilians but was ignored. The government said 21 people have been killed and 27 wounded. So, why does the crisis in Libya matter? Well, ever since Western forces helped depose Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has been gripped by violence and political instability. The UN has attempted to broker a political deal between General Haftar and Prime Minister Sarraj, but so far, it's failed and the fear among Western governments is that full-blown civil war could mean Libya once again becomes a source of migration and extremism on Europe's southern flank. Haftar clearly believes there is a military solution to this conflict. He believes that if he captures Tripoli, he doesn't have to negotiate politically, but this is a big gamble and it's certainly unclear whether it's going to be successful. At the moment, it's in the balance, but it looks like it's unlikely for his forces to succeed. Some countries are now acting to protect their nationals. These unverified pictures appear to show the United States evacuating some of its forces by hovercraft. EU foreign ministers will discuss the crisis in Brussels tomorrow, but few expect the fighting to end soon. James Landale, BBC News. The Government is due to reveal long-awaited proposals for tackling harmful online content. It follows sustained pressure on big tech companies, who have been under attack on several fronts, from the streaming of terror attacks, such as Christchurch, to child grooming. Earlier this year, there was an outcry after it was revealed that 14-year-old Molly Russell had seen images of self-harm on Instagram before she took her own life.

More than 20 people are reported to have died in clashes -- there have been reports of both sides using air strikes. Dozens of militias operate their macro. They are linked either to the UN backed government under the Prime Minister. It has struggled to assert control. Or they are linked to the rebel army led by General Khalifa Haftar. Since Thursday, it's advanced on the capital, Tripoli, igniting fears of an all-out war. Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, has more. This is a battle fought largely by pick-up truck. Makeshift armoured vehicles jamming the routes in and out of Tripoli. These belong to militias loyal to the Government of National Accord that's backed by the United Nations. They are rushing to defend the capital. A government spokesman insisted they had slowed the advance of rebel forces. TRANSLATION: On this day, the Libyan Armed Forces declare the launch of the operation Volcano Of Anger to purge all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces. These are the aggressive forces he is talking about, from the so-called Libyan National Army - the loose alliance of armed groups that control much of the east and south of Libya - here preparing for battle at their Benghazi headquarters. Today, as these forces continue to head west, there were clashes south of Tripoli, particularly around the disused international airport. And there were also reports of air strikes by both sides. The UN mission in Libya called for a short truce to evacuate civilians but was ignored. The government said 21 people have been killed and 27 wounded. So, why does the crisis in Libya matter? Well, ever since Western forces helped depose Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has been gripped by violence and political instability. The UN has attempted to broker a political deal between General Haftar and Prime Minister Sarraj, but so far, it's failed and the fear among Western governments is that full-blown civil war could mean Libya once again becomes a source of migration and extremism on Europe's southern flank. Haftar clearly believes there is a military solution to this conflict. He believes that if he captures Tripoli, he doesn't have to negotiate politically, but this is a big gamble and it's certainly unclear whether it's going to be successful. At the moment, it's in the balance, but it looks like it's unlikely for his forces to succeed. Some countries are now acting to protect their nationals. These unverified pictures appear to show the United States evacuating some of its forces by hovercraft. EU foreign ministers will discuss the crisis in Brussels tomorrow, but few expect the fighting to end soon. James Landale, BBC News.

More than 20 people are reported to have died in clashes -- there have been reports of both sides using air strikes. Dozens of militias operate their macro. They are linked either to the UN backed government under the Prime Minister. It has struggled to assert control. Or they are linked to the rebel army led by General Khalifa Haftar. Since Thursday, it's advanced on the capital, Tripoli, igniting fears of an all-out war. Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, has more. This is a battle fought largely by pick-up truck. Makeshift armoured vehicles jamming the routes in and out of Tripoli. These belong to militias loyal to the Government of National Accord that's backed by the United Nations. They are rushing to defend the capital. A government spokesman insisted they had slowed the advance of rebel forces. TRANSLATION: On this day, the Libyan Armed Forces declare the launch of the operation Volcano Of Anger to purge all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces. These are the aggressive forces he is talking about, from the so-called Libyan National Army - the loose alliance of armed groups that control much of the east and south of Libya - here preparing for battle at their Benghazi headquarters. Today, as these forces continue to head west, there were clashes south of Tripoli, particularly around the disused international airport. And there were also reports of air strikes by both sides. The UN mission in Libya called for a short truce to evacuate civilians but was ignored. The government said 21 people have been killed and 27 wounded. So, why does the crisis in Libya matter? Well, ever since Western forces helped depose Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has been gripped by violence and political instability. The UN has attempted to broker a political deal between General Haftar and Prime Minister Sarraj, but so far, it's failed and the fear among Western governments is that full-blown civil war could mean Libya once again becomes a source of migration and extremism on Europe's southern flank. Haftar clearly believes there is a military solution to this conflict. He believes that if he captures Tripoli, he doesn't have to negotiate politically, but this is a big gamble and it's certainly unclear whether it's going to be successful. At the moment, it's in the balance, but it looks like it's unlikely for his forces to succeed. Some countries are now acting to protect their nationals. These unverified pictures appear to show the United States evacuating some of its forces by hovercraft. EU foreign ministers will discuss the crisis in Brussels tomorrow, but few expect the fighting to end soon. James Landale, BBC News.

The Government is no longer in charge of this process. </p><p>Vicki Young in Westminster, thank you. There have been reports in the beer of both sides using air strikes. More than 20 people are reported to have died in clashes -- there have been reports of both sides using air strikes. Dozens of militias operate their macro. They are linked either to the UN backed government under the Prime Minister. It has struggled to assert control. Or they are linked to the rebel army led by General Khalifa Haftar. Since Thursday, it's advanced on the capital, Tripoli, igniting fears of an all-out war. Our diplomatic correspondent, James Landale, has more. This is a battle fought largely by pick-up truck. Makeshift armoured vehicles jamming the routes in and out of Tripoli. These belong to militias loyal to the Government of National Accord that's backed by the United Nations. They are rushing to defend the capital. A government spokesman insisted they had slowed the advance of rebel forces. TRANSLATION: On this day, the Libyan Armed Forces declare the launch of the operation Volcano Of Anger to purge all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces. These are the aggressive forces he is talking about, from the so-called Libyan National Army - the loose alliance of armed groups that control much of the east and south of Libya - here preparing for battle at their Benghazi headquarters. Today, as these forces continue to head west, there were clashes south of Tripoli, particularly around the disused international airport. And there were also reports of air strikes by both sides. The UN mission in Libya called for a short truce to evacuate civilians but was ignored. The government said 21 people have been killed and 27 wounded. So, why does the crisis in Libya matter? Well, ever since Western forces helped depose Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has been gripped by violence and political instability. The UN has attempted to broker a political deal between General Haftar and Prime Minister Sarraj, but so far, it's failed and the fear among Western governments is that full-blown civil war could mean Libya once again becomes a source of migration and extremism on Europe's southern flank. Haftar clearly believes there is a military solution to this conflict. He believes that if he captures Tripoli, he doesn't have to negotiate politically, but this is a big gamble and it's certainly unclear whether it's going to be successful. At the moment, it's in the balance, but it looks like it's unlikely for his forces to succeed. Some countries are now acting to protect their nationals. These unverified pictures appear to show the United States evacuating some of its forces by hovercraft. EU foreign ministers will discuss the crisis in Brussels tomorrow, but few expect the fighting to end soon. James Landale, BBC News. The Government is due to reveal long-awaited proposals for tackling harmful online content. It follows sustained pressure on big tech companies, who have been under attack on several fronts, from the streaming of terror attacks, such as Christchurch, to child grooming. Earlier this year, there was an outcry after it was revealed that 14-year-old Molly Russell had seen images of self-harm on Instagram before she took her own life. Our media editor, Amol Rajan, is here. What can we expect to see tomorrow? You say the proposals along long-awaited, the negotiations around and have made Brexit look simple. It has been a long time in the making. Brexit has taken a punt with in what will and there was a consensus from Australia to America we need regulation of the internet -- Brexit has taken up bandwidth. It is no wonder there should be a big debate in Whitehall. Lots of leaks, lots of talk in recent months about a new regulator, whether it is an entirely new body is not clear, how it is funded is not clear, probably the tech companies, lots of talk about statutory duty of care, heavy fines and potential criminal prosecutions for directors of companies if they leave out harmful material for too long.

The headlines at 11pm. Theresa May has insisted she had to reach out to Labour to try to save Brexit or let it slip out of our fingers. </p><p>The government plans to combat harmful online content. Labour has defended its handling of complaints about anti-Semitism, after it was reported the party failed to take disciplinary action in hundreds of places. A British woman has been arrested in Dubai for a Facebook post she made two years ago, calling her ex husband Dan Lydiate and his new wife a horse. For the second year in a row with the River Thames is light blue. Cambridge beat Oxford in the men's and women's boat races. At 11:30pm will take a look at the papers with our reviewers, Tony grew and Caroline Frost. Good evening. Welcome to BBC News. The Prime Minister has said that the Government's Brexit talks with Labour in recent days have taken place amid what she called the \"stark choice\" between leaving the EU without a deal, or not leaving at all. Labour says further talks are planned, but that there has not been any movement on the Government's so-called \"red lines\". Mrs May is due to travel to an emergency EU summit on Wednesday, where she'll ask for another Brexit delay. Here's our chief political correspondent, Vicki Young. If she'd had her way, we would have left the EU nine days ago. But it's not going to plan for Theresa May. Another Brexit deadline is approaching and there is little sign of a breakthrough in talks with Labour. The Prime Minister says continuing to delay our departure could mean it does not happen at all. It would mean letting the Brexit the British people voted for slip through our fingers, I will not stand for that, she says. And the Leader of the Commons agrees. I just do want to point out, we are out of time, we should have left on the 29th of March. Andrea Leadsom defended the decision to hold talks with the Labour leader, saying it was something they were doing through gritted teeth. Working with Jeremy Corbyn is not something I want to do at all. It is not something the Prime Minister wants to do. But far worse than that would be to fail to deliver on Brexit. That would be the appalling thing because we were quite clearly told by the people in 2016 to leave the European Union and every single politician who went on the air said, \"What you decide, we will implement.\" Those talks look likely to continue, but today Labour said they would consider revoking Article 50, that is stopping the Brexit process, to prevent leaving without a deal. If we get to a situation where Parliament has to look at revoking Article 50, that will be disappointing and it will be as a result of the crisis the Government has caused, unfortunately. It will be a matter that we consider very carefully at the time, but we have promised our party members and our constituents that we will do all we can to avoid a no-deal situation and it is something that we would consider very, very strongly. Parliament is making its voice heard on Brexit and all sides talk about compromise, but it is still not clear how a deal can be done. While the arguments rage in Westminster, what do Conservative voters in Ripon think about cross-party talks? If she works with him, the chances are we are going to get somewhere, rather than where we are now, sitting there, just listening to it all over and over and over again. I just want the job done. You know, if they can actually come to some compromise with the deal and actually agree, then I think that is all to the good. Should just come out of the EU, just walk away without a deal. Another Brexit deadline looms, but the path towards the exit still has a few more twists and turns. Vicki Young reporting. The government is due to reveal long-awaited proposals for tackling harmful online content. It follows sustained pressure on big tech companies, who have been under attack on several fronts - from the streaming of terror attacks, including Christchurch, to child grooming. Earlier this year there was an outcry after it was revealed that 14-year-old Molly Russell had seen images of self-harm on Instagram before she took her own life. Our media editor Amol Rajan is here and explains what we can expect to see tomorrow. These proposals have been a very long time in the making, for understandable reasons. Brexit has taken up a lot of bandwidth within Whitehall and there is a constraint -- consensus from Australia to America we need regulation of the internet but no country has mastered what that tougher regulation looks like. Philosophers have argued about what harm is so it's no wonder</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-ed4cb27ddd2c4822ab78f537189b32b9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV0-NJN1-JBH6-C25C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

It's going to be a 12 week consolation -- consultation. It's an attempt to take back control from Silicon Valley to citizens and voters and it shows that becoming battle between democracy and technology is one that will define our era. Amol Rajan, our media editor. Labour has defended its handling of complaints about anti-Semitism - after the Sunday Times reported that the party had failed to take disciplinary action in hundreds of cases. The newspaper claimed that complaints had been beset by delays, inaction and interference from the leader's office. This afternoon, at an annual general meeting, members of the Jewish Labour Movement overwhelmingly passed a no confidence motion in Jeremy Corbyn over his handling of anti-Semitism within the party. The National Secretary of the Jewish Labour Movement, Peter Mason, said Jeremy Corbyn had not done enough to tackle anti-Semitism. So, the Jewish Labour Movement a few months ago made the heart-wrenching decision to refer the Labour Party to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, alleging institutional racism, because quite frankly, what we have seen, and what today confirms, is that the structures and mechanisms of the Labour Party are so incapable of dealing with anti-Jewish racism that quite frankly, they need to bring in full independence to get the situation under control and to really shine a light on what we now know has been happening. Ultimately, organisations are led by the top, cultures of organisations are set by those that lead them. And over the last three years, one year on from the protests in Parliament Square by the Jewish community, can the Labour Party and the Labour Party leadership really say that enough has been done? Speaking this morning, the Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti urged the Jewish Labour Movement not to \"personalise the issue\". We have to tackle it, but it will be much easier to tackle it if we don't make it a personal attack on Jeremy Corbyn or a Conservative attack on Labour, or an inter-factional attack, it seems to me. And we know to take the same approach when there are claims about the Conservative Party, not to go, \"Oh, the Tories have got a problem with Islamophobia...\" We've got to come together as democratic people in the context of the rise of the far-right in Europe and in this country. The democratic people, who are anti-racist, need to come together and tackle it. Shami Chakrabarti. In Libya, reports of both sides using air strikes. More than 20 people have been reported dead in the clashes at the UN has called for an urgent truth. Libya has been torn by violence and instability since 2011. Dozens of militias operate their links either to the UN backed government and the Prime Minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, which has struggled to assert control, or the rebel Libyan national army, led by the general Haftar. Since Thursday, it's advanced on the capital Tripoli, igniting fears of an all-out war. Our diplomatic correspondent James Landale has more. This is a battle fought largely by pick-up truck. Makeshift armoured vehicles jamming the routes in and out of Tripoli. These belong to militias loyal to the Government of National Accord that's backed by the United Nations. They are rushing to defend the capital. A government spokesman insisted they had slowed the advance of rebel forces. TRANSLATION: On this day, the Libyan Armed Forces declare the launch of the operation Volcano Of Anger to purge all Libyan cities of aggressor and illegitimate forces. These are the aggressive forces he is talking about, from the so-called Libyan National Army - the loose alliance of armed groups that control much of the east and south of Libya - here preparing for battle at their Benghazi headquarters. Today, as these forces continue to head west, there were clashes south of Tripoli, particularly around the disused international airport. And there were also reports of air strikes by both sides. The UN mission in Libya called for a short truce to evacuate civilians but was ignored. The government said 21 people have been killed and 27 wounded. So, why does the crisis</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-66ba6758b1b54a51991099780902d2c5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV0-NJN1-JBH6-C232-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"855\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

That is pretty graphic. I don't know that there is one picture here that's not showing blood or a scar of some sort. Like a grooming process, especially on Instagram, because you follow one to another hash tag to another hash tag and it's grooming that person to self-harm more, consider suicide more, and maybe even take action on that. </p><p>It just needs to be shut down. I just... There are children literally dying every day from something that we can help prevent and we are not doing it. I don't understand it. At 5.38, he found her lifeless body... Mallory Grossman was just 12 when she ended her own life. Her mother, Diane, believes she was bullied to death, in part on social media. Now she tours the country, sounding a warning. One high school had nine suicides in one year. Nine children. Hindsight is cruel. Hindsight is very cruel. That's the toughest thing to cope with. Yes, it is. That, to me, is hindsight, that... I share that people think that the worst day of my life was the day that she died and I say, \"No, it's the day before, it was the day before.\" There's a million things you wish you'd done differently. We have a moral responsibility to protect our youth. If I could sit down at the table with Mark Zuckerberg, could I make your product better? Could I make it safer? What a great way for you to attaboy other and high five each other in the boardroom, if you actually put in infrastructure in a system to protect children. Keep up that work. You too. San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where big tech has flourished. But is it time for the industry to be reined in? It's amazing to me that as a father, you are willing... Definitely yes, says America's biggest charity dealing with online child safety. This is a huge problem and the lack of responsibility of the social media platforms is absolutely mind-boggling and absolutely disgraceful, so it is clear to me that they can and should be regulated. Journey's end, thoughts of home and of course of Molly. Molly is with me every day. I think all of her friends and family think about her frequently. She always wanted to help people. So I am pretty certain that she would be pushing for change so that young people were safer when they were online and that if they need help they could more easily find it.

Now, with the day's sport, here's Lizzi Greenwood Hughes at the BBC Sport Centre. Thanks, Clive. Good evening. Wales' head coach Warren Gatland says it wasn't to be after his side just missed out on a first World Cup final. They were beaten 19-16 in their semifinal by South Africa who'll now play England for the title next weekend. Andy Swiss reports from Yokohama. The anticipation was deafening, Wales fans, hoping for history, could they join England in the World Cup Final? Their passion was obvious. But they would need poise as well. A scrappy first half won't have revealed much to watching England coach, Jones, but the Springboks edged it. Andre Pollard booting them 9-6 ahead at the break. After it, Wales' task got even tougher, as De Allende bulldozed through to put South Africa in command. But Wales are a side of remarkable resilience, and back they came. COMMENTATOR: World Cup semifinal try! Josh Adams giving their fans fresh hope. Suddenly, it was 16-16. What drama! With less than five minutes to go, a penalty to South Africa,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-3991244ee43f412ea9ca3505b5d15712</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XC8-RV31-DY08-34HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"673\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

This is really about competing visions of the World Wide Web. The internet model we have in the West today is dominated by a few mostly Californian giants. The coming iteration of the internet will probably be more regulated and less literally of a free for all while stopping short of the walled garden occupied in places like China. Whether it is on competition rules, new data protection is or now copyright, it is Europe that is clipping the wings of big tech. The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Last week, Kurdish led forces took the last piece of territory in Syria occupied by the Islamic State group. It brought to a formal end to the self-proclaimed caliphate, declared in 2014. But amid the celebrations, Kurdish authorities say they're struggling to cope with the thousands of captured men and women from the ranks of IS, and are calling for an international court to be set up to deal with them. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has been given rare access to one of the camps in Northern Syria, where many of them are being held. What should be done with the captured men and women of the Islamic State group? It's one of the most urgent issues now the last enclave has been won back from IS. Hundreds of women who joined the group from around 40 countries are in this camp in Northern Syria. They include Ilham from the Netherlands who admits to having joined IS, but as yet has no idea where she might face trial. We are asking the government to take us back but I'm still here waiting. If you did go back to Holland, what do you think would happen? I'd go to prison. My children, I hope, to my family. That's what's going to happen. And you could accept that? Yeah. Because, I know I made a mistake. Well, you'll understand there are people around the world who will be watching this and they will say, leave her there. If she wanted to go, leave her there. Yeah, but it's no matter what people are thinking about me. With few countries taking back their IS group nationals, dealing with them has been left to the ill-equipped Kurdish administration. This isn't a prison. It is, as you can see, a camp in a war zone. The longer it goes on, the more there is a risk that something could go wrong. There could be instability in the region again. Unless a plan is put in place soon, this really is a ticking time bomb. People in the Kurdish region of Syria have already suffered living under IS, then losing so many lives fighting IS, and here, countries like Britain revoking the nationality of citizens who joined the group has gone down badly. The Kurdish head of foreign relations Abdul Karim Omar says it's created a huge problem. \"Unfortunately, the international community has disappointed us,\" he says. \"We can't hold and try these people alone. If the world doesn't help us, there will be a problem again and the Islamic State group will once again be a danger for all of us.\" After the final offensive to wipe the so-called Islamic State from the map, we saw trucks that carted away, we were told, hundreds of IS families. An ignominious end for the militants, but a reminder that children had been caught up in it all too. The administration here is urging countries to at least do something to help rehabilitate these young, foreign victims, to try to stop the ideology into which they were born re-emerging through them in the future. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, in north-eastern Syria. A US pharmaceutical firm, owned by the billionaire Sackler family, has agreed to pay nearly $275 million to settle a law suit brought by the state of Oklahoma, claiming it helped fuel the opioid crisis in the country. It's one of several firms named in the claim, which alleged they used deceptive practises, to sell opioids. The companies deny the claims. Our North America editor Jon Sopel is in Washington.

Last week, Kurdish led forces took the last piece of territory in Syria occupied by the Islamic State group. It brought to a formal end to the self-proclaimed caliphate, declared in 2014. But amid the celebrations, Kurdish authorities say they're struggling to cope with the thousands of captured men and women from the ranks of IS, and are calling for an international court to be set up to deal with them. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has been given rare access to one of the camps in Northern Syria, where many of them are being held. What should be done with the captured men and women of the Islamic State group? It's one of the most urgent issues now the last enclave has been won back from IS. Hundreds of women who joined the group from around 40 countries are in this camp in Northern Syria. They include Ilham from the Netherlands who admits to having joined IS, but as yet has no idea where she might face trial. We are asking the government to take us back but I'm still here waiting. If you did go back to Holland, what do you think would happen? I'd go to prison. My children, I hope, to my family. That's what's going to happen. And you could accept that? Yeah. Because, I know I made a mistake. Well, you'll understand there are people around the world who will be watching this and they will say, leave her there. If she wanted to go, leave her there. Yeah, but it's no matter what people are thinking about me. With few countries taking back their IS group nationals, dealing with them has been left to the ill-equipped Kurdish administration. This isn't a prison. It is, as you can see, a camp in a war zone. The longer it goes on, the more there is a risk that something could go wrong. There could be instability in the region again. Unless a plan is put in place soon, this really is a ticking time bomb. People in the Kurdish region of Syria have already suffered living under IS, then losing so many lives fighting IS, and here, countries like Britain revoking the nationality of citizens who joined the group has gone down badly. The Kurdish head of foreign relations Abdul Karim Omar says it's created a huge problem. \"Unfortunately, the international community has disappointed us,\" he says. \"We can't hold and try these people alone. If the world doesn't help us, there will be a problem again and the Islamic State group will once again be a danger for all of us.\" After the final offensive to wipe the so-called Islamic State from the map, we saw trucks that carted away, we were told, hundreds of IS families. An ignominious end for the militants, but a reminder that children had been caught up in it all too.

The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Last week, Kurdish led forces took the last piece of territory in Syria occupied by the Islamic State group. It brought to a formal end to the self-proclaimed caliphate, declared in 2014. But amid the celebrations, Kurdish authorities say they're struggling to cope with the thousands of captured men and women from the ranks of IS, and are calling for an international court to be set up to deal with them. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has been given rare access to one of the camps in Northern Syria, where many of them are being held. What should be done with the captured men and women of the Islamic State group? It's one of the most urgent issues now the last enclave has been won back from IS. Hundreds of women who joined the group from around 40 countries are in this camp in Northern Syria. They include Ilham from the Netherlands who admits to having joined IS, but as yet has no idea where she might face trial. We are asking the government to take us back but I'm still here waiting. If you did go back to Holland, what do you think would happen? I'd go to prison. My children, I hope, to my family. That's what's going to happen. And you could accept that? Yeah. Because, I know I made a mistake. Well, you'll understand there are people around the world who will be watching this and they will say, leave her there. If she wanted to go, leave her there. Yeah, but it's no matter what people are thinking about me. With few countries taking back their IS group nationals, dealing with them has been left to the ill-equipped Kurdish administration. This isn't a prison. It is, as you can see, a camp in a war zone. The longer it goes on, the more there is a risk that something could go wrong. There could be instability in the region again. Unless a plan is put in place soon, this really is a ticking time bomb. People in the Kurdish region of Syria have already suffered living under IS, then losing so many lives fighting IS, and here, countries like Britain revoking the nationality of citizens who joined the group has gone down badly. The Kurdish head of foreign relations Abdul Karim Omar says it's created a huge problem. \"Unfortunately, the international community has disappointed us,\" he says. \"We can't hold and try these people alone. If the world doesn't help us, there will be a problem again and the Islamic State group will once again be a danger for all of us.\" After the final offensive to wipe the so-called Islamic State from the map, we saw trucks that carted away, we were told, hundreds of IS families. An ignominious end for the militants, but a reminder that children had been caught up in it all too. The administration here is urging countries to at least do something to help rehabilitate these young, foreign victims, to try to stop the ideology into which they were born re-emerging through them in the future. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, in north-eastern Syria. A US pharmaceutical firm, owned by the billionaire Sackler family, has agreed to pay nearly $275 million to settle a law suit brought by the state of Oklahoma, claiming it helped fuel the opioid crisis in the country. It's one of several firms named in the claim, which alleged they used deceptive practises, to sell opioids. The companies deny the claims. Our North America editor Jon Sopel is in Washington. How significant could this prove to be, do you think? Well I think this is a landmark settlement and may well prove to be the tip of the arrow, as many other drugs companies face potential legal action. OxyContin came to the market in 1996</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NR-212cb9f8343c43daa52210956018f451</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRF-19V1-DY08-32XF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Last week, Kurdish led forces took the last piece of territory in Syria occupied by the Islamic State group. It brought to a formal end to the self-proclaimed caliphate, declared in 2014. But amid the celebrations, Kurdish authorities say they're struggling to cope with the thousands of captured men and women from the ranks of IS, and are calling for an international court to be set up to deal with them. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has been given rare access to one of the camps in Northern Syria, where many of them are being held. What should be done with the captured men and women of the Islamic State group? It's one of the most urgent issues now the last enclave has been won back from IS. Hundreds of women who joined the group from around 40 countries are in this camp in Northern Syria. They include Ilham from the Netherlands who admits to having joined IS, but as yet has no idea where she might face trial. We are asking the government to take us back but I'm still here waiting. If you did go back to Holland, what do you think would happen? I'd go to prison. My children, I hope, to my family. That's what's going to happen. And you could accept that? Yeah. Because, I know I made a mistake. Well, you'll understand there are people around the world who will be watching this and they will say, leave her there. If she wanted to go, leave her there. Yeah, but it's no matter what people are thinking about me. With few countries taking back their IS group nationals, dealing with them has been left to the ill-equipped Kurdish administration. This isn't a prison. It is, as you can see, a camp in a war zone. The longer it goes on, the more there is a risk that something could go wrong. There could be instability in the region again. Unless a plan is put in place soon, this really is a ticking time bomb. People in the Kurdish region of Syria have already suffered living under IS, then losing so many lives fighting IS, and here, countries like Britain revoking the nationality of citizens who joined the group has gone down badly. The Kurdish head of foreign relations Abdul Karim Omar says it's created a huge problem. \"Unfortunately, the international community has disappointed us,\" he says. \"We can't hold and try these people alone. If the world doesn't help us, there will be a problem again and the Islamic State group will once again be a danger for all of us.\" After the final offensive to wipe the so-called Islamic State from the map, we saw trucks that carted away, we were told, hundreds of IS families. An ignominious end for the militants, but a reminder that children had been caught up in it all too. The administration here is urging countries to at least do something to help rehabilitate these young, foreign victims, to try to stop the ideology into which they were born re-emerging through them in the future. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, in north-eastern Syria. A US pharmaceutical firm, owned by the billionaire Sackler family, has agreed to pay nearly $275 million to settle a law suit brought by the state of Oklahoma, claiming it helped fuel the opioid crisis in the country. It's one of several firms named in the claim, which alleged they used deceptive practises, to sell opioids. The companies deny the claims. Our North America editor Jon Sopel is in Washington.

The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Last week, Kurdish led forces took the last piece of territory in Syria occupied by the Islamic State group. It brought to a formal end to the self-proclaimed caliphate, declared in 2014. But amid the celebrations, Kurdish authorities say they're struggling to cope with the thousands of captured men and women from the ranks of IS, and are calling for an international court to be set up to deal with them. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has been given rare access to one of the camps in Northern Syria, where many of them are being held. What should be done with the captured men and women of the Islamic State group? It's one of the most urgent issues now the last enclave has been won back from IS. Hundreds of women who joined the group from around 40 countries are in this camp in Northern Syria. They include Ilham from the Netherlands who admits to having joined IS, but as yet has no idea where she might face trial. We are asking the government to take us back but I'm still here waiting. If you did go back to Holland, what do you think would happen? I'd go to prison. My children, I hope, to my family. That's what's going to happen. And you could accept that? Yeah. Because, I know I made a mistake. Well, you'll understand there are people around the world who will be watching this and they will say, leave her there. If she wanted to go, leave her there. Yeah, but it's no matter what people are thinking about me. With few countries taking back their IS group nationals, dealing with them has been left to the ill-equipped Kurdish administration. This isn't a prison. It is, as you can see, a camp in a war zone. The longer it goes on, the more there is a risk that something could go wrong. There could be instability in the region again. Unless a plan is put in place soon, this really is a ticking time bomb. People in the Kurdish region of Syria have already suffered living under IS, then losing so many lives fighting IS, and here, countries like Britain revoking the nationality of citizens who joined the group has gone down badly. The Kurdish head of foreign relations Abdul Karim Omar says it's created a huge problem. \"Unfortunately, the international community has disappointed us,\" he says. \"We can't hold and try these people alone. If the world doesn't help us, there will be a problem again and the Islamic State group will once again be a danger for all of us.\" After the final offensive to wipe the so-called Islamic State from the map, we saw trucks that carted away, we were told, hundreds of IS families. An ignominious end for the militants, but a reminder that children had been caught up in it all too. The administration here is urging countries to at least do something to help rehabilitate these young, foreign victims, to try to stop the ideology into which they were born re-emerging through them in the future. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, in north-eastern Syria. A US pharmaceutical firm, owned by the billionaire Sackler family, has agreed to pay nearly $275 million to settle a law suit brought by the state of Oklahoma, claiming it helped fuel the opioid crisis in the country. It's one of several firms named in the claim, which alleged they used deceptive practises, to sell opioids. The companies deny the claims. Our North America editor Jon Sopel is in Washington. How significant could this prove to be, do you think? Well I think this is a landmark settlement and may well prove to be the tip of the arrow, as many other drugs companies face potential legal action.

The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Last week, Kurdish led forces took the last piece of territory in Syria occupied by the Islamic State group. It brought to a formal end to the self-proclaimed caliphate, declared in 2014. But amid the celebrations, Kurdish authorities say they're struggling to cope with the thousands of captured men and women from the ranks of IS, and are calling for an international court to be set up to deal with them. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has been given rare access to one of the camps in Northern Syria, where many of them are being held. What should be done with the captured men and women of the Islamic State group? It's one of the most urgent issues now the last enclave has been won back from IS. Hundreds of women who joined the group from around 40 countries are in this camp in Northern Syria. They include Ilham from the Netherlands who admits to having joined IS, but as yet has no idea where she might face trial. We are asking the government to take us back but I'm still here waiting. If you did go back to Holland, what do you think would happen? I'd go to prison. My children, I hope, to my family. That's what's going to happen. And you could accept that? Yeah. Because, I know I made a mistake. Well, you'll understand there are people around the world who will be watching this and they will say, leave her there. If she wanted to go, leave her there. Yeah, but it's no matter what people are thinking about me. With few countries taking back their IS group nationals, dealing with them has been left to the ill-equipped Kurdish administration. This isn't a prison. It is, as you can see, a camp in a war zone. The longer it goes on, the more there is a risk that something could go wrong. There could be instability in the region again. Unless a plan is put in place soon, this really is a ticking time bomb. People in the Kurdish region of Syria have already suffered living under IS, then losing so many lives fighting IS, and here, countries like Britain revoking the nationality of citizens who joined the group has gone down badly. The Kurdish head of foreign relations Abdul Karim Omar says it's created a huge problem. \"Unfortunately, the international community has disappointed us,\" he says. \"We can't hold and try these people alone. If the world doesn't help us, there will be a problem again and the Islamic State group will once again be a danger for all of us.\" After the final offensive to wipe the so-called Islamic State from the map, we saw trucks that carted away, we were told, hundreds of IS families. An ignominious end for the militants, but a reminder that children had been caught up in it all too. The administration here is urging countries to at least do something to help rehabilitate these young, foreign victims, to try to stop the ideology into which they were born re-emerging through them in the future. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, in north-eastern Syria. A US pharmaceutical firm, owned by the billionaire Sackler family, has agreed to pay nearly $275 million to settle a law suit brought by the state of Oklahoma, claiming it helped fuel the opioid crisis in the country. It's one of several firms named in the claim, which alleged they used deceptive practises, to sell opioids. The companies deny the claims. Our North America editor Jon Sopel is in Washington. How significant could this prove to be, do you think? Well I think this is a landmark settlement and may well prove to be the tip of the arrow, as many other drugs companies face potential legal action. OxyContin came to the market in 1996</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1LO-4a3a0cd045ab46bb8a6b1207ffa60f5b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1LO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRF-19V1-DY08-32XK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Last week, Kurdish led forces took the last piece of territory in Syria occupied by the Islamic State group. It brought to a formal end to the self-proclaimed caliphate, declared in 2014. But amid the celebrations, Kurdish authorities say they're struggling to cope with the thousands of captured men and women from the ranks of IS, and are calling for an international court to be set up to deal with them. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has been given rare access to one of the camps in Northern Syria, where many of them are being held. What should be done with the captured men and women of the Islamic State group? It's one of the most urgent issues now the last enclave has been won back from IS. Hundreds of women who joined the group from around 40 countries are in this camp in Northern Syria. They include Ilham from the Netherlands who admits to having joined IS, but as yet has no idea where she might face trial. We are asking the government to take us back but I'm still here waiting. If you did go back to Holland, what do you think would happen? I'd go to prison. My children, I hope, to my family. That's what's going to happen. And you could accept that? Yeah. Because, I know I made a mistake. Well, you'll understand there are people around the world who will be watching this and they will say, leave her there. If she wanted to go, leave her there. Yeah, but it's no matter what people are thinking about me. With few countries taking back their IS group nationals, dealing with them has been left to the ill-equipped Kurdish administration. This isn't a prison. It is, as you can see, a camp in a war zone. The longer it goes on, the more there is a risk that something could go wrong. There could be instability in the region again. Unless a plan is put in place soon, this really is a ticking time bomb. People in the Kurdish region of Syria have already suffered living under IS, then losing so many lives fighting IS, and here, countries like Britain revoking the nationality of citizens who joined the group has gone down badly. The Kurdish head of foreign relations Abdul Karim Omar says it's created a huge problem. \"Unfortunately, the international community has disappointed us,\" he says. \"We can't hold and try these people alone. If the world doesn't help us, there will be a problem again and the Islamic State group will once again be a danger for all of us.\" After the final offensive to wipe the so-called Islamic State from the map, we saw trucks that carted away, we were told, hundreds of IS families. An ignominious end for the militants, but a reminder that children had been caught up in it all too. The administration here is urging countries to at least do something to help rehabilitate these young, foreign victims, to try to stop the ideology into which they were born re-emerging through them in the future. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, in north-eastern Syria. A US pharmaceutical firm, owned by the billionaire Sackler family, has agreed to pay nearly $275 million to settle a law suit brought by the state of Oklahoma, claiming it helped fuel the opioid crisis in the country. It's one of several firms named in the claim, which alleged they used deceptive practises, to sell opioids. The companies deny the claims. Our North America editor Jon Sopel is in Washington. How significant could this prove to be, do you think? Well I think this is a landmark settlement and may well prove to be the tip of the arrow, as many other drugs companies face potential legal action.

The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Last week, Kurdish led forces took the last piece of territory in Syria occupied by the Islamic State group. It brought to a formal end to the self-proclaimed caliphate, declared in 2014. But amid the celebrations, Kurdish authorities say they're struggling to cope with the thousands of captured men and women from the ranks of IS, and are calling for an international court to be set up to deal with them. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has been given rare access to one of the camps in Northern Syria, where many of them are being held. What should be done with the captured men and women of the Islamic State group? It's one of the most urgent issues now the last enclave has been won back from IS. Hundreds of women who joined the group from around 40 countries are in this camp in Northern Syria. They include Ilham from the Netherlands who admits to having joined IS, but as yet has no idea where she might face trial. We are asking the government to take us back but I'm still here waiting. If you did go back to Holland, what do you think would happen? I'd go to prison. My children, I hope, to my family. That's what's going to happen. And you could accept that? Yeah. Because, I know I made a mistake. Well, you'll understand there are people around the world who will be watching this and they will say, leave her there. If she wanted to go, leave her there. Yeah, but it's no matter what people are thinking about me. With few countries taking back their IS group nationals, dealing with them has been left to the ill-equipped Kurdish administration. This isn't a prison. It is, as you can see, a camp in a war zone. The longer it goes on, the more there is a risk that something could go wrong. There could be instability in the region again. Unless a plan is put in place soon, this really is a ticking time bomb. People in the Kurdish region of Syria have already suffered living under IS, then losing so many lives fighting IS, and here, countries like Britain revoking the nationality of citizens who joined the group has gone down badly. The Kurdish head of foreign relations Abdul Karim Omar says it's created a huge problem. \"Unfortunately, the international community has disappointed us,\" he says. \"We can't hold and try these people alone. If the world doesn't help us, there will be a problem again and the Islamic State group will once again be a danger for all of us.\" After the final offensive to wipe the so-called Islamic State from the map, we saw trucks that carted away, we were told, hundreds of IS families. An ignominious end for the militants, but a reminder that children had been caught up in it all too. The administration here is urging countries to at least do something to help rehabilitate these young, foreign victims, to try to stop the ideology into which they were born re-emerging through them in the future. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, in north-eastern Syria. A US pharmaceutical firm, owned by the billionaire Sackler family, has agreed to pay nearly $275 million to settle a law suit brought by the state of Oklahoma, claiming it helped fuel the opioid crisis in the country. It's one of several firms named in the claim, which alleged they used deceptive practises, to sell opioids. The companies deny the claims. Our North America editor Jon Sopel is in Washington. How significant could this prove to be, do you think? Well I think this is a landmark settlement and may well prove to be the tip of the arrow, as many other drugs companies face potential legal action. OxyContin came to the market in 1996</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SC-0fdf32d6b0664ec387f6bf6f62428ef3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRF-19V1-DY08-32XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"822\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

But campaigners for the open Web and tech giants themselves who spend huge sums lobbying against the changes say this is a dark day for civil society across the globe and they add that these rules could be unworkable. There are important caveats here. The reforms have already been deleted and they remain short on vital detail. </p><p>If approved by EU member states, each country will have two years to make the changes and of course Britain's future relationship with the EU is still unclear. This is really about competing visions of the World Wide Web. The internet model we have in the West today is dominated by a few mostly Californian giants. The coming iteration of the internet will probably be more regulated and less literally of a free for all while stopping short of the walled garden occupied in places like China. Whether it is on competition rules, new data protection is or now copyright, it is Europe that is clipping the wings of big tech. The future of Silicon Valley is being reimagined in Brussels and the laws governing our global digital community are about to get a whole lot tougher. Amol Rajan, BBC News. Last week, Kurdish led forces took the last piece of territory in Syria occupied by the Islamic State group. It brought to a formal end to the self-proclaimed caliphate, declared in 2014. But amid the celebrations, Kurdish authorities say they're struggling to cope with the thousands of captured men and women from the ranks of IS, and are calling for an international court to be set up to deal with them. Our correspondent Aleem Maqbool has been given rare access to one of the camps in Northern Syria, where many of them are being held. What should be done with the captured men and women of the Islamic State group? It's one of the most urgent issues now the last enclave has been won back from IS. Hundreds of women who joined the group from around 40 countries are in this camp in Northern Syria. They include Ilham from the Netherlands who admits to having joined IS, but as yet has no idea where she might face trial. We are asking the government to take us back but I'm still here waiting. If you did go back to Holland, what do you think would happen? I'd go to prison. My children, I hope, to my family. That's what's going to happen. And you could accept that? Yeah. Because, I know I made a mistake. Well, you'll understand there are people around the world who will be watching this and they will say, leave her there. If she wanted to go, leave her there. Yeah, but it's no matter what people are thinking about me. With few countries taking back their IS group nationals, dealing with them has been left to the ill-equipped Kurdish administration. This isn't a prison. It is, as you can see, a camp in a war zone. The longer it goes on, the more there is a risk that something could go wrong. There could be instability in the region again. Unless a plan is put in place soon, this really is a ticking time bomb. People in the Kurdish region of Syria have already suffered living under IS, then losing so many lives fighting IS, and here, countries like Britain revoking the nationality of citizens who joined the group has gone down badly. The Kurdish head of foreign relations Abdul Karim Omar says it's created a huge problem. \"Unfortunately, the international community has disappointed us,\" he says. \"We can't hold and try these people alone. If the world doesn't help us, there will be a problem again and the Islamic State group will once again be a danger for all of us.\" After the final offensive to wipe the so-called Islamic State from the map, we saw trucks that carted away, we were told, hundreds of IS families. An ignominious end for the militants, but a reminder that children had been caught up in it all too. The administration here is urging countries to at least do something to help rehabilitate these young, foreign victims, to try to stop the ideology into which they were born re-emerging through them in the future. Aleem Maqbool, BBC News, in north-eastern Syria. A US pharmaceutical firm, owned by the billionaire Sackler family, has agreed to pay nearly $275 million to settle a law suit brought by the state of Oklahoma, claiming it helped fuel the opioid crisis in the country. It's one of several firms named in the claim, which alleged they used deceptive practises, to sell opioids. The companies deny the claims. Our North America editor Jon Sopel is in Washington. How significant could this prove to be, do you think? Well I think this is a landmark settlement and may well prove to be the tip of the</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1EA-9748c4fcf1a340ad8bd700dd03b4489b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1EA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRF-19V1-DY08-32W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400360</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

But for him, he said it was always about the line. I know nothing about mountaineering, I couldn't do it myself. I thought the elation would be when you got to the top of the mountain, surely that is the moment that you feel the most exhileration. </p><p>But for Tom he said it is when he got down to the bottom and he looked at the line he had climbed, and that is what he was trying to do on this mountain, he was trying to do a particularly tough route with Deaniele Nadi, the Mummery Rib. And they knew the dangers. They talked of avalanches in the days before. I wished him luck just a couple weeks before on Facebook. It is just so sad. You can see that interview in full tomorrow evening on BBC One on Inside Out East Midlands and if you're outside the area, you can see it on BBC iPlayer. A 15-year-old boy has been charged with the murder of a teenager, who was fatally stabbed in west London. Ayub Hassan, aged 17, was found with wounds to his chest - in West Kensington on Thursday afternoon. He died later in hospital. A teenager is in a serious condition in hospital after being stabbed in the chest whilst on-board a bus in North London. The incident happened on the Route 134 bus in the Muswell Hill area just before a quarter to five this afternoon. The 19-year-old man was flown by air ambulance to an East London hospital. No arrests have been made. Two climbers have been rescued following an avalanche in the Scottish Highlands. The pair were climbing on part of the Three Sisters ridges in Glencoe and had been missing since yesterday. Both men were suffering from hypothermia when they were found. From Glencoe, our correspondent Morag Kinniburgh sent us this update. The two men had been on a rock climb up Stob Coire nan Lochan in the Three Sisters of Glencoe. They had been really high up all day yesterday when the winds picked up, the snow drove in and there were avalanches nearby. Attempts to rescue the pair had to be abandoned because of the danger to the rescuers themselves. The RAF and coastguard helped 70 mountain rescue team members on the ground to locate the pair, one of the men described as walking wounded, the other in a much more serious condition. The rescuers we have spoken to have described the pair as being very well equipped and experienced but conditions were very tough indeed. It seems they've completed the climb successfully and they had been on the ridge. I think visibility may have been the factor in this situation and they had got lost. It is quite technical ground higher up, eat easy to get lost in the mist. avalanched, we can't see potential cornices and how the snow is at higher levels. This has been one of the biggest search and rescue operations in this area for many years. The men and women involved in the rescue team simply very relieved that they did manage to get those two men off the mountain. Internet users should have greater control over personal data to ensure their own safety online. It's part of a proposal to change the way big tech companies are regulated. It follows a report from The House of Lords Communications Committee which says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had viewed graphic images about self harm online. Molly's father has said he believes social media was partly to blame for her death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online, and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nation state, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in the Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies, but if we think they need to do things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate. The House of Lords Communications Committee says the industry's response has been piecemeal and inadequate, so the Committee is calling for big tech to be reined in. There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering the digital world, but no one body has complete oversight, so the Lords recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protections given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. There's also a call for a classification framework, similar to that for films. The Government is currently working on its own plans to more strictly regulate web companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-2e054f483b25409cb6ac32a40009afa3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKT-H6M1-DY08-327S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"848\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

It is where North Korea makes most of its intercontinental ballistic missiles and most of its rockets for satellite launches. The activity is large trucks, which they have seen going in and out. Doesn't sound like much, but it is activity that many believe is consistent with that of preparing for either a missile or a rocket launch. </p><p>This goes in conjunction with the satellite images which suggest their main rocket launch site is now fully operational. Work stopped last year but now seems to have been started again and in fact it seems to have been rebuilt at a rapid pace. All eyes will now be on that site. It seems that trucks have now left Sanum Dong, and a train. All eyes will now be on the main rocket launch site to see if it arrives there for launch. It is unlikely I'm told by analysts at this stage that it may be a missile. They believe it is more likely to be a satellite. But that would still breach the agreement reached between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, according to the US State Department spokesman who gave a briefing this week. They would see that as a violation, even if it is a satellite launch. So this is a tense time and one of those times where both Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump have difficult decisions to make. If they launch a satellite in North Korea it could break all agreements and cause a breakdown of the talks between the United States and North Korea. The United States may turn a blind eye and just say it is a satellite, or they may also say that this is a breach of the trust reached between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. So it is a tense time and everyone is wondering exactly what is going on. I think the best thing we can do is keep an eye on the situation. Laura in the South Korean capital. Let's take at look at some of today's other stories on BBC News. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten of the nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a nine per cent increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. America's commercial astronaut capsule, the Space-X Dragon, has successfully completed its six-day test mission into space. The craft, which had a robot on board, re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and touched down in the Atlantic Ocean. The US space agency NASA says that for the first time in eight years it could now consider sending astronauts back into orbit. More than 200 items from George Michael's personal art collection are to be auctioned this week in London. The singer - who died in December 2016 - built up his collection by visiting galleries and artists' studios. Any money made will go to charity. And events to mark Barbie's 60th birthday are taking place around the world. The doll will make an appearance at a number of locations, including a Barbie pop-up experience in New York. The toy's manufacturer - Mattel - describe her as \"the number one fashion doll\" designed to inspire girls. Internet users should have greater control over personal data to ensure their own safety online. It's part of a proposal to change the way big tech companies are regulated. It follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee that says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had viewed graphic images about self harm online. Molly's father has said he believes social media was partly to blame for her death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online, and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nation state, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in the Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies, but if we think they need to do things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate.

It won't do any good in Molly's case, but of course, we might learn lessons that might help other people. I'm sure there's something on her Instagram account... The family know she had at least one account on Instagram, but there may be others. She used Pinterest too. </p><p>A month after her death, automated e-mails were still suggesting more accounts to follow. In law, that data belongs to the tech companies, not the family. But we now believe that the coroner is writing to Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and Apple, demanding that they hand over anything they know about what Molly did online. So why YouTube? Here's why. Within a couple of clicks, we find videos about self-harm. Many are meant to be positive, posted by people trying to help. But some of the images are graphic and disturbing. And look - the same kind of bleak cartoons we know Molly liked on Instagram. Then there's her phone. Ian wants to know what's in it, but it's locked. Apple says it would help, but their encryption means it's impossible to open. If you were to look in Molly's phone, there may be key evidence. The only thing that provided that last final straw must have come through her phone or her iPod Touch. We need to find out what it was that drove her to make that final decision that encouraged her to take her life at the end. It seems to me that the data on Molly's phone should have become her parents' property. She died without a will. She was 14. And everything else quite naturally returns to us as her parents, and so should her data. In Germany, it's different. In 2012, a 15-year-old girl fell in front of an underground train at the station. It wasn't clear whether she had taken her own life. Her parents wanted answers, and had to take Facebook to court to get access to her account. I think it's very important that there are laws or judgments, anything that would help families, in this case, to get hold of the data, to retrieve the data, because it's personal. It's not data which belongs to Facebook or Instagram or Google, for instance. Molly's family are left with videos, pictures, memories. What they need are answers and for now, those remain out of reach. Angus Crawford, BBC News. Well today social media companies were accused of choosing to profit from children rather than protect them by Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson. He said a Labour government would create a regulator with the power to break up tech firms in a bid to rein in their enormous commerial power and influence. Our media editor Amol Rajan looks now at how this might work. As Angus's report made clear, Molly Russell's father wants it to be much easier for users to access information after a tragedy. But there's also the wider issue of how you shift the power from big tech companies back to citizens. The challenge here is we are in very new territory. New laws tend to use old laws as a starting point, but it's not clear that old laws are much use when it comes to the digital revolution. Today, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, identified three areas that could be explored. First, competition law. This is about the concentration of economic power. Could existing or new competition laws be used to break up monopolies, or stop acquisitions such as Facebook's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp? Second, data. It's too crude, as it were, to say that data is the new oil, but it is the most powerful commodity on earth today. Could Europe's new data rules, known as GDPR, be extended, to give citizens greater control and ownership of the digital trails they leave online? Some policy makers, for instance, think tech companies should pay us for our data. Finally, free speech and libel laws. This is about the limits of liberalism. What is it permissible to publish online, and who should be responsible? In Germany, they've modified existing hate-speech laws to fine tech companies for leaving harmful content online too long.

You say he could have been here. The Home Secretary said yesterday there hasn't been consular access in Syria since the war began, pretty much, that it is not a safe place for example where British officials could go and be involved in any attempt to bring the baby out, and that therefore there wasn't really anything the Government could have done. British journalists have been able to get into the camp and of course it is serviced by aid workers. </p><p>It is not upset a humanitarian aid group like Save The Children to comment on what kind of private diplomacy might have been able to get the mother and child out but it is clear the decision to strip the mother of citizenship was taken considering the best interests of the child. The third child lost to this particular mother and against a backdrop where 84 people have died on their way to or arriving at this camp, two thirds of which are little children under five years old. Just on the scale of the pressure that is now on that refugee camp, because of the larger numbers of people coming into it, some of them of course will have been fighters with the group calling itself Islamic State, and others will have been girls and women who were married or living with those men. What sort of pressure is that putting on? What is the ability to supply food, shelter, warmth, for that large number of people. Our understanding is that over 90% of the people in this camp are women and children. There are about 54,000 people they are in freezing temperatures so a lot of the people who have died have died of hypothermia or because they haven't had enough food. This particular little boy, not even three weeks old, died of pneumonia. If you wonder how a child dies of pneumonia, they essentially die of exhaustion because they little body gives up fighting because it is so hard to breathe. These are no places for children and certainly no places for newborns. I'm sure everyone would agree with what you are saying destination. I suppose the practical difficulty in the case of Shamima Begum, this is a woman who had voluntarily left this country to live in another country to be involved in a conflict situation. Is not something where it can be the obligation you think on politicians and officials in this country to do something about? Well, the best interests of her children, regardless of how we feel about the parent, the best interests of the children come first. But it is worth remembering in the specific case she was 15 when she left, a child herself. Someone who has been radicalised in Britain remains Britain's responsibility and we all have questions to answer about how that could have happened in our country and what obligations we owe not just to her but crucially to her little ones now. I might use a 90% of those coming into the camp are women. -- you say that 90% of those coming in. Presumably many of them will be British and many will have had children since they were out there since that is sort of part of the package, as it were, of going to live with the group that calls itself Islamic State. What then happens to those children? Clearly they haven't had the spotlight or attention that Shamima Begum's case has had. Do they have legal status as British citizens if their mothers where British? We found about 2500 children in the camp that are the children of foreign nationals, not of course just Britain but different countries. 2500 children who are born to mothers who were not originally from Syria but came to Syria. Exactly. 2500 children born to mothers who are owed an obligation from their own states. We can't keep passing this problem around. If you are a citizen of a country remain that country's responsibility. But we also found 50 children completely unaccompanied without anyone to look after them and they are of course not in the spotlight but they are the number one concern of Save The Children. Kirsty McNeill from the charity, thank you very much for being with us today. Internet users should have greater control over personal data to ensure their own safety online. It's part of a proposal to change the way big tech companies are regulated. It follows a report from The House of Lords Communications Committee which says companies are failing to regulate themselves effectively. Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had viewed graphic images about self harm online. Molly's father has said he believes social media was partly to blame for her death. There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online, and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nation state, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in the Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies, but if we think they need to do things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate.

When I share that people think that the worst day of my life was the day that she died and I say, \"No, it's the day before, it was the day before.\" </p><p>There's a million things you wish you'd done differently. We have a moral responsibility to protect our youth. If I could sit down at the table with Mark Zuckerberg, could I make your product better? Could I make it safer? What a great way for you to attaboy each other and high five each other in the boardroom, if you actually put in infrastructure in a system to protect children. Keep up that work. You too. San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where big tech has flourished. But is it time for the industry to be reined in? It's amazing to me that as a father, you are willing... Definitely yes, says America's biggest charity dealing with online child safety. This is a huge problem and the lack of responsibility of the social media platforms is absolutely mind-boggling and absolutely disgraceful, so it is clear to me that they can and should be regulated. Journey's end, thoughts of home and, of course, of Molly. Molly is with me every day. I think all of her friends and family think about her frequently. She always wanted to help people. So I'm pretty certain that she would be pushing for change so that young people were safer when they were online and that if they need help they could more easily find it.

The headlines on BBC News: President Trump announces that US special forces have killed the fugitive leader of the so-called Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The US says al-Baghdadi detonated an explosive vest after being cornered in a compound, in north-western Syria. The government presses ahead with attempts to get a December general election. Ministers will put a vote before Parliament tomorrow. Sport, and for a full round-up, here's the BBC Sport Centre. Good evening. There won't be an all-British Rugby World Cup final after Wales lost to South Africa by 19-16. It was a close match throughout, which made the final result of the semi-final all the more heartbreaking for Wales. South Africa will now play England in the final next weekend. Our sports correspondent Andy Swiss reports from Yokohama. The anticipation was deafening, Wales fans hoping for history, could they join England in the World Cup final? Their passion was obvious. But they would need poise as well. The Springboks edged it. Booted 9-6 ahead at the break. After it, the task for Wales got tougher. Bulldozing through to put South Africa in command. Wales are a side of remarkable resilience and back they came. COMMENTATOR: World Cup semifinal... Josh Adam is giving fans fresh hope, suddenly 16-16, what drama. Less than five minutes left, a penalty to South Africa and under the fiercest pressure, he held his nerve. It had not been pretty from the Springboks, but it was enough. While they celebrated, for Wales, the dream was once again dashed, a Third World Cup semifinal defeat and desperate disappointment. Absolutely gutted. South Africa took advantage, congratulations to them. Really proud of the skies. They have given us 100%, they continue to do so. We got ourselves back in that game, really close contest. Data semi-final defeat, is it a bit sad</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-e900dbbc551243cf8a522b282ff1f7a0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCB-YDV1-DY08-3509-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"642\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

This change the way they communicate with each other. It is an amazing way for them to entertain themselves but there are huge dangers online. Even now when you can see, my eight-year-old can see when she is on the iPad in the room, if this becomes a wearable technology, our regulation, which is already 30 years out of date, based on the children's act, is no chance of keeping up. </p><p>So what Barnardos is saying is that the technology is fantastic. Young people benefit hugely from it but our regulation around keeping children safe online, we do off-line, in playgrounds which are safe by design. So she had that experience online be safe? If we don't do it now than in 30 years' time where some of our futurologist that we have interviewed a sane, well, much of what we think is going to drive communication in the future hasn't even been invented yet. So we clearly can't regulate for that. What we can do, though, is really bring back the online harm paper, and the Government has done some great work on select committees with the help of charities like Barnardos. What we need to do, regardless of what parties in power in the next couple of months, this is unarguably something that needs to be put into legislation. You need to update for the online world. How on earth, though, does a Government think about regulating for, know, holograms or chip inside a wrist, when that is not out there in the market? I don't think you can anticipate what we don't know yet. But certainly, what we need to do is regulate for what we do know and ensure that there is at least a statutory duty of care, a legal duty of care for the big tech companies that will be developing this technology so they are developing it alongside charities that understand the impact of, like Barnardos, a palm on children and young people, ensuring that it is safe by design. So we don't have to retrospectively try to fix something that is pretty hard to get back in the bag at that point. So what we are saying is, let's put in place an online harm is built into legislation. Out of that as a regulator, part of that is a duty on big tech companies to ensure safety by design and that way we have got a chance of keeping children and young people, particularly the most vulnerable, actually, say. Just very quickly, couldn't help to make this technology help keep people safe? If I always know when my child is because there is something implanted in them or if it holograms, and potentially more dangerous? It's potentially better, isn't it? It is just like fire. A great tool when used well and dangerous when not. Technology is a wonderful thing. The same technology that you can track your child with, somebody else can. It if it has not been used are regulated in the right way put up on children, importantly, the parents and children are not learning how to navigate safely in that environment themselves. Education is a key part for adults absolutely committed. Thank you very Thank you very much indeed. The teenage activist Greta Thunberg has hailed the global day of protests she inspired as the 'biggest climate strike in history'. Millions of people around the world have taken part in demonstrations over the last 24 hours, ahead of a summit in New York next week. The teenager addressed people in the city - praising them for taking part in what she called 'a wave of change'. We all live here. It affects all of us. And we will not just stand aside and watch. We are united behind the science and we will do everything in our power to stop this crisis from getting worse. APPLAUSE. Fears that thousands people could storm the top secret US military base known as 'Area 51' last night turned out to be unfounded. More than three million responded to a Facebook post in June, calling for people to raid the facility in Nevada - in an attempt to uncover evidence of extra-terrestrial life. But only around 75 people turned up, many of them in costume and no-one attempted to enter the site. Tim Allman has more. SHOUTING, LAUGHTER. As invasions go - alien or otherwise - this was a little underwhelming. Here at Area 51, it seems fewer than that number bothered to turn up. But, for those who did, the hunt for little green men is always worthwhile. A bunch of random people in weird costumes, standing outside of a Government base? Why would you want to miss that? That's a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It's like Halloween, but we're just...annoying people. We clicked that we'd be going, just for the fun of it, but as it got more popular, we decided, \"Hey, why not go down and actually make a fun trip out of it?\" So we came down, we're going camping and we're going to check at the base - as much as we can - from here.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-3ab1e4e9d64a47d0b325a49ec661f6c8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3J-0WD1-DY08-34MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

There are more than a dozen UK regulators covering the digital world, but no one body has complete oversight, so the Lords recommend the creation of a new digital authority. It also wants protections given to people in the real world to apply online. One key principle for regulation would be respect for privacy, to keep our growing volume of online data safe. </p><p>There's also a call for a classification framework, similar to that for films. The Government is currently working on its own plans to more strictly regulate web companies. Internet firms say they work hard to keep their services free of some of the most serious issues people are concerned about, but they say they recognise that more needs to be done to address potential online harms. Rob Young, BBC News. The world's oldest living woman has been recognised by Guinness World Records. She is the 116-year old Japanese woman, Kane Tanaka, who was born and lives on the southern island of Kyushu. She's in a nursing home, where staff organised a party to celebrate the recognition. Tanka says the secret to her long life are family, sleep and her Shinto faith. Still in good health, her hobbies include board games and calligraphy, but she also confesses to a weakness for sweets and canned coffee drinks. I don't know why they put that story just before the start, but, Mike Bushell, a few tips for living long and successfully? I certainly don't get enough sleep but I like board games! Anyway, good morning. They've swept all before them for 12 matches running, but today Wales come up against a Scotland side, who can be a force to reckoned with at home. Having said that, if the Welsh head coach Warren Gatland can keep up his own unblemished record against the scots, his side will be one step away from the Six Nations Grand Slam. Joe Wilson is at Murrayfield for us. This has to come to an end at some point, this winning streak. Will it be Scotland? I think Scotland need to believe they can do it, and in a broader sense the six Nations really need a competitive Scottish team especially at home. You mention the weather. Bright and breezy start to the day in Edinburgh. We might get rain later. If not, I think it will help Scotland. If they can keep the ball in hand, keep it quick, keep their skill. Finn Russell, may be the most skilful player in the whole of European rugby. Ali Price starts for Scotland at scrum half who can perhaps inject a bit of dynamism into things, and then maybe we will see some of the Scottish player we have seen a lot of over recent years -- some of the Scottish flair. Enthusiasm coming back into Scottish rugby. Having said all that, we know that Wales over those consecutive victories have this way of winning matches, they have the confidence, the discipline and the strength and organisation but we have been talking a lot about what this game means to Wales with a grand slam possibility in the World Cup year. I think we need to be clear this game means a lot to Scottish rugby as well. Right now they could really do with what I would term the oxygen of a big victory. Joe, you should get in that Scottish dressing room, a motivational team talk they are, from our very own Joe Wilson! Fantastic stuff. We will see you a little later. Scotland v Wales coverage on BBC 1 from 13.15 with kick-off at 14.15, and live commentary on Radio 5Live of England v Italy from 16.45. England Women beat India by one run in their third and final T20 International. England started well, reaching 50 without a wicket, but lost five quick wickets including Natalie Sciver out for a duck following Danielle Wyatt's dismissal that started the collapse, finishing 119-6. India needed three runs in six balls but Kate Cross got 2 wickets in the last over to give England the win. When you have a low total to defend you are probably going to be a villain or hero pretty quickly. Nice to be on the right side of that. But I had been hitting a hard lens all game and that had been working quite successfully for me, the previous two games. Me and Heather had a chat, and hopefully got it right this time -- thankfully we got it right this time. Manchester City can go four points clear at the top of the Premier League table with a win over Watford. Second-placed Liverpool play Burnley tomorrow. City boss Pep Guardiola says the match is vital for their chances of retaining the title. It is the last game before 21 days without the Premier League, before the international break, and of</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-d502d31d71314990b6d5f768bd0787f1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-PP91-JBH6-C0XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

It is at times like these that really reminds us how valuable and importantly will of independent independent professional journalism is an situation like that, different organisations beating one another so that people had the chance to make up their own minds. And what can you do about governments when they are involved in misinformation? We know there are examples. </p><p>I won't go into them, but we all kind of know at the accusations fly all over the place, so what can you do about it? There are three words, invest in journalism. I will go beyond that, of course, but if that was possible and it is not always possible, as Rasmus is saying, in some environments, but investing in journalism and investing in education of that information consumer. There is a lot of discussion right now about throwing legal infrastructure at the problem, technical infrastructure at the problem, but to me it is making information for the consumer as savvy as possible and that has to start really young, but it also has to be thrown and provided for the older generation that aren't digital natives, so I think either huge advocate of education and investing in journalism. But there's not a lot you can do if a Government decides it is going to jam and deny people access to various sites. There's not a lot you can do, is there, Jevin? There is not and that is where the wild, wild west of the Internet helps. It is a double-edged sword in some ways, in that it is a big problem, but the more that we provide access to that information across the world, as we mentioned in a previous question so far in this discussion, that is one of the ways that I think we can get at these things, so I think access to information, despite its problems, is what we should be after as well. Has that answered your question? Yes, I would like to thank the panel. I was just thinking that this misinformation that even the Government allows is a serious issue about democracy and threatening our freedom. Thank you very much from Shanghai in China. That is go to our last question now, Anastasia from Ukraine. What is your question please? My question is can misinformation be regulated at the governmental level without breaking basic human rights? Right, Rasmus, how would you answer that? I am very sceptical of that, personally. We have a balance to strike always between free expression and other fundamental human rights, but most countries have signed up to the various international declarations and I think there are good reasons to have legal bans on hate speech and some other forms of criminal speech, that when it comes to misinformation I think there are often misinformation is information that is disturbing, that is offensive and a shocking and it is information that is not necessarily true, but is most often covered by traditional freedom of expression rules and I think we really need to be very careful, as several of you have pointed out in your question is because much misinformation concerns politics and governments. They will always be a temptation if we criminalise things that could be seen as misleading that they will be used by a powerful people and powerful institutions to silence dissent and critics, as of course historically has happened, even in democracies, such rules have been used by powerful people to try to stifle dissent and criticism, so I think we need to be very careful and I'm glad to see caught in a free societies around the world express great scepticism toward some of the attempts to regulate misinformation just in the last couple of days. Jevin, just before you answer that, a related issue there about regulation. Some of the platforms themselves are trying to do things, aren't they? Twitter, for instance, hit one tweet from President Trump that it said was a bit... One that was a bit misleading and one was a bit provocative, and he said, when the looting starts, the shooting starts, and so on, so they are themselves taking some responsibility, so can governments and the googles and the facebooks step up to this challenge themselves? I am sceptical and I couldn't agree with Rasmus more on this issue. I am a huge advocate of freedom of expression and freedom of speech, and the big tech companies are doing their best to show that they can do this regulation and they are doing more so during Covid-19 and I ever have, and I commend some of their efforts. I mean there are certain things we should certainly remove. Child pornography, for example, or suicide videos. There are all sorts of things we should</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-41f269edc25e45d0b5b7886ee498bca2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607G-92X1-JBH6-C507-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"788\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

She was stabbed in a park while listening to music with friends. Police say that she died about an hour later. A postmortem has revealed the cause of death to be trauma and haemorrhage. </p><p>Mr Petrovic, who confirmed that he is a Croatian national, is to appear at the Old Bailey on the 11th of March. A second man also remains in custody, on suspicion of Jodie's murder. That was Jane-Francis Kelly. A 15-year-old boy has been charged with the murder of a teenager who was stabbed to death in west London. Ayub Hassan, aged 17, was found with stab wounds to the chest in Lanfrey Place, West Kensington, on Thursday and died in hospital. Scotland Yard said the 15-year-old boy was due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court later. Asda has said it will remove all single kitchen knives from sale, because of concerns over their use in stabbings across the UK. The announcement by the supermarket chain follows a wave of fatal stabbings in recent weeks, many involving teenagers. Asda says the most frequently stolen knives are the single-use-style, and it adds it has a responsibilty to try and help in the work to bring violent crime under control. For the second time this week, US analysts have reported activity at a military site in North Korea. Commercial satellite images of a facility near the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, suggest there are preparations to launch a missile or a satellite. A summit between the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and President Donald Trump to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear weapons ended last week without agreement. The BBC's correspondent in Seoul, Laura Bicker, has been explaining what had raised analysts suspicions. The latest activity is at a site known as Sanum Dong, just outside Pyongyang. It is where North Korea makes most of its intercontinental ballistic missiles and most of its rockets for satellite launches. The activity is large trucks, which they have seen going in and out. Doesn't sound like much, but it is activity that many believe is consistent with that of preparing for either a missile or a rocket launch. This goes in conjunction with the satellite images which suggest their main rocket launch site is now fully operational. Work stopped last year but now seems to have been started again and in fact it seems to have been rebuilt at a rapid pace. All eyes will now be on that site. It seems that trucks have now left Sanum Dong, and a train. All eyes will now be on Sohae to see if something arrives there for launch. It is unlikely, I'm told by analysts, at this stage that it may be a missile. They believe it is more likely to be a satellite. But that would still breach the agreement reached between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, according to the US State Department spokesman who gave a briefing this week. They would see that as a violation, even if it is a satellite launch. So this is a tense time and one of those times where both Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump have difficult decisions to make. If they launch a satellite in North Korea it could break all agreements and cause a breakdown of the talks between the United States and North Korea. The United States may turn a blind eye and just say it's a satellite, or they may also say that this is a breach of the trust reached between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. So it is a tense time and everyone is wondering exactly what is going on. I think the best thing we can do is keep an eye on the situation. That was Laura Bicker in Seoul. Let's take at look at some of today's other stories on BBC News. Research by the BBC has found only one in ten of the nurses working within the NHS in England are men. Figures suggest that last year there were just over 36,000 male nurses compared to more than 285,000 women. The Department of Health said it had seen a nine per cent increase in men applying for courses in the past 12 months. America's commercial astronaut capsule, the SpaceX Dragon, has successfully completed its six-day test mission into space. The craft, which had a robot on board, re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and touched down in the Atlantic Ocean. The US space agency Nasa says that for the first time in eight years it could now consider sending astronauts back into orbit. More than 200 items from George Michael's personal art collection are to be auctioned this week in London. The singer - who died in December 2016 - built up his collection by visiting galleries and artists' studios. Any money made will go to charity. Internet-users should have greater control over personal data to ensure their own safety online. It's part of a proposal to change the way big tech companies are regulated. It follows a report from the House of Lords Communications Committee which says companies are failing</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-65f3f861cac4464e964674559621bf1e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-W9N1-JBH6-C1HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"857\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Our business correspondent Rob Young has more. Molly Russell was 14 years old when she took her own life in 2017. She had viewed graphic images about self harm online. Molly's father has said he believes social media was partly to blame for her death. </p><p>There have been growing concerns about content and behaviour online, and calls for companies to do more. I think that lots of people feel powerless in this situation, but of course we can act. We are a nation state, Parliament is sovereign, as we are discovering in the Brexit process. We can legislate if we need to. It would be far better to do it in concert with social media companies, but if we think they need to do things that they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate.

Rob Young, BBC News. The world's oldest living woman has been recognised by Guinness World Records. She is 116-year old Japanese woman, Kane Tanaka, who was born and lives on the southern island of Kyushu. She's in a nursing home these days, where staff organised a party to celebrate the recognition. Tanka says the secret to her long life are family, sleep and her Shinto faith. Still in good health, her hobbies include board games and calligraphy but she also confesses to a weakness for sweets and canned coffee drinks. Congratulations to her. There may yet be hope for me! Now it's time for a look at the weather with Helen Willetts. Hello there. A turbulent weekend of weather. It's been windy, we've had hill snow through Saturday morning. The afternoon brings further snow showers to the hills, rain and snow to the north, but fewer showers, more sunshine and an easing in the wind for southern areas, so some good spells of sunshine. But this is waiting in the wings, and this is going to give us a headache. One weather system approaching from the south, and later one from the west, so although it will feel relatively pleasant out and about in the south this afternoon, a very different complexion to the weather will take place through the night. This comes north, bumping into the cold air, so potentially giving us some more hill snow, and as it joins forces with this next weather system coming in from the West, which will give more significant snow, the potential is also there for it to really whip up into a deep area of low pressure, potentially bringing some very windy weather, but significant snow, even a couple of centimetres at lower levels, but 10-15 centimetres over the hills in the north. Clearly a colder day for most of us and feeling so in that potentially very windy weather. Hello - this is BBC News, with Shaun Ley. The headlines: The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, is facing criticism after the death of the baby son of Shamima Begum - the British teenager whose citizenship he revoked for joining the Islamic State group. A man charged with murdering Jodie Chesney has been remanded in custody. The 17-year-old was stabbed to death in a park in East London last Friday. The Brexit Secretary accuses Michel Barnier of trying \"to rerun old arguments\" - as talks continue between the UK and EU.

I mean they say they are dealing with this agenda. They have got a waste consultation which has just closed. In that waste consultation they have said that they will consider an extended producer responsibility and they've given a menu of five different things. </p><p>So textiles are in there, vying for attention with tyres, with furniture, with mattresses and carpets. What we are saying is it is not a choice of one of the other, it is all of them. They are also saying that they will do a couple of them by 2025. We have got scientists saying we've got 11 years to tackle devastating climate change. We need to get on with this. So, Lynn, in your view, what is the thing that shoppers should be doing? We know that a lot of people watching this programme this morning are the people, you know, in the frame, in terms of throwing away clothes. We all occasionally to that. What should we be doing that instead? And I'm guilty of having far too many clothes at home. So, firstly, it's don't just throw them away. Like, recycle them, give them to the local charity shop in your village. We've got a small charity shop where I live and the clothes go there, or to my local school or to people that are... Not necessarily the bags that come through your letterbox, because I never trust them. Or give it to somebody you know. I buy stuff from H&amp;M and I know H&amp;M are working hard to become more environmental. I know they are not perfect yet but they have taken steps. You can take a bag of clothes in to H&amp;M and they will give you some money off your shop. So it is a small step but it's in the right direction. So it is looking, Mary, do you agree, it is looking like best practice among the fashion retailers? We had a list of leaders and laggards which is on the environmental audit committee's website and you can go on there and see Tesco's are doing good things, so is Primark actually. So is ASOS. And some of those companies have been caught up in big scandals like the Rana Plaza scandal, so they have had to make those changes. The Bangladesh factory collapse. The big factory collapse where 1100 workers were killed making clothes to our high street. So that is the real cost there. But the laggards really are the online brands, the Boohoos, TK Maxx and Amazon. Not only does Amazon not pay its taxes, they don't have any sort of sustainably policies at all. And that is really difficult and damaging for the environment. So go and demand more from your clothing retailers. What we really feel though is that without the government regulating and saying you have, if you want to have permission to operate in this country, you've got to be tackling these big issues. And if you're not, you cannot really do business in this country. And modern slavery, they are all meant to have a statement on their website saying what they have done to tackle slavery in the supply chain. We have found big brands like FootLocker, Geox, Valentino - luxury brands - simply not doing anything about it. In a moment we'll have all the business news, but first the headlines on BBC News. A second ballot takes place this afternoon in the Conservative Party leader contest. Two teenage neo-Nazis who encouraged an attack on Prince Harry for marrying a woman of mixed race are jailed for encouraging terrorism. MPs are calling for the government to end the era of throwaway clothes and bad working conditions in the fashion supply chain. They say its important that the fashion industry changes its ways. Allied Bakeries - which makes Kingsmill bread - is halting production at its site in Cardiff. 180 jobs are at risk. The company wants to move its bread production operations to \"larger facilities\". Middle-aged people are increasingly being used as \"money mules\" to launder money through their bank accounts according to the fraud prevention service Cifas. More than 40,000 cases \"bore the hallmarks\" of money mule activity last year. The biggest increase was in people aged 45 to 60. Facebook plans to launch a new digital currency, called Libra, next year. It'll allow payments via its own apps or through WhatsApp. The company says it wants to make sending money as easy as sending a text. It's the latest big tech firm to get into payment services. Zoe Klienman is our Technology Reporter. Hello. Why are Facebook doing this now? Facebook has tried to get into payments in the past and has had limited success. What it is recognising no it has such a big ecosystem and it wants to keep people on those platforms as long as possible.

That's a question that the BBC's 100 A team of female academics and tech experts have been brought together and find solutions to gender by the BBC in Silicon Valley to try inequality in the workplace. They've got until Friday before they have to reveal a prototype. Nuala McGovern reports. Every year, the BBC's 100 Women series celebrates the stories of women around the world. This year, we are doing something a little bit different. Over the next month, we are challenging teams of women from across the world to find solutions to some of our biggest problems - gender inequality in sport, illiteracy and sexual harassment on public transportation. the first challenge But we're starting here - to tackle in Silicon Valley?

The tech giants are facing a new system of regulation under government plans to clamp down on harmful content online. It's partly in response to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017. But her father says that far more needs to be done. I think the white paper is an important step to making the Internet a safe place. </p><p>The era of self-regulation has not worked. We'll be hearing more from Molly's father Ian and we'll be looking at the government's proposals. The other main stories on BBC News at 5. Senior Conservative MPs meet Theresa May in Downing Street as she prepares for Brexit talks in France and Germany tomorrow and a crucial summit on Wednesday. A new pollution charge begins in London - drivers of older, dirtier vehicles are paying more to drive in the centre of the capital. And in India - voters are preparing to head to the polls in three days' time for what will be the biggest democratic exercise in the world. It's 5 o'clock - our top story is that social media companies are facing a new system of official regulation - under plans announced by the government. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has proposed an independent watchdog - that would write a 'code of practice' for tech companies. Senior managers could be held liable for breaches - and internet sites could be fined or blocked - if they failed to tackle 'online harms' - such as terrorist propaganda and child abuse. But some critics say the plans threaten freedom of speech. A public consultation on the plans will run for 12 weeks. Our media editor Amol Rajan has more details. Over the past few years, the tech giants have come under sustained pressure to clean up their act. Terrorist propaganda such as the live broadcast of a recent attack in New Zealand have caused horror. So, too, have stories about child grooming online, and the appalling death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after seeing images of self-harm on Instagram - which is owned by Facebook - prompted an outcry. The actress and campaigner Domenique Fragale lost her friend when she killed herself after being bullied online. She thinks this white paper should have come sooner. A lot of messages were being sent to her, and they were encouraging her to kill herself, actually. And because of that, I wish I'd known. I wish she could speak out to me or she could actually contact the platforms and say, you know, this is happening. Help me. What do I do? This long-delayed white paper is broad in scope and bold in its recommendations. For the first time, oversight of the internet will be entrusted to a regulator. A statutory duty of care to protect users will be enforced. And there is a potential for heavy fines to be administered. But many details remain unclear, which is why there's now a 12-week consultation. Too many social media firms still seem to think that they can get away with providing the service without providing the protection for users, that anyone who challenges them must be some kind of Luddite who just doesn't understand the modern world, that a little progress here and there is acceptable while countless people, their lives are being destroyed. Enough. Internet companies have taken huge steps to protect people from harmful content online, and they want to do more of that. They are investing in systems to take down content and investing in teams to scan for content and remove harmful images. The next stage is getting to a regulatory regime with the government to help companies do that. The government hasn't yet decided whether it will set up a new regulator or entrust this work to an existing watchdog, such as Ofcom. Children's charities want tough penalties. Now is the time to act, and the UK has an opportunity now. If we see statutory regulation, that will be the UK going further and faster than any other country in the world to tackle online harms. That can only be a good thing, and that will fundamentally ensure that we can see really a game changer in terms of protections for children. The new rules would apply to any company that allows people to share or discover user-generated content, or to interact with others. While Facebook welcomes the proposals in principle, they say any new rules must protect innovation and freedom of speech. Critics say applying the same rules to companies of such varying size will favour those few companies that can afford staff to oversee compliance, so entrenching the power of big tech.
