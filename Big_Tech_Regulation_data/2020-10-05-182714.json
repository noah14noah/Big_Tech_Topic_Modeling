Now, Congress has taken up the issue with a proposed draft[2] of a new bipartisan, bicameral bill, and the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property (under the Senate's Committee on the Judiciary) recently completed three days of hearings. Sen. Thom Tillis has already stated that based on the testimony, he realizes revisions will need to be crafted to address issues with the new definition of 'utility,' to reconsider the proposed amendment to  112(f), to consider an appropriate enhancement of exemptions for experimental use and research, and to clarify that the legislation is not intended to promote patenting of human genes.The range of commentary from the hearing's 45 witnesses largely matched that provided in response to the USPTO Guidance. </p><p>In addition, however, the witnesses collectively provided a breadth and depth of thinking that should be extremely helpful as the subcommittee considers what to do next. Provided below is a summary of the written testimony that each witness brought to the hearings. Though the summary is somewhat lengthy, reviewing the various perspectives really helps one understand why the balancing of interests involved in this fundamental issue of patent law is so important. I also hope that the summary below may be a useful shortcut for stakeholders to find testimony relevant to issues they may want to focus on.Before presenting the summaries, it seems warranted to note one sentiment shared by most of the witnesses: their appreciation that the subcommittee invited so many voices to be heard. Only a few witnesses found that the group invited to testify was either skewed or otherwise too limited. Given that, my summary below only indicates those who saw problems with the group that was invited to testify.Part I: June 4 TestimonyIn the first day of the hearings, the subcommittee heard from former Federal Circuit Chief Judge Paul Michel, two former USPTO directors and a number of academics, think-tank specialists and other experts.Judge Michel proved to be a strong proponent of the draft, stating that, 'recent changes to patent case law have produced unending chaos.' He painted himself both as a patent judge and 'as one completely unhindered by any economic affiliations or interests,' asserting that this allowed him to 'be as objective as humanly possible.' Judge Michel stated that 'the courts alone created this problem,' and expressed concern that if he could not follow what he characterized as the unclear and inconsistent case law, how could patent examiners, trial judges, inventors and investors predict outcomes. Michel argued that 'national innovation policy \u2014 of which patent eligibility is an integral part \u2014 should not be made by the Supreme Court. It should be made by Congress.' After detailing the Supreme Court jurisprudence from Bilski to Alice and Mayo, he repeated that: 'The Constitution empowers Congress to secure exclusive rights in inventions and discoveries to their creators. Nothing I see in Article III empowers the court to contravene the statutory scheme or to make economic and innovation policy for your huge, diverse and complex nation.'Judge Michel concluded his testimony with two recommendations for the draft: one to delete its reference to 'in any field of technology' and the other to delete the alteration proposed to  112(f).Former USPTO Director Q. Todd Dickinson followed, asserting that he too was unbiased with 'clients on many sides of the question presented by this hearing.' He too referenced the recent Supreme Court decisions (Bilski, Alice, Mayo, Myriad) and said that he has joined the call of major neutral stakeholder organizations and judges of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for legislative reform, saying that hope has faded that, for example, 'the CAFC and the USPTO would be able to interpret and clarify Alice.' One paragraph of Director Dickinson's testimony is particularly pointed:'You will undoubtedly hear from organizations which prefer the status quo. Most of them will likely say that the Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence, particularly the Alice/Mayo framework, is a positive thing. The ambiguity, difficulty in interpretation, and challenges to consistent application by the USPTO and the courts, have led to a significant increase in patent invalidation, and a significant difficulty in getting patents in a variety of technologies through the USPTO. These entities apparently feel that this is a positive thing, in the sense that it gives them what several have referred to as 'a new tool' to invalidate patents which they believe may interfere with business models. This is cynical and short-sighted.'He likewise addressed the troll problem, saying that, 'we can consider other solutions, targeted more specifically at the problem, rather than using the expensive elephant gun of invalidation under section 101.'He walked through an extensive and detailed background of statutory and case law history from the 1793 Patent Act to the present, providing contextual history at the same time (e.g., discussing the dot-com boom and the rise of patent assertion entities). He concluded that while the recent USPTO Guidance is 'an excellent step in the right direction of providing clarification and direction, this Guidance obviously has its limitations. Specifically, the USPTO is still interpreting a flawed and confusing jurisprudence and analytic frameworks.'Director Dickinson finished his remarks with his explanation for why he believes now is the right time to address this question via legislative action, as well as his own views on specific provisions in the draft that warrant close attention (including, like Judge Michel, concern about the word 'technology,' stating that, 'It would be important to clarify the metes and bounds of this important word perhaps in the legislative history, if not the statute.')Former USPTO Director David Kappos, now a partner of Cravath, Swaine ...ore, came next. He did not mince words:'Our current patent eligibility law truly is a mess. The Supreme Court, Federal Circuit, district courts, and USPTO are all spinning their wheels on decisions that are irreconcilable, incoherent, and against our national interest.'Director Kappos pointed to U.S. competitiveness with respect to China and Europe, as well as the risk of undermining investment in technologies critical to national security such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, as important drivers for addressing the 'irreconcilable mess of 101.' Unlike Judge Michel, he suggested that  112 did warrant further strengthening to protect against assertion of vague or overbroad patents.After Director Kappos came the first testimony critical of the draft legislation, from Charles Duan, director of technology and innovation policy at the R Street Institute, an organization that 'engages in policy research and educational outreach to promote free markets as well as limited yet effective government.' Duan, who was previously a patent attorney with Knobbe, Martens, Olson ...ar, stated he was 'strongly concerned about the direction of the present legislative effort.' He brought forward two lines of concern, substantive and procedural, and asserted that 'the draft legislation would do harm to economic and social interests of great importance to the American people.' While he acknowledged concerns with patenting software, he left the details on that issue for the Electronic Frontier Foundation to address (see below). His focus was on access to medicines and scientific research.On the process side, Duan asserted that the draft legislation was the result of 'five closed-door roundtables with a hand-picked list of invitees weighted toward patent professionals and industry.' He said that 'the present effort - one born of an incomplete stakeholder process and one that would throw out two centuries of law, including legal results strongly supported by American consumers and American researchers - is not the right approach.'Turning to the substance, he foresaw negative impacts on cost, quality and availability of American healthcare. He warned that the draft legislation would lead to 'the practice of 'evergreening,' in which a drug company obtains a patent on a minor modification to a known drug compound, often years after the initial patent application on the drug was filed.' He further argued that patents on natural laws and products would reduce development of lifesaving tests and treatments. A third problem he asserted is that patents on genes and diagnostics would prevent patients from obtaining second opinions.More generally, Duan argued that research scientists view patents as detrimental to their work, and pointed particularly to negative impacts from gene patents. He concluded by returning to his process complaint - that many concerned stakeholders have not been included in the Congressional discussions regarding the legislation.Next heard was Professor Jeffrey Lefstin of the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. He primarily wanted to draw attention to a slightly different issue. He argued that the Supreme Court decisions, and particularly Mayo, have lost track of the longstanding protection Congress has provided not only for patents on inventions, but on discoveries as well. He argued that the Supreme Court has misread history in a manner that 'rests only on an intuitive judgment that some patents may pre-empt more progress than they will promote.' While his testimony did somewhat support the draft legislation, it primarily warned that whatever is done, attention should be paid to stopping the courts from continuing to ignore patents on discoveries.Following Professor Lefstin was Robert Armitage, an IP consultant. Armitage's testimony was highly detailed, weighing in at 47 heavily footnoted pages summarized by the assertion that: 'The state of patent eligibility law in the United States is tragically bad.' He characterized the draft legislation as having 'enormous merit' but nonetheless offered 'a set of clarifying modifications.' He asserted that 'the definition of the limitations on patenting would ideally be addressed through legal principles that are transparent, objective, predictable, and simple in their application.' (emphasis original.) And he identified the three 'essential principles' of such limits as tangibility, proportionality and inventiveness, each of which he espoused in considerable detail.SMU Dedman School of Law Professor David Taylor provided an even more detailed treatment \u2014 some 72 pages worth \u2014 likewise bemoaning the current two-part eligibility test as 'gobbledygook.' He suggested that 'four basic principles should guide any legislative effort to correct patent eligibility law: broad eligibility, clarity, constraint on judicial intervention, and flexibility.' Based on those principles, he stated, 'While I support the thrust of the proposal in its current form \u2014 it certainly improves eligibility law over where it stands today \u2014 I do have some concerns and suggestions.' His support of the proposal was primarily in its elimination of the current two-part test, and his concerns had to do with defining what is 'practical' and what is a 'field of technology,' as well as with potential unintended consequences of changing the law of functional claiming. He provided detailed treatment of these issues, which Congress may end up finding quite helpful in striking stakeholder balances in these portions of the draft bill.Sherry Knowles of Knowles Intellectual Property Strategies (formerly of GlaxoSmithKline) began her testimony with the following message:'What is at stake in this focus on patent eligibility in the United States is not just righting the ship on patent eligible subject matter, it is sending a clear message to the Supreme Court that it must not, and can never, alter the sense and meaning of federal legislation through judicial exceptions to federal statutes and/or conscious disregard for their literal wording and meaning. Congress has the sole right to create federal legislation under the U.S. Constitution, and the American people have the right to demand that it be applied as written.'Her comments went on to assert a constitutional basis for broad patent protection:'Opponents argue that if isolated natural products are patent eligible subject matter (as required by statute), then other companies or universities cannot enter that market until the patent expires. This is absolutely true. And the Constitution itself, going back to 1787, embeds this principle as the core means to motivate inventions and discoveries. Our founding fathers knew that our country's success depends on the ability to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing for limited time the exclusive right to discoveries. If opponents disagree with this, they will have to amend the constitution. Absent that, this framework stays as the highest law of our land.'In addition to discussing the current case law, based on her law review article, 'Unconstitutional Application of 35 U.S.C. 101 by the U.S. Supreme Court' (included in full with her written testimony), she urged support for the draft bill not only based on the legal analysis, but also on her assertion that R...n isolated natural products as medicines declined 'after Myriad and will continue to stall until Myriad is abrogated.' She concluded in a highly personal manner stating that, as a breast cancer survivor saved by a nature-based antibiotic, 'If Mayo/Myriad had been the law years ago, I would not be giving testimony to the subcommittee because I almost certainly would have died.'Alex Moss of the Electronic Frontier Foundation followed with a very different outlook. She focused on the fact that  101 has 'remained virtually intact since the Patent Act of 1793' and that any changes to the section 'should come with a heavy burden' to ensure that the limits provided by current  101 are not undermined. In a portion of her testimony headed as, 'Section 101's Protections are Crucial for Ensuring the Patent System Promotes More Innovation than It Deters,' she asserted:'The state of patent-eligibility is better than ever for software startups, small businesses, technology developers, and end users \u2014 or at least better than it has been since the 1990s when the Federal Circuit gave a green light to patents on basic business methods implemented on generic computers in its State Street Bank and Trust. v. Signature Financial Management decision. That led to a glut of broad software patents and a dearth of prior art \u2014 i.e., material that can be used to invalidate patents under other sections of the Patent Act (specifically,  102 and 103), which typically consist of printed publications, including issued patents and patent applications.'She asserted that, 'the Alice decision has only boosted our nation's global lead in the software and information, communications, and telecommunications ('ICT') industries.' In contrast, she warned that the current draft would benefit patent trolls and large patent holders while harming small businesses, technology developers and users. As a first example, she pointed to U.S. Army veteran Justus Decher, who after having his own heart bypass surgery was inspired to design a medical monitoring system. He was threatened by a patent troll, but the patent was found ineligible by a court based on Alice.A second example is that of Ruth Taylor, a professional photographer who too was threatened by a patent holder. In this case, EFF stepped in to provide pro bono representation and the patent owner dropped the lawsuit a few days before EFF's Alice-based motion to dismiss.In addition to urging that Congress reconsider patentability of software, which Moss said was 'a uniquely bad fit for patent protection,' she suggested that Congress further consider allowing technology users and consumers to stay suits during parallel litigation, provide automatic fee-shifting against plaintiffs for objectively baseless suits, require transparency in litigation regarding a patent's ownership, assignment, and licensing documents, require underlying assignment agreements to be recorded in the PTO, and 'make methods of organizing human activity ineligible for patent protection.'Professor Mark Lemley of Stanford Law School agreed with the other academics that, 'the law of patentable subject matter is a mess.' However, he cautioned that Congress should not do something that would merely end up creating more uncertainty. He found that the draft bill 'offers some promising approaches, but also presents some risks depending on how courts interpret the bill.' He observed that 'the current 101 rules are bad for life sciences but might be good for software innovation,' arguing that in contrast to life sciences, patents are much less central to innovation in the software industry. That, coupled with suits by patent trolls, have resulted in a situation in which Alice (along with the availability of IPRs) has beneficially allowed defendants to 'weed out weak patent claims more quickly and cheaply than before.'That said, he observed that the Federal Circuit's application of the law has been 'inconsistent and uncertain.' His concern with the proposed solution was largely in its breadth, which does not focus on the identified problems. 'A narrower bill focused on those issues would likely have a broader consensus behind it, would not eliminate two hundred years of legal doctrine, and would not risk encouraging patent abuse.' In one particular area, he pointed to a 2012 paper[3] he wrote urging limits on functional claiming.Michael Rosen, adjunct fellow of the American Enterprise Institute, categorized three main elements as being central: clarity/certainty, compartmentalization and preemption. He was of the position that ever since Mayo/Alice, 'it is not exaggeration to say that patent practice has been thrown into tumult.' He rhetorically questioned whether the benefits of purging bad patent claims from the system have outweighed the costs of doing so. He characterized the specific defined categories of exclusion in an early version of the draft bill as 'a good start,' though he would add 'natural phenomena' to the list as well as provide concrete but non-limiting examples for each category to help with interpretation. Regarding compartmentalization, he suggested ensuring that 102, 103 and 112 inquiries 'remain independent of eligibility.' On preemption, he urged rejection 'of only those claims the would preempt every use of an abstract idea, natural law, or natural phenomenon' (emphasis original). As a parting thought, he cited the 12th century philosopher Maimonides who 'cautioned against veering too far in any direction but instead embrace moderation' in order to 'adopt a middle way that ensures balance in our patent system.'Professor Paul Gugliuzza of Boston University School of Law strongly defended the 'Supreme Court's reinvigoration of the patent-eligible subject matter requirement.' While he admitted that the requirement is imperfect, he said that it 'plays a crucial role in reducing litigation costs by giving courts a mechanism to quickly dismiss infringement claims that plainly lack merit.' He attached his detailed Texas Law Review article as his basis for asserting: 'I see the primary benefit of an invigorated eligibility doctrine in how it affects the process of patent litigation.' (emphasis original.)Professor Joshua Sarnoff of DePaul University College of Law made nine distinct points, at least seven of which militated against the draft bill. In his view, current uncertainty does not justify eliminating 'existing protection for the public domain of scientific, natural, and fundamental discoveries.' He asserts that:'Propertizing this public domain with utility patents is: (a ) bad utilitarian innovation policy; (b) likely unconstitutional; (c) contrary to the human right of access to science and its applications; (d) immoral, by taking away the public's rights and requiring the public to unjustly enrich patent applicants; and (e) a religious sin against God.'In any event, he argues that the proposals do not address the 'root causes of the doctrinal uncertainty.' Further, they would not harmonize U.S. law with that of other countries. They would 'increase uncertainty in and costs of the patent system' and expand it to 'aesthetic and other forms of non-technological creativity.' In his view, the new legislation would be unconstitutional as well. Finally, attempts at clearly defining the new terms in the draft bill 'will prove at least as difficult as addressing directly the requisite kind of eligible creativity through Section 101's eligible novelty doctrine.'The two additional points he made were that current judicial treatment of ineligible novel discoveries is good innovation and moral policy, and that if Congress nonetheless proceeds, it should 'provide as much clarity as humanly possible,' protect the public domain, expressly prohibit consideration of preemption outside of  112 and explicitly abrogate judicial precedents inconsistent with the new language.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, represented by Patrick Kilbride, presented its International IP Index, highlighting notes from 2014 to the present and drawing the following observation:'While the U.S. maintains the highest-rated overall IP system in the world as measured by the Index, it is not perfect. Restrictive patentability standards, excessive litigation burdens, and legal uncertainty regarding the durability of rights, have dampened the economic incentive for long-term, capital-intensive, and high-risk research and development in cutting-edge sectors.'Professor Adam Mossoff of Scalia Law School, the final witness on this first day, argued that the Alice-Mayo framework 'is undermining the longstanding comparative advantage by the U.S. in the world in securing reliable and effective patent rights for all innovators' and that it 'has called into question the longstanding U.S. claim to a 'gold standard' patent system as compared to the rest of the world.' He presented detailed data regarding PTO allowance rates under the Alice-Mayoframework and concluded:'These high rates of rejections of patent applications are not merely a departure from historical U.S. practices. They also signal that the U.S. has closed its patent system as compared to China and Europe.'Citing the Bilski Blog summary[4] of comments submitted to the USPTO on its new eligibility guidelines, he emphasized that 'Director Iancu lacks the legal authority to change the fundamental cause of the problem: the Alice-Mayo framework created by the U.S. Supreme Court,' and that some comments argued that the guidelines are contrary to law.Professor Mossoff observed that what Congress is looking to do here with  101 is similar to what it did in the 1952 Patent Act with  103, when Supreme Court case law had begun to call for a 'flash of creative genius,' a standard that proved 'an insuperable hurdle for inventors to overcome.'Part II: June 5 TestimonyThe American Intellectual Property Law Association's President-Elect Barbara Fiacco provided AIPLA's testimony. She reported that 'AIPLA conceptually supports' the draft bill, but has some concerns with parts of it. She characterized the bill as 'a serious and impressive step toward untangling the Gordian Knot that the Supreme Court's patent eligibility decisions have become' and in particular praised the bill for 'adher[ing] to the hallmarks of the 1952 Patent Act, a framework that has nurtured an unprecedented wave of innovation by American industry over the past 57 years.' The areas of concern mainly had to do with the definition of terms, specifically 'useful,' 'in any field of technology' and 'through human intervention.' Each, she asserted, needed further consideration with respect to unintended consequences and flexibility. She raised similar concerns with the proposed amendment to  112.The ABA's testimony was delivered by Scott Partridge, immediate past chair of the ABA Section of Intellectual Property Law. He characterized the draft bill as 'a simple and elegant solution to the current unworkable and detrimental state of section 101 jurisprudence.' He characterized the admonition that 101 be 'construed in favor of eligibility' as a 'key provision' of the draft.The Intellectual Property Owners Association, via its President Henry Hadad (of Bristol-Myers Squibb), noted its support of the effort to clarify  101, even though it has not yet taken an official position on the May 22 proposed legislative text. He provided examples of cases demonstrating the uncertainty that now exists in this area, adding that, 'the Supreme Court seems unlikely to reconsider this issue anytime soon.' Regarding the specific changes proposed to  100 and 112, he said that IPO will continue to study those elements.David Jones, executive director of the High Tech Inventors Alliance (identifying in a footnote its members as including Adobe, Amazon, Cisco, Dell, Google, Intel, Oracle and Salesforce ), expressed a starkly different viewpoint regarding amendment of  101 to overrule the Supreme Court's eligibility test. 'We oppose such an amendment and firmly believe that both the court's historical precedents and the traditional limitations on statutory subject matter should be retained.' He disputed that the current framework is unworkable, excessively unpredictable or harmful to U.S. innovation. 'To the contrary, the current test has improved patent clarity, has decreased spurious litigation, and has furthered the patent system's core purpose of promoting technological innovation.' HTIA urged that any legislative approach 'should be narrowly-tailored to specific, demonstrated problems' and lodged 'strong objections to making wholesale changes to section 101 that would abandon traditional limitations on statutory subject matter and fundamentally alter not just the legal test for determining eligibility but also the broad underlying principles that are used to define what types of subject matter may be patented.' HTIA's 'most fundamental objections' were summarized under the following headings:'First, the draft would effectively erase existing barriers to patenting non-technological subject matter by overruling the current eligibility test and abrogating the judicial prohibition against patenting abstract ideas.''Second, no compelling case has been presented for making statutory changes of this magnitude or abrogating the entirety of the case law relating to such a fundamental and longstanding doctrine.''Third, the draft bill fails to include changes to sections 103 and 112 that are necessary to address the problems and gaps in the law that would result from the proposed amendments to section 101.'Jones provided a detailed discussion of the HTIA position on each of these points, followed by feedback on the proposed statutory definition of 'useful,' removal of the word 'new' in  101, the proposed amendment to  112(f) (which was well-received) and additional provisions.Stephanie Martz provided testimony on behalf of United for Patent Reform, a coalition of American businesses. 'Collectively, our members represent over 80 million U.S. employees, a figure that accounts for nearly two-thirds of private sector jobs in the U.S.' UFPR expressed concern that 'the proposal would reopen the floodgates for abusive litigation by non-practicing entities and discourage job creation without incentivizing innovation.' She detailed the prevalence of NPEs and their impact on businesses, as well as explaining that:'Insofar as the situation has improved in the past three years, it is due partly to the AIA. However, the decrease in NPE litigation rates is also due in very large part to the Alice decision.'She stated that the proposed legislation would lead to uncertainty and litigation \u2014 the opposite of its stated goal. She asserted that: 'No clear and concrete evidence of harm that could justify the complete upending of decades of settled law has been offered, only anecdotal complaints.'US Inventor Inc., an organization of '13,000 citizen activists,' was represented by Paul Morinville. He said: 'Today, patents are useless to the very entities the patent system was created to help inventors and patent-based startups' (ellipses original). He argued that changes over the past 15 years 'have virtually all gone on the direction of harming small inventors and startups making our patents undefendable.' An initial concern he expressed was with how little opportunity inventors themselves had to explain their positions:'Of the changes made in the last 15 years, three are the most violent to the rights of inventors and startups: The America Invents Act created the Patent Trial and Appeal Board , which invalidates 84% of challenged patents; eBay v MercExchange effectively eliminated injunctive relief; and the subject of this hearing, Alice v CLS Bank let loose a demon called the 'abstract idea' that has no definition and is invalidating 67% of challenged patents.'But many multinational corporations are testifying as themselves and testifying through proxies of their lobbying organizations US Inventor represents inventors inventing technology to compete with these big tech monopolies, yet we combined have only one voice and only five minutes of oral testimony for all of us. The big tech monopoly has more than 100 minutes via direct and proxy testimony before this subcommittee, at least 20 times that of US inventors' five minutes.'He bemoaned pejorative terms such as 'patent troll' and 'bad patents' as being used in furtherance of 'false political narratives' and went into some detail regarding each. He contrasted the situation in the U.S. with that in China, which he said is continuing to strengthen its patent system.The US Inventor position regarding the proposed new legislation is that it 'does little to improve the crashed patent system. Instead, it passes the confusion created under 101 to 100 and 112 leaving the patent system in disarray.' This testimony concluded by asserting: 'What an embarrassment. China is laughing.'Philip Johnson appeared next in his capacity as chair of the Steering Committee for 21st Century Patent Reform ('21C'), a coalition of manufacturers including 3M, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, General Electric, Johnson ...hnson, Procter ...mble and United Technologies. He said that 21C is strongly supportive of steps based on the proposed legislation, with a caveat that the 112(f) amendment proposal 'is not necessarily part of the solution to our current patent eligibility problem' but deserves further study as a 'patentability' provision (all emphasis original). In addition to detailing the 'Traditional Role of Section 101' and the 'Origin of the Current Patent Eligibility Problem,' this testimony walked through the proposed statutory language and contrasted the 21C position with that given by other witnesses. For example:'A practical effect of these clarifications will be to ensure that naturally occurring materials and compositions as they exist in nature, including human genes, will remain patent ineligible. In particular, and in contrast to the assertions of the ACLU and others, the proposal would not 'authorize patenting products and laws of nature, abstract ideas, and other general fields of knowledge,' nor would it 'permit patenting of human genes and naturally-occurring associations between genes and diseases.' These would remain patent ineligible because they are not 'inventions or discoveries,' did not result from ' human intervention,' and do not have ' specific and practical utility in any field of technology.''William Jenks testified on behalf of the Internet Association, described as 'the unified voice of the internet economy, representing the interests of America's leading internet companies and their global community of users.' The IA position was straightforward: 'Here, the proposed change to patent-eligibility law is unnecessary and will likely do more harm than good.' After detailing its view of why there is no crisis in the law in this area, Jenks warned that the proposed changes to  101 would both bring uncertainty and render eligible claims such as those in Alice and Bilski. He also stated that  112 could be made more clear simply by stating that it is 'intended to apply to all functional claim limitations, not just those functional limitations devoid of structure.'The Software and Information Industry Association, via Christopher Mohr, asserted that its membership both relies on patents and depends on the ability to operate 'free from improper assertions of exclusive rights.' In SIIA's view, Alice was 'a natural and beneficial evolution of the patent law that helpfully illuminates the bounds of patentable subject matter for computer-implemented inventions.' Accordingly, the SIIA testimony opposed the draft legislation. Mohr stated that no need has been shown for such a sweeping change and that the proposal's 'simplicity of language belies the complexities and harms that await when its language is applied.' While SIIA noted appreciation at the clarifying changes proposed for  112(f) it said that the language essentially only codified existing case law and 'is insufficient to overcome SIIA's concerns that the discussion draft's approach will lead to recurrence of overbroad business method patents that plagued the patent system and the courts before the Alice decision came down.'The Innovation Alliance, another coalition of technology companies with members including Dolby Laboratories and Qualcomm, provided its testimony via Jeff Birchak. He, too, reviewed the current Alice/Mayo framework, which he said 'has led to uncertainty, unpredictability and hindered innovation.' He cited two aspects as 'particularly problematic': claim dissection and conflation of subject matter eligibility with inventiveness. The Innovation Alliance found the draft bill to be 'a major positive step toward sensible reform' with respect to  101 but did express a 'note of caution' regarding potential unintended consequences that might be caused by the breadth of the proposed amendment to  112(f). The specific concern was that wide application of  112(f) would mean that 'an accused infringer only needs to make a minor change from the structure described in the specification to not infringe.'The Association for Accessible Medicines, the 'leading trade association for manufacturers and distributors of FDA-approved generic and biosimilar prescription medicines, was represented by its general counsel Jeffrey Francer. AAM said that it is 'deeply concerned' that the proposed legislation would result in higher drug prices and stifle innovation. AAM also expressed constitutional concerns, saying that the proposed legislation 'substantially removes material from the public domain' by allowing a patent 'on a DNA primer that is an exact copy of the gene' as it 'exists in nature.' AAM expressed a second constitutional concern that any proposed retroactive application of the new legislation with respect to finally adjudicated, invalid patents would violate the separation of powers. This testimony also detailed why AAM believes that  101 is 'critical' in facilitating pharmaceutical competition. AAM echoed many of the previously expressed concerns about the proposed statutory language, but added that the language provides a 'double presumption' of validity (i.e., the new 'construed in favor of eligibility' language on top of the existing  282 language saying that claims 'shall be presumed valid'). This double presumption would 'potentially create significant confusion about the precise showing required to invalidate a patent under section 101.'Hans Sauer of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization urged that 'uncertainty, drift, and creep in the law of substantive patentability \u2014 such as under  101 of the Patent Act \u2014 is highly relevant to the biotech business model.' He said that: 'The past nine years have seen an unprecedented expansion of common-law exceptions to patentability.' As a result, 'businesses must rationally assume that patents that are validly issued today can 'become' invalid over time, because creative new applications of judicial exceptions may lurk only an appellate decision or two in the future.' BIO argued that 'nothing could be worse for innovation' and highlighted two areas in particular as calling for protection: (1) preparations of naturally occurring or naturally-derived substances; and (2) methods of using drugs and other substances for therapy, diagnosis or prophylaxis. Sauer warned the subcommittee to be cautious in considering 'sweeping statements' and 'fears' that have been raised that are 'unfounded and difficult to understand given the current state of the legislative working draft.' BIO's testimony concluded with the following:'Two points should be made about opposition to this bipartisan effort. First, reform to section 101 should not be scuttled because some view the current state of the law as an expedient means to defend against infringement cases. Favoring quick means to invalidate broad swaths of patents ignores the collateral damage and unintended consequences of current jurisprudence. Second, the proposed legislation and whichever final form it takes should not be an invitation to relitigate the merits or demerits of the Supreme Court cases that gave rise to current systemic problems. To the extent that various groups have valid and substantiated concerns about the legislation, they should be invited to participate in the process with constructive proposals.'The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America likewise supported the legislation, beginning with a section entitled: 'The Importance of Providing Patent Protection to Foster Continued Medical Innovation.' Natalie Derzko, who provided the testimony, urged that 'the scope of Section 101 is intended to be broad and to encompass a wide range of inventions,' citing Thomas Jefferson's observation that 'ingenuity should receive a liberal encouragement' as well as various Supreme Court decisions. She asserted that 'the proposed legislation is a promising avenue for course-correcting patent subject matter eligibility in the United States,' emphasizing that it maintains the current statutory categories, guards against future judicial intervention and codifies, via the 'useful' definition, the current utility standard that 'has long served a gatekeeping function.' PhRMA further supported the 'technology neutrality' of the proposal as well as its 'human intervention' component.The Association of American Universities, represented by Rick Brandon, said that 'American research universities have a front row seat to the incentives provided by our patent system.' AAU expressed concern that: 'In the past several years, we have seen the incentive system break down in the case of medical diagnostic technologies due to the uncertainty around the patent eligibility of these technologies,' and accordingly indicated its support for the draft legislation. That said, Brandon noted some concerns about the terms used in the draft, such as what is meant by 'specific and practical,' 'field of technology' and 'through human intervention.' Still focusing on specific phrases, AAU proposed a number of subtle edits, such as changing 'limitation' to 'element' in  101 to better track the term used in  112, and questioned other terms, such as whether the language 'whoever invents or discovers' might warrant attention given that assignees are permitted to file and obtain patents. Raising such questions at this juncture seems a helpful step in minimizing the likelihood of unintended consequences that may result both from changing current statutory language and retaining language that may no longer be as appropriate as it was when originally drafted.Kate Ruane provided testimony on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union. She said that the effect of the proposed legislation 'will be to greatly expand what can be patented, opening the door to a world in which private parties could claim 20-year monopolies on, for example, human genes, associations between genes and diseases, naturally occurring associations or processes, or common abstract practices, like hedging risk, through clever drafting by patent lawyers.'As with AAM's testimony, the ACLU testimony said that this expansion 'would also trigger constitutional questions.' Ruane addressed a range of issues in her testimony, from reduced access to information about genetic risks to concerns that impacted groups have not been invited to testify, listing such groups as including the American Medical Association and AARP. A significant portion of Ruane's testimony focused on ACLU's concern that the draft legislation would allow patenting of human genes and the implications of that, but it also addressed other products of nature, abstract ideas and 'areas of general knowledge.' It advocated that attention be given to 'what should properly remain in the public commons for all to study and use,' urging that  102, 103, and 112 were insufficient to address this issue. A full section of the testimony was devoted to explaining why the ACLU believes that the draft bill would harm innovation. The testimony continued with a related and detailed discussion urging that both the patent clause in Article I of the Constitution as well as the First Amendment limit Congress's power to award patents, and finally by noting that 'important groups of stakeholders are missing from the groups invited to testify.'Part III: June 11 TestimonyManny Schecter provided testimony on behalf of IBM. While IBM noted that the current judicially imposed limits 'mitigate concerns some have about infringement assertions based on poor quality patents,' IBM asserted that 'application of a vague and unpredictable eligibility standard is not the correct way to address this problem.' Schecter said that 'the draft bill text accomplishes the key objectives of patent eligibility reform, including the primary goals of improving clarity and predictability in the law.' He explained IBM's position about why the 'abstract ideas' test is 'inherently ambiguous' saying that 'the identification of an 'abstract idea' is itself too abstract.' After detailing why IBM believes that a lack of strong and predictable patent protection undermines innovation, he emphasized the 'vital role' of Congress (rather than the courts) to set eligibility requirements and urged that issues with patent quality are best addressed by improvements to disclosure requirements, such as the proposed amendment to  112. IBM's support of the draft focused on its approach to starting anew, avoiding parsing and commingling (toward the goals of eliminating subjectiveness and improving clarity), and taking a balanced approach.Laurie Self provided testimony on behalf of Qualcomm, which she began by presenting a history of Qualcomm and then explaining the importance of 'strong, predictable patent rights' to Qualcomm's business. She presented the specific example of 5G wireless technologies. 'Qualcomm's difficulty obtaining certain 5G patents under section 101 illustrates our concerns with the state of the law.' She cited one example in which Qualcomm determined not to pursue an application further after several rounds of 101-related prosecution. 'Reliance on 5G networks for mission-critical services, autonomous vehicles, remote surgeries, military operations and countless other applications depends on technology that minimizes the risk of error in transmission of 5G signals. Yet on multiple occasions, section 101 jurisprudence has unreasonably delayed or defeated the grant of a patent on these essential features of 5G.' She extended the importance of this issue from 5G to national security. After detailing the current state of the law, she addressed the proposed legislative reform to  101, stating, 'we fully support those efforts.' Like other witnesses as summarized above, she was not as supportive of the proposed  112 changes, and like those others, focused on unintended consequences.Nokia's testimony was presented via Byron Holz. Nokia presented itself as having interests both as a patent licensor and a patent licensee and stated:'No patent system is perfect, and Nokia has seen its share of improper patent assertions directed against it. On balance, however, Nokia believes that recent changes in U.S. patent law \u2014 including in the area of subject matter eligibility \u2014 have tipped the scales too much against the interests of patent owners.'Holz acknowledged that so much attention had been given to the proposals relating to  101 already that he would focus on  112. He presented statistics showing that patent applicants had, due to 'additional risks placed upon section 112(f) claims,' dramatically declined in using means-plus-function claims (citing a drop from one-quarter of all claims in 2001 to barely over 5% in 2012). He argued that 'software innovation is often functional in nature,' and expressed concern that the existing challenges to software-related claims would be exacerbated by the proposed expanded application of  112(f). He argued that U.S. law in this area 'is atypical among the world's major patent systems, suggesting that application of section 112(f) is not needed to address concerns about overly broad claims.' He closed by repeating Nokia's support for the  101 reform.Kimberly Chotkowski of InterDigital, which she characterized as 'quite possibly, the only remaining for-profit research firm in the U.S. developing advanced technology for wireless communications,' contrasted InterDigital with firms that do R...n support of their existing product lines. Her testimony began with the statement that: 'The current state of the U.S. patent system does not accurately reflect the purpose and meaning of Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of the U.S. Constitution with respect to 'discoveries.''She argued that the current confusion 'has driven InterDigital to consider other jurisdictions and means of protection and enforcement for valuable technologies that are at risk under the current 35 USC  101 analysis. This is not by choice but by necessity as other nations' goals of technical supremacy in software and 5G, for example, continue marching ahead.'She explained that, in general, the proposed  101 amendments 'will allow InterDigital to continue investing and developing advanced technologies, not only bringing jobs and investment to Delaware and the rest of our U.S. operations, but also helping this great nation maintain its technical dominance.' On the specific amendments in the proposed legislation, she (like others as noted above) questioned whether terms such as 'useful' and 'specific and practical' might warrant attention and disfavored the proposed change to  112. But InterDigital suggested other subtle changes to the statutory language that prior witnesses had not. For example, Chotkowski explained that by changing 'may obtain a patent' to 'shall be entitled to a patent,' the addition of proposed  101(b) might be obviated.Sean Reilly of the Clearing House Payments Company, a former patent examiner, presented testimony that began under the heading, 'The Interest of the Financial Services Industry with Respect to Section 101.' He explained that this interest includes both robust protection as well as 'ensuring that low quality patents do not issue or are not otherwise available for use in abusive litigation.' He cautioned that amendment to  101 risks undoing progress recently made with respect to lawsuits based on 'dubious patents' and high dollar settlements resulting from the high cost of litigation. He urged a holistic approach to patent reform that keeps in mind 'the overall balance of the patent system.' One suggestion was for 'separate statutory provisions regarding abstract claims amendable to motion practice early in litigation and available as grounds of invalidity in post-grant reviews.' He also cautioned that  112 is 'an inadequate alternative to section 101 for dealing with abstract claims.'Laurie Hill testified on behalf of Genentech, stating that 'none of the work that Genentech has done and continues to do would be possible without strong patent protection.' Hill explained in some detail the investments needed for breakthroughs as well as the inevitable failures that are 'part of the process' to argue that patents are needed to justify such investments. She characterized current  101 law as a 'barrier' that has taken 'relatively unobjectionable' judicially created rejections and expanded them 'in a manner that lacks clarity and consistency.' She emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating that 'now is the time for Congress to correct Section 101.' She emphasized Genentech's support of several key elements of the draft while stating that 'we are continuing to review' the  112 amendment. She also stated: 'We would like to emphasize that Genentech does not and is not interested in patenting an individual's genes,' asserting that the human genome is already in the public domain and no longer eligible for patent.In a lengthy section entitled 'The Future of Medicine Brings the Science Closer to Nature,' she provided numerous examples of advances that 'are deliberately closer to nature or that harness natural processes such as the body's own immune response to treat or prevent disease.' She lamented that, 'unfortunately, under the current Section 101 regime, such medicines may not be patent-eligible subject matter.'Hill's final example was under the heading, 'The Future of Medicine Utilizes Artificial Intelligence.' Again, she argued that in this area there are 'patent eligibility challenges under the judge-made exceptions.' Her testimony concluded by recognizing the number of issues and stakeholders to be considered, but asserting that action on section 101 'is absolutely vital to the future of medicine.'Invitae, the genetic testing company, provided testimony via its CEO Sean George. George indicated at the start that he would be sharing 'why we believe the proposed changes you are considering will unintentionally stifle innovation and harm patient care.' His focus was on three issues: (1) how the 'golden age of precision medicine' has been 'ushered in' by Myriad/Alice/Mayo; (2) how the threat of patents in this area extends beyond simply patents on the genes themselves; and (3) any legislative approach should preserve 'what is currently beneficial to innovators, instead of indiscriminately sweeping away 150 years of case law.' He supported these three points with numerous statistics as well as specific examples, saying, 'We present the above as clear evidence of a 'vigorous and real-time' debate, hardly screaming out for immediate legislative intervention.'Gonzalo Merino of Regeneron had a sharply different view, stating that: 'The inability to obtain patent protection will disincentivize investment and collaboration, and limit the sharing of scientific information to the detriment of patients and the scientific community.' Merino stressed that he was not talking about patenting genes, but instead 'ground-breaking discoveries from our analysis of genetic data and the application of such for the benefit of patients.' He urged that the time for action is now, lest the U.S. lose 'its position as the global leader in biotech innovation.' His final point was that 'advances in genetics are as reliant on innovation in biotech as in hi-tech,' and he expressed a belief that the proposed legislation addresses both.Cleveland Clinic Innovations, represented by its Executive Director Peter O'Neill, used its litigation against True Health Diagnostics as a case study for why attention to this issue is so important. He related that one of its patents was issued in 2007, survived two reexamination challenges (most recently in 2011), but then found invalid in district court under Alice/Mayo in 2015, with unsuccessful attempts to change the result in the Federal Circuit and Supreme Court. In 2016, the USPTO provided updated guidance in this area, and Cleveland Clinic returned to the USPTO and in 2017 obtained additional patents on related laboratory methods. They again sued True Health Diagnostics, he recounted, but again the patents were found ineligible under  101, both at the district court and on appeal. He stated the uncertainty illustrated by this example 'has a very meaningful impact on our ability to develop and bring new advances to the market for use with patients and consumers.' While this testimony did not take a definite position on the draft legislation (indeed it urged that 'the committee should move with caution), it suggested the following three points: (1) give greater standing to guidance from the USPTO ('A patent issued by USPTO should represent the approval of the federal government that a product meets the standards of the federal statute, not the beginning of a protracted legal battle.'); (2) clarify the eligibility of life science and diagnostic products for Section 101 patents; and (3) protect the ability of genetic researchers to continue their work.David Spetzler of Caris Life Sciences also focused on the current uncertainty as deterring 'the substantial investment necessary to develop new healthcare technologies.' He too told the story of his organization, in this instance to underscore why Caris supports the proposed legislation.'We and others cannot continue to invest such time and resources into advancing personalized medicine, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs, if we are unable to recoup our investments because others copy our innovations. Under the current state of the law, competitors, both domestic and foreign, have been emboldened to copy our innovations, disregard patents and then challenge the validity of those patents in court.'He also directly addressed the concerns about 'gene patents' by stating that 'there are better ways to deal with one company's unpopular business practices than imposing limitations on patentable subject matter.'Michael Blankstein of Scientific Games was generally supportive of the draft, saying that: 'The bill would support good patents on breakthrough computer-implemented games but weed out bad patents on mere computerization of well-known business practices.' That said, Blankstein cautioned against use of the term 'technology' in the draft bill, instead suggesting 'a more open-ended approach that is industry neutral.' Without suggesting specific replacement language, he said 'SG believes any invention that provides practical and specific utility through human intervention should be eligible, regardless of industry or purpose.'Novartis provided its testimony via Corey Salsberg. Like some of the other witnesses, he expressed general support for the draft bill in concept, while suggesting that some aspects might call for 'further refinement' and noting that 'we are still assessing the proposed amendments to Section 112(f). He used specific examples of Novartis claims that ran afoul of  101 to support his statement that the judicially created exceptions 'have become so untethered from their sensible origins that we no longer know what they mean.' He worried about both the vagueness of the existing framework as well as what he called 'ineligibility creep' as ongoing problems, stating that, 'the potential consequences of this trajectory are alarming.' As some of the other witnesses had done, he included testimony disagreeing with the notion that the legislation 'would enable the patenting of genes in the body, other laws and products of nature, basic mental processes, or 'the facts of life.''Cyborg Inc., a company that develops data compression algorithms, said via its CEO Nicolas Dupont that, 'unfortunately, the existing system fails to address our needs adequately, leaving us and countless other small businesses feeling vulnerable and unprotected.' He detailed three main points: (1) rejection at the PTO, not only due to the cost implications for a small company, but also the 'publication of the rejected patent application for general public consumption); (2) fear of rejection leading to abandoning the patent system in favor of trade secrets (an approach that allows a foreign entity to file their own patents without fear that the Cyborg innovation will be citable prior art); and (3) general lack of confidence in the system. He cited Cyborg's decision to pull out of the wireless telecommunications sector as a specific example of how these issues play out. In addition to generally supporting the proposed legislation, he proposed 'adding software as a statutory category alongside the current list of process, machine, manufacture, and composition of matter.'Robert DeBerardine, Johnson ...hnson's chief IP counsel, strongly supported the proposed reform, quoting USPTO and judicial opinions to conclude that 'the time for legislative intervention is clearly at hand.' His testimony focused on the importance of predictability and, more generally, patents. The company-specific examples he used were primarily taken from the pharmaceutical side of the Johnson ...hnson business; he walked through the details of the R...nd regulatory phases and explained that 'upon expiration of the patent term, today's innovative drugs become the generic drugs of tomorrow.'Attorney John Vandenberg provided detailed comments supporting the following specific recommendations for any legislative reform efforts: 'Do not erase centuries of common law on this complex issue. Patenting the types of ideas the courts today consider 'abstract' will harm innovation, especially so when they are useful and innovative ideas.' 'Ask selected witnesses to submit language overturning Mayo, but not Alice or Myriad \u2014 even if they disagree with that approach. This will not be easy, but such a targeted question to this diverse group of experts might lead to a workable legislative solution that spurs innovation in personalized medicine, for example, without harming innovation in other areas.' 'Remember that some big U.S. patent holders are in China, and could use U.S. patents on useful and innovative mathematical algorithms, mental processes, and desired results, etc. \u2014 that they cannot patent today under Alice \u2014 to harm U.S. businesses and innovation.' 'Amend Sec. 112(f) as proposed, namely to remove unnecessary and confusing language, but make that amendment prospective only.' 'Also add to Sec. 112(f) this sentence: 'The Director shall identify each such claim element in the record of the patent.' This will promote both patent clarity and also fairness to inventors.'In addition, and not necessarily tied to the recommendations, he provided several pages of specific comments on a dozen portions of language in the proposed language in the bill, disagreeing with the majority and providing his reasons on each point. He did endorse the proposed amendment to  112(f), providing significant detail regarding so-called 'hollow' claims that recite 'a function or result without a particular way of accomplishing the function or result,' in comparison with what he called a 'how' claim that expressly includes such limitations in the claim or discloses them elsewhere in the patent. He discussed how courts have had difficulty with this area and said that the proposed amendment would 'induce patent drafters to expressly recite in the claims, where feasible, how the claim-related function or result is accomplished, leading to greater certainty as to scope and more innovation.'This summary of the 45 witnesses who appeared in three days of hearings this month is indeed lengthy, but to those who have reviewed this broad set of perspectives it gives good insight into the significant balancing that is required whenever IP legislation is proposed, and also highlights the difficulty in asserting what the 'right' answer is on these points. An additional, perhaps more important, takeaway is that these numerous divergent viewpoints show how important it is for there to be widespread study and discussion of the issues to help both advocates and lawmakers narrow in on a workable balance.

With Bernard Shaw in Washington and Susan Rook in Atlanta.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BERNARD SHAW, CNN HOST: Thanks for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We began with the United States economy still too early to declare the recession over, but signs today that it may be bottoming out and turning around. Retail sales up in May, new claims for unemployment benefits down a fourth straight week. The figures point to one conclusion, the American consumer, the driving force of the economy, is spending money again. Our business correspondent, Steve Young, reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">STEVE YOUNG, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: In one key sign the recession is ending, retail sales rose 1 percent in May. The third retail sales increased in the past four months. Apparel sales were especially strong because of good weather and momentum gained from the economic recovery.</p><p>ROBERT BARBERA, LEHMAN BROTHERS CHIEF ECONOMIST: The decline for consumers' spending on goods was deeper than any recession but one, 1974, '75. Consumers really did take a big step back. So their return really in February, March and a bit in May is welcomed but is certainly to be expected with that kind of sharp reversal.</p><p>YOUNG: But wholesale prices nudge up six tenth of a percent surprising most economists because it's the biggest gain in over seven months. The increases were sparked by energy price hikes of almost 2.5 percent, largely on gasoline price increases of more than 5 percent. Home heating oil and natural gas prices continue to decline. There was also a steep 4 percent jump in tobacco prices.</p><p>Financial markets have been reacting to the news with a decline in stock prices, that's because interest from bonds is becoming more competitive with returns from stocks. But if the recession bounce back, turns out to be weak, bond prices again will go up and yields will go down. The government cranks out another round of figures Friday on inflationary pressures at the retail, the consumer level.</p><p>Steve Young, CNN Business News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAW: And now the state of the American dream owning a home. Today, the federal government confirm what many Americans already know. Recession or not, it is getting harder and harder. In fact, the Census Bureau finds 57 percent of American households cannot afford a median priced home with a 30-year mortgage. 15 percent cannot afford even the least expensive home.</p><p>SUSAN ROOK, CNN HOST: The U.S. Supreme Court has again waived police powers against suspects' rights and come down on the side of police. The Court ruled Thursday that under certain circumstances, a criminal suspect may be questioned without his lawyer present. CNN's Anthony Collings has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANTHONY COLLINGS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: When police arrest a suspect, they must read him his Miranda rights. But a suspect's rights have limits, the Supreme Court says. A 63 rulings has a jailed suspect represented by a lawyer in one case may be questioned about another crime without the lawyer present. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia said that barring some police questioning of a suspect who would asked for a lawyer would seriously impede effective law enforcement. Conservative experts welcome the decision to give police more power.</p><p>ALAN SLOBODIN, WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION COUNSEL: It's a good thing. I think it's another development by the Supreme Court where they're recognizing realities of how the criminal justice system is swung too far in favor of criminal defendants.</p><p>COLLINGS: Liberal Justice John Paul Stevens in dissent accused the court majority of swinging too far the other way. He said today's decision is ominous because it reflects a preference for an inquisitorial system. The decision favoring police came coincidentally on the 25th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark Miranda decision. It required police to make sure that suspect's rights against self-incrimination are upheld. But the current conservative-dominated Supreme Court has issued a series of opinions limiting those rights.</p><p>Last March, in throwing out the murder conviction of an Arizona man, the Court ruled that while his confession was coerced illegally, some coerced confessions can still be admitted in evidence if there is enough other evidence to convict. The High Court this year also permitted suspects to be held for 48 hours without a warrant. It has expanded search powers of police and limited appeals by inmates of death row.</p><p>PAUL ROTHSTEIN, WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION: The Supreme Court has an approach these days which says that if there's any room in earlier decisions to go against the criminal defendant, we will seize that opportunity and go against the criminal defendant.</p><p>COLLINGS: In its latest ruling that a lawyer doesn't always have to be present during questioning, the Supreme Court says it is not weakening the Miranda rights of a suspect. Liberals don't agree but it is increasingly clear that in this court, the liberals no longer call the shots.</p><p>Anthony Collings, CNN, at the Supreme Court.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROOK: Still ahead on PRIME NEWS, some former hostages asked Congress to investigate a nagging question about the release of U.S. hostages held in Iran. (Inaudible) not just take lives, it takes jobs, friends. We'll show you how some people with the disease are coping. And talk about a historic document. Last summer it cost four dollars now, we'll show what a piece of history goes for these days. Stay tuned.</p><p>ROOK: One of the darkest periods in recent U.S. foreign policy, the Iran hostage crisis refuses to fade away. For 444 days, 52 Americans were held hostage in the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Their dramatic release occurred just moments after Ronald Reagan was sworn in as president in 1981. Now, several of the former hostages are calling on Congress to investigate allegations that their release was delayed for political reasons. CNN's Carl Rochelle has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARL ROCHELLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: While the world watched, 52 Americans counted the days they were held hostage by Iran. Now, more than 11 years later, eight of the 52 have written Congress asking for help. They want to know if there is any truth to reports that they were part of an arms deal with Iran, they kept them hostage until after the 1980 presidential election.</p><p>MOORHEAD KENNEDY, FORMER HOSTAGE: We are not concluding that something happened. We are simply saying that there is evidence that something might have happened of such a serious nature that it should be investigated right away.</p><p>BARRY ROSEN, FORMER HOSTAGE: It is not appropriate to say there is insufficient proof until there's been an official investigation. The question of whether there is evidence of any wrongdoing must be answered by an unbiased bipartisan congressional investigation with full subpoena power. Unless this happens, speculation and unanswered questions will erode public confidence in our electoral system.</p><p>ROCHELLE: Gary Sick, a former aide to President Carter focused attention on the question. He charge the Reagan campaign had made a deal with Iran to hold the hostages until after the election in return for military equipment. Sick said George Bush, then running for vice president may have gone to Paris to help arrange the deal. GARY SICK, FORMER CARTER AIDE: There really is no doubting at all in my mind that there were meetings between the Republican campaign and the Iranians in the course of the 1980 elections to discuss the question of the hostages.</p><p>ROCHELLE: Some Democrats have initiated their own investigation into the matter but Republicans aren't convinced there was any wrongdoing.</p><p>REP. DAN BURTON, (R) INDIANA: It's a fishing expedition. I think it's very, very political and it would be a waste of the taxpayers' money in my opinion to have an investigation of this.</p><p>ROCHELLE: Former President Reagan denies there was any deal with Iran but even Sick admits he has found no smoking gun but may never be able to prove his allegations.</p><p>The White House responded to this latest barrage by releasing the text of a letter <person><nameText>President Bush </nameText></person>showed last month to Moorhead Kennedy in which Mr. Bush emphatically denied any involvement.</p><p>Carl Rochelle, CNN, Washington.</p><p>ROOK: As Carl Rochelle just mentioned, former Carter administration official Gary Sick says George Bush when he was vice president may have been involved in a hostage delay deal with Iran. Mr. Bush has strongly denied that allegation. His chief of staff repeated the President's position to CNN just a short while ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN SUNUNU, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: <person><nameText>President Bush </nameText></person>has been unequivocal in his comments that there was nothing of the nature that has been described but if Congress or anybody who wants to investigate this, we have no problem with that. The President is comfortable with the fact that nothing he knew of, not the descriptions given by the hostages.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you endorse a congressional investigation?</p><p>SUNUNU: Well, Congress has to decide what it wants to do. We have absolutely no problem if they make that choice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROOK: John Sununu was interviewed on CNN's \"The World Today\"</p><p>SHAW: The White House responded Thursday to General Norman Schwarzkopf statements that military intelligence during the Gulf War was lacking. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater says the President felt the information was excellent. Wednesday, the general compliant to a congressional committee, some of the data were out of date. The Pentagon has conceded there were intelligence related problems, including differences between various United States intelligence agencies.</p><p>Boris Yeltsin is scheduled to arrive in Washington next Thursday, and he'll come as the first popularly elected president of the Russian Republic. With a landslide victory behind him, Yeltsin has a mandate from the people to pursue his radical reforms. Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said before the election he would cooperate with the winner.</p><p>In other developments, the people of Leningrad unexpectedly voted to restore the city's original name of St. Petersburg, in effect turning their backs on the founder of the Soviet state Nikolai Lenin.</p><p>ROOK: Stay with us for these stories. Swimming against the tide of AIDS discrimination. You'll see how some people with this disease are working to change public attitudes.</p><p>Also, ahead on Prime News, we'll tell you what's hot in space as the Columbia crew get set to return to earth. You'll see what's going on in a border town for bombings and death have become a routine part of everyday life. And later, we'll see what strategy and what candidates might win for the Democrats in '92.</p><p>SHAW: In medical news, <person><nameText>President Bush </nameText></person>is joining the drive to make sure all children are immunized against childhood diseases such as measles. In doing so, Mr. Bush is echoing the call of his Health and Human Services secretary.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And in the 1990s, no child in America should be at risk to deadly diseases like diphtheria, polio, or the one that Lou was stressing here today, measles.</p><p>LOUIS SULLIVAN, HHS SECRETARY: As a nation, we cannot be satisfied until all our children are properly vaccinated. But we have to work harder, making the process of immunization more accessible. We must act now to avoid slippage.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAW: Dr. Sullivan is dispatching HHS SWAT teams to six U.S. cities to look for ways to improve immunization programs. Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts is critical of the government plan and he calls it a road show that would involve solving the problem of inadequate vaccination. Evidence of the problem, in the last two years, more than 100 people died of measles out of 45,000 cases. Officials say, at least half of those cases involve preschool children who were not vaccinated.</p><p>ROOK: A top U.S. health official suggest a Florida dentist may have spread the AIDS virus through contaminated dental instruments or equipment. Dr. David Acer died of AIDS. It has been confirmed, five of his patients were infected with similar strains of the AIDS virus. The top AIDS official with the Centers for Disease Control says it's doubtful Dr. Acer spread the virus through blood in all five cases. The official believes the dentist practice may have been particularly unsafe. However, CDC investigators say, they may never know exactly how the five patients were infected.</p><p>SHAW: And tonight's news from Medicine Part Nine of our continuing series on AIDS, the second decade. CNN's Dan Rutz explores the other worries aside from health that people with AIDS must confront each day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN RUTZ, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Most people who carry the virus linked to AIDS are well enough to work, but often worried sick they'll be fired.</p><p>SCOTT JORDAN, AIDS VIRUS CARRIER: But in fact, when they found out, that is exactly what happened.</p><p>RUTZ: Scott Jordan's new job is with a firm where all the employees are AIDS carriers.</p><p>JORDAN: There's a lot of mental anguish that goes along with being sick and I think it's important that you have a purpose to get up for in the morning.</p><p>RUTZ: A doctor started the multitasking systems company in New York City to help out her patients and prove that people with AIDS make good workers. Dr. Linda Laubenstein works from a wheelchair herself.</p><p>LINDA LAUBENSTEIN, NEW WORK UNIVERSITY DOCTOR: And they should be no reason why the average individual can't work in the average kind of work setting without -- they're being a danger to either the employer or the employee.</p><p>RUTZ: MPS copies documents and prepares mass mailing. Most of the 36 employees work part-time. The manager hopes eventually to turn a profit.</p><p>EDWARD PETERS, MULTITASKING SYSTEMS, INC. STAFF: We are of essence and we certainly have to have various business principles that any business has.</p><p>RUTZ: The American Civil Liberties Union feels people with AIDS should not be restricted to jobs that cater especially to them.</p><p>WILLIAM RUBENSTEIN, ACLU PROFESSOR: So the first cut for someone with HIV disease should be that they should be able to stay on as long as possible wherever they are working already.</p><p>RUTZ: The Americans with Disabilities Act bans most discrimination against people with AIDS but hold little power over attitudes. Ronald Webeck's St. Petersburg, Florida neighbors know he has AIDS.</p><p>GAIL SCHONEBOOM, RONALD WEBECK'S NEIGHBOR: Well, I would say a couple of years ago when I first met him there were people at our pool who would get out at the pool when he got in.</p><p>MARLA HUGH, RONALD WEBECK'S NEIGHBOR: I remember when people used to feel that way about people who had cancer. People always hid that fact.</p><p>RUTZ: Webeck feels the people around him have learned enough in recent years not to be afraid.</p><p>RONALD WEBECK, AIDS VICTIM: I don't have to fight an element that a lot of other people are fighting, I think, which is maybe prejudice. And I've never really had to experience that. So it's made my life much nicer and much easier.</p><p>RUTZ: But distrust is growing between doctors and patients. New concerns about the risk of AIDS transmission either way spark debate over mandatory AIDS testing. The Centers for Disease Control has yet to issue guidelines, but it's clearly torn between the concerns of the worried well and of healthcare workers who could lose their jobs.</p><p>JAMES CURRAN, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL DOCTOR: But I think we want make recommendations to protect the public, to educate the profession, and to try to stem overreaction by including far too many procedures or far too many people.</p><p>RUTZ: The rights of the infected whether they work in medicine or industry have throughout the AIDS epidemic been an important consideration in public health policy, more so than fears, the experts regard as irrational.</p><p>There is more to all this than just holding a job for a paycheck or to escape boredom. Doctors find for many people, going to work is good therapy.</p><p>Dan Rutz, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROOK: Officials in Los Angeles say a police helicopter experienced engine trouble just minutes before it crashed in a ball of flames. Three people were killed in the crash. Two officers in the chopper and one person on the ground. Several cars and a duplex were burned. Witnesses say the chopper was shaking just before it clip a light pole and slammed into a parking lot across the street from a daycare center. No children were injured.</p><p>SHAW: The space shuttle Columbia crew spent part of its last day in space doing a mundane household task. The astronauts were awakened early to fix two overheated refrigerator so they could save blood and urine samples collected during the nine day voyage. Then it was time to pack up for the trip home. Columbia scheduled to return to earth Friday at 11:40 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>Pictures taken from Columbia provided a glimpse of Mount Pinatubo's continuing volcanic eruptions in the Philippine. Today, the volcano blew a cloud of ash and plume as nearly five miles into the air. The latest eruption sent thousands more running heading for evacuation centers. So far, more than 50,000 people, including many from a nearby U.S. air base have evacuated the area. The Pentagon is declining comments on reports nuclear arms are stored at the base.</p><p>ROOK: Northern Ireland has been erupting with religious and political violence for years. Now, there is hope that a meeting set for Monday may lead to peace. Catholic and Protestant political leaders will sit down for long-awaited talks on the future of the British run province. From Northern Ireland, CNN's Rick Sallinger reports from a place where Catholics and Protestants lived side by side with death.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICK SALLINGER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Castlederg, nestled in the hills. It's as pretty as a picture, but some of the pictures in this border town aren't nearly so nice. This is where a terrorist murder of a Protestant took place. Here a bomb exploded on Mother's Day last year, damaging dozens of homes. The Catholic Irish Republican Army has been blamed.</p><p>JAMES EMERY, TOWN COUNCILOR: Over the last 20 years you see this town is being bombed so much, pretty used with it. It is a great detriment of course maybe to people like you and the tourists who come here. They tend to shy away from Castlederg. But we kind of -- it's normal and sadly we have the kind of -- it's normal.</p><p>SALLINGER: Normal, it all looks very normal on the surface but look closer. What is normal for Castlederg is a sign of a heavily armed policeman with a bullet proof vest. They must constantly watch their backs. The police station is like a fortress, cars that passed by are checked for weapons and explosives.</p><p>Castlederg has a distinction of being the most bomb border town in Northern Ireland. 75 explosions have shaken this community over the past 20 years, but the violence hasn't ended there.</p><p>There have been 24 killings, 23 victims were Protestants. The cemetery is filled with headstones marked, murdered by terrorists. William Pollock, age 27, Norman McKinley, age 32, Heather Kerrigan, 20 years old. That's Heather on the right as a bridesmaid at this wedding. Since then, the groom and best man were also killed by the IRA, not one gunman has been apprehended.</p><p>CANON WALTER QUILL, CHURCH OF IRELAND RECTOR: Up until now when a Protestant has been murdered, scores of Roman Catholics come under suspicion. Now if we could apprehend the terrorists, and hopefully that they would be from outside the community, it would end that suspicion from the local people.</p><p>SALLINGER: While the British flag flies over the town, it is the flag of Ireland waving in the breeze in this Catholic neighborhood. Portraits of three IRA martyrs are on a house and a Merel (ph) encourages early allegiance to that outlawed organization.</p><p>How are Catholics treated here?</p><p>PATRICK DEVLIN, CATHOLIC RESIDENT: Very badly. You should be here couple of weeks ago. There's allegedly a small blast down the road. SALLINGER: He says the police got all Catholics in the neighborhood out of bed in the middle of the night regardless of age. Castlederg is just a mile from the border with the Republic of Ireland. That makes it a convenient target for the IRA to carry on its war seeking a united Ireland.</p><p>EDWARD TURNER, DISTRICT COUNCIL PRESIDENT: As far as the bombings are concerned, quite a number of these have taken place by 500 pine bomb, 600 pine bomb, 1,000 pine bomb of explosives loaded into the back of a vehicle with some description and driven across.</p><p>SALLINGER: He is calling for more border security. Because Turner is the district council president, he is accompanied by a bodyguard wherever he goes. And he rides in a bulletproof car. The divisions in this community of 6,500 are as vivid as the colors of the neighborhood curves, Protestant and Catholic. What's harder to see is the progress being made in relations here. Pat O'Loughlin sees it, he's a Catholic shop owner in Castlederg.</p><p>PAT O'LOUGHLIN, CATHOLIC BUSINESSMAN: I don't have customers in my shop, we have suffered greatly through terrorism and yet they would come in and do business with me from all sides of any other day.</p><p>SALLINGER: His friend across the street is Protestant businessman Samuel Crawford.</p><p>SAMUEL CRAWFORD, PROTESTANT BUSINESSMAN: And you have to love Tequila to survive, have good relationship with all of them, people of the state.</p><p>QUILL: We're matured enough to know that we share this place together and we all condemned terrorism. And we want peace to prosper here in Castlederg.</p><p>SALLINGER: The clergy has started a program of interdenominational activities called \"Bridge Building\" to try and convince two communities deeply divided by murders, bombings, and religion, that they must live together as one in order for there to be peace.</p><p>Rick Sallinger, CNN, Castlederg, Northern Ireland.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAW: Coming up on PRIME NEWS. The New York Stock Exchange stays open. It's the first step toward round-the-clock trading.</p><p>ROOK: Among our top stories on PRIME NEWS, the U.S. government reports retail sales rose 1 percent last month. Some analysts say it's further evidence the economy is bouncing back. But there is negative news on the inflation front. Wholesale prices jumped to surprising six tenths of a percent in May, force stop by hikes in gas and tobacco prices.</p><p>In a 63 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court gives police more leeway in questioning certain suspects. The court says, a jail suspect represented by a lawyer in one criminal case may be questioned about another crime without the lawyer present.</p><p>And eight U.S. citizens once held hostage in Iran say, they want to know for sure if their release was delayed for political gain. They're asking Congress to investigate allegations that the Reagan- Bush campaign struck a deal with Iran to hold the Americans until after the 1980 presidential election.</p><p>SHAW: The Federal Communications Commission is planning to give local officials a voice in setting prices for about 60 percent of the nation's cable T.V. systems. Under current rules, just about all systems are exempt, but local governments have been complaining that current rules allow cable rates to keep going up. Today's action will permit local governments to regulate prices in markets with fewer than six over the air stations or no competing cable system.</p><p>ROOK: A few hours ago, the New York Stock Exchange did something it'd never done before. It stayed open after 4:00. The idea pumped up the exchanges sagging trading volume. But as CNN's Terry Keenan reports, the idea hasn't quite caught on just yet.</p><p>TERRY KEENAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The first day of after-hours trading on the New York Stock Exchange wasn't much different from any other. At 4:00, the floor cleared, traders headed home, and trading in most stocks came to a halt. With little action there was took place here on brokerage trading floors where handful of traders were on hand to take orders.</p><p>THOMAS GALLAGHER, OPPENHEIMER &amp; CO. HEAD TRADER: Well, there's not a lot of response. Most people kind of -- going to wait and see how it goes and see whether or not it's worthwhile being involved in it. We did have a few orders both from our retail and from our institutional efforts and it was very little indeed.</p><p>KEENAN: Also, the mere 2.3 million shares traded in the after hours sessions, less than 2 percent of the regular hours total, and most of it to institutions. Still, the NYSE which is counting on the extra hours to help regain lost volume was optimistic.</p><p>RICHARD GRASSO, NYSE PRESIDENT: Well, I think what we've done is take a very small step in the direction of continuous trading for big board listed securities.</p><p>KEENAN: Whether that's to happen, traders say the big board will have to get more aggressive by offering something they can already get somewhere else.</p><p>One problem may be a bad sense of timing. According to traders only about 30 percent of all the exchange trades take place after the New York Stock Exchange closes. The other 70 percent occur in the morning and half hour before trading begins.</p><p>Terry Keenan, CNN Business News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) SHAW: Ahead on PRIME NEWS, CNN Political Analyst David Broder and Jack Germond examine presidential campaign '92. And later, sweet home Chicago, the Bulls returned from Los Angeles and we'll have the latest in sports.</p><p>SHAW: The presidential election is less than 17 months away. Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown is convening a meeting of heavy hitters in Virginia over the next two days, to plan a strategy they hope will dislodge George Bush in 1992. Among these desperate Democrats most of the party leadership, major fundraisers, and prospective Democratic candidates in 1992.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RON BROWN, DNC CHAIRMAN: This is a meeting which will bring together party leaders, prospective candidates, and major supporters of the party to share notes, to share ideals, to talk about the values and goals of the Democratic Party, to talk about a strategy and plan to capture the White House in 1992. We intend to elect a Democrat president of United States. In order to do that, we have to change the way we do our business. We have to get off to an early start as far general election, campaign planning, as far as research, and polling, and focus groups, and message testing. And in effect, getting our act together for the general election campaign.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAW: Joining us to assess the politics and the prospects for the Democratic Party next year, two veteran observers. Washington Post Political Columnist David Broder and in Los Angeles, Jack Germond of the Baltimore Sun. Both now analyst for CNN's political coverage right through the '92 presidential campaign.</p><p>Before we start, the Democrats are smiling a bit this week going into the big meeting in Middelburg, a new internal poll shows <person><nameText>President Bush's </nameText></person>reelection numbers are only at 46 percent compared to his popularity ratings that are well into the 70s. And that <person><nameText>President Bush </nameText></person>is vulnerable on domestic and economic issues.</p><p>Jack, in thinking about 1992, in thinking about where we stand now, can the Democrats attack George Bush in terms of strong suit, weak suit?</p><p>JACK GERMOND, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, the -- I think what happened Bernie is, we reach the point where the Democrats now if you hold a mirror up to the mouth of the party at does cloud up, I mean, the party is alive. And I think that there's two reasons for this is, one is there are some candidates who are acting aggressive, Rockefeller and Tom Harkin particularly. But the other reason is they think that Bush, as this poll would suggest, is vulnerable for his disinterest, of lack of interest on domestic concerns. And that is what sort of invigorated the party, more out of Washington I say than in Washington.</p><p>SHAW: David, your thoughts.</p><p>DAVID BRODER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think that the poll offers him some comfort but not a whole lot, Bernie. During the Reagan years, you may recall that often on issue questions, and issue after issue, the voters said that they like the position the Democrats were taking better than the Reagan position but they saw Ronald Reagan as a strong leader, they saw the Democrats as a weak and confused party and they weren't about to make the trade. Unless and until the Democrats come up with a candidate who looks as if he could even approach George Bush in terms of that strength of leadership, I don't think they're a real serious threat to George Bush.</p><p>SHAW: So just as Reagan, his security blanket, Bush has his, Jack?</p><p>GERMOND: Well, it's very difficult to look at any of these figures in the abstract, but David made the right point. The question is can the Democrats produce a candidate who was personally forceful enough to have some say about what the agenda is if he allows <person><nameText>President Bush </nameText></person>to control the agenda in '92 as candidate Bush control than in '88. It doesn't make any difference what the poll show back and win the election. If they got a strong figure that controls the agenda, makes them talk about their subjects then they have a shot.</p><p>SHAW: What about the economy and its status?</p><p>BRODER: Well the economy has clearly got to be the Democrat's strong suit. It's not that today, even though we've been in a recession, the Democrats don't have the kind of commanding lead as the party best able to deal with the economy that they've had in the past. So, just saying that the economy is in trouble as it has been for the past year by itself does not elect the Democrats to the White House.</p><p>GERMOND: It's also, Bernie, there's a lot of risk in the Democrats or the party out of power in any case relying on the economy. The economy has a habit of turning up right before a presidential election and taking the issue away. But that doesn't take away from other issues that are related to the economy. I think particularly the healthcare, for example.</p><p>SHAW: You know, I'm wondering about this Middelburg, Virginia meeting. David Broder, George Bush is at four years or four-year lead on the Democrats but shouldn't this meeting have been held before now?</p><p>BRODER: Maybe, but it's hard for the opposition party to get its act together and Ron Brown is accurate in saying that if he can begin to put together a general election campaign plan 16 months in advance of election day he would be far ahead of the schedule in the past. This meeting is an effort by Ron Brown to deal himself and the Democratic National Committee into the 1992 campaign, because the money that the taxpayers give to presidential candidates to finance their campaigns goes to that candidate as an individual and his personal campaign committee. Often, the party organization is left on the sidelines in the presidential campaign. Ron Brown is trying to change that pattern by getting the party into the planning early. He's going to have a battle on his hands to make it work. GERMOND: You know, there are lot of things. The fact is that the Democrats, what they have done in the last few campaigns, if they start from scratch with a great cloud of cosmic dust the day after they nominate the presidential candidate at the convention. What Brown is saying essentially is he wants to raise money now to do the things that have to be done as a foundation for a camping far ahead of the campaign and it will be the same thing essentially no matter who you nominate, whether you nominate a liberal or a conservative or whoever, they will all want the same sort of spade work than anything.</p><p>BRODER: But that's not realistic, Jack, because the campaign will be very different if it's a liberal or if it's a conservative.</p><p>GERMOND: Well, it wouldn't be different in terms of identifying issues where the other guy is vulnerable. It wouldn't be different in terms or negative research or targeting new Democrats, that kind of thing.</p><p>SHAW: You mentioned the word vulnerable, George Bush believes the Democrats are vulnerable, the Democrats believe he is vulnerable. Last night on the White House South Lawn, Bush, in effect, took the campaign to them, Marlin Fitzwater said you might consider the remarks made at the White House last night, the beginning of the '92 campaign. Let's listen to an excerpt of what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BUSH: I wasn't asking the Congress to deliver a hot pizza in less than 30 minutes. That would be revolutionary for Congress. I only asked for two pieces of legislation in 100 days and it's now clear that neither will be on my desk by Friday. And look, I'm disappointed, but frankly I'm not surprised. American people don't understand the complications and the inaction and the bickering, particularly when so many do understand what it takes to solve problems in their own neighborhoods commitment, compassion and courage.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAW: Opening salvo '92 race for the White House. Your reaction, gentlemen.</p><p>GERMOND: Sure sounds like a ...</p><p>BRODER: Bernie, this is one part of it. What we can see now is a three-part Bush re-election campaign strategy. What you heard last night was beating up on Congress and sharpening the issue with the Democrats. We saw that a week earlier on the specific issue of civil rights or quotas as the Republicans would have.</p><p>The second piece is pride and patriotism and that of course is keyed to the celebration of the U.S. and Allied victory in the Persian Gulf War. And the third part of it is George Bush as mister nice guy and I think the lead piece there would be the man who's trying to improve our schools, working with Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander, getting out into local communities, trying to help people do something they want done.</p><p>GERMOND: Yeah, that the -- it is quite clear that this goes back to this question of the (inaudible) by the minute, Bernie, about agenda setting. If George Bush is allowed to do things, for example setting that 100-day deadline for these two bills to be passed and to get away with it, the Democrats will never get off their backs to get into the ball game. But that is not necessarily assured if there is a right kind of a candidate.</p><p>SHAW: Gentleman, in the few seconds we have left, if you voted three fingers on your hands, among the Democrats who's first hottest?</p><p>BRODER: This week, I think Tom Harkin is probably the hottest candidate. He is not at all known nationally, Senator from Iowa. He is really talking the language that the liberal labor part of the Democratic Party loves to hear.</p><p>SHAW: Second hottest?</p><p>BRODER: Jack?</p><p>GERMOND: Well, I mean, you have one of those situation where Democrats are going have a pet rock every month which is what happened last time.</p><p>BRODER: Is that pet Rockefeller, is that -- is pet rock is Rockefeller?</p><p>GERMOND: I think right now those who were showing the most interest, the most formidable is potentially is Rockefeller.</p><p>SHAW: OK.</p><p>GERMOND: I think he has the right issue in healthcare, and I think he has the -- some of the kind of celebrity that sort of transcends the usual labels.</p><p>SHAW: On that note from Jack Germond, we thank you, we thank David Broder in Washington. Now, back to Susan.</p><p>ROOK: And still to come on PRIME NEWS, tragedy hits the opening round of the U.S. Open Golf Championship. And what's the value of the copy of the Declaration of Independence $4 or millions of dollars. When we return, we'll tell you the going price set at a New York auction.</p><p>ROOK: The 39 Paris air show open Thursday to the thunder of supersonic jet fighters swooping overhead. During the next nine days, hundreds of aircraft will be put on display, everything from a single pilot helicopters to the stealth fighter. Paris Air Show is the world's largest showcase for aviation and aerospace technology. Salesmanship is the name of the game. Aviation firms from around the world will be trying to find as many buyers as possible in what's considered a depressed market for aircraft.</p><p>SHAW: Now with a sports report we go back to Atlanta and Nick Charles.</p><p>NICK CHARLES, CNN SPORTS REPORTER: The U.S. Open golf tournament started today in Chaska, Minnesota, but anything achieved by the players on the course was vastly overshadowed by the tragedy that struck there. An intense thunder cell moved in on the course and six spectators seeking shelter under the tree were struck by lightning. Rescue workers rushed to the scene, one man was fatally injured. He died of cardiac arrest and has not yet been identified pending notification of family.</p><p>16 calling out in the action, Billy Andrade, his nice looking approach sails over the green into the water. Andrade with two eights on the back nine, that's the toughest open course. Now, out of the sand, Jeff Sluman to the bottom of the cup. That's the fourth hole, we go to the 10th, Nolan Henke. It'll break right and it'll break perfectly right. His sixth birdie of the day on the way to being five under par. The lightning and bad weather has held up play and they're still trying to complete the first round, Nolan Henke so far, the leader on a tragic first day of the U.S. Open.</p><p>Well the city of Chicago sure find a way to cure the midweek workweek blast. They celebrated championship that was 25 years in the making. The Chicago Bulls came home with their first NBA championship today thanks to a five-game romp over Lakers that they put the finishing touches on last night in Los Angeles. Thousands of fans jammed O'Hare International Airport today to give the Bulls the red carpet welcome but only a few were allowed into the terminal to greet the returning heroes.</p><p>While most Chicagoan celebrated quietly, some took to the streets to party last night. Police estimated 10,000 people stopped traffic in Rush Street which runs to the heart of the nightlife district. However, things got out of hand elsewhere and a 115 were arrested for isolated looting on the Westside near Chicago Stadium. At least two people were shot during the post game rivalry. But despite the problem, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley called the championship the best thing to happen in the city in a long time. The Bulls will be toasted by the city tomorrow at a special victory celebration beginning at noon in Grant Park.</p><p>Well overshadowed but not forgotten was the baseball game in Chicago today and the Cubs won that beating the visiting San Francisco Giants in a dynamic finish. The Cubs were clinging to a one run lead when the Giants loaded the bases of one out the ninth and Mike Kingery lofted a fly to shallow right field, Andre Dawson playing the center field knew the runner on third could challenge his arm, and Tony Perezchica did. And Dawson fired a bullet that shot down the runner, completed the double play and finished off the Giants beautifully.</p><p>We'll have a lot more baseball coming up at 11:30 Eastern time, including a look at the Minnesota Twins trying to win their 12th straight game. Also a fine look back at a memorable match up that may never come our way again, Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan. Well I see you at 11:30 Eastern time for that.</p><p>Now, though PRIME NEWS continues back in Washington with Bernard Shaw. SHAW: Thanks, Nick, we've get a match up that goes back millions of years. There's new evidence to support one theory of what killed dinosaurs. The theory, dust and debris stirred up by an asteroid crashing into the earth caused a climate change so great the dinosaurs could not adapt and they died. It's believed this happened about 64 million years ago. Scientists now say test and pieces of melted glass found in Haiti backup the theory. It's a type of glass that an asteroid collision would form and those tests show it's also about 64 million years old.</p><p>ROOK: Tough, I think that's neat. Well the weather is often a mystery, let's check it out, Flip Spiceland is the expert.</p><p>FLIP SPICELAND, CNN WEATHER FORECASTER: And as Nick told you in his sports report, it's been an absolutely horrendous day weather-wise in the upper Midwest. This, a satellite loop indicates the building of the thunderstorms starting in the early afternoon and ending in the evening hours. Watch how they just grow here in the upper Midwest not only in Minnesota but North and South Dakota down into Nebraska too. They are still under the gun. There are still severe thunderstorm watches and tornado watches in effect in this area of the country. I'll give you a graphic display of those in just one moment.</p><p>But before we get away from the satellite photograph I want to show you how the thunderstorms built across the South too and also here throughout the Rockies. Watch them pop up here. Look at that, they just popped up in late afternoon hours due to the heat and humidity.</p><p>Now, let's take a look at our CNN color radar summary, severe thunderstorm watches of the boxes here in light blue. This is a tornado watch. You can see a bad storm sail here in North Dakota within the tornado watch. You see a bad storm sail here in the area of Minneapolis-St. Paul suburbs, just to the north of them.</p><p>A look now at the predicted high-temperature for tomorrow would be another hot one in the Midwest with 90s reaching as far north as northern Iowa. The only cool weather would be here in the Northwest. We'll see some place with high zone in the 50s. Our forecast weather map for tomorrow indicates that thunderstorms are once again possible here in the upper Midwest as the warm humid air comes in behind this and the cooler air comes in from the west behind this.</p><p>Right now, take a look at specific forecast for cities around the nation for tomorrow.</p><p>Now back to Bernard Shaw in Washington.</p><p>SHAW: Thank you, Flip. Good to see you.</p><p>When PRIME NEWS returns another big tech at Southern Bays of New York, not Van Gogh, this time it's Jefferson and company.</p><p>SHAW: A first printing of the Declaration of Independence sold for a record $2.4 million more than twice pre-auction estimates. The 215- year-old document, one of just two dozen copies known to exist was the featured item at Southern Bays Americana auction. And there's declaration report was found stuffed inside the frame of a $4 painting. It still is a good buys as Thursday's winning bidder Atlanta investor Donald Scheer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD SCHEER, DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE BUYER: I think it's bargain particularly what's going on in the world today. I think this is a living document. The words in this document are the words that knock down the Berlin Wall, that freed Poland, and probably elected Boris Yeltsin yesterday in Russia. I think these words are -- is alive today as they were when they were penned in 1776.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAW: Yeah, and they say Mr. Scheer's copy of the declaration is in almost perfect condition. And that concludes this edition of PRIME NEWS. I'm Bernard Shaw in Washington.</p><p>ROOK: We'll see you in one hour, I'm Susan Rook at CNN Center in Atlanta. \"Larry King Live\" is next.</p><p>Larry, what's coming up tonight?</p><p>LARRY KING, LARRY KING LIVE HOST: We're going to meet some people with incredible stories to tell about self abuse and recovery.

Quick Fix   \u2014 Baby steps on the next coronavirus package: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell floated the idea of a stricter income cap on a second round of stimulus checks.   \u2014 Oh, there were takes on this: A foundation of Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, with its longstanding goal of shrinking the size of government, was among the groups that accepted Paycheck Protection Program loans.   \u2014 Margrethe Vestager, Silicon Valley\u2019s bane from Brussels, still has Big Tech in her sights.   A message from H&amp;R Block:   H&amp;R Block supports small businesses: With millions of small businesses served by H&amp;R Block and Wave, and our network of franchisees who are small business owners in their communities, we understand the vital role of small businesses in local economies.

WELCOME BACK to Morning Tax, where we were definitely here for The Washington Tax Extenders football team joke \u2014 with the caveat that only it really lands with a limited audience. (Though, have to say: Pretty darn good engagement on that tweet!)

There certainly doesn\u2019t seem to be any sprint toward reaching a fourth or fifth (depending on your definition) Covid-19 relief measure, with McConnell also saying on Monday while back in Kentucky that Senate Republicans would release a new proposal once they return to Washington in two weeks \u2014 which would give Congress about two more workweeks to figure something out before expanded unemployment insurance runs out.   But the majority leader did sound pretty onboard with another round of stimulus checks, as NBC News reported, something that House Democrats also approved in their latest coronavirus package back in May, and that the White House has become more vocal in supporting. McConnell\u2019s marker \u2014 suggesting those checks should be limited to those making around $40,000 a year \u2014 also came as no surprise to Democrats, who have been hearing Republicans say that the next Covid-19 legislation should be more targeted for awhile now.   There\u2019s clearly still some fleshing out needed there \u2014 for instance, would that $40,000 be for single filers? And if so, what\u2019s the cut-off for married couples? (Stimulus checks phased out completely at $99,000 and $198,000 in the CARES Act.) In any event, it suggests that Republicans are consolidating behind the idea of sending direct payments to a smaller universe of taxpayers, if still a pretty large chunk of families.   More Covid-19 odds and ends: McConnell also specifically pointed out how the pandemic has dragged down key parts of the tourism industry, like hotels and restaurants \u2014 another area where both President Donald Trump and other GOP officials have been talking about offering aid.   Interestingly enough, the chief executive of Tripadvisor, Stephen Kaufer, said over the weekend that a tax incentive for vacationers \u2014 one of the ideas that\u2019s out there, and one that hasn\u2019t gotten great reviews from experts \u2014 wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference.   \u201cWhat's best for the travel industry, at least my opinion, is really getting the pandemic under control. And that isn't about a tax credit for someone to take a vacation, it's really about leadership from our federal government, from the state governments, from local governments,\u201d Kaufer said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d   More Sunday show: Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia reiterated the Trump administration\u2019s interest in a payroll tax cut on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d even though the White House is on something of an island with that desire.   And finally: Here\u2019s another group hoping for help from the next Covid-19 measure \u2014 barbershops and beauty salons, lots of which are owned by minorities and/or women and can\u2019t offer takeout like restaurants. The Professional Beauty Association is seeking the same kind of incentive currently available to restaurants, which can get a tax credit for payroll taxes paid on customer tips, as Bloomberg Tax\u2019s Kaustuv Basu noted.   HAPPENING TOMORROW AT 12 PM EDT - HOW IS MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ APPROACHING THE COVID-19 SPIKE IN MIAMI? A rapid spike in coronavirus cases has forced Miami to scale back reopening plans.

REGISTER HERE.   THEY WERE DOWN WITH PPP: The ATR affiliate received between $150,000 and $350,000 from PPP, according to data released on Monday by the Treasury Department and Small Business Administration.   Of course, Norquist has long fought for lower taxes while railing against federal spending \u2014 he once famously said he hoped to shrink the government down to a size that it could be drowned in a bathtub. In a statement, ATR said the money was for its foundation, a related 501c(3) organization that it said had been \u201cbadly hurt\u201d by the lockdown, and the loan allowed it to \u201cmaintain its employees without laying anyone off.\u201d ATR also noted in the statement that it did not oppose creating the PPP because it was \u201ccompensation for a government taking during the shutdown.\u201d   But also of course: That didn\u2019t stop the charges of hypocrisy from flowing in. (Among the other groups to get a PPP loan: The Ayn Rand Institute.) \u201cSo much for his disdain for federal assistance,\u201d as Elise Bean, a former Senate tax investigator, put it. \u201cInstead, his organization is now a poster child showing how PPP funds are going to those who don\u2019t need the money but are well connected \u2014 here, an anti-tax group that reports losses year after year but has never gone out of business.\u201d   Others noted that Norquist signed on to a letter imploring Washington to stop pouring on the spending after the CARES Act was passed \u2014 something that would, for instance, make life more difficult for states and localities that are also trying to stave off layoffs.   And yet: Hypocrisy accusations aside, most everyone seems to agree that the ATR foundation used the program exactly as policymakers intended. Also of note: There are still PPP funds left over, so the foundation didn\u2019t box out another company or organization for the money. Another good question: Might it have been better for the government\u2019s bottom line for the foundation to take the loan, instead of laying off employees who then would have gotten expanded unemployment insurance?   Around the World   SHE\u2019S BACK: Vestager is starting to lay out a new regulatory agenda aimed at fostering more competition in the tech field, dealing with issues like companies\u2019 liabilities for their content. But on the tax front, the big issue in Brussels is still a bloc-wide digital tax now that the global Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development process is on the skids. And Vestager remains a full-throated supporter of that idea: \u201cSo many businesses have to work very hard to make a profit, and from that profit to then pay taxes,\u201d she said, via The Wall Street Journal. \u201cThey should not be met with competitors for capital, skilled employees and customers who do not contribute to society.   More OECD: Watch out for this \u2014 as our colleagues in Europe noted, the OECD is considering decoupling Pillar One (dealing with tax base issues) and Pillar Two (seeking a global minimum tax), and could put that idea in front of G-20 finance ministers in the coming weeks. That\u2019s basically what Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called for when he threw the talks into upheaval last month, but it\u2019s also not something that may go over well among other negotiators.

Around the Nation   IT\u2019S ON: The Seattle City Council cleared a new tax on big businesses that\u2019s expected to raise some $200 million a year for housing and other priorities, The Seattle Times reported. It\u2019s the latest effort by the council to squeeze more revenue out of Amazon and other companies paying high salaries in the city. Mayor Jenny Durkan has supported previous measures to tax big companies, but has expressed concerns about the new bill that would tax businesses based on how many employees make at least $150,000 a year.

Skeptics have pointed to former Obama economics adviser Lawrence Summers' comment in a 2009 e-mail that \"government is a crappy VC\" to argue that the $787 billion stimulus measure was packed with waste.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">About $100 billion of stimulus funding was earmarked for technology spending, according to tech consulting firm International Data Corp. Two-thirds was for energy technology, and most of the rest will subsidize doctors' adoption of electronic medical-records (EMR) software. At USA TODAY's request, IDC identified major beneficiaries of that spending to examine whether the money helped companies grow and bring technologies to market.</p><p>The analysis covered more than 45 companies that are public or have registered for initial public offerings, including most leading makers of electronic medical-records software and electric cars, and a small selection of the 5,000-plus companies and local government agencies that got clean-energy stimulus grants. Separately, USA TODAY looked at the recipients of all 38 completed or pending loan guarantees under the Energy Department's three major financing programs, including well-known public companies such as Ford, Southern Cos. and NRG, not on IDC's list. In all, the included companies, or their customers, are to receive more than two-thirds of the technology funding.</p><p>So far, the legislation has sparked adoption of electronic medical-records software and nurtured an electric-car industry that will sell at least 20,000 cars this year. At least 19 companies have gone public or filed for IPOs after getting stimulus money, from Solazyme's $21.8 million grant to build a pilot biofuels refinery to a $1.6 billion loan guarantee letting BrightSource Energy build the world's biggest solar-generation plant of its kind, according to securities-disclosure filings.</p><p>The stimulus has helped spark an 82(PERCENT) gain in the stocks of 11 health care technology companies since <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>took office and a 263(PERCENT) gain in the three public companies that took $7.8 billion of federal financing to build next-generation vehicle factories. It contributed to a 79(PERCENT) jump in stocks of the four leading energy-efficiency companies identified by IDC, including diversified companies such as Johnson Controls and Honeywell. Companies involved in developing smart electric grids, nine big tech firms that are also in many other businesses, have risen 54(PERCENT).</p><p>All these match or exceed the 51(PERCENT) gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, and beat the 4.9(PERCENT) average annual gain in venture funds raised in 2008, according to Cambridge Associates. The big exception is that the five solar-power companies and advanced-battery manufacturers on IDC's list have fallen 70(PERCENT). Similarly, among the loan-guarantee recipients examined by USA TODAY, solar-power related companies such as Solyndra and energy-storage companies such as Beacon Power, which filed for bankruptcy reorganization Oct. 31, have fared the worst.</p><p>The impact is filtering into the real economy, too.</p><p>Solazyme's algae-based jet fuel powered its first United Airlines flight on Nov. 7. More than 40(PERCENT) of doctors now use electronic medical records, up from 29(PERCENT) two years ago, including 75(PERCENT) of those working in groups of more than 25 physicians, according to research firm SK&amp;A. More electric cars are hitting the road, with Fisker Automotive's $95,900 luxury sedan reaching U.S. stores this month, as Tesla Motors gears up to supply batteries for Toyota's electric RAV4 SUVs, in addition to launching its Model S sedan next year.</p><p>Even a venture capitalist who cautioned the White House about its public support for Solyndra says the stimulus overall was still a good idea.</p><p>\"The government has been a better VC than a certain number of people on the Street,\" said Steve Westly, a former California state controller and Obama fundraiser whose venture firm backed Tesla and biochemicals company Amyris, which each got aid. Westly sent a well-publicized e-mail to Obama aide Valerie Jarrett, trying to persuade the White House not to have the president visit Solyndra.</p><p>Getting some flak</p><p>The stimulus' technology-boosting plan sparked a firestorm when Solyndra defaulted on its federal loan in August. The Republican National Committee on Nov. 9 lumped the programs with the collapse of investment bank MF Global amid Europe's debt crisis as evidence of the administration's financial mismanagement. \"This is a classic case of waste, fraud and abuse,\" House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., said in August. Department of Energy spokesman Damien LaVera declined to make senior officials available for comment.</p><p>The success or failure of the stimulus is about more than stock prices. The number of permanent jobs created or saved in the government's loan guarantee programs is about 40,000, plus several thousand more construction jobs. More than three-fourths of the permanent jobs are at Ford. The government owns stock in few of the companies it backs, meaning others reap the gains. In most others, Washington's skin in the game is only the company's ability to repay loans that the government makes or guarantees.</p><p>Furthermore, stimulus funding isn't the only reason many companies that received it have prospered. General Electric's $210 million of stimulus revenue is less than one-tenth of 1(PERCENT) of sales, spokesman Andrew Williams said. Likewise, Dell and IBM have cashed in on smart-grid development or health records upgrades and been boosted much more by the broader recovery. Even at a smaller company such as Solazyme, stimulus aid was far less than the $280 million it raised in venture capital and IPO funding.</p><p>Still, government bridged a bond-market gap that has lingered since the 2008 financial panic, said Scott Sandell, a partner at New Enterprise Associates (NEA), the nation's largest venture firm.</p><p>\"Across all the clean-tech sectors we invest in, there has been a tremendous paucity of capital at any stage of a company's development where there's any risk,\" said Sandell, whose firm backs Fisker, which got a $529 million loan guarantee to retrofit an ex-General Motors plant in Delaware. \"Trust me, it's been a barren landscape.\"</p><p>A leading IPO analyst concurred, saying the stimulus built market confidence in companies such as Tesla, helping them attract IPO investors and corporate partners.</p><p>\"The government money was a platform, and a few of them like Tesla used that and flew off on their own,\" said Francis Gaskins, editor of IPO Desktop. \"Many of them looked at the government money as a way to do things they might have done anyway.\"</p><p>Healthy gains</p><p>The clearest connection between the stimulus and the economy might be in health care software, in which the boost in companies' value far exceeds the amount spent so far in a five-year program costing up to $30 billion. Together, the gain in value of companies such as McKesson, Cerner and Athenahealth since the stimulus bill was proposed is at least $20 billion.</p><p>The stimulus has paid about $100 million so far to clients of Cerner, the largest maker of electronic medical-records(EMRs) software, said Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Wieland. Given Cerner's 20(PERCENT) market share, that translates into $500 million in extra annual sales for the industry, which may double as lower Medicare reimbursements, also part of the stimulus law, kick in for doctors who don't use EMRs by 2015, he said.</p><p>\"This really did accelerate adoption,\" said Jeff Townsend, chief of staff at Kansas City, Mo.-based Cerner, whose stock-price value is up 194(PERCENT) or $6.5 billion, since January 2009. Cerner's new-software sales rose 26(PERCENT) in the first nine months of 2011 vs. 2010's pace of 16(PERCENT). He said extra spending will add to growth, as doctors upgrade their systems and connect them to each other.</p><p>That spending has lifted nearly all health information technology stocks. Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, an EMR company whose CEO Glen Tullman raised money for Obama in 2008, has seen shares rise 134(PERCENT). Rival Athenahealth, which supplies Internet-based medical-billing and EMR services as a cheaper alternative to software, has doubled since mid-2010.</p><p>The question is whether the spending was efficient, says Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush, who has donated to Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns and is former president George W. Bush's cousin. He says Washington could have spurred adoption of cheaper, more flexible technology such as his through regulatory changes without subsidizing software.</p><p>\"We're a beneficiary of stimulus spending, but we'd be doing even better without it,\" said Bush, whose company benefitted from the administration's decision to have Medicare reimburse doctors for regularly using EMRs, favoring pay-as-you-go Internet business models such as Athena's, rather than paying for software purchases up front. \"What you really needed was hundreds of cloud-based companies innovating.\"</p><p>By government standards, the health care stimulus was fairly disciplined, Townsend contends. Doctors aren't reimbursed for software until they show they're routinely using it for work such as prescribing medications, he said. While knitting together networks owned by different doctors and hospitals will take time, data-sharing is essential to contain overall health care spending, he said.</p><p>Getting it out there</p><p>The energy stimulus is more controversial. More than 5,000 grants totaling $34.6 billion and 38 loans and loan guarantees totaling an additional $35.9 billion have been approved. But $11.3 billion of loan deals haven't closed and just $19.2 billion of the grant money has been spent, according to Energy Department data.</p><p>Energy stimulus produced the best-known stimulus failure, Solyndra. A congressional panel is investigating whether politics tainted Solyndra's loan review, and plans to probe other guarantees.</p><p>Also struggling is A123 Systems, which won a $249.1 million grant to build a Michigan factory for electric-car batteries. Its stock has fallen 83(PERCENT) since its 2009 IPO. A123, which lost $172.8 million for the first nine months of 2011, said it will break even by 2013, excluding taxes, interest and non-cash accounting charges.</p><p>Another loan-guarantee recipient, Beacon Power, filed for bankruptcy protection Oct. 30.</p><p>Not all the money is for high-risk deals. More than $10 billion in loans are scheduled for two nuclear plants, both backed by utilities with investment-grade credit. Another $8.3 billion has been loaned to Ford, Nissan, Tesla and Fisker to develop fuel-effective vehicles. Almost $6 billion went to Ford to develop new versions of models that sell 2 million units annually.</p><p>In each guarantee, the government will only lose money if the borrower defaults.</p><p>The $13 billion-plus for solar loans is divided between $1.82 billion for plants to manufacture equipment for newer technologies, including Solyndra; and more than $11 billion to build solar-power generation plants, mostly using existing methods. Loans to solar farms are safer, as those deals include long-term contracts for utilities to buy electricity produced at projects such as BrightSource's $1.6 billion Ivanpah, Calif., facility, said Lux Research analyst Andrew Soare.</p><p>Investors have already made big returns on companies in several DOE projects. Tesla raised venture capital at $7.53 a share in May 2009, got its loan guarantee that June, went public at $17 last year and now is worth $32.60 a share, or $3.4 billion. Ford is up fivefold, driven by a global auto recovery.</p><p>The loan \"lets us get to where we can make mass-market electric vehicles,\" said Diarmuid O'Connell, Tesla's vice president of business development. He said taxpayers also win if electric cars trim U.S. oil imports. \"For either economic or policy reasons, you have to do what's next,\" he said.</p><p>If anything, the industry has been held back recently because U.S. loan guarantees are hard to get or come with red tape, Sandell said. A better offer from China's government helped persuade NEA-backed solar-cell maker Suniva to build a factory in Asia rather than Michigan, he said. KiOR, which is developing wood-based ethanol substitutes, deferred its application for a $1.1 billion guarantee to finance refineries in Mississippi until 2012, although the program's funding is in limbo.</p><p>\"It may never close,\" Vinod Khosla, a VC who controls a 72(PERCENT) voting stake in KiOR , said in a September interview with The Daily, Rupert Murdoch's iPad newspaper. KiOR went public in June, after winning a tentative loan-guarantee commitment, making an 11-fold gain on pre-IPO shares. \"If you can get an (ExxonMobil) or a Chevron to work with you, why go through the federal government?\"</p><p>The volatile stock market will help determine the success or failure of the stimulus, whether measured by gains in market value or jobs created, said NEA's Sandell, a frequent donor to Democratic politicians.</p><p>Start-ups that go public create 90(PERCENT) of their jobs post-IPO, he said, citing a study commissioned by the National Venture Capital Association.

Skeptics have pointed to former Obama economics adviser Lawrence Summers' comment in a 2009 e-mail that \"government is a crappy VC\" to argue that the $787 billion stimulus measure was packed with waste.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">About $100 billion of stimulus funding was earmarked for technology spending, according to tech consulting firm International Data Corp. Two-thirds was for energy technology, and most of the rest will subsidize doctors' adoption of electronic medical-records (EMR) software. At USA TODAY's request, IDC identified major beneficiaries of that spending to examine whether the money helped companies grow and bring technologies to market.</p><p>The analysis covered more than 45 companies that are  public or have registered for initial public offerings, including most leading makers of electronic medical-records software and electric cars, and a small selection of the 5,000-plus companies and local government agencies that got clean-energy stimulus grants. Separately, USA TODAY looked at the recipients of all 38 completed or pending loan guarantees under the Energy Department's three major financing programs, including well-known public companies such as Ford, Southern Cos. and NRG, not on IDC's list.  In all, the included companies, or their customers, are  to receive more than two-thirds of the technology funding.</p><p>So far, the legislation has sparked  adoption of electronic medical-records software and nurtured an electric-car industry that will sell at least 20,000 cars this year. At least 19 companies have gone public or filed for IPOs after getting stimulus money, from Solazyme's $21.8 million grant to build a pilot biofuels refinery to a $1.6 billion loan guarantee letting  BrightSource Energy build the world's biggest solar-generation plant of its kind, according to securities-disclosure filings.</p><p>The stimulus has helped  spark an 82% gain in the stocks of 11 health care technology companies since <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>took office and a 263% gain in the three public companies that took $7.8 billion of federal financing to build next-generation vehicle factories. It contributed to a 79% jump in stocks of the four leading energy-efficiency companies identified by IDC, including diversified companies such as Johnson Controls and Honeywell. Companies involved in developing smart electric grids, nine big tech firms that are also in many other businesses, have risen 54%.</p><p>All these match or exceed the 51% gain in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, and  beat the 4.9% average annual gain in venture funds raised in 2008, according to  Cambridge Associates. The big exception is that the five solar-power companies and advanced-battery manufacturers on IDC's list have fallen 70%. Similarly, among the loan-guarantee recipients examined by USA TODAY, solar-power-related companies such as Solyndraand energy-storage companies such as Beacon Power, which filed for bankruptcy reorganization Oct. 31, have fared the worst.</p><p>The impact is filtering into the real economy, too.</p><p>Solazyme's algae-based jet fuel powered its first United Airlines flight on Nov. 7. More than 40% of doctors now use electronic medical records, up from 29% two years ago, including 75% of those working in groups of more than 25 physicians, according to research firm SK&amp;A. More electric cars are hitting the road, with Fisker Automotive's $95,900 luxury sedan reaching U.S. stores this month, as Tesla Motors gears up to supply batteries for Toyota's electric RAV4 SUVs, in addition to launching its Model S sedan next year.</p><p>Even a venture capitalist who cautioned the White House about its public support for Solyndra says the stimulus overall was still a good idea.</p><p>\"The government has been a better VC than a certain number of people on the Street,\" said Steve Westly, a former California state controller and Obama fundraiser whose venture firm backed Tesla and biochemicals company Amyris, which each got aid. Westly sent a well-publicized e-mail to Obama aide Valerie Jarrett, trying to persuade the White House not to have the president visit Solyndra.</p><p>Getting some flak</p><p>The stimulus' technology-boosting plan sparked a firestorm when Solyndradefaulted on its federal loan in August. The Republican National Committee on Nov. 9 lumped the programs with the collapse of investment bank MF Global amid Europe's debt crisis as evidence of the administration's financial mismanagement. \"This is a classic case of waste, fraud and abuse,\" House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., said in August. Department of Energy spokesman Damien LaVera declined to make senior officials available for comment.</p><p>The  success or failure of the stimulus is about more than stock prices. The number of permanent jobs created or saved in the government's loan guarantee programs is about 40,000, plus several thousand more construction jobs. More than three-fourths of the permanent jobs are at Ford. The government owns stock in few of the companies it backs, meaning others reap the gains. In most others, Washington's skin in the game is only the company's ability to repay loans that the government makes or guarantees.</p><p>Furthermore, stimulus funding isn't the only reason many companies that received it have prospered. General Electric's $210 million of stimulus revenue is less than one-tenth of 1% of sales, spokesman Andrew Williams said. Likewise, Dell and IBM have cashed in on smart-grid development or health records upgrades and been boosted much more by the broader recovery. Even at a smaller company such as Solazyme, stimulus aid was far less than the $280 million it raised in venture capital and IPO funding.</p><p>Still, government bridged a bond market gap that has lingered since the 2008 financial panic, said Scott Sandell, a partner at New Enterprise Associates (NEA), the nation's largest venture firm.</p><p>\"Across all the clean-tech sectors we invest in, there has been a tremendous paucity of capital at any stage of a company's development where there's any risk,\" said Sandell, whose firm backs Fisker, which got a $529 million loan guarantee to retrofit an ex-General Motors plant in Delaware. \"Trust me, it's been a barren landscape.\"</p><p>A leading IPO analyst concurred, saying the stimulus built market confidence in companies such as Tesla, helping them attract IPO investors and corporate partners.</p><p>\"The government money was a platform, and a few of them like Tesla used that and flew off on their own,\" said Francis Gaskins, editor of IPO Desktop.  \"Many of them looked at the government money as a way to do things they might have done anyway.\"</p><p>Healthy gains</p><p>The clearest connection between the stimulus and the economy might be in health care software, in which the boost in companies' value far exceeds the amount spent so far in a five-year program costing up to $30 billion. Together, the gain in value of companies such as McKesson, Cerner and Athenahealth since the stimulus bill was proposed is at least $20 billion.</p><p>The stimulus has paid about $100 million so far to clients of Cerner, the largest maker of electronic medical-records (EMR) software, said Piper Jaffray analyst Sean Wieland. Given Cerner's 20% market share, that translates into $500 million in extra annual sales for the industry, which may double as lower Medicare reimbursements, also part of the stimulus law, kick in for doctors who don't use EMRs by 2015, he said.</p><p>\"This really did accelerate adoption,\" said Jeff Townsend, chief of staff at Kansas City, Mo.-based Cerner, whose stock-price value is up 194% or $6.5 billion, since January 2009. Cerner's new-software sales rose 26% in the first nine months of 2011 vs. 2010's pace of 16%. He said extra spending will add to growth, as doctors upgrade their systems and connect them to each other.</p><p>That spending has lifted nearly all health information technology  stocks. Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, an  EMR company whose CEO Glen Tullman raised money for Obama in 2008, has seen shares rise 134%. Rival Athenahealth, which supplies Internet-based medical-billing and EMR services as a cheaper alternative to software, has doubled since mid-2010.</p><p>The question is whether the spending was efficient, says Athenahealth CEO Jonathan Bush, who has donated to Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns and is former president George W. Bush's cousin. He says Washington could have spurred adoption of cheaper, more flexible technology such as his through regulatory changes without subsidizing software.</p><p>\"We're a beneficiary of stimulus spending, but we'd be doing even better without it,\" said Bush, whose company benefitted from the administration's decision to have Medicare reimburse doctors for regularly using EMRs, favoring pay-as-you-go Internet business models such as Athena's, rather than paying for software purchases up front. \"What you really needed was hundreds of cloud-based companies innovating.\"</p><p>By government standards, the health care stimulus was fairly disciplined, Townsend contends. Doctors aren't reimbursed for software until they show they're routinely using it for work such as prescribing medications, he said. While knitting together networks owned by different doctors and hospitals will take time, data-sharing is essential to contain overall health care spending, he said.</p><p>Getting it out there</p><p>The energy stimulus is more controversial. More than 5,000 grants totaling $34.6 billion and 38 loans and loan guarantees totaling an additional  $35.9 billion have been approved. But $11.3 billion of loan deals haven't  closed and just $19.2 billion of the grant money has  been spent, according to Energy Department data.</p><p>Energy stimulus produced the best-known stimulus failure,  Solyndra. A congressional panel is investigating  whether politics tainted Solyndra's loan review, and plans to probe other guarantees.</p><p>Also struggling is A123 Systems, which won a $249.1 million grant to build a Michigan factory for electric-car batteries. Its stock has fallen 83% since its 2009 IPO. A123, which lost $172.8 million  for the first nine months of 2011, said it will break even by 2013, excluding taxes, interest and non-cash accounting charges.</p><p>Another loan-guarantee recipient, Beacon Power, filed for bankruptcy protection Oct. 30.</p><p>Not all the money is for high-risk deals. More than $10 billion in loans are scheduled for two nuclear plants, both backed by utilities with investment-grade credit. Another $8.3 billion has been loaned to Ford, Nissan, Tesla and Fisker to develop fuel-effective vehicles. Almost $6 billion went to Ford to develop new versions of models that sell 2 million units annually.</p><p>In each guarantee, the government will only lose  money if the borrower defaults.</p><p>The $13 billion-plus for solar loans is divided between $1.82 billion for plants to manufacture equipment for newer technologies, including Solyndra; and more than $11 billion to build solar-power generation plants, mostly using existing methods. Loans to solar farms are safer, as those deals include long-term contracts for utilities to buy electricity produced at projects such as BrightSource's $1.6 billion Ivanpah, Calif., facility, said Lux Research analyst Andrew Soare.</p><p>Investors have already made big returns on companies in several DOE projects. Tesla raised venture capital at $7.53 a share in May 2009, got its loan guarantee that June, went public at $17 last year and now is worth $32.60 a share, or $3.4 billion. Ford is up fivefold, driven by a global auto recovery.</p><p>The loan \"lets us get to where we can make mass-market electric vehicles,\" said Diarmuid O'Connell, Tesla's vice president of business development. He said taxpayers also win if electric cars trim U.S. oil imports. \"For either economic or policy reasons, you have to do what's next,\" he said.</p><p>If anything, the industry has been held back recently because U.S. loan guarantees are hard to get or come with red tape, Sandell said. A better offer from China's government helped persuade NEA-backed solar-cell maker Suniva to build a factory in Asia rather than Michigan, he said. KiOR, which is developing wood-based ethanol substitutes, deferred its application for a $1.1 billion guarantee to finance refineries in Mississippi until 2012, although the program's funding is in limbo.</p><p>\"It may never close,\" Vinod Khosla, a VC who controls a 72% voting stake in KiOR, said in a September interview with The Daily, Rupert Murdoch's iPad newspaper. KiOR went public in June, after winning a tentative loan-guarantee commitment, making an elevenfold gain on pre-IPO shares. \"If you can get an (ExxonMobil) or a Chevron to work with you, why go through the federal government?\"</p><p>The volatile stock market will help determine the  success or failure of the stimulus, whether measured by gains in market value or jobs created, said NEA's Sandell, a frequent donor to Democratic politicians.</p><p>Start-ups that go public create 90% of their jobs post-IPO, he said, citing a study commissioned by the National Venture Capital Association. It will take years before the full impact of stimulus-funded companies is apparent, while Solyndra-like mistakes typically reveal themselves quickly, he said.</p><p>\"If it succeeds, it will succeed because a handful of companies produced extraordinary results,\" said Sandell. \"The lemons always show up first. That's the story of the venture capital business.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-45505112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:549F-0PV1-JC8N-K46M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2327\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Gannett Company, Inc.

Davidson analyst Thomas Forte.

Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 10 points. The S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and the Nasdaq 100 futures gained slightly.   The busiest week of corporate earnings rolled on after the bell on Tuesday.  Starbucks swung to a loss during its fiscal third quarter, but the world's largest coffee chain raised forecast for the current quarter, sending shares up more than 4% in extended trading.    Shares of Advanced Micro Devices popped more than 8% after the chipmaker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings and issued an upbeat guidance.   Investors will assess more results from Boeing, General Motors and General Electric before the bell Wednesday, while Qualcomm and PayPal are among the companies reporting after the close Wednesday.   Chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google-parent Alphabet will testify   before the House Antitrust Subcommittee at noon Wednesday following a yearlong probe into their anti-competitive practices. Investors will look for insights on how the Big Tech is handling antitrust challenges from regulators with the authority to break them up.   Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will conclude its two-day policy meeting Wednesday and is set to release a statement at 2 p.m. ET. Chairman Jerome Powell will have a press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET.   The central bank is expected to keep interest rate unchanged at near zero to support the economy still struggling with the coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, the Fed announced it would extend  its emergency lending programs through the remainder of 2020.   \"Markets continue to expect ultra-accommodative policy from the Fed, and the Fed is unlikely to disappoint at this meeting,\" Bill Callahan, investment strategist at Schroders, said in an email. \"Given that we are still squarely in the center of the pandemic, the only question for investors is just how dovish the Fed will be.\"   In other news,  Eastman Kodak soared nearly 40% in extended trading Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced a deal to work with the photography pioneer to produce ingredients in generic drugs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Thank  you so much.  Good morning, everybody.  We will see you in a little while.   Girls, thank you.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Happy Friday, everybody.  It is Friday, November 2nd.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Major market moves this morning, Apple shares sliding today, week revenue  guidance last night on the announcement that it will no longer provide unit  sales.  That's stock down better than five percent right now.  The  technology giant at risk of losing that $1 trillion market valuation.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The other big story for the markets, of course today, the Jobs Report.   October Jobs Report will be out in two and a half hours, the expectation  calls for jobs of 190,000 added to the economy last month, month of  October.  And the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.7  percent.</p><p> We are taking a look at what that means for the midterm elections now just  four days away.</p><p> We are taking a look at the rally at the open this morning.  Meanwhile,  despite the drag from Apple shares, stocks are expected to open big.  Up  200 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 17 points on the S&amp;P  500, and higher by 10 and a quarter points on the NASDAQ this morning.</p><p> This after the major indices yesterday posted their third day of gains in a  row, it was a pretty good day at the close yesterday.</p><p> Take a look, up 264 points for the Dow Industrials.  That was better than  one percent yesterday, finishing near the highs of the day.  </p><p> The NASDAQ up one and three-quarters percent, that was 128 points higher  yesterday.</p><p> Checking global markets this morning, we kick it off with Europe.  European  indices higher across the board, FT-100 up two-thirds of one percent, the  CAC Quarante in Paris up better than one percent, and the DAX Index in  Germany up better than one percent as well.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets higher across the board, best performer there,  China.  Actually, Korea, KOSPI Index up three and a half percent, but China  also very strong up 2.7 percent on the Shanghai Composite.</p><p> On the earnings rank, we will hear from oil giants and Dow Components.   ExxonMobil and Chevron today.  Plus Alibaba, also set to report.</p><p> We will have those numbers and analysis, give us a little window into  what's going in Chinese consumer as well.</p><p> China trade, of course, in focus.  President Trump speaking with China's  president, Xi Jinping yesterday, showing progress in the trade dispute.  </p><p> As soon as that was announced yesterday, markets did turn around.  We got  some firmness when we heard that there was progress on the China deal.</p><p> Here's what IAC Chairman, Barry Diller, told me about China's trade  practices </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARRY DILLER, CHAIRMAN, IAC:  Their trade practices have to change.  And  us, being tough-minded about it, I think it's sensible.  I think us being  outrageous and excessive about it is dangerous.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest this morning.  More from Barry Diller  as well on technology and what's been happening with tech stocks, all those  stories coming up this Friday morning.  </p><p> And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman,  and Bench Mark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly.</p><p> Great to see you this morning.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Great to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Look who's back two days in a row?  </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, love it.  Love it.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, so exciting.  I'm sorry you had to impose this on your  viewers again, but -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm so happy you're back.  Yes.  It's great.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  -- I'm going to be here for a little while.  The -- you know, I  don't think the President said it was fantastic, but he did say it was good  and nice talking to President Xi Jinping, so -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Very good.</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- let's hope this is a step toward resolution of the trade  dispute.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.  And when we heard that they had the phone  call, it actually did help markets yesterday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Take -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, and I -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Big boost.</p><p> FREEMAN:  I think that's a lot of what you're seeing in the futures here as  well.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And on Apple's side, it's not just the revenue forecast for the  December quarter, it's also the fact that they're -- they are no longer  going to break out device unit sales in any future financial results.  </p><p> So basically, Apple is telling investors, \"You're going to get a lot less  information from us about what is going on with the company, with sales of  our devices,\" and that's why the stock down five percent.</p><p> But Apple was only down three percent in the month of October when Amazon  was in a bear market losing 20 percent of its value.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point, yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We talked about that yesterday morning.  </p><p> So, again, revenue is a problem and then when any company says, \"Oh, by the  way, we're going to give you less information -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- that's not -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what happened to -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's what happens to the stock.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what happened to Oracle a couple of weeks ago.  I mean - - and a lot of the analysts who have said that they said that they weren't  going to break out cloud revenue and these specific lines within the cloud  revenue, less transparency, you know, and so that's one thing.</p><p> So we're going to know less about how the company makes -- </p><p> FREEMAN:  But the revenue and the earnings are good.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  It's just the outlook.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> FREEMAN:  And then that's -- we have seen that with a lot of these  companies, where the numbers are fine, it's the future and the concern, and  maybe some of it is going away now with this discussion on China.  </p><p> KELLY:  But -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Amazon -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And which is the issue.  Which is the issue.  Are we going to  see growth slowdown in the future?  And what we're hearing, as far as these  revenue expectations, is, yes, things will slow down with the growth.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The midpoint of the revenue forecast for the holiday quarter  from Apple is just a three percent gain year over year.</p><p> That is for a company at this valuation, Apple being cheaper than other  tech names, but that's still lackluster, quite frankly.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  I mean I think it's important to note that they're not going  to be announcing unit sales and that's because they actually missed on unit  sales this time.  </p><p> Sixty percent of their revenue comes from iPhone sales.</p><p> I mean, that is it.  And so if they're missing on those numbers now and  then they're not going to give them in the future, that's uncertainty for  investors, especially because the biggest important market, which President  Trump's going to be talking to Xi Jinping, is China.</p><p> We saw the revenues come down from 21 percent the previous quarter to 18  percent and they're continuously slowing down over there.  </p><p> That's the most important market for growth.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's what Dan Niles pointed out, that, look, are we  really going to see people pony up a thousand dollars for an iPhone X in  China when you know that things are slowing down there?  </p><p> And he also mentioned the inventories, when you check on inventories at  Apple as well coming up.  </p><p> Also joining the conversation this morning, my exclusive interview with  Barry Diller.  He is Chairman of InterActive/IAC, and Expedia Group.  Don't  miss what he has to say about markets and technology, and really where the  growth is going forward.</p><p> All that is coming up.  </p><p> But first, our top story this hour.  Apple shares under pressure despite a  earnings report.  Earnings per share of $2.91 a share.</p><p> Revenue 61.9 billion -- as you see earnings revenue, $62.9 billion on  revenue on earnings of $2.91 a share.</p><p>Apple stock is down better than five percent right now, as you can see.   The stock is down as investors worry about that guidance.  </p><p> The company's decision to stop reporting unit sales for the products,  seeing it as sign of potentially slow sales growth.</p><p> Joining us right now is Mahoney Asset Management CEO, Ken Mahoney.  Ken,  it's good to see you.  </p><p> KEN MAHONEY, CEO, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Great to be back again.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p> Let me just point out that it is also Jobs Friday.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  Yes.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So we will have the Jobs number out in two and a half hours and  we're going to talking about that as well.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  Glad to know.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But your reaction to the Apple numbers.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  Again, soft numbers.  You know, they're really playing around and  pushing the envelope when it comes to elasticity of the man.  Remember that  little textbook phrase?</p><p> I mean pushing up prices and see where that demand is, I mean, look, I  think the estimates were about $750 a unit to now they came to $793.  </p><p> But they're really pricing out a lot of households.  I mean what is that --  what is that elasticity of the man?  Where is that level where you could  actually have good margins and also have some good sales?</p><p> And I think that's the thing.  And also by the way, I think the new  offerings are quite confusing to consumers, right?  There's the XL's, and  G's, and D, like -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No -- </p><p> MAHONEY:  Before, it's quite simple, you had a red card to pick, a white  card, and a black card color, you know.  </p><p> KELLY:  Right.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  And now we have, like, 19 different choices, so what is the  consumer -- where is that kind of sweet spot now for Apple with their  iPhone offerings?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So the XR is the cheaper of the new model.  The X -- I say X,  it's 10, it's 10R, 10S, 10S Max, and it's actually the 10R, or the XR,  that's gotten the really good reviews and that's the lower price change.  </p><p> And so that, again, is -- was a concern going into this report.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, I think you're bringing up a great point because what happened  is they keep increasing their average selling price, but also the parts and  components are going down.  </p><p> So their operating margins are expanding pretty significantly and that's  going to be a future headwind because we're not going to see DRAM prices go  down even more.  </p><p> And so I think, when you're talking about pricing power, that's what is  going to help companies succeed next year when they can -- </p><p> MAHONEY:  That's right.  </p><p> KELLY:  -- when they can pass along that pricing power.</p><p> So what are you seeing for next year and how you're going to be positioning  yourself in the markets?</p><p> MAHONEY:  Yes, look, it's going to be a volatile year.  We also have to  deal with the headlines, the Fed raising rates at a time when, you know,  that's another kind of one of those bugaboos that's going to be out there,  right?  </p><p> So, you know, I feel like the Fed's going to keep raising rates until  something breaks, and some things are breaking around us -- housing, we're  seeing construction, homebuilders, and so forth.  </p><p> So I think -- I think investors are becoming nimble.  I mean we don't make  them day traders, but kind of active when we have these swishes down like  we had in February, in April, coming off of a strong January and March.  </p><p> And now, again, a strong August-September we've had.  </p><p> So I think we are -- we have a hybrid strategy, basically.  Seventy percent  long, large cap growth, but also about 30 percent kind of buy the dip, sell  the rip, you know, into some of these crazy volatilities.  </p><p> So I think next year, look, we have a lot -- we have a lot of things to  kind of deal with after midterm elections, but at the -- at the end of the  day, I think investors can make volatility their friend instead of their  foe, is kind of the way we're going to come and play this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But are you saying you are expecting a slowdown in the coming  couple of years?</p><p> MAHONEY:  I think so.  Again, some specific interest rate sensitive  industries, again, home builders, again they bounce a little bit, we  wouldn't be there.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, what about the broad economic -- </p><p> MAHONEY:  All those and -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- growth?  I mean we're talking about 4.2 percent growth for  the second quarter, 3-1/2 percent for the -- </p><p> MAHONEY:  3.5, yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- third quarter.  Do you see economic growth slowing down?  </p><p> MAHONEY:  Oh, yes, absolutely.  Yes, it's definitely slowing down 4.1.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  But, again, the point is the Fed keep raising rates here, it's  going to slow a lot of things.</p><p> And we're seeing already, by the way.  If you look at the real estate  market, especially in the metro area here, you're starting to see some  softness, so it is having impact, these higher interest rates.</p><p> FREEMAN:  So if the President, best-case scenario here, gets a deal quickly  with China, not predicting this, but if Xi Jinping says, \"OK, we'll respect  property rights and lower trade barriers,\" you're thinking that doesn't  give the market much of a bump because the focus stays on interest rates or  it does?</p><p> MAHONEY:  Look, look, look, we saw, since Monday, you know, look, we had a  whipsaw kind of -- bungee market, we were up 350 points.  </p><p> The President said, \"Hey, we're going to add some more trade tariffs in  China in case we don't get a deal,\" and the market fell out of bed again.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  So he knows his words are tied into his algorithms that trade  offered us.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Right.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  So, the tariffs are really important.  Look, we heard from 3M,  Caterpillar, even Apple last night, talk about the uncertainty because of  China trade. </p><p> So, that definitely helps out.  But, again, I think 4.1 may be your peak  GDP, quite frankly, and 3-1/2 of, you know -- </p><p> KELLY:  No.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I was going to -- I would point out, the Apple stock, until  through yesterday, was still up 31 percent year to date.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And one big concern is the iPhones and the imports of Apple  goods made in China have not been hit with any tariffs by this government  yet.  </p><p> But it looks like if something doesn't get resolved by the end of the year,  iPhones will get hit with tariffs, and then you have to factor in the worry  that the Chinese government retaliates against Apple.</p><p> MAHONEY:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Retaliates in terms of China as a sales market, but also as a  manufacturing hub for Apple, so there's a lot of concern.  </p><p> It would be a huge, huge boost for the stock potentially if the U.S. could  get something done with China on trading. </p><p> MAHONEY:  It's important, too, because this has been going on for about a  year now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  Versus protecting aluminum and steel industries now, we have some  of the other industries aching from this.  </p><p> So at the end of the deal, you know, we've been playing Liar's Poker.  My  50 billion, your hundred billion, my 50 billion, my hundred -- you know, at  this point, we really should get a deal here, right?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But he's got -- this administration has got to push back on  China.  Don't forget what we heard yesterday and this was just one company  and this is just one issue and that is from Steve Ballmer.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  Right,</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Former CEO of Microsoft.</p><p> MAHONEY:  Microsoft, yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That 90 percent of the -- of the companies in China use the  Microsoft operating platform and only one percent pay for it.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that equates to $10 billion to Microsoft.</p><p> MAHONEY:  No, I remember back in -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Lost profit -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But the -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- that goes to China because they're stealing it.</p><p> MAHONEY:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I started the week by talking about this and the Journal  writes about it today.  The better China strategy is what we've seen them  going after, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company, which has been  accused of stealing technology intellectual property from Micron.  </p><p> That's what this administration has done.  We hit the Chinese company for  allegedly stealing those secrets. </p><p> The Journal writes about it, calling it a better China trade.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  Well you -- well -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I don't disagree.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Rather than -- rather than blunderbuss Paris.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we should have -- and I -- </p><p> MAHONEY:  Yes, well -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I don't disagree, we should have pushed back on ZTE as  well.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  That's right.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, and we did.  We actually imposed some fines -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But then he came back.</p><p> KELLY:  -- because he was skirting sanctions.  Right.  But I think the  important thing to note here is that it's not just American companies and  the American government.  </p><p> We saw, at the World Trade Organization, the Europeans came around with our  viewpoints as well and said, actually, they should not be getting a most-  favored nation status at the World Trade Organization.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> KELLY:  They're still considered an emerging economy, yet they're still  skirting regulation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.</p><p> MAHONEY:  Right.  </p><p> KELLY:  So if you even have the Europeans aligned with the Americans,  that's going to be saying something.  But this goes back -- </p><p> MAHONEY:  Right.  </p><p> KELLY:  -- to what you're talking about, is that even if we get -- do get  good growth next year, the dollar's going to get stronger.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  That's right.  </p><p> KELLY:  And the Feds is also going to continue to raise rate because -- </p><p> MAHONEY:  Right.  </p><p> KELLY:  -- they're going to tamper inflations because if parts go up, then  inflation's going up.</p><p> MAHONEY:  Right.  </p><p> KELLY:  So the stronger dollar, I see, is one of the biggest impediments.</p><p> MAHONEY:  Absolutely.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you selling into this rally right now?</p><p> MAHONEY:  Yes, this morning we will be selling.  But, look, from -- yes,  from Monday's low -- this is like Friday's, it's been a long month this  week, right, guys?  </p><p> So from Monday's low to this open, it's about a 10 percent move for the  NASDAQ.  </p><p> I think we go back in film, not bearish, but I think we need to break down  like we did, we do this bounce, we do a retest, I hope we make higher lows.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> MAHONEY:  I mean that'd be great technically.  But at the end of the day,  we were up 10 percent intraday from Monday now through Friday.</p><p> I think it takes some shekels, have some -- your powers run away in case we  have to go back, or in case next week, the midterm elections don't go the  way people think it's going to go, or the China talks don't go the way we  think they will go.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  You have some -- you have some -- you have some power drive.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So sell into strength?  I like that.</p><p> MAHONEY:  Sell into strength.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Sell some shekels.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  That's true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's talk jobs for a second.  It is Jobs day in  America this morning.  </p><p> Thee October Jobs Report out in two hours, 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Here are the  expectations, a hundred and ninety thousand jobs added to the economy in  the month of October.  </p><p> With the unemployment rate holding steady and 3.7 percent.  Kevin, what are  you expecting from today's Jobs numbers?  </p><p> KELLY:  Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What are you going to be focused on this morning?  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes, I think we're actually going to get a print above 200,000, and  one of the reasons why is holiday expectations and needing to fill those  seasonal jobs.  </p><p> And especially after the hurricanes, I'm going to really be looking at the  labor participation rate and I think that's the biggest one because we need  to see people coming into the labor force if this economy continued to grow  and expand.  </p><p> Because that will lead to productivity for the companies -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> KELLY:  -- so they can keep their margins where they're at.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is a good number priced into this market, Ken?</p><p> MAHONEY:  I don't know.  I think today, the market's mostly focused on the  trade deal with China.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> MAHONEY:  And a little bit about Apple.</p><p> I mean this is important, but I think it's already a foregone conclusion  that the Fed's going to raise rates in December.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  We're going to be watching wage growth very closely.</p><p> And to your point, you know, a lot of companies are saying we're having  trouble finding employees to grow our business.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  So this is -- this is an issue.  So, participation rate is  important.</p><p> KELLY:  The rate.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  But it -- the wage growth is what the Feds' going to watch  closely.  So, we have to watch when the Feds' watching to make our  decisions.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  yes, wage growth is important.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, and -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's supposed to be the best in nine and a half years, so  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> FREEMAN: Yes, because we have a worker shortage.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  yes.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  That's what we saw on the NFIB report yesterday.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> FREEMAN:  And it's good to see the President the last couple of days  recognizing that, saying we want border enforcement, but we want to let  people in, too.</p><p> MAHONEY:  That's right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's jump.  Ken Mahoney, good to see you.  </p><p> MAHONEY:  Thanks very much.  Good Friday.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are all hands on deck, so keep it right here.  MORNINGS WITH  MARIA, we've got full coverage of the October Jobs Report beginning at 8:00  a.m. Eastern, special coverage where we identify where the jobs are right  now.</p><p> First up, protecting that border, the first 100 troops have arrived at the  border for Operation Faithful Patriot as the migrant caravan closes in on  the border.  The very latest next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A sheriff's deputy in Texas fighting for his  life this morning.  Cheryl Casone with all the details and headlines now.   Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  Good morning.  </p><p> That deputy and another officer were attempting to serve a warrant to a man  who failed to register as a sex offender.  </p><p> The officers had to use a stun gun on the suspect after he resisted arrest,  but he escaped and fled to his apartment.  That suspect started shooting.   He hit the deputy in the head, the unnamed officer remains in critical  condition this morning.  The suspect is, though, in custody.</p><p> Well, the first 100 active-duty troops arriving at the Southern Border.  As  part of Operation Faithful Patriot, President Trump said the number of  troops deployed to the border could go as high as 15,000.</p><p> Meanwhile, the President plans to sign an executive order that could keep  migrants, including asylum seekers apprehended at the border, in detention  until their legal cases are heard.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  Those who choose to break our laws and enter illegally will no  longer be able to use meritless claims to gain automatic admission into our  country.  </p><p> We will hold them for a long time, if necessary.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Well, at least three caravans of migrants are currently heading  north from Central America right now.</p><p> Then there's this, AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia accusing the Justice Department of  collaborating with Dish Network.</p><p> WarnerMedia issued a statement saying, \"The Department of Justice  collaborated closely with Dish in its unsuccessful lawsuit to block our  merger.  Well, that collaboration continues to this day with Dish's  tactical decision to drop HBO, not the other way around.\"</p><p> So here's what's going on.  For the first time in its 40-year history,  WarnerMedia's HBO went dark on Dish Network yesterday after a disagreement  over a new distribution deal.</p><p> Now AT&amp;T is going to go back to court next month in the DOJ's appeal of  that antitrust decision approving AT&amp;T's deal to buy Time Warner Media.  </p><p> So obviously, Maria, a lot of twists and turns in the story, but forget  about it, you're not going to get your Sopranos reruns on HBO and Dish.   Sadness.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh, forget about it.  All right, Cheryl.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  Coming up, the President's midterm rally blitz, the  President is making stops in key states with just four days left before  voters hit the poll.  </p><p> We are on countdown mode.  We're breaking down the races coming up right  after this.  </p><p> Then my exclusive interview with IAC and Expedia Group Chairman, Barry  Diller.  He's talking social media regulation, if it's even possible.  </p><p> Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Spotlight on the midterms now.  We are not four  days away from the midterm elections.  We are taking a look at key economic  data in states with some of the most influential races, so today we zero in  on Missouri, Montana, and Colorado.  </p><p> Joining us right now is Kristin Tate, she is The Hill contributor and  author of \"How do I Tax Thee?\"  Kristin, good to see you.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  </p><p> KRISTIN TATE, CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Before we get to Missouri, let me get your take overall.  How  do you think the Republicans fair in the midterms on Tuesday night?</p><p> TATE:  Well, I think this is really a referendum on Trump, so Republicans  are trying to inject Trump into these races as much as possible to get his  supporters to the polls.  </p><p> This is all about mobilization, but Trump mobilizes Democrats, too.  We  have Democrats running on the perceived hatred of Trump, so it's just about  who can get the most folks to those voting booths.  </p><p> But I think that the Democrats are going to take back the house.  But it'll  be tight.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's start with Missouri here.  The President was  there last night campaigning for Republican candidate, Josh Hawley.</p><p> He's locked in a tight race against incumbent Democratic Senator, Claire  McCaskill, first elected back in 2006.  </p><p>Missouri's first quarter GDP, 2.4 percent.  The unemployment rate, 3.2  percent in September.  The state's leading industries are hospitals,  nursing and residential care facilities.  </p><p> President Trump won this state back in 2016, what's your take here?  Can  Hawley unseat McCaskill?  </p><p> TATE:  So this race is really a toss-up, but the most recent polls do  suggest that Hawley has a slight edge here.  </p><p> Remember, Missouri is kind of a right-leaning state, Trump won it by 19  points.  So, McCaskill is really trying to position herself as a moderate  Democrat, someone who's worked with Trump.  </p><p> She's really courting Trump supporters because, frankly, she needs them to  win this race.</p><p> The two biggest issues there are health care and the economy.  The economy  there in Missouri is doing pretty well, growth has not been as robust as  it's been for the nation as a whole.  </p><p> I think unemployment sits out about 3.3 percent, but interestingly, Hawley  really hasn't been talking about the economy much and I think that's  because of tariffs.  </p><p> Hawley supported President Trump when he tried to win these trade wars, but  now Missouri is really feeling the effects of tariffs.  </p><p> China buys about one-third of Missouri's soybean crop, and of course they  slapped 25 percent tariffs on soybeans, which reduced their value by about  20 percent, so that's really devastating to the farming industry there,  which was already hurting.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's really a good point.  And don't forget what Claire  McCaskill said the other day, she's really trying to look like she's a  moderate, calling her colleagues crazy.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  She said, \"Those crazy Democrats.\"</p><p> TATE:  Right.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Well, I wonder, does that affect turnout for her in St. Louis?   She's obviously trying to get more of that rural vote, but what does that  do for kind of the core Democratic voter there?</p><p> TATE:  She's in a tough position, you know, because she comes off as  looking too liberal for the moderates and conservative votes, but too  moderate for the really liberal voters in those cities.  </p><p> So, she is walking a very tough tightrope here, but Hawley has responded by  really hammering her on that no vote that she gave to Kavanaugh, and a  couple of other issues like her personal wealth.  </p><p> You know, McCaskill loves to say that, you know, she's just an ordinary  Missouri gal, but really she's extremely wealthy.  I think her net worth  is, like, $29 million.  </p><p> So there are several issues that she's being hammered on and this is all to  get the base energized on the right, but I do think she's going to have a  hard time reaching out to people in the cities and, you know, these really  far-left progressive voters.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> TATE:  Because, again, she is seen as too moderate for them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Kristin, let's move on to Montana.  Incumbent  Democratic Senator Jon tester, facing off the Republican challenger, Matt  Rosendale.  </p><p> Now on the economic front, first quarter GDP in Montana, two and a half  percent.  September unemployment, 3.6 percent, so a good unemployment  number.</p><p> The President is headed to Montana tomorrow.  This is this last-minute  campaign blitz before voters head to the polls.  Kristin, what's driving  voters here?</p><p> TATE:  Well, Tester is, again, another Democrat trying to fight for his  political life in a state that loves Trump.</p><p> Up until recently, he had been seen -- Tester had been seen as having a  kind of wide lead here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> TATE:  But now, this is a toss-up race because the libertarian candidate in  that race dropped out, presumably giving votes to the Republican.  </p><p> The big issues are health care and the economy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> TATE:  Insurance rates have been on the rise in this State of Montana,  premiums have gone way up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> TATE:  And then when it comes to the economy, Montana's really roaring  under Trump.  Unemployment, the lowest it's been since 2007 and -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why -- which is why he's headed there today.</p><p> TATE:  -- median household incomes are way up.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Real quick on Colorado.  </p><p> TATE:  It's a -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The state's first quarter GDP was three percent in Colorado.   September unemployment, 3.1 percent, now the leading industry here, oil and  gas extraction, contributing more than $11 billion to GDP.  Real quick on  Colorado, Kristin.</p><p> TATE:  I'm watching very closely the sixth congressional district race.   People are saying this is kind of a bellwether for who controls congress.  </p><p> Of course, Colorado has been trending blue for many years now, so it's an  uphill battle for the Incumbent Republican there, but Colorado citizens are  very happy with the direction of the economy, that looks really good for  Republicans, so we'll see what happens.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Kristin.  Great analysis from you always.  Thanks so  much.  We will see you soon. </p><p> TATE:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kristin Tate joining us.  Stay tuned.  We've got special  coverage from -- on Fox Business for the midterm elections beginning  November 6th.  </p><p> \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\" kicks us off at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Tuesday night.  </p><p> Neil Cavuto takes over at 8:00 p.m.  I will join Neil at 8:00.</p><p> MORNINGS WITH MARIA the next morning starts an hour earlier.  We'll all be  here.  All hands on deck 5:00 a.m. Eastern.  The next day with all the  results because some of these races could go late with, of course,  California closing late on Tuesday night.</p><p> Coming up, my exclusive sit-down with IAC Chairman, Barry Diller.  What he  says about the future of social media and companies in his portfolio,  including Match, Tinder, and Angie's.  </p><p> Plus, oil earnings in focus this morning.  Supply concerns weighing on  investors.  We'll talk more about that after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  TGIF, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, November 2nd,  your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Finishing up another week of earnings, it's a big one, Apple shares are  under pressure, this morning, the technology giant, reporting the fourth  straight quarter of record revenue and profit.  However, the company said  it will no longer report unit sales, not going over well with investors,  this morning.</p><p> And isn't it interesting that we are looking at Apple, down almost six  percent, and we're still expecting a rally, in the broader markets.</p><p> We're waiting on energy names this morning, reporting their quarter,  including Exxon Mobil and Chevron.  We are also waiting, of course, on the  October jobs report, that's going to come out in two hours from now.</p><p> We are expecting 190,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of October,  with an unemployment rate holding steady, at 3.7 percent.  We will look at  what it all means for the midterm elections, now, four days away from the  midterms.</p><p> Check out Futures, going into all of that, Dow Industrials expected to be  up 225-point rally at the start, even with Apple, down where it is.  The  other averages also higher, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P, up fractionally.</p><p> The major indices finished higher, yesterday, as well.  We had a 3-day  rally underway, Dow Industrials yesterday, at the close, up 264 points,  better than one percent.  Check out the NASDAQ, yesterday, at the close, up  128 points, that was one and three quarters percent, yesterday.</p><p> In Europe this morning, momentum is continuing, FT 100 up three quarters of  a percent, 50 points higher, CAC Quarante in Paris, up one and a third  percent, 65 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, up 1-1/2 percent,  166 points higher.</p><p> Overnight, in Asia, markets were higher across the board, best performer,  Korea, up 3-1/2 percent.  Hang Seng, up more four -- the Hang Seng Index up  better than four percent, in Hong Kong.</p><p> And protests at Google are continuing, thousands of employees are  protesting the company's -- they're walking off the job after the company  is reacting to the sexual harassment allegations.  We will tell you about  that.  How the company's reacting to all these protests.</p><p> But first, our top story this half an hour, the future of the internet, IAC  and Expedia Group Chairman Barry Diller, sitting down with me, in a FOX  Business Exclusive, we talked about the brands of his business and I also  got his take on regulation, will hit the industry in the wake of privacy  scandals at major players like Google and Facebook.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DILLER:  Well, look at what has happened with Facebook and with Google and  with all of the large players in communications or in social  communications, where the proliferation, the ability to simply get into the  system with infectious disease, bad, evil thought, manipulations by  Russians or by the Chinese or by this political action side or that.</p><p> The demonizing of George Soros, and, in fact, where every one of these --  Facebook just announced that they had this huge breach, every technology,  it is -- the cyber warfare of it.  All of these things are just -- you  know, it's just the stir of what has been enabled.  And we are not even yet  at the even beginning stage of taming it.  And it will, over time, get  tamed.</p><p> I think it's going to get tamed by regulation, because I think we've  reached the stage where regulation is a recommended thing when you have  these areas that have gotten so strong and powerful, with so many  unintended consequences that the only way that you can really probably deal  with them is, through some -- through, hopefully, wise regulation.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What is regulation, though, going to look like, because you  can't really regulate a company just because it got big and powerful, but  if they have market share of 90 percent of all search, like Google does, or  if they have vulnerabilities to the bad actors, like Facebook, how do you  regulate that?</p><p> DILLER:  Well, I think, we should resurrect some form of what was called,  the fairness doctrine.  So, if you have an opinion over on this side, you  have to air -- you have to provide a countervailing opinion on the other  side, that's called fairness doctrine.</p><p> And it ruled broadcasting for 25 years until, of course, there were then  lots more outlets for expression and they say, we don't need this anymore  because we've got enough diversity, OK?  Now, we have the opposite end of  this coin, which is they have too much out there, and too many divisive  currents running throughout it.</p><p> So, some semblance of this fairness doctrine that tries in its way, to not  have, essentially, one voice speaking, only one thing to one constituency  and another that continues to polarize everything, so I think, that may be  a solution.  It's complicated.</p><p> And by the way, everybody in broadcasting will hate it.  Listen, if we can  do anything through legislative process, we really ought to have  nonpartisan people get in a room and say, we've got to figure out ways not  to control this or crimp it, but realizing its power and realizing what  these very near-term effects have been for the last couple of years,  particularly.</p><p> And right, today, with what has happened in the last couple weeks,  something has got to be done.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And now, these companies are saying, OK, government is coming,  the big hand of government may start regulating us, let's try to start  policing this ourselves.  Has Facebook done a good job of trying to put  things in place?</p><p> DILLER:  I read this piece, this morning, in the New York Times, saying, is  Mark Zuckerberg too big to fail?  The idea of being that -- just like these  big banks, you know, they were too big to fail, they would have terrible  consequences.  That he is now a figure because he controls the company.   That he also, is too big to fail.  You can't let him fail and nobody can  replace him.</p><p> However, replacing him, people say, would be a good idea.  Here's the  thing, this is a holy -- this is a -- this is an extraordinary talent who  created a company and has been learning since childhood, 20 years old or  whatever, to be a good executive on the job.</p><p> He has done really well, so well, that his company got huge and got,  essentially, in front of his ability to control it tame it.  And they have  done a tremendous job trying, extraordinarily difficult ability to actually  do so.</p><p> But they've been trying and trying with some success and some failure, to  actually control this or let's say, adjudicate what is the right kind of  information for them to put over their platform.  And yes, I would say  within the construct of how difficult it is, they put huge amounts of  resources against it, they've announced to the markets that they're going  to have a slower growth because of it.</p><p> That they're going to have less net income, because they're going to have  to spend so much, all of which, they're doing.  And who else should do  that?  Now, I think, that through a level playing field, government  regulation is going to have to help him.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I want you to assess where we are, right now, in terms of where  the growth is, internet-related businesses.  Where do you see the growth in  the coming 5 to 10 years?</p><p> DILLER:  Well, I mean, the growth is just part of the revolution.  You  know, people kind of forget that the internet revolution is still in, like,  in year terms, really young, it's 22 or 23 years, and it took 10 years to  15 years just to get up enough bandwidth, to actually have rich media,  being served through it.</p><p> So, we're really at the very, very earliest stage of this.  Now, there are  companies that have, kind of, Expedia, for instance, one of the first  companies that kind of colonized travel for the internet, 20 years ago.</p><p> But, that's a world where the colonization of all these businesses is just  now coming on, so to speak, full line, where you can do almost everything  and almost everything more, through digital platforms, so the growth is  everywhere.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, it's really digital platforms, enabling you to do whatever  you want, so with Match, you're talking about dating, and with Expedia,  travel.  Are there areas that have not been capitalized on, in terms of  that digital platform?</p><p> DILLER:  Well, I'll give you one, which is when we're engaged in, but there  are lots of others.  I mean, financial -- FinTech, Financial Technology, is  just now, really getting into very much mainstream, and big companies are  being built in it.</p><p> For us, home services, being able, in your home, to do the same thing  essentially, you do, when you want a car, which is, you know, you want to  be taken someplace rather than drive yourself.  Where, you have an app, and  with Uber, you simply say, I want it now, and you see the car coming, you  can see where it is, and all that.</p><p> With home services, which has been the most difficult, one of the most  difficult areas to tame, because it's the most essentially vocal of  everything, which is, your water heater breaks, your -- whatever, air- conditioning doesn't work.  You have -- just take it on the emergency side  or the quick service side.</p><p> You want help, right?  Now, there is an app, in ANGI Homeservices, and  HomeAdvisor.  There is an app where, literally, you do the same thing.  You  say, I need a plumber, and it will show you plumbers hovering around, Uber- ish like, service providers.</p><p> And you'd be able to do the full circle of that transaction on your little  mobile device, because it's there, and it's ready for you.  Well, that is  just now at its very earliest stages.  And so, it's just one example where  growth is -- you know, runway is infinite.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, is there an opportunity to create another ANGI, to go aside  from that or you just use ANGI to, as the vehicle, to capitalize on that?</p><p> DILLER:  Well, no.  You have to think again, it's a platform.  And the  platform essentially takes consumers over here, who have needs, and service  providers over here, who provide services.  And through technology, it  makes a perfect match or good match.</p><p> So that's what all of those things are.  They're platforms.  So, once, by  the way, you have a platform, then, when you say, will others be created?   I mean, certainly, there'll be other platforms created, but there won't be  that many because the network effects have to come into play.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about Match, since you're talking about a  perfect match, when that first came on the scene, and when you -- we were  first talking about meeting somebody online, it was so foreign to so many  people, but it seems to have really resonated it, to the extent that people  are meeting and getting married, I mean, increasingly.  Where is that  business right now?</p><p> DILLER:  When you say increasingly, you know, we've been involved in this  for almost 20 years, I think.  I mean, we bought Match, quite early, in the  -- in the cycle.  We found that, you know what?  That's a very good idea.</p><p> We found this little company in Texas called Match.com, which we bought,  and the thing is, when you say it's just now becoming where people get  married, we've watched, 10 years ago, we had literally -- I think -- I  don't know what the count was, it was definitely above 1 million marriages  come, out of Match.com.</p><p> And then, the technology moves forward and forward, and you have Tinder,  which is actually younger, in terms of the people.  People on Match were  fairly serious.  I mean, yes, they wanted to date and see what would happen  on our little one-time date.  But they also really wanted relationships.</p><p> Tinder, kind of, got younger in earlier stage of, let's say, pre- relationships to say one-time dating or one-time whatever.  But now, is  moving into the same track that Match did, which is real relationships are  coming out of Tinder.</p><p> The thing is, it's an alternative to the historic going to bars, being  fixed up, et cetera, et cetera.  This actually does bring technology into  the mix.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Are you surprised on what has taken place  in the last 25 years?  I mean, when you --</p><p> DILLER:  Well, shocked more than -- I mean, not shocked.  You can't.  It's  a stupid thing.  When you are inside of a revolution, which I was just  lucky enough, in timing, to get into at the early stage, you know, you  don't -- you don't realize the effects of what is happening, so to speak,  around you.</p><p> But this is a truly radical revolution.  And right now, it's a very  troubled revolution, which happens at -- let's call it really early stages.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's going to talk more about where the trouble is, right now,  more of my exclusive interview with Barry Diller, next hour.  You know,  I've covered Barry Diller now for 25 years, and I've watched him amass this  incredible portfolio of internet companies.</p><p> And he really has highlighted or targeted or put his finger on some of the  real growth stories of the internet, whether it's dating or ANGI and home,  you know, HomeServices or Tinder, and so many others.  But, interesting,  James, that he mentions regulation, is going to be, sort of, the next leg  of what's to come.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  I hope it doesn't go there.  The history is that it ends up  favoring big incumbents and preventing new competitors.  And I think we'd  like more competition to some of these drives.</p><p> I also think he's talking about the fairness doctrine.  That is going to be  very tough to square with the first amendment, so not sure where that's  going.  But, as far as his investments, glad I don't have to date anymore,  but, it's nice that he's offering people some good technology to do this.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  And meanwhile, then, there's Google, thousands  of Google employees, around the world, walking off the job, protesting the  company's response to sexual misconduct allegations.</p><p> Lauren Simonetti is here with more details there, and I've been astounded  by the story, Lauren, with the maker -- the creator of the Android, getting  $90 million after some really rough behavior there.</p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Explosive allegations that  were found to be credible.  Andy Rubin is that man, he denies those  allegations.  Anyway, the message that we heard from Google workers  yesterday, that time is up for tech.</p><p>Google staff, thousand strong and more than they expected, are staging a  powerful global walkout, you are looking at some of the most amazing  pictures that we saw from yesterday.  They're protesting how the company  handles sexual harassment.</p><p> The catalyst was this bombshell New York Times report, that Google paid  Andy Rubin, $90 million in severance, even though, Google actually  concluded the allegations against him were credible.  It seems that the  sexual misconduct is more widespread at the company than we might have  thought.</p><p>Google says it fired 48 executives over similar allegations and it did not  give those executives exit packages.  But the power of yesterday's protest  underlines two things for me.  The first one is the influence of this  activist workforce, and how they influence their company to act in certain  ways.</p><p> We saw it with their response to Google, looking out ways to get into the  Chinese market.  And we saw with their criticism of Google, doing work with  the Pentagon, and also a sense of hypocrisy.  You know, they have this  motto, this code of conduct at Google, do the right thing, and employers  are calling foul on that.</p><p> They're protesting an end to forced arbitration, so victims of sexual  harassment would be able to sue and they're also looking for gender pay  equality, among other things.</p><p> So, they had a message, they had a mission.  The Google's CEO, Sundar  Pichai, he was at the New York Times DealBook Conference yesterday, and he  said this \"Moments like this, show that we didn't always get it right, and  so we are committed to doing better.\"  And he did silently or gave a muted  endorsement of the protest yesterday.</p><p> KELLY:  I talked to a couple of people in Silicon Valley, and one of the --  one of the biggest points that was made is that, there were a lot of  confidentiality agreements that were going around too, that were very  Weinstein-esque.</p><p> And so, that's what -- that lit a lot of fire for some of the people that  walked out, because I was talking to people yesterday, what do you make of  this?  Why is it so strong?  And they said, listen, there's a double  standard, executives weren't held accountable.  There were confidentiality  agreements and that just not in the best interests, so employees were  treated different than the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It is like the Weinstein situation, in the sense that there is a  double standard, politically, as well.  Organizations are -- who were  considered conservative, are targeted by the loudest voices in the country.</p><p> But I think that the Valley and these tech companies got a little bit of a  past because they are Bastian of liberalism, quite frankly.  And now, the  women who work there are coming out and saying hey, Human Resources was not  handling these sexual harassment complaints in the way that they should  have.</p><p> And I think it remained hidden and they weren't -- they weren't targeted  verbally and loudly, across the country because, again, that's where the  Dems live.</p><p> KELLY:  Well, they made Rubin resign, right?  And the situation was that  they gave such high praise.  So, here he was -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And $90 million, $90 million, as a hero's exit.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And there was another executive who quit this week, by the way.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  And also a lot of severance package too, so very not  transparent in how they dealt with these sexual misconduct allegations.   Time's up for tech.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, we'll talk more about that, coming up.  Thank  you so much, Lauren.  Coming up, it is job's day, we are expecting 190,000  jobs added to the economy, in the month of October, we're talking about  what that means for the midterm elections now four days away, special  coverage, coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, earnings are the story, certainly, Alibaba  set to report momentarily.  As soon as those numbers hit, we will get you  them.  The stock is up ahead of the numbers. What are you watching from  Alibaba, this morning, Kevin Kelly?  It's up 3-1/2 percent.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  What's pretty interesting is that actually Cloud should be  their biggest driver of growth.  They actually have a data center in  Silicon Valley.  They have -- they have one in Europe that they've opened  up.  They're expanding that business to take on Amazon, to take on  Microsoft, especially in China.  Microsoft has been expanding their Cloud  business there.</p><p> One of the interesting things is we need to see what Jack Ma says about the  trade war.  He said the trade war could last for over 20 years.  I don't  know if you remember that, but that made a lot of headlines, when he was  talking about that.</p><p> So, we're going to see some guidance because they're also investing in the  retail, pretty significantly, and expanding.  So expect the top line  revenues to do very well.  But actually, the bottom line to be very, very  thin.</p><p> And one of the things that may have impacted them, is that the U.S.  government actually ended the sweetheart deal on parcel services coming  over here in the United States, I heard there was a lot of subsidies, so  that ended recently, so we'll have to see guidance, how that's impacting  some of their sellers on their site, Tmall.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Was there still questions about how the company reports certain  revenue lines?  There were a lot of questions about the structure of the  revenue, reporting it, at this company, for a long time.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  And that's still taking hold, especially because they're  always moving things around if you think about their financial services,  Alipay, was actually taken out of the company right before their IPO.  And  now, Alipay is actually being influenced to break up their largest money  market mutual fund over in China, so there's not really any transparency or  accountability because it can move assets -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's why some people won't invest in Alibaba for that one  reason.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, unequivocally, absolutely.  But, Singles' Day, they've sort of  revolutionized how people transact.  They have, on November 11th, 1111,  they have Singles' Day.  And then, you saw Amazon follow them into that,  with Prime Day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right, Singles' Day.</p><p> FREEMAN:  I don't know if we will get any more visibility, but this  question, why he's leaving?  He's a relatively young man, I don't know if  it says something about his thoughts on China, going forward, but doesn't  seem like a bullish sign.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes, he's getting older and he's tired.</p><p> FREEMAN:  He's not that old.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's a young guy, but -- </p><p> KELLY:  I mean, that's what he said.  That's what he said.  That's what he  said.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  By the way, Apple, one of the issues with Apple is because of  transparency, as well.  They're not going to be reporting their unit sales  and that's why the stock is down, this morning.  We'll take a short break.</p><p> When we come back, stop the suds, WeWork is putting limits on how much free  beer their employees are entitled to.  Yes, how much free beer are you  entitled to drink during the day?  Next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, right  here, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning, everybody.  TGIF.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Friday, November 2nd.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button right now.</p><p> Major market moves this morning -- Apple shares the story of the day.  It  is down on weak revenue guidance and on the announcement that the company  is no longer going to be providing unit sales.  So we will not know  specific unit sales on a quarterly basis anymore.  The technology giant at  risk of losing a $1-trillion market valuation with today's move.  It is  down 5.25 percent.</p><p> The other big story of the market, of course, is the October jobs report.   Yes, it is jobs Friday right here.  The expectation is for 190,000 jobs  added to the economy in the month of October with the unemployment rate  holding steady at 3.7 percent which is a multi-decade low.</p><p> We will take a look at what this means for the midterm elections and the  market.  Of course, the midterms now four days away.</p><p> Check out futures this morning.  Even with the 5.5 percent selloff in  Apple, we're looking at a rally of 260 points on the Dow Jones Industrial  Average.  It's going to be up about 1 percent right out of the gate this  morning.  The S&amp;P 500 is expected to be up 21 points.  That's three- quarters of 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq right now up 15 points, a quarter of  a percent on the Nasdaq.</p><p> This after another day of gains yesterday.  This is the third day of gains  for the markets yesterday.  The Dow Industrials up 265 points at the close.   All the major indices finished at their highs of the -- or near their highs  of the session.  The Dow, S&amp;P up better than 1 percent; the Nasdaq up 1.75  percent, 128 points higher yesterday for the Nasdaq.</p><p> Markets this morning across the globe higher -- FT 100 up three-quarters of  a percent, 53 points higher in London; one-and-a-third percent higher in  Paris on the CAC 40 at 66 points higher; and the DAX index in Germany up  172 points, that's 1.5 percent higher in Germany. </p><p> In Asia, overnight gains across the board -- check it out.  Best performer  Hong Kong -- Hang Seng index up better than 4 percent overnight.</p><p> On the earnings front, we are watching Alibaba earnings later this morning.   We will hear from oil giants and Dow components, ExxonMobil and Chevron.   We'll have those numbers and analysis.</p><p> Right now, it's really Apple which is a big focus but these are coming out  soon.</p><p> China trade in focus -- this was important yesterday in the markets.   President Trump spoke with China's president Xi Jinping and apparently  there was progress in the trade dispute from what we understand from that  phone call.  It definitely helped markets rally yesterday in the middle of  the day.</p><p> Here's what IAC chairman Barry Diller told me about China's trade practices  yesterday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARRY DILLER, CHAIRMAN, IAC:  I am not a proponent of quote, \"trade wars\" - - their trade practices have to change, trying to pick trade wars.  If you  let an unfettered trade war actually take place, which is in our control,  it would be disastrous for everybody.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest coming up.  More of Barry Diller this  morning.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Friday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street  Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and Benchmark  managing partner, Kevin Kelly.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  So Alibaba is actually up right  now 5 percent in the premarket because they actually beat pretty  significantly on the revenues and on their bottom line.  They have a  revenue forecast cut on macroeconomic conditions though.  So even though  they did beat, so it was initially up 5 percent, now it seems like it's  coming down a little bit because probably of this forecast of macro  concerns.</p><p> And one of the things they're actually talking about is also the money they  need to spend into their streaming services.  So in order for them to be  the Netflix of China, they're indicating they need to spend significantly  more on their content.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So it is losing ground quickly.  </p><p> KELLY:  It is losing ground quickly.  But they said their annual active  buyers are actually up 23 percent so they're doing very well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So the numbers are better than expected -- </p><p> (CROSS TALKING)</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- but they're going to be having to see costs go up.  </p><p> KELLY:  Yes.  They're seeing costs go up, and also they're guiding revenues  down because of macro conditions.  So unless Trump and President Xi Jinping  have beautiful chocolate cake, Alibaba is very concerned.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The chocolate cake moment.  </p><p> We've got a lot coming up this morning.  Part two of my exclusive interview  with the chairman and senior executive of both IAC and Expedia Group.   That's Barry Diller.  He weighs in on Amazon, Google, U.S. trade relations  with China as well as General Electric as well.  You don't want to miss a  moment of it.  So do stay with us for that interview.</p><p> But we want to get to Apple because the stock is trading down this morning  on disappointing guidance.  It is on track to shave about 85 points from  the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Stock right now down 5.5 percent as CEO  Tim Cook said that the company will no longer give unit sales figures in  future reports.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  This is like if you go to the market and you push  your cart up to the cashier and she says or he says how many units you have  in there?  It doesn't -- it doesn't matter a lot, how many units there are  in there in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  Well, I can understand the analogy.  Does it not  matter?  I would imagine analysts -- </p><p> KELLY:  No.  I think it matters.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  If your investors tell you it  matters, then it matters.  Whatever your messaging is -- more information  is better.  You can't be in the news business and say I want less  information from the world's $1 trillion company.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   No, I'm not going to say that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Obviously, you do want more information and as people think about  the company's future, they want to see in each segment how it's doing.  But  I would say in his defense, this has never been a company that -- where  it's about volume.  Apple really has not been the big volume producer.   That's the android universe.</p><p> So what Apple sells is to a smaller market but to a much more lucrative  market, very high-priced, very high-margin products.  So if you're seeing  what you want to see on the revenue and the earnings from each of these  products -- </p><p> KELLY:  I beg to differ.  </p><p> (CROSS TALKING)</p><p> FREEMAN:  I don't know that it's the end of the world that you don't see  how many devices.  </p><p> KELLY:  It's not about that.  It's not even about the iPhone anymore.  It's  60 percent of sales now.  It used to be a lot more of that.  It actually  used to be 75 percent of sales.  But we need to get unit sales on Mac  books, on their home pods, on their watches -- that is the next leg of  growth for them and attribution into their ecosystem.</p><p> So the problem is that they missed on the services side.  In order for the  services side to grow, we need to know how many units they're selling of  each product line.  So I need to know what's in that shopping cart because  they missed on the services.</p><p> They had less than $10 billion.  They're saying that it's $10 billion.  It  was actually less than that.  It was $9.981 billion when every analyst  across the street had at least $10.18 billion.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We should point out that services -- </p><p> (CROSS TALKING)</p><p> KELLY:  So that's the biggest issue.</p><p> FREEMAN:  The market agrees with you.  Over time, I think this is probably  not going to be -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're calling this a miss.  </p><p> KELLY:  No -- but this is a miss.  They missed on unit sales for iPhones  which is 60 percent of the revenue.  And then they're refreshing all their  Macbook Pros and their watches and now we're not going to get guidance into  that?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The growth -- they missed on the forecast for the December  quarter that it was -- they show slowing growth there.  That was the  revenue forecast.  In terms of the services business, we should just point  out that's app store sales, Apple pay use, music streaming, subscriptions  stuff like that -- revenue growth there was up 17 percent.  That's slower  in recent quarters.</p><p> When you have a valuation like this, you have to -- your growth rates need  to be bigger and bigger and bigger, not smaller and smaller and smaller.  </p><p> KELLY:  That's it.  And listen Morgan Stanley just downgraded the price  target from $247 to $226 and their analyst has been very good on the stock.   You had BAML -- Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch downgrade their price target  to $223 -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Don't forget what Dan Miles -- I know I keep saying this -- but  he was right.  I mean what's your take on inventory because Dan said that  in the second quarter inventory was up 89 percent.  And that also goes hand  in hand with the unit sales because if you've got all this inventory, first  you've got get rid of that before you actually start producing more.  </p><p> KELLY:  That's it.  And they're not expecting to sell more that's why  you're seeing them increase the price of their products -- ok.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> KELLY:  And then they also had their component costs go down.  So that's  great.  But I don't invest in the stock market looking in the rearview  mirror.  I invest looking forward.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's look forward to the jobs report.  That's another major  story this morning because the jobs report is coming out in an hour-and-a- half.</p><p> We want to check out one of the election's most pivotal states this morning  and that's Florida.</p><p> Kristina Partsinevelos as has more from the Sunshine State this morning.   And Kristina -- it's been a good jobs market in Florida as well.  Good  morning to you.  </p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   And you're right.</p><p> Yes, it is a pivotal race.  It's a swing state.  And this year is no  different.  We have a lot of people looking at the governor's race and the  senate race.</p><p> We have former President Obama who is going to be here in Miami where I am  right now on Route 1.  It's very early in the morning so it's still quite  dark out.  He's throwing his support behind the Dems.  You've got Andrew  Gillum who's running for governor and then incumbent Bill Nelson who is  also going for Senate.  So those are the two candidates that former  President Obama is supporting.</p><p> If we take a look at the Real Clear Politics polls and average multi-polls  (ph) that we're seeing across the board for governor in Florida, you're  seeing a slight lead, a little bit less than 3 percent for Gillum.  Gillum  is 39 years old, a progressive, mayor of Tallahassee -- pretty much pushing  for higher minimum wage and higher corporate taxes.</p><p> He is going against Republican Ron DeSantis who has the full support of  President Trump.  They will be together on Saturday in Pensacola.  And you  have Ron DeSantis who is an advocate for gun control.  There hasn't been a  Democrat who's been elected for the governor's race since 1994.  </p><p> And we switch over to Senate race which is also closely watched -- we look  at the polls over there from Real Clear Politics again, you're seeing as of  this morning less than 2 percent lead for Bill Nelson.  So Bill Nelson, 75  years old, a centrist -- he's pushing for a ban on assault rifles.</p><p> And he's going against Governor Rick Scott who's very familiar here because  he served two terms as governor.  He wants to continue his political life  which is why he's running for Senate.  A lot can happen here.  </p><p> We have former President Obama here, in Georgia on Friday and in Chicago on  Sunday.  Lots of movement in Florida and we're going to be here.  </p><p> Back to you -- guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's really an important race.  Kristina -- thank you.   We'll keep checking back.  Kristina Partsinevelos is in Miami this morning.</p><p> Joining us right now is Florida Congressman Ted Yoho.  He's running for  office in Florida's third congressional district and is on the Foreign  Affairs and Agriculture House Committees.  Sir -- it's good to have you on  this morning.  </p><p> REP. TED YOHO (R), FLORIDA:  Hi.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p> YOHO:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you feel going into the midterms in terms of your own  prospects?  </p><p> YOHO:  I feel really good.  We've got a lot of momentum on the ground.   We've got people out door-knocking, making phone calls.  We're doing  rallies and coffees all over the district.</p><p> The momentum is on our side that we're seeing.  And I think you're going to  see it carry through the governor's race and the Senate race with Rick  Scott.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, it doesn't look like that.  We're looking at the numbers.   And if you believe the polls, it looks like Gillum is in the lead and even  Nelson is in the lead.  What do you think about that?  </p><p> YOHO:  Well, we got internal polls-- we've got internal polls that show  different.  If you go back to the last presidential election, they had  Hillary Clinton leading the day of the election.  So I think there's a lot  of movement on the ground.  I think you're going see this. </p><p> And then you've got our governor's race -- you know, you've got a guy  that's under FBI investigation and he's got a liberal progressive agenda  that wants to roll back what Rick Scott has done.</p><p> And then you compare Rick Scott's record with Bill Nelson is just like a  place holder and he's not accomplished a whole lot.  Rick Scott has created  1.6 million jobs in this state, lowered taxes and we've got one of the best  ratings, if not the best rating in the country for a state.</p><p> Rick Scott has done an awesome job.  He'll do that in the senate.  And I  can't wait for him to get up there and work with him.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- it's Dagen McDowell.  The unemployment rate in  the state of Florida is below the national average.  It was 3.5 percent in  Florida.  </p><p> YOHO:  It sure is.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Rick Scott took that economy to a trillion dollars in terms of  its value.  </p><p> YOHO:  He sure did.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Why isn't that resonating with the voters?  Why wouldn't he be  leading Bill Nelson?  </p><p> YOHO:  Well, you know, I guess politics.  You know, you've got all these  negative ads going out there from both sides.  Mainly, you see more attacks  from the other side.</p><p> But then you look at, you know, where he stands on things.  Rick Scott has  not varied on who he is and what he said and what he said he was going to  accomplish.  He's done that.  And the voters -- like I said, our internal  polls show a different story than what you're seeing on national polls.</p><p> And then, you know, again I can account for District 3 which is six  counties in north central Florida.  But we talk to people all over the  state.  This economy that we have, we've not seen this before.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> YOHO:  And then you take, you know, the tax cuts that we did with President  Trump and rolled back regulations, that fits hand in hand.  Andrew Gillum  wants to go the other way -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> YOHO:  -- and Bill Nelson want to go the other way.  The people of Florida  are not ready for that.  </p><p> (CROSS TALKING)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And so you're just -- you're not believing -- you're not  believing these polls.  You say your polls say something different.  </p><p> How important is the China story for Floridians?  I mean the U.S.-China  trade issue?  The President yesterday sounded optimistic because he had a  phone call with the Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p> But I spoke with the former CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer yesterday,  along with the chairman of IAC Barry Diller, and they were both incredibly  concerned about China's business practices.  Listen to this.  I've got to  get your reaction.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  90 percent of companies are using the Microsoft operating  platform and only 1 percent are paying for it.  How do we -- what are we  going to do that China keeps stealing everything this way?  I mean that's  pretty extraordinary.  </p><p> STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT:  I'm a free trader by nature.  I went  to school, economics -- it's the best thing for the world.  This one's a  tricky issue because it's absolutely clear that the rules don't apply in  China and the U.S. government needs to do something -- whether tariffs are  right or wrong, I'm silent on that point.</p><p> But without any pressure from the U.S. government, we're talking about $10  billion plus for example in Microsoft that would go into profit.  </p><p> DILLER:  Their trade practices have to change.  And us being tough-minded  about it, I think it's sensible.  I think us being outrageous and excessive  about it is dangerous.  I don't think the trade war is -- if you let an  unfettered trade war actually take place, which is in our control, it will  be disastrous for everybody.  So they will have to mature their practices.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman-- your reaction?  Is this an issue for Floridians?  </p><p> YOHO:  It's an issue all over the nation.  But what President Trump is  doing is something that had to be done.  Unchecked it would get worse.  And  so I'm glad he's doing what he's doing and I stand behind him.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- it's good to have you on the program.  We'll be  watching the developments on Tuesday.  It's nice (ph) to see you -- thank  you.</p><p> YOHO:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ted Yoho.</p><p> We also invited Congressman Yoho's opponent.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> We are watching earnings.  We get two more Dow components coming this  morning.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with all the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  A lot of market moving  news before the market even opens -- Maria.</p><p> ExxonMobil expected to post double digit gains in earnings and revenue from  a year ago with the average price for oil up 34 percent for the third  quarter in general.</p><p> We're also going to get results from Chevron today.  Analysts looking for  the company's profits to double with revenue up nearly 30 percent.  That's  the oil story.</p><p> Alibaba out with its latest results just a few minutes ago.  Revenue rising  54 percent from a year ago to $12.4 billion.  Shares are substantially  higher in the premarket, up almost 6 percent right now.  All right.  That  stock though is off the highs from previous revenue guidance.</p><p> And also, we're looking at Apple, real quick here.  The stock is trading  sharply lower, down almost 6 percent in the premarket.  Earnings, as we've  been talking about today topped the street's estimates in the latest  quarter but Apple also issued disappointing guidance for the current  quarter which includes, of course, the holiday season and we've been  talking about the unit sales issue.  This raises questions about weaker  than expected demand for their more expensive new iPhones which we're not  going to be getting numbers on anymore.</p><p> All right.  There is this -- a group of Tesla shareholders wants to put  tighter reins on CEO Elon Musk.  Three Tesla investors sent the board a  letter saying the company should permanently separate the positions of  chairman and chief executive, both of which Musk holds.  That would go  beyond Tesla's settlement with the SEC that required Musk to step down as  chairman for just three years.</p><p> The directors are also calling for more turnover on the company's board,  recommending a time line be set for some directors to leave.  There is  Tesla in the premarket, up almost three-quarters of a percent.</p><p> And then there is this -- bottomless beer no more.  Co-working space Wework  is now setting a limit for what used to be bottomless kegs of beer for its  tenants.  The New York tenants are now going to be limited to just four  beers per day-- each person per day.  Wework says that the change was  determined by software to help manage the beer supply.</p><p> So it's a software issue, not the fact that people were getting drunk at  Wework while they were working there.  Ok.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't even understand that.  They were drinking more than  four beers a day during the day?  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  Bottomless beer, bottomless mimosas -- you know what  happens.  This is what the story is.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's in your cup?  </p><p> KELLY:  Oh yes.  This is definitely not gin.  It's for sure water.</p><p> But I just wanted real quickly on the Alibaba side -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Thanks -- Cheryl.</p><p> KELLY:  I accidentally said that they beat on the top line, miss on the  bottom.  It was the inverse.  Alibaba missed on the top line, beat  significantly on the bottom line.  But the main takeaway is that they  actually guided their revenue forecast down 4 percent to 6 percent going  forward.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Look at this.  Stock is still up -- Kevin.</p><p> KELLY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's up almost 6 percent even though it's a revenue miss.   Thank you.</p><p> Coming up, a scare on the high seas to tell you about -- details on the  terrifying moments that caused a cruise ship to tilt.  That's coming up.</p><p> Then countdown to the midterms is on, we break down why the number one  issue for voters apparently according to the polls is health care.</p><p> Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> We are only four days away from the midterm elections.  In a recent Fox  News poll, health care is the number one issue driving Americans to the  voting booth.  Joining us right now is Dr. Joseph Galati.  He is the author  of \"Eating Yourself Sick\".</p><p> Why do you think health care has become a top priority in our country is  the number one issue here?  Dr. Galati -- good to see you.  Thanks for  being here.  </p><p> DR. JOSEPH GALATI, AUTHOR, \"EATING YOURSELF SICK\":  Well -- thank you,  Maria.</p><p> You know, health care is always a hot button topic.  Our patients -- the  ones that I'm dealing with in Texas come to me with all sorts of insurance  problems.  They're worried about pre-existing.  They're worried about  insurance companies not covering certain procedures or disorders that they  have.</p><p> And so a day doesn't go by that patients are not sitting in my office,  talking and complaining about their health care.  How it's going to be  solved, I don't know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> GALATI:  It's really a big, behemoth problem.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So James -- lay out the issue for us in terms of pre-existing  conditions.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes.  So the idea is you don't want to let people buy insurance  on their way to the hospital.  This would be the argument to say let's have  an insurance market.  If you are sick already, you don't need insurance.   You need health care.</p><p> So you need a system that allows people to get the care they need but if  you're going to have an insurance market, they have to be able to sell to  healthy people, not just sick people and so that's the theory.  Now, the  President has said he doesn't want to change anything with pre-existing  conditions.  That wasn't changed obviously.  The Republicans never rewrote  Obamacare.</p><p> So it's kind of a phony issue in that way.  But to me, I don't know if  you're hearing from patients, this issue of the Medicare-for-all plan,  which ends Medicare and ends private insurance, in other words, it ends all  pre-existing coverage, every person in the United States this is the plan  that most Democrats in the House have endorsed -- Bernie Sanders, a lot of  the Senate candidates.  It ends all coverage in the U.S. and creates a new  government plan.  What does that mean for patients?  </p><p> GALATI:  You know, when you read about this Medicare for all, it's very  thin on details.  It's very thin on whether administrative costs are going  to go down, whether it's going to provide better health care.  That is  really unclear.</p><p> And unfortunately, whenever people hear something for all, people jump on  the bandwagon and say this is good for America.  When really if we're  voting on it or talking about it, the details are thin and you know, what  really are we dealing with?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  But we do know from the legislation whether it's the Bernie  Sanders plan or the one that most House Democrats have co-sponsored, it  explicitly says private insurance goes away.  Medicare goes away.</p><p> So this is the end of pre-existing coverage.  Not just particular  conditions.  Your whole health plan is changing.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  People do not understand this.  </p><p> FREEMAN:  I don't know why this isn't an issue in this election.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And you're all about wellness and prevention, I mean  getting ahead of disease.  </p><p> GALATI:  It is.  And the sad part is, in my area of liver disease that I  take care of, we see patients, we counsel them on staying well.  Because  taking care of somebody at the end is not the way to take care of yourself.</p><p> And so in the book, \"Eating Yourself Sick\", 30 years of interviewing  thousands of patients, I see that.  I had a conversation with a patient  five years ago, six years ago, and they just continued to decline.  And the  common thread in so many of these diseases -- fatty liver disease,  cirrhosis, diabetes, heart disease, cancer -- it's what we're eating.</p><p> It sounds real simple but what Americans are eating -- the processed foods  -- is crazy.  We have lost our way on eating at home, cooking at home with  your children.  And what I propose, as simple as it is, is to get back to  the basics.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  It's prevention all the way.  Get ahead of  disease.  That will eliminate all the costs that we're faced with in the  terms of cure and care rather than prevention.</p><p> GALATI:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dr. Galati -- we could talk about this all day.  </p><p> GALATI:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This is probably our favorite subject, actually.  </p><p> GALATI:  It is.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.  </p><p> GALATI:  Absolutely.  It's been a pleasure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  Joseph Galati there.</p><p> Coming up -- the streaming wars are heating up, technology giants Amazon  and (AUDIO GAP) Netflix.</p><p> Stay with us for part two of my exclusive interview with the chairman and  senior exec of both IAC and Expedia Group.  Barry Diller weighs in on big  tech.</p><p> Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> 730</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning.  TGIF.  Thanks for joining us, everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   And it is jobs Friday, November 2nd this morning.  Your top stories right  now 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.  We are 30 minutes away from   the October jobs' report.  The expectation calls for job creation about  1901,000 jobs added to economy last month with the unemployment rate  holding steady at 3.7 percent.</p><p> President Trump weighing in on this yesterday. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  So today, right now, we have  more Americans working than at any time, any time in the history of our  country.  That's pretty good, that's pretty good.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are looking at rally in stocks ahead of these numbers.  Take  a look at where we stand with the Dow Jones Industrial average 337 points  right now, 1-1/3 percent.  Big bounce this morning, S&amp;P 500 up one percent,  253 points higher.  NASDAQ up a quarter of a percent.  19 points higher  right now.  Futures indicating a big rally at the start of trading.  </p><p> Major indices posted a third day of gains yesterday in fact, all finishing  near the highs of the session at the close where the Dow Industrials up  better than  one percent as was the S&amp;P 500, and the NASDAQ with a gain of  1-3/4 percent, 128 points higher and NASDAQ 264 points higher on the Dow.   Checking global markets this morning.  The momentum continues in Europe as  you can see, the FT-100 is up almost  one percent, 58 points higher.</p><p> The CAC Quarante is up 1-1/2 percent and the DAX Index in Germany up 1-2/3  percent.  Earnings are out on ExxonMobil, revenue beating expectations a  $76.6 billion for ExxonMobil revenue versus an estimate 73.55 billion.   ExxonMobil reporting earnings as we speak right now.  The stock is up three  percent.  There is a look at some of the big names this morning in terms of  earnings.</p><p>Apple, you know, reported a miss down six percent.  We're going to talk  about that right now. ExxonMobil is reporting right now better-than- expected revenue. Stock is up three percent.  Chevron, we're waiting on at  2-1/3 percent.  As you can see in Alibaba is up six percent, company  reported better-than-expected earnings revenue was light we are waiting on  chevron Alibaba reported better than expected earnings but revenue was  light.</p><p> We are waiting on Chevron and Alibaba reported strong results.  Weak  guidance was the concern for Alibaba but still the stock is up six percent.   China trade in focus this morning, President Trump speaking with the  president of China yesterday, Xi Jinping and he said progress was shown in  the trade dispute.  That moved markets yesterday.</p><p> And then there's this.  Protesting going on at Google.  Thousands of  employees at the search giant's walking off the job yesterday over the  company's response to sexual misconduct allegations.  The fallout coming up  right here this morning.</p><p> All those stories coming up right here and joining me to break it all down,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The Wall Street Journal's Assistant  Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman and \"MAKING MONEY WITH CHARLES PAYNE\"  host, Charles Payne.  Good to see you.</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  </p><p> PAYNE:  It's a great looking at -- interesting morning, huh?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are all hands on deck to get the jobs report out. </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Mr. Optimism is what I was  going to call you and sure enough.</p><p> PAYNE:  Hey, man.  I feel - no one is interesting when I went to bed last  night you figured OK, Apple is going to be responsible for at least 100  points to the downside on the Dow.  So you wake up early in the morning and  the Dow is up 200, 300 points, you're like, what the heck is going on?   This is kind of a good strange.  And it's -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Apple is down six percent, market is up 300.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, Apple, Apple - I mean so, essentially add on another 100  points and that's where the market would be if Apple didn't, you know, have  such a, you know, controversial poor, poor earnings report.  Guys, can I  just say one thing on this China thing?  I think it's remarkable from  President Trump's point of view.  So you have this great phone call with  President xi and then you come out with these indictments, right?</p><p> These criminal indictments, the Department of Justice.  In other words,  we're saying, hey, we're not going to use the World Trade Organization,  it's as game system.  We're going to go at you directly.  Now, people have  to understand, this united microelectronics, the Taiwanese company, their  partner in this is a $6 billion state-funded Chinese company.</p><p> We are going directly at them.  Last week we got five Chinese spies on  stealing technology.  I mean, this president, he has a great conversation  with the president of China, he says, but that isn't stop at nothing.  We  are going to come after you in a way that you have never seen has come  after before.  I like that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I like it too.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- a better - the Journal writes today in the editorial page  that this a better strategy to cracking down on our biggest problems with  China.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  His indictments are.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Than the blunder bus are ham-handed tariffs which punishes those  who are not the perpetrators in this.  There are also --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PAYNE:  -- China, too though and I think economically, we have to do that.   I think it's one of these things where, you know, it's a sacrifice, it's --  you got to say hey, are we willing to do this, are we willing to take a  short period of pain for long term not just prosperity but fairness.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But their argument is you punish the actual culprits.  You  punish --</p><p> PAYNE:  The country is the culprit.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> PAYNE:  The country is the culprit.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But their argument Charles is that the steel and aluminum  tariffs punish those who are not stealing intellectual property and are  manufacturing -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm not uncomfortable with because whatever it takes to get  China to get in line and stop stealing theft behavior is what the  administration needs to do.  I mean, nobody has been pushing back on this.   I understand the implications, the negative implications of the steel and  aluminum but all bets are off in my opinion when it comes to China.  </p><p> JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think we can do all agree  that attacking a specific issue of theft, industrial espionage is a good  idea.  We probably may be regret that the President let ZTE off the hook.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why did he let ZTE off the hook?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FREEMAN:  I think looking back, maybe he might say now that he didn't  really see the reciprocation he was hoping for but maybe this phone call is  the beginning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PAYNE:  I tell you something, someone who came up as - as a broker in New  York City, I see President Trump, the classic New York City salesman and  one of the things the first thing I was taught by the best sales people on  Wall Street is you always give a little but you take back a lot.  I thought  that that was olive branch to President Xi saying, listen, I'm going  against even members of my own party.</p><p> I'm going to do something for you, but you're going do have to do something  for me later.  And so I think he established a great platform for  negotiations by doing that with the other side.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But what about Dagen's point that this messes up the  whole supply chain?</p><p> PAYNE:  Well, you know, it's -- again, it's a short-term thing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> PAYNE:  The supply chain can move to any country with slave labor or child  labor.  There's a lot of countries out there looked at but this is a short- term thing.  If we're going to be worried about this, I'm telling you, six  years from now China will blow up one of our nuclear submarines because  they will have stolen enough technology from us to be able to do that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's not that - I'm not debating the goal, l'm debating the  means to fighting.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  I understand.</p><p> FREEMAN:  But that's OK.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> FREEMAN:  -- no one has fought it before in an effective way.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> FREEMAN:  And on a 232 tarrif, I will tell you this, I do think President  Trump could easily let give an exemption to Canada and Mexico and I think  that would alleviate, the market would love it and I think after the USMCA,  I'm not sure why he hasn't done that -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- next year.  It's not signed yet.  Congress has to -</p><p> FREEMAN:  Right, right.  But I'm just saying though, again, as part of the  negotiations right, listen, again, give-and-take, that part is -- yesterday  when he answer to a guy asked him manufacturing number came out, you heard  industry after industry, that was their only complaint.  It wasn't about  the China part of this, it was about to Dagen's point, to steel and  aluminum part of this.</p><p> Even though in this earning season, the dollar has been a much bigger  problem but for those companies that have talked to tariffs, whether it's  Caterpillar or others, it's been on the steel and aluminum part.  I agree  with you on there, I really believe, I really believe we can do something  at 232.  Not with China but at least with Canada --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Shall we talk jobs for a second, jobs in America, the October  jobs' report is out in - what?  23 minutes under half an hour from now,  economists are looking for 190,000 jobs added to the economy in the month  of October.  The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.7  percent.  The President was in Missouri yesterday and he touted as strong  jobs market and economy.  </p><p> Joining us right now is MacroMavens President, Stephanie Pomboy and the  Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath.  Great to  see you both.  Thank you so much for being here.  </p><p> STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS LLC:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p> JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stephanie, four days until the midterm elections.  The economy  is obviously one of the most important issues, and now we're seeing this  bounce back to a horrible month of October which you predicted.</p><p> POMBOY:  Well, you know, we're -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What now?</p><p> POMBOY:  That's the question, what now?  So I mean, the next couple of  months, anything can happen, you usually get your Santa Claus rally into  year-end and the economic data, this morning's number especially, are  really going to be hard to infer some broader economic message from because  we have the hurricane effect, you know, this morning's report, we'll have  the recovery from the Florence Hurricane.</p><p> And it's not clear that we'll yet have the impact of Michael.  So, this  number could actually surprise on the upside but then, you know, all of  these sort of temporary factors are going to end come January 1, at the  same time we no longer have the year-on-year effect of the tax cuts.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Oh god.  Here comes Debbie Downer.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> POMBOY:  Mr. Optimism next to the mistress of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I got to go through some of your concerns, these are real  concerns, and this is important.  So hold on there.</p><p> POMBOY:  OK.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jon, you just heard what Stephanie said, this is going to be a  little hurricany this month in terms of the jobs number.  What else should  we be forced on when this report comes out in about 20 minutes?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Oh, the wage number, the wage number is going to be pretty  good.  We could get average hourly earnings up more than three percent for  the first time in years, and I think that's what we're all going to be  talking about in about 21 minutes that, you know, we're finally seeing what  the unemployment rate down under four percent, you know, some sign that  worker wages are picking up.</p><p> And we'll probably be talking about, you know, what does that mean for  workers?  Good news for workers, what is - also, what does it mean for the  Fed on its interest rate policies?  </p><p> FREEMAN:  And we're also looking at how many people come back into the  labor force.  I guess this would be maybe, Steph, a -- an argument if the  number surprises to the downside doesn't necessarily mean business aren't  thriving, we saw that NFIB report yesterday still at record levels,  companies that can't fill open positions.  </p><p> POMBOY:  Absolutely, I mean, I -- this is -- the struggle is that, you  know, you have a tight labor market in terms of the skilled jobs.  I'm  sorry, in terms of the unskilled jobs, you know, people just -- sorry I'm  getting -- you can't mind qualified labor to fill the job.  So that's the  persistent concern but the problem is, you know, it's not like you can just  say, OK, here are 10,000 suddenly qualified people.</p><p> It's going to be a longer term struggle to fill those jobs in terms of  apprenticeships and really, education and training and whatnot.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Stephanie, one thing that you talked a lot about is the  consumer and whether or not we're actually seeing a strong consumer out  there, two-thirds of the economy and then business spending in the last GDP  report was gone, we have been talking a lot about capital expenditures  being a real positive.  Do you see any change in those two things?  These  are two important things you've been pointing out.  </p><p> POMBOY:  Right.  So, I guess, you know, again, when you look at these  numbers right now, it's really hard to infer a broader economic message  because, you know, the J-Curve Effect from, the tariff which is basically  you're going to pull forward as much spending in inventory build ahead of  the impact of the increase in tariffs come Jan 1, that is boosting  consumption and notwithstanding the weaker print in third quarter.</p><p> Industrial production and, you know, Capex beyond what normally be.  </p><p> PAYNE:  The consumer -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> POMBOY:  And the consumer -</p><p> PAYNE:  There's no signs that the consumer is not strong.</p><p> POMBOY:  But what I would point out is in that third quarter report, the  strength was acutlaly in goods which fits with this whole J-Curve, you  know, where you would buy now, what you anticipate will be for expensive.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PAYNE:  A lot of people sitting there and -</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> PAYNE:  -- on stuff because of the tariffs now.  The consumer is ultra,  ultra strong.  I looked at visa's results, American Express - I mean,  MasterCard.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You did, huh?</p><p> PAYNE:  The third quarter numbers.  Yesterday we learned that second  quarter, wages and salaries grew at their fastest pace in a decade, in a  decade.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What does all this mean for the midterm elections now  four days away, we are days away a few days away from what many people are  calling including myself, one of the most consequential elections of our  time in terms of the midterm elections.  Jeff Flock is live in Indianapolis  this morning with that angle.  Jeff, good morning to you.</p><p> JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Certainly the way it seems,  Maria.  Good morning to you.  Signs are up perhaps you see for the  President's visit here later today.  How important is Indiana, well,  President Trump will be here twice in the waning days of the campaign  starting with a rally tonight at Southport High School.  That in support of  Mike Braun, he is the Republic - the Republican businessman who is  challenging Democrat Joe Donnelly here in Indiana.</p><p> Yesterday, Braun getting the support from Senator Lindsey Graham who says,  I like Joe Donnelly, my colleague, but this is the first time I've actually  meaningfully campaigned against a colleague because it's too important this  time, we've got to elect Republicans like Mike Braun.  Listen to Braun.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MIKE BRAUN (R), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, INDIANA:  Joe has tried to align  himself in the middle as being somebody behind Trump on every important  piece of legislation he has voted with the radical left.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> FLOCK:  Donnelly we should point out is a man who has been rated as the  most bipartisan Democrat in the Senate and he has shied away from  supporting President Trump.  He says he's even helped him build the wall.   I leave you with a poll, Maria, the latest poll that had been back-and- forth but our latest Fox News poll shows Democrat Joe Donnelly up 45 to 38  percent, seven-point --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> FLOCK:  -- because they need the President.  We'll see.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Did this lead - does this lead just widen just in the last  couple days?  That is a big lead on Donnelly.  </p><p> FLOCK:  It did.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Jeff, thank you.  Jeff Flock.  </p><p> FLOCK:  I know.  The polls have been back-and-forth all along.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sure has.</p><p> FLOCK:  But we got him ahead.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Jeff flock is in Indianapolis.  Coming up.  All eyes on Apple.   Why the technology giant stock is down in the premarket.  Look at this,  this is the low of the morning.  Now down 6-1/2 percent after the earnings  report.  Stay with us. </p><p> (COMMCERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  An earnings bonanza.  ExxonMobil the latest to  report earnings this morning.  Cheryl Casone with all the details now.   Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  This first number is  pretty good, Maria.  Let's take a look at ExxonMobil, they reported better- than-expected results for this last quarter.  Earnings per share jump 57  percent from a year ago because the average price for oil is up 44 percent  in the third quarter.  So there's a correlation there.  The stock though  under a little bit of pressure in premarket.</p><p> We are waiting on Chevron.  They're going to report their latest earnings,  maybe about 15 minutes or so.  At this point, the stock is up two percent  in the premarket.  Analysts  are looking for their quarterly profits to  more than double.  Revenue up nearly 30 percent.  Well, right now  ExxonMobil, a different story.  Taking a look at shares of Alibaba, that  was rallying right now, off of the highs.</p><p> The company did cut revenue guidance for the full year.  Earnings per share  did beat expectations, revenue coming in just below the street's estimate.   Alibaba up more than three percent right now.  And of course we're watching  shares of Apple this morning, big time, trading sharply lower as you  mentioned.  This is the lowest trade we really seen on Apple this morning,  down about six and more than a quarter percent there</p><p> They did, of course, hit the street estimates in this - in this last  quarter but the issue disappointing guidance for the current quarter.  So  they beat the estimates, but the guidance was a problem.  The holiday  season, the units that you're talking about.  And there's a lot of  questions about weaker-than-expected demand for their more expensive new  iPhones going forward.</p><p> Also we're watching this story for you.  Google says it is listening to  their employees and they will consider ideas on how they treat complaints  of sexual harassment of the company.  Thousands of workers at Google  officers around the world yesterday stage walked.  They demanded a better  reporting system and they want an elimination of forced arbitration in  these types of cases.</p><p> The walkout following the New York Times report that Executive Andy Rubin  received $90-million pay out after he left the firm despite what Google  considered a credible allegation of sexual misconduct against him.  Shares  of parent Alphabet are higher in the premarket just fractionally, Maria.   Those are your headlines.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  We are just a few  minutes away from the October jobs' report.  We are all hands-on deck this  morning, what you need to know ahead of the numbers, next.  Back in a  moment.  NASDAQ just turned negative.  Down 2-1/2 points.  Dow Industrials  holding on to a gain of 237.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMCERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The October jobs' report due out in just a few  minutes.  Economists are expecting it to show 190,000 jobs added to the  economy last month.  It's expected to be unemployment rate holding steady  at 3.7 percent.  We are all hands-on deck this morning.  We got Benchmark  Managing Partner Kevin Kelly, EmployBridge Professional Division President,  Joanie Courtney with us.</p><p> Along with Senior Vice President and head of Traditional Investments Group  at U.S. Bank Wealth Management Lisa Erickson.  We also have a fantastic  panel here on set.  Very quickly the headlines that you're expecting.  Very  quickly.</p><p> PAYNE:  Plus 230, it might have some noise to Stephanie's point but it will  beat.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  It will beat.  We'll be right back with the  numbers.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is jobs  Friday, November 2nd.  We are moments away from the October jobs' report.   Here is what we're expecting.  190,000 jobs added to have been added to  economy in the month of October with the unemployment rate remaining steady  at 3.7 percent.  Markets this morning are rallying ahead of the number.</p><p> Take a look at where we stand with stocks.  Dow Industrials up 230 points,  that is one percent higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is up 19 points.  That is two- thirds of a percent higher.  The NASDAQ os negative but of course but of  course that's partly because Apple is down six percent in the premarket  after earnings.  Dagen McDowell, your expectations on this number 20  seconds away,</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Wage growth, whoa!  Fastest potentially in 9-1/2 years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wage growth.  That's the number you're going to be focused on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  North of three percent I'm hoping.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then of course we got the participation rate that is also  something to focus on.  And I know you, Stephanie Pomboy, look at revisions  a lot.  We're going to be wanting to look at the revisions.  Let's get  those numbers right now, Blake Burman is at the Labor Department.  Blake,  over to you.</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  250,000 jobs  created in the month of October, 250,000.  And with that, the unemployment  rate stayed at 3.7 percent.  Maria, when you look at revisions as well over  the last couple of months, September was revised downwards, 16,000 jobs to  118,000, but August was revised upward 16,000 to 286,000, so that is wash,  bringing the three-month average to 218,000 jobs.  And when you look at the  average over the last year, 210,000 jobs.  Sectors that gained all across  the board here, leisure and hospital up 42,000 jobs; health care up 36,000  jobs; manufacturing up 32,000 jobs; construction up 30,000 jobs;  transportation and warehousing up 25,000 jobs; mining, by the way, up 5,000  jobs.</p><p> The labor force participation rate up 0.2 percent to 62.9 percent, though,  that is just up slightly from this time last year, October 2017, when it  was 62.7 percent.  Average hourly earnings, Dagen, take a listen to this up  $0.05 cents, that's 0.2 percent to $27.30, that is a 3.1 percent increase  year-over-year.  That is the highest year-over-year increase since April of  2009.  The average workweek up 0.1 hours to 34.5 hours, but manufacturing  actually dropped 0.1 hours to 40.8 hours.  The U6, which of course, is  those who are marginally attached to the workforce or working part-time for  economic reasons.  7.4 percent, that is the same as August, but it is down  from eight percent this time last year.</p><p> Of course, there was that terrible hurricane that ripped through the  panhandle, Hurricane Michael, the economists here say that had, quote, no  discernible effect on the numbers.  So, the bottomline here, Maria, 250,000  jobs created in October, the unemployment rate stays at 3.7 percent, and  wages are rising.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Good number here, better than expected.  Blake,  thank you so much.  Dagen nails it with the wage comment.  Let's get right  to Stuart Varney, get his initial reaction.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Not  quite a blowout, but a very strong report on all fronts.  250,000 new jobs,  that is very strong.  Wages rising 3.1 percent over the past 12 months,  very strong indeed.  I'm not sure whether that's the highest in eight  years, nine years, two years, or whatever, but that is a very strong gain.   And the U6 coming in at 7.4 percent, it just strikes me that this is a  completely different employment picture than what we saw say two years ago.   This is completely shifted, 250,000 new jobs this month or last month, an  average of 210,000 this year.  That's a strong report, it's a strong  economy, it's full employment, case closed!</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's full employment, you're right, Stuart.  It's great  analysis.  I know you're going to have more.  We will see you in 30  minutes' time, Stu, at the top of the hour with \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" and your  fantastic guests, coming up.  Stuart Varney, join Stuart in 30 minutes.   Let's get right to Lisa Erickson, though, right now.  As Lisa, you're an  economist, you're looking at these numbers, and tell us what it sees --  what you see in terms of what it means for the future.</p><p> LISA ERICKSON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADITIONAL INVESTMENT GROUPS, U.S.  BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Well, we really do see this as a very good news  report, as Stu was just discussing.  We've got a really solid numbers  across the board, 250,000 obviously a very great absolute number and  definitely ahead of consensus expectations.  And on wage gain side, you've  got a nice increase for American workers at 3.1 percent.  What I would say  is that, you know, this should be very reassuring for the stock market.   Obviously, there's been a lot of concerns around whether we can continue  that growth story.  As we've been looking at it, we've maintained our  confidence in a cautiously optimistic outlook.  And I think this just  bolsters that.  </p><p> Longer term, however, I think the thing that we're going to be -- want to  be thinking about is whether that does reinforce the tendency of the Fed to  even potentially become more hawkish.  As long as we continue to get tight  numbers in the labor market, certainly, you want to going to continue on  that rising rate path.  And the other problem potentially presents is the  fact that it could actually widen the divergence with the economies  overseas because as rates go up and the dollar goes up, that can put  pressure on those overseas dollar borrowers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a really good point.  Actually, I've got to get  your opinion, Stephanie, on this.  But first, Dagen, you nailed it on  wages.  Go ahead.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart is gone but Stuart is wrong.  Stu, this is a blowout  report.  Charles made a face when Stuart said that.  Quite frankly, I don't  mean to throw you under the bus --</p><p> PAYNE:  It was (INAUDIBLE) that's all.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  250,000 jobs is a blowout.  Wages growing in this country north  of three percent.  That is something that we haven't seen since the early  term -- first term of Barack Obama, of President Obama, April of 2009.   This is a blowout.  The fact that you now have the three-month average job  growth outpacing the average for the last year, shows an economy to quote  James Freeman, at a higher growth plain, a higher growth plateau.  This is  awesome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead, James.</p><p> FREEMAN:  Yes, given how difficult it's been for firms to find new workers,  250k new jobs is big.  And really, as we talk about the elections,  Republicans make their closing argument, the President has delivered, at  least to this point, what he promised.  The manufacturing rival, the  economic revival he promised in 2016 is well underway.  32,000 jobs added  in manufacturing, 30,000 in construction, a lot of good news in this  report. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but let's go bring us back down to earth, Stephanie,  because look at the 30-year yield right now at 3.4 percent.  Look at the  10-year at 3.1 percent.  What does this mean for the Federal Reserve?</p><p> POMBOY:  (INAUDIBLE) I mean, I think Lisa's point is well-taken, and that  is, if anything, this keeps Powell on his track or maybe more aggressive,  and we have this on January 1, where kiwi and basically globally, we've had  still expanding central bank liquidity throughout this year, even as the  Fed has been tightening its balance sheet.  That ends next year, alongside  the (INAUDIBLE) of the tax cut effect, and most importantly -- and The Wall  Street Journal has an article on this today -- corporate interest expense  is going to start to move up sharply because they have almost a billion --  sorry, almost a trillion dollars in debt, $780 billion in debt that rolls  next year at these higher interest rates, that's going to be the real  headwind.  The profits are the number one input into employment growth.   So, I think this is a great report, no question about it.  But is this as  good as it gets past the old Milwaukee, you know, guys, this is as good as  it gets.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Isn't that what Jon Hilsenrath wrote the other day in The  Journal, what if this is as good as it gets?  Jon, weigh in here?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, this report is solid from beginning to end.   It's just great news across the labor market.  The thing that I would point  to that especially encouraging in here is that the labor force  participation rate picked up.  What that suggests is that we're getting  workers coming in from the sidelines because wages are picking up, and  there are so many job opportunities out there.  You know, I wrote a story  earlier this week saying that, you know, the private sector is expecting a  slowdown, you don't see it in these numbers, it's a very good report. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but Charles -- I mean, just what Jon just said, I mean, a  3.7 percent unemployment rate, 49-year low, as new people are coming in  shows confidence in the jobs market, shows confidence in the economy.</p><p> PAYNE:  This is an amazing -- this is an amazing number.  And, you know, we  could talk about it two ways, Main Street and Wall Street.  For Main  Street's point of view, this is amazing.  Participation up, wages are up,  dirty fingernail jobs, good producing jobs, manufacturing which we said  would never come back to this country, keeps blowing them away.  Even the  composition of this, so you've got 2,000 retail jobs, but instead, people  are getting jobs in transportation and warehouses.  Amazon and those places  are creating these fulfilment centers.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They need vehicle --</p><p> PAYNE:  They pay more than retail.  So, even the composition of the  numbers, some people will say, well, these are about the same numbers  President Obama had in his last year.  Numbers are the same, but the  composition, it's changing to higher paying jobs which I think is also  important.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kevin Kelly, I'm coming to you in a second with your analysis  on this market because the market has given up some gains here.  I want to  get your take on why we're losing some steam here.  But first, Joanie  Courtney, identify for us where are the jobs right now for those people who  want to get in the jobs market, where should they be looking?</p><p> JOANIE COURTNEY, PROFESSIONAL DIVISION PRESIDENT, EMPLOYBRIDGE:  Yes,  Maria, it is such a strong jobs market.  You know, there are 7.1 million  openings across the United States, and they are both in blue collar and  white collar opportunities.  So, you've got engineering, accounting and  finance, health care is very strong, but we also have manufacturing and  logistics, construction.  There's so many opportunities in the market.  So,  the best part about this report to me is definitely the labor participation  rate, seeing more people come back into the job market because wages are  moving, and there are opportunities.  Overall, I mean, this is one of the  best job reports we have seen in the last couple of years.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  One of the best jobs reports that we've seen in the last couple  of years, you say, just four days away from the midterm elections.  You  wonder what that's going to could for voters, and yet, markets are off of  the highs.  Kevin Kelly, explain.</p><p> KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yes, one of the reasons why the  markets are off the highs is you're starting to see that yields are going  up, so that goes back to the financing costs.  So, that's been the story  for the last, you know, few months.  When the 10-year treasury goes up, you  see equities take a hit because it's one of their largest input costs.  So,  if you think about the input costs we're talking about today, jobs, right,  wages are going up.  Charles hit the nail on the head.  Listen, we've got  transportation in warehousing jobs 25,000.  That's where e-commerce jobs  are.  We need over 452,000 workers in distribution centers this year and  next year just to meet e-commerce demand, 16 percent year-over-year growth  in that field alone.  </p><p> So, you're seeing retail jobs come down.  Last month, we actually lost  18,000 on that.  So, you have -- you have an equity market that is worried  about rising wages, you have an equity market that's worried about rising  costs of capital that impacts their margins.  That's why you're seeing  guidance whether it's, you know, all the companies on the industrial side,  even technology, talking about next year's revenues and profits, going to  be lower than this year's.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  One thing I would add, Maria, because we focus so much on the  numbers, but these numbers today back up the way that people are feeling in  this country.  That with consumer confidence, we can talk about the polls,  and how people more concerned about health care and the tax reform, and the  tax cuts aren't connecting with voters.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great point. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But consumer confidence is at an 18-year high.  And it was  strong, even in the month of October as the market is selling off, and  people have told me from the rural -- around the rural communities that I  grew up in, for the first time in over a decade, people can find full-time  jobs, they can find full-time work and they don't feel like that they're  trying to scrape here and scrape there, and are living -- I mean, worried  about paying their bills every month.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How about -- and higher wages, too. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And so, you are finding work, full-time work, and in --  as to Charles's point, better-paying positions, if you're switching jobs,  and I think that that is really resonating and you see -- market be dammed,  whatever investors are worried about on Wall Street, God bless them, but  this is just great news for all Americans.</p><p> PAYNE:  They're worried about Jay Powell.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're worried about Jay Powell.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> PAYNE:  I'll let you add to this, I just want to point to people, I think  October was started by a speech (INAUDIBLE) made on October 3rd where he  said the Fed didn't know where neutral was and that they would certainly  overshoot.  The market fell off a cliff, and it hasn't -- and that to me  was the scariest moment of the entire month.</p><p> POMBOY:  The comment I was going to make on the back of what Dagen was  saying is that, you know, this is a positive thing.  I'm going to, you  know, (INAUDIBLE) my umbrella for a minute, and what we're seeing with the  wage growth is now consumers will be able to shift from relying on central  bank created asset inflation to fund their retirements and their current  commutation with actual good old-fashioned wage growth.  This is the way  it's supposed to be.  It's a positive development.  And it comes in my  view, at a good time, because that asset inflation story is coming to an  abrupt end, home price inflation has already slowed a lot, and I think the  stock market and the corporate bond market are going to follow suit.</p><p> FREEMAN:  I could not agree more.  And I think maybe this is optimism.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> FREEMAN:  But what -- but this -- what we're seeing --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> FREEMAN:  What we're seeing is a real economy which gives us a chance to  make the transition back to normal.  The policy makers, the central bankers  of the last decade left us with this enormous challenge to unwind all of  this money that they put into the economy because the tax and regulatory  burdens wouldn't let the economy grow, they tried to conjure prosperity  forcing all of this money in.  This report is more evidence that the real  economy is reasserting itself and we might be able to break this transition  --</p><p> KELLY:  Can I just bring up a point about this economy and how healthy and  strong it is?  Look at leisure and hospitality adding 42,000 jobs when it  was supposed to take a hit because of Hurricane Michael, especially in  Florida.  So, it is so strong that people are out there, and they're  actually spending their money, they're spending their crumbs that they got  from this fiscal policy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, crumbs.  Look at this traffic --</p><p> KELLY:  So, that is a true testament how strong this market is.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  This -- you're right, this graphic shows the leisure and  hospitality up 42,000, but look at service providing.  I mean, this is a  services economy, we know, but 179,000 jobs created in services, that is --  that is a big number. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to remind people, too, when President Barack Obama  goes on the campaign trail, and continuously tries to take credit for this  economy, it was only for a brief spurt but for the most part during his  eight years in office, we never had three percent wage growth in this  country.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We never had an economy that any calendar year grew at three  percent.  It was the Federal Reserve that kept you propped up and  deregulation and the government burden that kept the lid on growth. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that was eight years -- eight years. </p><p> FREEMAN:  But it's also -- it's kind of fun, though, watching President  Obama and his former economic advisers sort of diverging here, where he's  saying, isn't it great?  I built that.  And they're saying he's not so  great.  It's not so great.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You didn't build that.  You didn't build that.  Donald Trump  built that.</p><p> FREEMAN:  But it's harder -- it's harder to say it's not so great.  So, I  think we can expect may be he's going to want to claim even more.</p><p> POMBOY:  That should be his new tagline, Donald Trump.  That's genius.  He  didn't build that, I built that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Let's get a check on markets.  Gerri Willis is  on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this morning with some early  reaction.  And Gerri, we got a pretty good showing with the Dow Industrials  this morning.  It's what we were expecting anyway.</p><p> GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, that's right, Maria.  And  I've been talking to traders all morning.  Pre-number, post-number, they're  speaking with one voice, and what they're saying is here comes the Fed.   You know, this is pointing to a very strong economy, you're seeing this  wage growth kicking up 3.1 percent.  I was told before the number came out,  if we got 190,000 to 230,000 more jobs for the month that that would be  good, that would be solid.  250, that's going to make traders do start  thinking about is this economy overheating and what they worry about, rates  go higher, that takes money out of market, that's how they interpret it.  </p><p> Number two layer here that people are talking about and concerned about in  today's market, what they're happy about, frankly, is this discussion of  China trade, this idea that there are going to be more China talks.  They  love that.  It's on everybody's mind down here.  But for this report, it  makes them think that that idea that maybe the Fed would stop or slow or  pause, maybe not because this is very good news about the economy.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, Gerri, I'm glad you mentioned China because, Lisa  Erickson, yesterday in the middle of the day, we learned that the President  had spoken with President Xi in China, and markets definitely moved on  that.  What was your sense of what went on yesterday in markets, and how  are you expecting this market to trade given what we've learned this  morning?</p><p> ERICKSON:  Well, trade market -- the trade issues are certainly a big  overhang, and in fact, that's one of the key things that we're monitoring  as well, of course, in addition to what's going on in the growth picture  and also with the Fed.  But I think, basically, there's been a lot of  volatility because people are not certain what's going to happen.  And so,  when you get some positive headlines like you did yesterday, the market is  going to trade up on that.  You know, as far as the market reaction going  out, I think that basically, this is going to settle in potentially for  some more volatility.  Again, now that the market is seeing that there may  be more of a case for the Fed to continue on a trajectory of raising rates,  that does raise the bar.  It does race the competition for equities.  And  in addition, people are needing to see those growth numbers to continue to  come through.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> ERICKSON:  So, again, I think the fundamental picture is balanced.  We are  seeing positives in both the macropicture and as well as corporate  earnings, but you've got this offset with a little bit more competition.   So, it's going to be important to watch that outlook going forward. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stephanie, what are you going to be watching from here to get a  sense of where things go now?  What are your most important metrics?</p><p> POMBOY:  Well, the thing I'm watching most closely is the corporate credit  market, specifically what's happening with spreads.  You know, when you see  the 10-year backing up on numbers like this morning, do corporate yields  follow suit?  And you know, what we've seen in October is that the spreads  have been winding out where people are starting to price in greater risk in  the corporate bond market.</p><p> PAYNE:  Let me ask you about the junk bond market because that's -- have  been sort of a red flag, isn't it?</p><p> POMBOY:  You know, it went from first to worst in October.  It was the top  performing credit market all year, and then it flipped and people couldn't  get away from it fast enough, but that's how it is with high yield.  You  know, it's called junk for a reason.  And people then reacquaint themselves  with the definition of junk, and realize, you know, maybe I'm not going to  get repaid on this debt.  The interesting thing is that you also have half  of what's categorized as investment grade that is just one rung above that  junk threshold.  So, it wouldn't take much of an increase in rates to push  half of the investment-grade universe into that bottom bucket.  </p><p> That's what I'm worried about because the spillover to the stock market is  going to be huge, you know, obviously, companies borrowed like crazy to  fund their buyback and dividend programs.  That have been a key support for  the stock market.  I mean, I think the number one buyer of equities has  been the corporate sector, not retail investors, not --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Which is why -- which is why Kevin Kelly thinks once  the corporations get out of earnings and once companies start buying back  their stock, we're going to see this rally rip.</p><p> POMBOY:  Assuming they have the money with which to do that, you know,  Apple --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> KELLY:  Well, they -- well, they do.  Stephanie, they have over a trillion  --</p><p> POMBOY:  -- buybacks rather than using that --</p><p> KELLY:  Stephanie, they have the money, over a trillion dollars.</p><p> POMBOY:  -- a mountain of cash.  Not every company does.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Go ahead, Kevin.</p><p> KELLY:  Oh, I was going to say, they over a trillion dollars of stock  buybacks that are going to occur actually over the next year.  So, you're - - and you're going to see it start taking hold now.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> KELLY:  You know, it's going to be pretty interesting is that Apple is  going to come out and start buy back a lot of their stock at these prices.   So, that's going to lend an underlying bid because they've been blacked out  for the last month.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  And that'll help -- that'll help Apple certainly and  the broader market.  Jon Hilsenrath, before you go, I know you got a job --  your final number and reaction to this number before you go.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Very strong start to the fourth quarter.  A lot of analysts  have been forecasting that the economy was going to slow down in the fourth  quarter.  This is a sign that it's still ripping.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Jon, we'll see you soon.  Thanks so much for your  insights this morning.  Jon Hilsenrath, always a pleasure.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  More from this all-star panel on the October jobs' report after  this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the October jobs number is out, the  economy added 250,000 jobs last month that top the economists'  expectations.  The unemployment rate holding steady at a 49-year low of 3.7  percent.  We want to go right now, it's the final jobs' report before the  midterm elections, we want to go to one of the elections' most pivotal  states, Arizona.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning in Phoenix with more.   Hillary, good morning to you.</p><p> HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   This is one of the closest Senate races in the country right now.  Democrat  Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema is running against Republican Congresswoman  Martha McSally to fill Jeff Flake's Senate seat.  And the latest Fox News  poll has both candidates in a dead heat, both of them polling with 46  percent of voter support.  This migrant caravan, though, that is headed  towards the U.S.-Mexico border is a local issue here in this border state.   We caught up with Democrat Kyrsten Sinema yesterday at a Get Out To Vote  event with veterans.  Sinema, a former anti-war protester has come under  fire for her anti-military rhetoric in the past.  And I asked her if she  will support the military men and women headed to the U.S. border in her  home state to stop this migrant caravan from crossing over.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. KYRSTEN SINEMA (D), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, ARIZONA:  It's not new for  us to have military deployment to the border to provide a support role for  our Customs and Border Patrol agents who were down there.  So, we wish them  well and tell them to stay hydrated.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> VAUGHN:  Former fighter pilot and Republican Martha McSally spent the day  stomping with the President's son, Donald Trump, Jr. to rally support  headed into election day.  McSally tells me that Democrats are to blame for  this migrant caravan and crisis at the border.  And she says it's her  mission, if elected, to close loopholes in the system that allow migrants  to exploit U.S. immigration law.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. MARTHA MCSALLY (R), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, ARIZONA:  Border security is  national security.  They will be coming to bases in my district that I  represent in Arizona, and our communities are going to welcome them as they  continue to serve and sacrifice to keep our country safe.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> VAUGHN:  Maria, the Green Party candidate just dropped out yesterday and  that could be a game changer in a neck-and-neck race.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hillary, wait, did Sinema just say stay hydrated to the  military?</p><p> VAUGHN:  Yes.  And when I told McSally that, she had the same reaction, she  laughed.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Hillary, thank you.  Hillary Vaughn.  Kevin Kelly, Joanie  Courtney, Lisa Erickson, thank you so much for joining us.  Invaluable  insights from all of you, we so appreciate it.  We got this panel on set as  we continue with just a few minutes left.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We got a big weekend this weekend.  Stay with me  tonight, Maria Bartiromo's \"WALL STREET\" 9:00 p.m. Eastern.  More of my  exclusive interview with Barry Diller.  And then I'll see you on Sunday  morning on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" Fox News Channel --</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Thank  you so much.  Good morning, everybody.  We will see you in a little while.   Girls, thank you.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Happy Friday, everybody.  It is Friday, November 2nd.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Major market moves this morning, Apple shares sliding today, week revenue  guidance last night on the announcement that it will no longer provide unit  sales.  That's stock down better than five percent right now.  The  technology giant at risk of losing that $1 trillion market valuation.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The other big story for the markets, of course today, the Jobs Report.   October Jobs Report will be out in two and a half hours, the expectation  calls for jobs of 190,000 added to the economy last month, month of  October.  And the unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.7  percent.</p><p>We are taking a look at what that means for the midterm elections now just  four days away.</p><p>We are taking a look at the rally at the open this morning.  Meanwhile,  despite the drag from Apple shares, stocks are expected to open big.  Up  200 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 17 points on the S&amp;P  500, and higher by 10 and a quarter points on the NASDAQ this morning.</p><p>This after the major indices yesterday posted their third day of gains in a  row, it was a pretty good day at the close yesterday.</p><p>Take a look, up 264 points for the Dow Industrials.  That was better than  one percent yesterday, finishing near the highs of the day.  </p><p>The NASDAQ up one and three-quarters percent, that was 128 points higher  yesterday.</p><p>Checking global markets this morning, we kick it off with Europe.  European  indices higher across the board, FT-100 up two-thirds of one percent, the  CAC Quarante in Paris up better than one percent, and the DAX Index in  Germany up better than one percent as well.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets higher across the board, best performer there,  China.  Actually, Korea, KOSPI Index up three and a half percent, but China  also very strong up 2.7 percent on the Shanghai Composite.</p><p>On the earnings rank, we will hear from oil giants and Dow Components.   ExxonMobil and Chevron today.  Plus Alibaba, also set to report.</p><p>We will have those numbers and analysis, give us a little window into  what's going in Chinese consumer as well.</p><p>China trade, of course, in focus.  President Trump speaking with China's  president, Xi Jinping yesterday, showing progress in the trade dispute.  </p><p>As soon as that was announced yesterday, markets did turn around.  We got  some firmness when we heard that there was progress on the China deal.</p><p>Here's what IAC Chairman, Barry Diller, told me about China's trade  practices </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARRY DILLER, CHAIRMAN, IAC:  Their trade practices have to change.  And  us, being tough-minded about it, I think it's sensible.  I think us being  outrageous and excessive about it is dangerous.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest this morning.  More from Barry Diller  as well on technology and what's been happening with tech stocks, all those  stories coming up this Friday morning.  </p><p>And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  the Wall Street Journal's Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman,  and Bench Mark Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly.</p><p>Great to see you this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Look who's back two days in a row?  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, love it.  Love it.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, so exciting.  I'm sorry you had to impose this on your  viewers again, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm so happy you're back.  Yes.  It's great.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  -- I'm going to be here for a little while.  The -- you know, I  don't think the President said it was fantastic, but he did say it was good  and nice talking to President Xi Jinping, so -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very good.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- let's hope this is a step toward resolution of the trade  dispute.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right.  And when we heard that they had the phone  call, it actually did help markets yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Take -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, and I -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big boost.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think that's a lot of what you're seeing in the futures here as  well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And on Apple's side, it's not just the revenue forecast for the  December quarter, it's also the fact that they're -- they are no longer  going to break out device unit sales in any future financial results.  </p><p>So basically, Apple is telling investors, \"You're going to get a lot less  information from us about what is going on with the company, with sales of  our devices,\" and that's why the stock down five percent.</p><p>But Apple was only down three percent in the month of October when Amazon  was in a bear market losing 20 percent of its value.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point, yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We talked about that yesterday morning.  </p><p>So, again, revenue is a problem and then when any company says, \"Oh, by the  way, we're going to give you less information -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- that's not -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what happened to -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's what happens to the stock.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what happened to Oracle a couple of weeks ago.  I mean - - and a lot of the analysts who have said that they said that they weren't  going to break out cloud revenue and these specific lines within the cloud  revenue, less transparency, you know, and so that's one thing.</p><p>So we're going to know less about how the company makes -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  But the revenue and the earnings are good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  It's just the outlook.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>FREEMAN:  And then that's -- we have seen that with a lot of these  companies, where the numbers are fine, it's the future and the concern, and  maybe some of it is going away now with this discussion on China.  </p><p>KELLY:  But -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amazon -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And which is the issue.  Which is the issue.  Are we going to  see growth slowdown in the future?  And what we're hearing, as far as these  revenue expectations, is, yes, things will slow down with the growth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The midpoint of the revenue forecast for the holiday quarter  from Apple is just a three percent gain year over year.</p><p>That is for a company at this valuation, Apple being cheaper than other  tech names, but that's still lackluster, quite frankly.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  I mean I think it's important to note that they're not going  to be announcing unit sales and that's because they actually missed on unit  sales this time.  </p><p>Sixty percent of their revenue comes from iPhone sales.</p><p>I mean, that is it.  And so if they're missing on those numbers now and  then they're not going to give them in the future, that's uncertainty for  investors, especially because the biggest important market, which President  Trump's going to be talking to Xi Jinping, is China.</p><p>We saw the revenues come down from 21 percent the previous quarter to 18  percent and they're continuously slowing down over there.  </p><p>That's the most important market for growth.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's what Dan Niles pointed out, that, look, are we  really going to see people pony up a thousand dollars for an iPhone X in  China when you know that things are slowing down there?  </p><p>And he also mentioned the inventories, when you check on inventories at  Apple as well coming up.  </p><p>Also joining the conversation this morning, my exclusive interview with  Barry Diller.  He is Chairman of InterActive/IAC, and Expedia Group.  Don't  miss what he has to say about markets and technology, and really where the  growth is going forward.</p><p>All that is coming up.  </p><p>But first, our top story this hour.  Apple shares under pressure despite a  earnings report.  Earnings per share of $2.91 a share.</p><p>Revenue 61.9 billion -- as you see earnings revenue, $62.9 billion on  revenue on earnings of $2.91 a share.</p><p>Apple stock is down better than five percent right now, as you can see.   The stock is down as investors worry about that guidance.  </p><p>The company's decision to stop reporting unit sales for the products,  seeing it as sign of potentially slow sales growth.</p><p>Joining us right now is Mahoney Asset Management CEO, Ken Mahoney.  Ken,  it's good to see you.  </p><p>KEN MAHONEY, CEO, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Great to be back again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>Let me just point out that it is also Jobs Friday.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we will have the Jobs number out in two and a half hours and  we're going to talking about that as well.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Glad to know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But your reaction to the Apple numbers.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Again, soft numbers.  You know, they're really playing around and  pushing the envelope when it comes to elasticity of the man.  Remember that  little textbook phrase?</p><p>I mean pushing up prices and see where that demand is, I mean, look, I  think the estimates were about $750 a unit to now they came to $793.  </p><p>But they're really pricing out a lot of households.  I mean what is that --  what is that elasticity of the man?  Where is that level where you could  actually have good margins and also have some good sales?</p><p>And I think that's the thing.  And also by the way, I think the new  offerings are quite confusing to consumers, right?  There's the XL's, and  G's, and D, like -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No -- </p><p>MAHONEY:  Before, it's quite simple, you had a red card to pick, a white  card, and a black card color, you know.  </p><p>KELLY:  Right.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  And now we have, like, 19 different choices, so what is the  consumer -- where is that kind of sweet spot now for Apple with their  iPhone offerings?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So the XR is the cheaper of the new model.  The X -- I say X,  it's 10, it's 10R, 10S, 10S Max, and it's actually the 10R, or the XR,  that's gotten the really good reviews and that's the lower price change.  </p><p>And so that, again, is -- was a concern going into this report.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I think you're bringing up a great point because what happened  is they keep increasing their average selling price, but also the parts and  components are going down.  </p><p>So their operating margins are expanding pretty significantly and that's  going to be a future headwind because we're not going to see DRAM prices go  down even more.  </p><p>And so I think, when you're talking about pricing power, that's what is  going to help companies succeed next year when they can -- </p><p>MAHONEY:  That's right.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- when they can pass along that pricing power.</p><p>So what are you seeing for next year and how you're going to be positioning  yourself in the markets?</p><p>MAHONEY:  Yes, look, it's going to be a volatile year.  We also have to  deal with the headlines, the Fed raising rates at a time when, you know,  that's another kind of one of those bugaboos that's going to be out there,  right?  </p><p>So, you know, I feel like the Fed's going to keep raising rates until  something breaks, and some things are breaking around us -- housing, we're  seeing construction, homebuilders, and so forth.  </p><p>So I think -- I think investors are becoming nimble.  I mean we don't make  them day traders, but kind of active when we have these swishes down like  we had in February, in April, coming off of a strong January and March.  </p><p>And now, again, a strong August-September we've had.  </p><p>So I think we are -- we have a hybrid strategy, basically.  Seventy percent  long, large cap growth, but also about 30 percent kind of buy the dip, sell  the rip, you know, into some of these crazy volatilities.  </p><p>So I think next year, look, we have a lot -- we have a lot of things to  kind of deal with after midterm elections, but at the -- at the end of the  day, I think investors can make volatility their friend instead of their  foe, is kind of the way we're going to come and play this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But are you saying you are expecting a slowdown in the coming  couple of years?</p><p>MAHONEY:  I think so.  Again, some specific interest rate sensitive  industries, again, home builders, again they bounce a little bit, we  wouldn't be there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what about the broad economic -- </p><p>MAHONEY:  All those and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- growth?  I mean we're talking about 4.2 percent growth for  the second quarter, 3-1/2 percent for the -- </p><p>MAHONEY:  3.5, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- third quarter.  Do you see economic growth slowing down?  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Oh, yes, absolutely.  Yes, it's definitely slowing down 4.1.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  But, again, the point is the Fed keep raising rates here, it's  going to slow a lot of things.</p><p>And we're seeing already, by the way.  If you look at the real estate  market, especially in the metro area here, you're starting to see some  softness, so it is having impact, these higher interest rates.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So if the President, best-case scenario here, gets a deal quickly  with China, not predicting this, but if Xi Jinping says, \"OK, we'll respect  property rights and lower trade barriers,\" you're thinking that doesn't  give the market much of a bump because the focus stays on interest rates or  it does?</p><p>MAHONEY:  Look, look, look, we saw, since Monday, you know, look, we had a  whipsaw kind of -- bungee market, we were up 350 points.  </p><p>The President said, \"Hey, we're going to add some more trade tariffs in  China in case we don't get a deal,\" and the market fell out of bed again.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  So he knows his words are tied into his algorithms that trade  offered us.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  So, the tariffs are really important.  Look, we heard from 3M,  Caterpillar, even Apple last night, talk about the uncertainty because of  China trade. </p><p>So, that definitely helps out.  But, again, I think 4.1 may be your peak  GDP, quite frankly, and 3-1/2 of, you know -- </p><p>KELLY:  No.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was going to -- I would point out, the Apple stock, until  through yesterday, was still up 31 percent year to date.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one big concern is the iPhones and the imports of Apple  goods made in China have not been hit with any tariffs by this government  yet.  </p><p>But it looks like if something doesn't get resolved by the end of the year,  iPhones will get hit with tariffs, and then you have to factor in the worry  that the Chinese government retaliates against Apple.</p><p>MAHONEY:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Retaliates in terms of China as a sales market, but also as a  manufacturing hub for Apple, so there's a lot of concern.  </p><p>It would be a huge, huge boost for the stock potentially if the U.S. could  get something done with China on trading. </p><p>MAHONEY:  It's important, too, because this has been going on for about a  year now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Versus protecting aluminum and steel industries now, we have some  of the other industries aching from this.  </p><p>So at the end of the deal, you know, we've been playing Liar's Poker.  My  50 billion, your hundred billion, my 50 billion, my hundred -- you know, at  this point, we really should get a deal here, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But he's got -- this administration has got to push back on  China.  Don't forget what we heard yesterday and this was just one company  and this is just one issue and that is from Steve Ballmer.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Right,</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Former CEO of Microsoft.</p><p>MAHONEY:  Microsoft, yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That 90 percent of the -- of the companies in China use the  Microsoft operating platform and only one percent pay for it.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that equates to $10 billion to Microsoft.</p><p>MAHONEY:  No, I remember back in -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lost profit -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- that goes to China because they're stealing it.</p><p>MAHONEY:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I started the week by talking about this and the Journal  writes about it today.  The better China strategy is what we've seen them  going after, Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Company, which has been  accused of stealing technology intellectual property from Micron.  </p><p>That's what this administration has done.  We hit the Chinese company for  allegedly stealing those secrets. </p><p>The Journal writes about it, calling it a better China trade.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Well you -- well -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I don't disagree.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rather than -- rather than blunderbuss Paris.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we should have -- and I -- </p><p>MAHONEY:  Yes, well -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I don't disagree, we should have pushed back on ZTE as  well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  That's right.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, and we did.  We actually imposed some fines -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But then he came back.</p><p>KELLY:  -- because he was skirting sanctions.  Right.  But I think the  important thing to note here is that it's not just American companies and  the American government.  </p><p>We saw, at the World Trade Organization, the Europeans came around with our  viewpoints as well and said, actually, they should not be getting a most-  favored nation status at the World Trade Organization.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>KELLY:  They're still considered an emerging economy, yet they're still  skirting regulation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>MAHONEY:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  So if you even have the Europeans aligned with the Americans,  that's going to be saying something.  But this goes back -- </p><p>MAHONEY:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- to what you're talking about, is that even if we get -- do get  good growth next year, the dollar's going to get stronger.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  That's right.  </p><p>KELLY:  And the Feds is also going to continue to raise rate because -- </p><p>MAHONEY:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  -- they're going to tamper inflations because if parts go up, then  inflation's going up.</p><p>MAHONEY:  Right.  </p><p>KELLY:  So the stronger dollar, I see, is one of the biggest impediments.</p><p>MAHONEY:  Absolutely.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you selling into this rally right now?</p><p>MAHONEY:  Yes, this morning we will be selling.  But, look, from -- yes,  from Monday's low -- this is like Friday's, it's been a long month this  week, right, guys?  </p><p>So from Monday's low to this open, it's about a 10 percent move for the  NASDAQ.  </p><p>I think we go back in film, not bearish, but I think we need to break down  like we did, we do this bounce, we do a retest, I hope we make higher lows.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>MAHONEY:  I mean that'd be great technically.  But at the end of the day,  we were up 10 percent intraday from Monday now through Friday.</p><p>I think it takes some shekels, have some -- your powers run away in case we  have to go back, or in case next week, the midterm elections don't go the  way people think it's going to go, or the China talks don't go the way we  think they will go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  You have some -- you have some -- you have some power drive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So sell into strength?  I like that.</p><p>MAHONEY:  Sell into strength.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sell some shekels.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  That's true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's talk jobs for a second.  It is Jobs day in  America this morning.  </p><p>Thee October Jobs Report out in two hours, 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Here are the  expectations, a hundred and ninety thousand jobs added to the economy in  the month of October.  </p><p>With the unemployment rate holding steady and 3.7 percent.  Kevin, what are  you expecting from today's Jobs numbers?  </p><p>KELLY:  Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you going to be focused on this morning?  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I think we're actually going to get a print above 200,000, and  one of the reasons why is holiday expectations and needing to fill those  seasonal jobs.  </p><p>And especially after the hurricanes, I'm going to really be looking at the  labor participation rate and I think that's the biggest one because we need  to see people coming into the labor force if this economy continued to grow  and expand.  </p><p>Because that will lead to productivity for the companies -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>KELLY:  -- so they can keep their margins where they're at.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is a good number priced into this market, Ken?</p><p>MAHONEY:  I don't know.  I think today, the market's mostly focused on the  trade deal with China.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>MAHONEY:  And a little bit about Apple.</p><p>I mean this is important, but I think it's already a foregone conclusion  that the Fed's going to raise rates in December.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  We're going to be watching wage growth very closely.</p><p>And to your point, you know, a lot of companies are saying we're having  trouble finding employees to grow our business.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  So this is -- this is an issue.  So, participation rate is  important.</p><p>KELLY:  The rate.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  But it -- the wage growth is what the Feds' going to watch  closely.  So, we have to watch when the Feds' watching to make our  decisions.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  yes, wage growth is important.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, and -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's supposed to be the best in nine and a half years, so  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, because we have a worker shortage.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  yes.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's what we saw on the NFIB report yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>FREEMAN:  And it's good to see the President the last couple of days  recognizing that, saying we want border enforcement, but we want to let  people in, too.</p><p>MAHONEY:  That's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's jump.  Ken Mahoney, good to see you.  </p><p>MAHONEY:  Thanks very much.  Good Friday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are all hands on deck, so keep it right here.  MORNINGS WITH  MARIA, we've got full coverage of the October Jobs Report beginning at 8:00  a.m. Eastern, special coverage where we identify where the jobs are right  now.</p><p>First up, protecting that border, the first 100 troops have arrived at the  border for Operation Faithful Patriot as the migrant caravan closes in on  the border.  The very latest next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A sheriff's deputy in Texas fighting for his  life this morning.  Cheryl Casone with all the details and headlines now.   Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  Good morning.  </p><p>That deputy and another officer were attempting to serve a warrant to a man  who failed to register as a sex offender.  </p><p>The officers had to use a stun gun on the suspect after he resisted arrest,  but he escaped and fled to his apartment.  That suspect started shooting.   He hit the deputy in the head, the unnamed officer remains in critical  condition this morning.  The suspect is, though, in custody.</p><p>Well, the first 100 active-duty troops arriving at the Southern Border.  As  part of Operation Faithful Patriot, President Trump said the number of  troops deployed to the border could go as high as 15,000.</p><p>Meanwhile, the President plans to sign an executive order that could keep  migrants, including asylum seekers apprehended at the border, in detention  until their legal cases are heard.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Those who choose to break our laws and enter illegally will no  longer be able to use meritless claims to gain automatic admission into our  country.  </p><p>We will hold them for a long time, if necessary.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, at least three caravans of migrants are currently heading  north from Central America right now.</p><p>Then there's this, AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia accusing the Justice Department of  collaborating with Dish Network.</p><p>WarnerMedia issued a statement saying, \"The Department of Justice  collaborated closely with Dish in its unsuccessful lawsuit to block our  merger.  Well, that collaboration continues to this day with Dish's  tactical decision to drop HBO, not the other way around.\"</p><p>So here's what's going on.  For the first time in its 40-year history,  WarnerMedia's HBO went dark on Dish Network yesterday after a disagreement  over a new distribution deal.</p><p>Now AT&amp;T is going to go back to court next month in the DOJ's appeal of  that antitrust decision approving AT&amp;T's deal to buy Time Warner Media.  </p><p>So obviously, Maria, a lot of twists and turns in the story, but forget  about it, you're not going to get your Sopranos reruns on HBO and Dish.   Sadness.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, forget about it.  All right, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  Coming up, the President's midterm rally blitz, the  President is making stops in key states with just four days left before  voters hit the poll.  </p><p>We are on countdown mode.  We're breaking down the races coming up right  after this.  </p><p>Then my exclusive interview with IAC and Expedia Group Chairman, Barry  Diller.  He's talking social media regulation, if it's even possible.  </p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Spotlight on the midterms now.  We are not four  days away from the midterm elections.  We are taking a look at key economic  data in states with some of the most influential races, so today we zero in  on Missouri, Montana, and Colorado.  </p><p>Joining us right now is Kristin Tate, she is The Hill contributor and  author of \"How do I Tax Thee?\"  Kristin, good to see you.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  </p><p>KRISTIN TATE, CONTRIBUTOR, THE HILL:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we get to Missouri, let me get your take overall.  How  do you think the Republicans fair in the midterms on Tuesday night?</p><p>TATE:  Well, I think this is really a referendum on Trump, so Republicans  are trying to inject Trump into these races as much as possible to get his  supporters to the polls.  </p><p>This is all about mobilization, but Trump mobilizes Democrats, too.  We  have Democrats running on the perceived hatred of Trump, so it's just about  who can get the most folks to those voting booths.  </p><p>But I think that the Democrats are going to take back the house.  But it'll  be tight.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's start with Missouri here.  The President was  there last night campaigning for Republican candidate, Josh Hawley.</p><p>He's locked in a tight race against incumbent Democratic Senator, Claire  McCaskill, first elected back in 2006.  </p><p>Missouri's first quarter GDP, 2.4 percent.  The unemployment rate, 3.2  percent in September.  The state's leading industries are hospitals,  nursing and residential care facilities.  </p><p>President Trump won this state back in 2016, what's your take here?  Can  Hawley unseat McCaskill?  </p><p>TATE:  So this race is really a toss-up, but the most recent polls do  suggest that Hawley has a slight edge here.  </p><p>Remember, Missouri is kind of a right-leaning state, Trump won it by 19  points.  So, McCaskill is really trying to position herself as a moderate  Democrat, someone who's worked with Trump.  </p><p>She's really courting Trump supporters because, frankly, she needs them to  win this race.</p><p>The two biggest issues there are health care and the economy.  The economy  there in Missouri is doing pretty well, growth has not been as robust as  it's been for the nation as a whole.  </p><p>I think unemployment sits out about 3.3 percent, but interestingly, Hawley  really hasn't been talking about the economy much and I think that's  because of tariffs.  </p><p>Hawley supported President Trump when he tried to win these trade wars, but  now Missouri is really feeling the effects of tariffs.  </p><p>China buys about one-third of Missouri's soybean crop, and of course they  slapped 25 percent tariffs on soybeans, which reduced their value by about  20 percent, so that's really devastating to the farming industry there,  which was already hurting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's really a good point.  And don't forget what Claire  McCaskill said the other day, she's really trying to look like she's a  moderate, calling her colleagues crazy.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She said, \"Those crazy Democrats.\"</p><p>TATE:  Right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I wonder, does that affect turnout for her in St. Louis?   She's obviously trying to get more of that rural vote, but what does that  do for kind of the core Democratic voter there?</p><p>TATE:  She's in a tough position, you know, because she comes off as  looking too liberal for the moderates and conservative votes, but too  moderate for the really liberal voters in those cities.  </p><p>So, she is walking a very tough tightrope here, but Hawley has responded by  really hammering her on that no vote that she gave to Kavanaugh, and a  couple of other issues like her personal wealth.  </p><p>You know, McCaskill loves to say that, you know, she's just an ordinary  Missouri gal, but really she's extremely wealthy.  I think her net worth  is, like, $29 million.  </p><p>So there are several issues that she's being hammered on and this is all to  get the base energized on the right, but I do think she's going to have a  hard time reaching out to people in the cities and, you know, these really  far-left progressive voters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>TATE:  Because, again, she is seen as too moderate for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Kristin, let's move on to Montana.  Incumbent  Democratic Senator Jon tester, facing off the Republican challenger, Matt  Rosendale.  </p><p>Now on the economic front, first quarter GDP in Montana, two and a half  percent.  September unemployment, 3.6 percent, so a good unemployment  number.</p><p>The President is headed to Montana tomorrow.  This is this last-minute  campaign blitz before voters head to the polls.  Kristin, what's driving  voters here?</p><p>TATE:  Well, Tester is, again, another Democrat trying to fight for his  political life in a state that loves Trump.</p><p>Up until recently, he had been seen -- Tester had been seen as having a  kind of wide lead here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>TATE:  But now, this is a toss-up race because the libertarian candidate in  that race dropped out, presumably giving votes to the Republican.  </p><p>The big issues are health care and the economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>TATE:  Insurance rates have been on the rise in this State of Montana,  premiums have gone way up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>TATE:  And then when it comes to the economy, Montana's really roaring  under Trump.  Unemployment, the lowest it's been since 2007 and -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, which is why -- which is why he's headed there today.</p><p>TATE:  -- median household incomes are way up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick on Colorado.  </p><p>TATE:  It's a -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The state's first quarter GDP was three percent in Colorado.   September unemployment, 3.1 percent, now the leading industry here, oil and  gas extraction, contributing more than $11 billion to GDP.  Real quick on  Colorado, Kristin.</p><p>TATE:  I'm watching very closely the sixth congressional district race.   People are saying this is kind of a bellwether for who controls congress.  </p><p>Of course, Colorado has been trending blue for many years now, so it's an  uphill battle for the Incumbent Republican there, but Colorado citizens are  very happy with the direction of the economy, that looks really good for  Republicans, so we'll see what happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Kristin.  Great analysis from you always.  Thanks so  much.  We will see you soon. </p><p>TATE:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kristin Tate joining us.  Stay tuned.  We've got special  coverage from -- on Fox Business for the midterm elections beginning  November 6th.  </p><p>\"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\" kicks us off at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Tuesday night.  </p><p>Neil Cavuto takes over at 8:00 p.m.  I will join Neil at 8:00.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA the next morning starts an hour earlier.  We'll all be  here.  All hands on deck 5:00 a.m. Eastern.  The next day with all the  results because some of these races could go late with, of course,  California closing late on Tuesday night.</p><p>Coming up, my exclusive sit-down with IAC Chairman, Barry Diller.  What he  says about the future of social media and companies in his portfolio,  including Match, Tinder, and Angie's.  </p><p>Plus, oil earnings in focus this morning.  Supply concerns weighing on  investors.  We'll talk more about that after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  TGIF, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Friday, November 2nd,  your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Finishing up another week of earnings, it's a big one, Apple shares are  under pressure, this morning, the technology giant, reporting the fourth  straight quarter of record revenue and profit.  However, the company said  it will no longer report unit sales, not going over well with investors,  this morning.</p><p>And isn't it interesting that we are looking at Apple, down almost six  percent, and we're still expecting a rally, in the broader markets.</p><p>We're waiting on energy names this morning, reporting their quarter,  including Exxon Mobil and Chevron.  We are also waiting, of course, on the  October jobs report, that's going to come out in two hours from now.</p><p>We are expecting 190,000 jobs added to the economy in the month of October,  with an unemployment rate holding steady, at 3.7 percent.  We will look at  what it all means for the midterm elections, now, four days away from the  midterms.</p><p>Check out Futures, going into all of that, Dow Industrials expected to be  up 225-point rally at the start, even with Apple, down where it is.  The  other averages also higher, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P, up fractionally.</p><p>The major indices finished higher, yesterday, as well.  We had a 3-day  rally underway, Dow Industrials yesterday, at the close, up 264 points,  better than one percent.  Check out the NASDAQ, yesterday, at the close, up  128 points, that was one and three quarters percent, yesterday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, momentum is continuing, FT 100 up three quarters of  a percent, 50 points higher, CAC Quarante in Paris, up one and a third  percent, 65 points higher, and the DAX Index in Germany, up 1-1/2 percent,  166 points higher.</p><p>Overnight, in Asia, markets were higher across the board, best performer,  Korea, up 3-1/2 percent.  Hang Seng, up more four -- the Hang Seng Index up  better than four percent, in Hong Kong.</p><p>And protests at Google are continuing, thousands of employees are  protesting the company's -- they're walking off the job after the company  is reacting to the sexual harassment allegations.  We will tell you about  that.  How the company's reacting to all these protests.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, the future of the internet, IAC  and Expedia Group Chairman Barry Diller, sitting down with me, in a FOX  Business Exclusive, we talked about the brands of his business and I also  got his take on regulation, will hit the industry in the wake of privacy  scandals at major players like Google and Facebook.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DILLER:  Well, look at what has happened with Facebook and with Google and  with all of the large players in communications or in social  communications, where the proliferation, the ability to simply get into the  system with infectious disease, bad, evil thought, manipulations by  Russians or by the Chinese or by this political action side or that.</p><p>The demonizing of George Soros, and, in fact, where every one of these --  Facebook just announced that they had this huge breach, every technology,  it is -- the cyber warfare of it.  All of these things are just -- you  know, it's just the stir of what has been enabled.  And we are not even yet  at the even beginning stage of taming it.  And it will, over time, get  tamed.</p><p>I think it's going to get tamed by regulation, because I think we've  reached the stage where regulation is a recommended thing when you have  these areas that have gotten so strong and powerful, with so many  unintended consequences that the only way that you can really probably deal  with them is, through some -- through, hopefully, wise regulation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is regulation, though, going to look like, because you  can't really regulate a company just because it got big and powerful, but  if they have market share of 90 percent of all search, like Google does, or  if they have vulnerabilities to the bad actors, like Facebook, how do you  regulate that?</p><p>DILLER:  Well, I think, we should resurrect some form of what was called,  the fairness doctrine.  So, if you have an opinion over on this side, you  have to air -- you have to provide a countervailing opinion on the other  side, that's called fairness doctrine.</p><p>And it ruled broadcasting for 25 years until, of course, there were then  lots more outlets for expression and they say, we don't need this anymore  because we've got enough diversity, OK?  Now, we have the opposite end of  this coin, which is they have too much out there, and too many divisive  currents running throughout it.</p><p>So, some semblance of this fairness doctrine that tries in its way, to not  have, essentially, one voice speaking, only one thing to one constituency  and another that continues to polarize everything, so I think, that may be  a solution.  It's complicated.</p><p>And by the way, everybody in broadcasting will hate it.  Listen, if we can  do anything through legislative process, we really ought to have  nonpartisan people get in a room and say, we've got to figure out ways not  to control this or crimp it, but realizing its power and realizing what  these very near-term effects have been for the last couple of years,  particularly.</p><p>And right, today, with what has happened in the last couple weeks,  something has got to be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And now, these companies are saying, OK, government is coming,  the big hand of government may start regulating us, let's try to start  policing this ourselves.  Has Facebook done a good job of trying to put  things in place?</p><p>DILLER:  I read this piece, this morning, in the New York Times, saying, is  Mark Zuckerberg too big to fail?  The idea of being that -- just like these  big banks, you know, they were too big to fail, they would have terrible  consequences.  That he is now a figure because he controls the company.   That he also, is too big to fail.  You can't let him fail and nobody can  replace him.</p><p>However, replacing him, people say, would be a good idea.  Here's the  thing, this is a holy -- this is a -- this is an extraordinary talent who  created a company and has been learning since childhood, 20 years old or  whatever, to be a good executive on the job.</p><p>He has done really well, so well, that his company got huge and got,  essentially, in front of his ability to control it tame it.  And they have  done a tremendous job trying, extraordinarily difficult ability to actually  do so.</p><p>But they've been trying and trying with some success and some failure, to  actually control this or let's say, adjudicate what is the right kind of  information for them to put over their platform.  And yes, I would say  within the construct of how difficult it is, they put huge amounts of  resources against it, they've announced to the markets that they're going  to have a slower growth because of it.</p><p>That they're going to have less net income, because they're going to have  to spend so much, all of which, they're doing.  And who else should do  that?  Now, I think, that through a level playing field, government  regulation is going to have to help him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want you to assess where we are, right now, in terms of where  the growth is, internet-related businesses.  Where do you see the growth in  the coming 5 to 10 years?</p><p>DILLER:  Well, I mean, the growth is just part of the revolution.  You  know, people kind of forget that the internet revolution is still in, like,  in year terms, really young, it's 22 or 23 years, and it took 10 years to  15 years just to get up enough bandwidth, to actually have rich media,  being served through it.</p><p>So, we're really at the very, very earliest stage of this.  Now, there are  companies that have, kind of, Expedia, for instance, one of the first  companies that kind of colonized travel for the internet, 20 years ago.</p><p>But, that's a world where the colonization of all these businesses is just  now coming on, so to speak, full line, where you can do almost everything  and almost everything more, through digital platforms, so the growth is  everywhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it's really digital platforms, enabling you to do whatever  you want, so with Match, you're talking about dating, and with Expedia,  travel.  Are there areas that have not been capitalized on, in terms of  that digital platform?</p><p>DILLER:  Well, I'll give you one, which is when we're engaged in, but there  are lots of others.  I mean, financial -- FinTech, Financial Technology, is  just now, really getting into very much mainstream, and big companies are  being built in it.</p><p>For us, home services, being able, in your home, to do the same thing  essentially, you do, when you want a car, which is, you know, you want to  be taken someplace rather than drive yourself.  Where, you have an app, and  with Uber, you simply say, I want it now, and you see the car coming, you  can see where it is, and all that.</p><p>With home services, which has been the most difficult, one of the most  difficult areas to tame, because it's the most essentially vocal of  everything, which is, your water heater breaks, your -- whatever, air- conditioning doesn't work.  You have -- just take it on the emergency side  or the quick service side.</p><p>You want help, right?  Now, there is an app, in ANGI Homeservices, and  HomeAdvisor.  There is an app where, literally, you do the same thing.  You  say, I need a plumber, and it will show you plumbers hovering around, Uber- ish like, service providers.</p><p>And you'd be able to do the full circle of that transaction on your little  mobile device, because it's there, and it's ready for you.  Well, that is  just now at its very earliest stages.  And so, it's just one example where  growth is -- you know, runway is infinite.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is there an opportunity to create another ANGI, to go aside  from that or you just use ANGI to, as the vehicle, to capitalize on that?</p><p>DILLER:  Well, no.  You have to think again, it's a platform.  And the  platform essentially takes consumers over here, who have needs, and service  providers over here, who provide services.  And through technology, it  makes a perfect match or good match.</p><p>So that's what all of those things are.  They're platforms.  So, once, by  the way, you have a platform, then, when you say, will others be created?   I mean, certainly, there'll be other platforms created, but there won't be  that many because the network effects have to come into play.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about Match, since you're talking about a  perfect match, when that first came on the scene, and when you -- we were  first talking about meeting somebody online, it was so foreign to so many  people, but it seems to have really resonated it, to the extent that people  are meeting and getting married, I mean, increasingly.  Where is that  business right now?</p><p>DILLER:  When you say increasingly, you know, we've been involved in this  for almost 20 years, I think.  I mean, we bought Match, quite early, in the  -- in the cycle.  We found that, you know what?  That's a very good idea.</p><p>We found this little company in Texas called Match.com, which we bought,  and the thing is, when you say it's just now becoming where people get  married, we've watched, 10 years ago, we had literally -- I think -- I  don't know what the count was, it was definitely above 1 million marriages  come, out of Match.com.</p><p>And then, the technology moves forward and forward, and you have Tinder,  which is actually younger, in terms of the people.  People on Match were  fairly serious.  I mean, yes, they wanted to date and see what would happen  on our little one-time date.  But they also really wanted relationships.</p><p>Tinder, kind of, got younger in earlier stage of, let's say, pre- relationships to say one-time dating or one-time whatever.  But now, is  moving into the same track that Match did, which is real relationships are  coming out of Tinder.</p><p>The thing is, it's an alternative to the historic going to bars, being  fixed up, et cetera, et cetera.  This actually does bring technology into  the mix.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  Are you surprised on what has taken place  in the last 25 years?  I mean, when you --</p><p>DILLER:  Well, shocked more than -- I mean, not shocked.  You can't.  It's  a stupid thing.  When you are inside of a revolution, which I was just  lucky enough, in timing, to get into at the early stage, you know, you  don't -- you don't realize the effects of what is happening, so to speak,  around you.</p><p>But this is a truly radical revolution.  And right now, it's a very  troubled revolution, which happens at -- let's call it really early stages.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's going to talk more about where the trouble is, right now,  more of my exclusive interview with Barry Diller, next hour.  You know,  I've covered Barry Diller now for 25 years, and I've watched him amass this  incredible portfolio of internet companies.</p><p>And he really has highlighted or targeted or put his finger on some of the  real growth stories of the internet, whether it's dating or ANGI and home,  you know, HomeServices or Tinder, and so many others.  But, interesting,  James, that he mentions regulation, is going to be, sort of, the next leg  of what's to come.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I hope it doesn't go there.  The history is that it ends up  favoring big incumbents and preventing new competitors.  And I think we'd  like more competition to some of these drives.</p><p>I also think he's talking about the fairness doctrine.  That is going to be  very tough to square with the first amendment, so not sure where that's  going.  But, as far as his investments, glad I don't have to date anymore,  but, it's nice that he's offering people some good technology to do this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  And meanwhile, then, there's Google, thousands  of Google employees, around the world, walking off the job, protesting the  company's response to sexual misconduct allegations.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti is here with more details there, and I've been astounded  by the story, Lauren, with the maker -- the creator of the Android, getting  $90 million after some really rough behavior there.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Explosive allegations that  were found to be credible.  Andy Rubin is that man, he denies those  allegations.  Anyway, the message that we heard from Google workers  yesterday, that time is up for tech.</p><p>Google staff, thousand strong and more than they expected, are staging a  powerful global walkout, you are looking at some of the most amazing  pictures that we saw from yesterday.  They're protesting how the company  handles sexual harassment.</p><p>The catalyst was this bombshell New York Times report, that Google paid  Andy Rubin, $90 million in severance, even though, Google actually  concluded the allegations against him were credible.  It seems that the  sexual misconduct is more widespread at the company than we might have  thought.</p><p>Google says it fired 48 executives over similar allegations and it did not  give those executives exit packages.  But the power of yesterday's protest  underlines two things for me.  The first one is the influence of this  activist workforce, and how they influence their company to act in certain  ways.</p><p>We saw it with their response to Google, looking out ways to get into the  Chinese market.  And we saw with their criticism of Google, doing work with  the Pentagon, and also a sense of hypocrisy.  You know, they have this  motto, this code of conduct at Google, do the right thing, and employers  are calling foul on that.</p><p>They're protesting an end to forced arbitration, so victims of sexual  harassment would be able to sue and they're also looking for gender pay  equality, among other things.</p><p>So, they had a message, they had a mission.  The Google's CEO, Sundar  Pichai, he was at the New York Times DealBook Conference yesterday, and he  said this \"Moments like this, show that we didn't always get it right, and  so we are committed to doing better.\"  And he did silently or gave a muted  endorsement of the protest yesterday.</p><p>KELLY:  I talked to a couple of people in Silicon Valley, and one of the --  one of the biggest points that was made is that, there were a lot of  confidentiality agreements that were going around too, that were very  Weinstein-esque.</p><p>And so, that's what -- that lit a lot of fire for some of the people that  walked out, because I was talking to people yesterday, what do you make of  this?  Why is it so strong?  And they said, listen, there's a double  standard, executives weren't held accountable.  There were confidentiality  agreements and that just not in the best interests, so employees were  treated different than the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is like the Weinstein situation, in the sense that there is a  double standard, politically, as well.  Organizations are -- who were  considered conservative, are targeted by the loudest voices in the country.</p><p>But I think that the Valley and these tech companies got a little bit of a  past because they are Bastian of liberalism, quite frankly.  And now, the  women who work there are coming out and saying hey, Human Resources was not  handling these sexual harassment complaints in the way that they should  have.</p><p>And I think it remained hidden and they weren't -- they weren't targeted  verbally and loudly, across the country because, again, that's where the  Dems live.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, they made Rubin resign, right?  And the situation was that  they gave such high praise.  So, here he was -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And $90 million, $90 million, as a hero's exit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And there was another executive who quit this week, by the way.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And also a lot of severance package too, so very not  transparent in how they dealt with these sexual misconduct allegations.   Time's up for tech.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right, we'll talk more about that, coming up.  Thank  you so much, Lauren.  Coming up, it is job's day, we are expecting 190,000  jobs added to the economy, in the month of October, we're talking about  what that means for the midterm elections now four days away, special  coverage, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, earnings are the story, certainly, Alibaba  set to report momentarily.  As soon as those numbers hit, we will get you  them.  The stock is up ahead of the numbers. What are you watching from  Alibaba, this morning, Kevin Kelly?  It's up 3-1/2 percent.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  What's pretty interesting is that actually Cloud should be  their biggest driver of growth.  They actually have a data center in  Silicon Valley.  They have -- they have one in Europe that they've opened  up.  They're expanding that business to take on Amazon, to take on  Microsoft, especially in China.  Microsoft has been expanding their Cloud  business there.</p><p>One of the interesting things is we need to see what Jack Ma says about the  trade war.  He said the trade war could last for over 20 years.  I don't  know if you remember that, but that made a lot of headlines, when he was  talking about that.</p><p>So, we're going to see some guidance because they're also investing in the  retail, pretty significantly, and expanding.  So expect the top line  revenues to do very well.  But actually, the bottom line to be very, very  thin.</p><p>And one of the things that may have impacted them, is that the U.S.  government actually ended the sweetheart deal on parcel services coming  over here in the United States, I heard there was a lot of subsidies, so  that ended recently, so we'll have to see guidance, how that's impacting  some of their sellers on their site, Tmall.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was there still questions about how the company reports certain  revenue lines?  There were a lot of questions about the structure of the  revenue, reporting it, at this company, for a long time.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And that's still taking hold, especially because they're  always moving things around if you think about their financial services,  Alipay, was actually taken out of the company right before their IPO.  And  now, Alipay is actually being influenced to break up their largest money  market mutual fund over in China, so there's not really any transparency or  accountability because it can move assets -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's why some people won't invest in Alibaba for that one  reason.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, unequivocally, absolutely.  But, Singles' Day, they've sort of  revolutionized how people transact.  They have, on November 11th, 1111,  they have Singles' Day.  And then, you saw Amazon follow them into that,  with Prime Day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's right, Singles' Day.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know if we will get any more visibility, but this  question, why he's leaving?  He's a relatively young man, I don't know if  it says something about his thoughts on China, going forward, but doesn't  seem like a bullish sign.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, he's getting older and he's tired.</p><p>FREEMAN:  He's not that old.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's a young guy, but -- </p><p>KELLY:  I mean, that's what he said.  That's what he said.  That's what he  said.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, Apple, one of the issues with Apple is because of  transparency, as well.  They're not going to be reporting their unit sales  and that's why the stock is down, this morning.  We'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back, stop the suds, WeWork is putting limits on how much free  beer their employees are entitled to.  Yes, how much free beer are you  entitled to drink during the day?  Next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, right  here, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Friday  morning, everybody.  TGIF.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Friday, November 2nd.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the button right now.</p><p>Major market moves this morning -- Apple shares the story of the day.  It  is down on weak revenue guidance and on the announcement that the company  is no longer going to be providing unit sales.  So we will not know  specific unit sales on a quarterly basis anymore.  The technology giant at  risk of losing a $1-trillion market valuation with today's move.  It is  down 5.25 percent.</p><p>The other big story of the market, of course, is the October jobs report.   Yes, it is jobs Friday right here.  The expectation is for 190,000 jobs  added to the economy in the month of October with the unemployment rate  holding steady at 3.7 percent which is a multi-decade low.</p><p>We will take a look at what this means for the midterm elections and the  market.  Of course, the midterms now four days away.</p><p>Check out futures this morning.  Even with the 5.5 percent selloff in  Apple, we're looking at a rally of 260 points on the Dow Jones Industrial  Average.  It's going to be up about 1 percent right out of the gate this  morning.  The S&amp;P 500 is expected to be up 21 points.  That's three- quarters of 1 percent.  And the Nasdaq right now up 15 points, a quarter of  a percent on the Nasdaq.</p><p>This after another day of gains yesterday.  This is the third day of gains  for the markets yesterday.  The Dow Industrials up 265 points at the close.   All the major indices finished at their highs of the -- or near their highs  of the session.  The Dow, S&amp;P up better than 1 percent; the Nasdaq up 1.75  percent, 128 points higher yesterday for the Nasdaq.</p><p>Markets this morning across the globe higher -- FT 100 up three-quarters of  a percent, 53 points higher in London; one-and-a-third percent higher in  Paris on the CAC 40 at 66 points higher; and the DAX index in Germany up  172 points, that's 1.5 percent higher in Germany. </p><p>In Asia, overnight gains across the board -- check it out.  Best performer  Hong Kong -- Hang Seng index up better than 4 percent overnight.</p><p>On the earnings front, we are watching Alibaba earnings later this morning.   We will hear from oil giants and Dow components, ExxonMobil and Chevron.   We'll have those numbers and analysis.</p><p>Right now, it's really Apple which is a big focus but these are coming out  soon.</p><p>China trade in focus -- this was important yesterday in the markets.   President Trump spoke with China's president Xi Jinping and apparently  there was progress in the trade dispute from what we understand from that  phone call.  It definitely helped markets rally yesterday in the middle of  the day.</p><p>Here's what IAC chairman Barry Diller told me about China's trade practices  yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARRY DILLER, CHAIRMAN, IAC:  I am not a proponent of quote, \"trade wars\" - - their trade practices have to change, trying to pick trade wars.  If you  let an unfettered trade war actually take place, which is in our control,  it would be disastrous for everybody.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest coming up.  More of Barry Diller this  morning.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street  Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman; and Benchmark  managing partner, Kevin Kelly.  Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  So Alibaba is actually up right  now 5 percent in the premarket because they actually beat pretty  significantly on the revenues and on their bottom line.  They have a  revenue forecast cut on macroeconomic conditions though.  So even though  they did beat, so it was initially up 5 percent, now it seems like it's  coming down a little bit because probably of this forecast of macro  concerns.</p><p>And one of the things they're actually talking about is also the money they  need to spend into their streaming services.  So in order for them to be  the Netflix of China, they're indicating they need to spend significantly  more on their content.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it is losing ground quickly.  </p><p>KELLY:  It is losing ground quickly.  But they said their annual active  buyers are actually up 23 percent so they're doing very well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the numbers are better than expected -- </p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- but they're going to be having to see costs go up.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  They're seeing costs go up, and also they're guiding revenues  down because of macro conditions.  So unless Trump and President Xi Jinping  have beautiful chocolate cake, Alibaba is very concerned.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The chocolate cake moment.  </p><p>We've got a lot coming up this morning.  Part two of my exclusive interview  with the chairman and senior executive of both IAC and Expedia Group.   That's Barry Diller.  He weighs in on Amazon, Google, U.S. trade relations  with China as well as General Electric as well.  You don't want to miss a  moment of it.  So do stay with us for that interview.</p><p>But we want to get to Apple because the stock is trading down this morning  on disappointing guidance.  It is on track to shave about 85 points from  the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Stock right now down 5.5 percent as CEO  Tim Cook said that the company will no longer give unit sales figures in  future reports.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM COOK, CEO, APPLE:  This is like if you go to the market and you push  your cart up to the cashier and she says or he says how many units you have  in there?  It doesn't -- it doesn't matter a lot, how many units there are  in there in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.  Well, I can understand the analogy.  Does it not  matter?  I would imagine analysts -- </p><p>KELLY:  No.  I think it matters.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  If your investors tell you it  matters, then it matters.  Whatever your messaging is -- more information  is better.  You can't be in the news business and say I want less  information from the world's $1 trillion company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   No, I'm not going to say that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ok.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Obviously, you do want more information and as people think about  the company's future, they want to see in each segment how it's doing.  But  I would say in his defense, this has never been a company that -- where  it's about volume.  Apple really has not been the big volume producer.   That's the android universe.</p><p>So what Apple sells is to a smaller market but to a much more lucrative  market, very high-priced, very high-margin products.  So if you're seeing  what you want to see on the revenue and the earnings from each of these  products -- </p><p>KELLY:  I beg to differ.  </p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know that it's the end of the world that you don't see  how many devices.  </p><p>KELLY:  It's not about that.  It's not even about the iPhone anymore.  It's  60 percent of sales now.  It used to be a lot more of that.  It actually  used to be 75 percent of sales.  But we need to get unit sales on Mac  books, on their home pods, on their watches -- that is the next leg of  growth for them and attribution into their ecosystem.</p><p>So the problem is that they missed on the services side.  In order for the  services side to grow, we need to know how many units they're selling of  each product line.  So I need to know what's in that shopping cart because  they missed on the services.</p><p>They had less than $10 billion.  They're saying that it's $10 billion.  It  was actually less than that.  It was $9.981 billion when every analyst  across the street had at least $10.18 billion.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We should point out that services -- </p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>KELLY:  So that's the biggest issue.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The market agrees with you.  Over time, I think this is probably  not going to be -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're calling this a miss.  </p><p>KELLY:  No -- but this is a miss.  They missed on unit sales for iPhones  which is 60 percent of the revenue.  And then they're refreshing all their  Macbook Pros and their watches and now we're not going to get guidance into  that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The growth -- they missed on the forecast for the December  quarter that it was -- they show slowing growth there.  That was the  revenue forecast.  In terms of the services business, we should just point  out that's app store sales, Apple pay use, music streaming, subscriptions  stuff like that -- revenue growth there was up 17 percent.  That's slower  in recent quarters.</p><p>When you have a valuation like this, you have to -- your growth rates need  to be bigger and bigger and bigger, not smaller and smaller and smaller.  </p><p>KELLY:  That's it.  And listen Morgan Stanley just downgraded the price  target from $247 to $226 and their analyst has been very good on the stock.   You had BAML -- Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch downgrade their price target  to $223 -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't forget what Dan Miles -- I know I keep saying this -- but  he was right.  I mean what's your take on inventory because Dan said that  in the second quarter inventory was up 89 percent.  And that also goes hand  in hand with the unit sales because if you've got all this inventory, first  you've got get rid of that before you actually start producing more.  </p><p>KELLY:  That's it.  And they're not expecting to sell more that's why  you're seeing them increase the price of their products -- ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KELLY:  And then they also had their component costs go down.  So that's  great.  But I don't invest in the stock market looking in the rearview  mirror.  I invest looking forward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's look forward to the jobs report.  That's another major  story this morning because the jobs report is coming out in an hour-and-a- half.</p><p>We want to check out one of the election's most pivotal states this morning  and that's Florida.</p><p>Kristina Partsinevelos as has more from the Sunshine State this morning.   And Kristina -- it's been a good jobs market in Florida as well.  Good  morning to you.  </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   And you're right.</p><p>Yes, it is a pivotal race.  It's a swing state.  And this year is no  different.  We have a lot of people looking at the governor's race and the  senate race.</p><p>We have former President Obama who is going to be here in Miami where I am  right now on Route 1.  It's very early in the morning so it's still quite  dark out.  He's throwing his support behind the Dems.  You've got Andrew  Gillum who's running for governor and then incumbent Bill Nelson who is  also going for Senate.  So those are the two candidates that former  President Obama is supporting.</p><p>If we take a look at the Real Clear Politics polls and average multi-polls  (ph) that we're seeing across the board for governor in Florida, you're  seeing a slight lead, a little bit less than 3 percent for Gillum.  Gillum  is 39 years old, a progressive, mayor of Tallahassee -- pretty much pushing  for higher minimum wage and higher corporate taxes.</p><p>He is going against Republican Ron DeSantis who has the full support of  President Trump.  They will be together on Saturday in Pensacola.  And you  have Ron DeSantis who is an advocate for gun control.  There hasn't been a  Democrat who's been elected for the governor's race since 1994.  </p><p>And we switch over to Senate race which is also closely watched -- we look  at the polls over there from Real Clear Politics again, you're seeing as of  this morning less than 2 percent lead for Bill Nelson.  So Bill Nelson, 75  years old, a centrist -- he's pushing for a ban on assault rifles.</p><p>And he's going against Governor Rick Scott who's very familiar here because  he served two terms as governor.  He wants to continue his political life  which is why he's running for Senate.  A lot can happen here.  </p><p>We have former President Obama here, in Georgia on Friday and in Chicago on  Sunday.  Lots of movement in Florida and we're going to be here.  </p><p>Back to you -- guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's really an important race.  Kristina -- thank you.   We'll keep checking back.  Kristina Partsinevelos is in Miami this morning.</p><p>Joining us right now is Florida Congressman Ted Yoho.  He's running for  office in Florida's third congressional district and is on the Foreign  Affairs and Agriculture House Committees.  Sir -- it's good to have you on  this morning.  </p><p>REP. TED YOHO (R), FLORIDA:  Hi.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>YOHO:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you feel going into the midterms in terms of your own  prospects?  </p><p>YOHO:  I feel really good.  We've got a lot of momentum on the ground.   We've got people out door-knocking, making phone calls.  We're doing  rallies and coffees all over the district.</p><p>The momentum is on our side that we're seeing.  And I think you're going to  see it carry through the governor's race and the Senate race with Rick  Scott.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it doesn't look like that.  We're looking at the numbers.   And if you believe the polls, it looks like Gillum is in the lead and even  Nelson is in the lead.  What do you think about that?  </p><p>YOHO:  Well, we got internal polls-- we've got internal polls that show  different.  If you go back to the last presidential election, they had  Hillary Clinton leading the day of the election.  So I think there's a lot  of movement on the ground.  I think you're going see this. </p><p>And then you've got our governor's race -- you know, you've got a guy  that's under FBI investigation and he's got a liberal progressive agenda  that wants to roll back what Rick Scott has done.</p><p>And then you compare Rick Scott's record with Bill Nelson is just like a  place holder and he's not accomplished a whole lot.  Rick Scott has created  1.6 million jobs in this state, lowered taxes and we've got one of the best  ratings, if not the best rating in the country for a state.</p><p>Rick Scott has done an awesome job.  He'll do that in the senate.  And I  can't wait for him to get up there and work with him.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- it's Dagen McDowell.  The unemployment rate in  the state of Florida is below the national average.  It was 3.5 percent in  Florida.  </p><p>YOHO:  It sure is.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rick Scott took that economy to a trillion dollars in terms of  its value.  </p><p>YOHO:  He sure did.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why isn't that resonating with the voters?  Why wouldn't he be  leading Bill Nelson?  </p><p>YOHO:  Well, you know, I guess politics.  You know, you've got all these  negative ads going out there from both sides.  Mainly, you see more attacks  from the other side.</p><p>But then you look at, you know, where he stands on things.  Rick Scott has  not varied on who he is and what he said and what he said he was going to  accomplish.  He's done that.  And the voters -- like I said, our internal  polls show a different story than what you're seeing on national polls.</p><p>And then, you know, again I can account for District 3 which is six  counties in north central Florida.  But we talk to people all over the  state.  This economy that we have, we've not seen this before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>YOHO:  And then you take, you know, the tax cuts that we did with President  Trump and rolled back regulations, that fits hand in hand.  Andrew Gillum  wants to go the other way -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>YOHO:  -- and Bill Nelson want to go the other way.  The people of Florida  are not ready for that.  </p><p>(CROSS TALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so you're just -- you're not believing -- you're not  believing these polls.  You say your polls say something different.  </p><p>How important is the China story for Floridians?  I mean the U.S.-China  trade issue?  The President yesterday sounded optimistic because he had a  phone call with the Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p><p>But I spoke with the former CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer yesterday,  along with the chairman of IAC Barry Diller, and they were both incredibly  concerned about China's business practices.  Listen to this.  I've got to  get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  90 percent of companies are using the Microsoft operating  platform and only 1 percent are paying for it.  How do we -- what are we  going to do that China keeps stealing everything this way?  I mean that's  pretty extraordinary.  </p><p>STEVE BALLMER, FORMER CEO, MICROSOFT:  I'm a free trader by nature.  I went  to school, economics -- it's the best thing for the world.  This one's a  tricky issue because it's absolutely clear that the rules don't apply in  China and the U.S. government needs to do something -- whether tariffs are  right or wrong, I'm silent on that point.</p><p>But without any pressure from the U.S. government, we're talking about $10  billion plus for example in Microsoft that would go into profit.  </p><p>DILLER:  Their trade practices have to change.  And us being tough-minded  about it, I think it's sensible.  I think us being outrageous and excessive  about it is dangerous.  I don't think the trade war is -- if you let an  unfettered trade war actually take place, which is in our control, it will  be disastrous for everybody.  So they will have to mature their practices.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman-- your reaction?  Is this an issue for Floridians?  </p><p>YOHO:  It's an issue all over the nation.  But what President Trump is  doing is something that had to be done.  Unchecked it would get worse.  And  so I'm glad he's doing what he's doing and I stand behind him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- it's good to have you on the program.  We'll be  watching the developments on Tuesday.  It's nice (ph) to see you -- thank  you.</p><p>YOHO:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ted Yoho.</p><p>We also invited Congressman Yoho's opponent.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are watching earnings.  We get two more Dow components coming this  morning.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with all the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  A lot of market moving  news before the market even opens -- Maria.</p><p>ExxonMobil expected to post double digit gains in earnings and revenue from  a year ago with the average price for oil up 34 percent for the third  quarter in general.</p><p>We're also going to get results from Chevron today.  Analysts looking for  the company's profits to double with revenue up nearly 30 percent.  That's  the oil story.</p><p>Alibaba out with its latest results just a few minutes ago.  Revenue rising  54 percent from a year ago to $12.4 billion.  Shares are substantially  higher in the premarket, up almost 6 percent right now.  All right.  That  stock though is off the highs from previous revenue guidance.</p><p>And also, we're looking at Apple, real quick here.  The stock is trading  sharply lower, down almost 6 percent in the premarket.  Earnings, as we've  been talking about today topped the street's estimates in the latest  quarter but Apple also issued disappointing guidance for the current  quarter which includes, of course, the holiday season and we've been  talking about the unit sales issue.  This raises questions about weaker  than expected demand for their more expensive new iPhones which we're not  going to be getting numbers on anymore.</p><p>All right.  There is this -- a group of Tesla shareholders wants to put  tighter reins on CEO Elon Musk.  Three Tesla investors sent the board a  letter saying the company should permanently separate the positions of  chairman and chief executive, both of which Musk holds.  That would go  beyond Tesla's settlement with the SEC that required Musk to step down as  chairman for just three years.</p><p>The directors are also calling for more turnover on the company's board,  recommending a time line be set for some directors to leave.  There is  Tesla in the premarket, up almost three-quarters of a percent.</p><p>And then there is this -- bottomless beer no more.  Co-working space Wework  is now setting a limit for what used to be bottomless kegs of beer for its  tenants.  The New York tenants are now going to be limited to just four  beers per day-- each person per day.  Wework says that the change was  determined by software to help manage the beer supply.</p><p>So it's a software issue, not the fact that people were getting drunk at  Wework while they were working there.  Ok.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't even understand that.  They were drinking more than  four beers a day during the day?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Bottomless beer, bottomless mimosas -- you know what  happens.  This is what the story is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's in your cup?  </p><p>KELLY:  Oh yes.  This is definitely not gin.  It's for sure water.</p><p>But I just wanted real quickly on the Alibaba side -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Thanks -- Cheryl.</p><p>KELLY:  I accidentally said that they beat on the top line, miss on the  bottom.  It was the inverse.  Alibaba missed on the top line, beat  significantly on the bottom line.  But the main takeaway is that they  actually guided their revenue forecast down 4 percent to 6 percent going  forward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Look at this.  Stock is still up -- Kevin.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's up almost 6 percent even though it's a revenue miss.   Thank you.</p><p>Coming up, a scare on the high seas to tell you about -- details on the  terrifying moments that caused a cruise ship to tilt.  That's coming up.</p><p>Then countdown to the midterms is on, we break down why the number one  issue for voters apparently according to the polls is health care.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We are only four days away from the midterm elections.  In a recent Fox  News poll, health care is the number one issue driving Americans to the  voting booth.  Joining us right now is Dr. Joseph Galati.  He is the author  of \"Eating Yourself Sick\".</p><p>Why do you think health care has become a top priority in our country is  the number one issue here?  Dr. Galati -- good to see you.  Thanks for  being here.  </p><p>DR. JOSEPH GALATI, AUTHOR, \"EATING YOURSELF SICK\":  Well -- thank you,  Maria.</p><p>You know, health care is always a hot button topic.  Our patients -- the  ones that I'm dealing with in Texas come to me with all sorts of insurance  problems.  They're worried about pre-existing.  They're worried about  insurance companies not covering certain procedures or disorders that they  have.</p><p>And so a day doesn't go by that patients are not sitting in my office,  talking and complaining about their health care.  How it's going to be  solved, I don't know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GALATI:  It's really a big, behemoth problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So James -- lay out the issue for us in terms of pre-existing  conditions.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  So the idea is you don't want to let people buy insurance  on their way to the hospital.  This would be the argument to say let's have  an insurance market.  If you are sick already, you don't need insurance.   You need health care.</p><p>So you need a system that allows people to get the care they need but if  you're going to have an insurance market, they have to be able to sell to  healthy people, not just sick people and so that's the theory.  Now, the  President has said he doesn't want to change anything with pre-existing  conditions.  That wasn't changed obviously.  The Republicans never rewrote  Obamacare.</p><p>So it's kind of a phony issue in that way.  But to me, I don't know if  you're hearing from patients, this issue of the Medicare-for-all plan,  which ends Medicare and ends private insurance, in other words, it ends all  pre-existing coverage, every person in the United States this is the plan  that most Democrats in the House have endorsed -- Bernie Sanders, a lot of  the Senate candidates.  It ends all coverage in the U.S. and creates a new  government plan.  What does that mean for patients?  </p><p>GALATI:  You know, when you read about this Medicare for all, it's very  thin on details.  It's very thin on whether administrative costs are going  to go down, whether it's going to provide better health care.  That is  really unclear.</p><p>And unfortunately, whenever people hear something for all, people jump on  the bandwagon and say this is good for America.  When really if we're  voting on it or talking about it, the details are thin and you know, what  really are we dealing with?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But we do know from the legislation whether it's the Bernie  Sanders plan or the one that most House Democrats have co-sponsored, it  explicitly says private insurance goes away.  Medicare goes away.</p><p>So this is the end of pre-existing coverage.  Not just particular  conditions.  Your whole health plan is changing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People do not understand this.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I don't know why this isn't an issue in this election.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And you're all about wellness and prevention, I mean  getting ahead of disease.  </p><p>GALATI:  It is.  And the sad part is, in my area of liver disease that I  take care of, we see patients, we counsel them on staying well.  Because  taking care of somebody at the end is not the way to take care of yourself.</p><p>And so in the book, \"Eating Yourself Sick\", 30 years of interviewing  thousands of patients, I see that.  I had a conversation with a patient  five years ago, six years ago, and they just continued to decline.  And the  common thread in so many of these diseases -- fatty liver disease,  cirrhosis, diabetes, heart disease, cancer -- it's what we're eating.</p><p>It sounds real simple but what Americans are eating -- the processed foods  -- is crazy.  We have lost our way on eating at home, cooking at home with  your children.  And what I propose, as simple as it is, is to get back to  the basics.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  It's prevention all the way.  Get ahead of  disease.  That will eliminate all the costs that we're faced with in the  terms of cure and care rather than prevention.</p><p>GALATI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dr. Galati -- we could talk about this all day.  </p><p>GALATI:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is probably our favorite subject, actually.  </p><p>GALATI:  It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us.  </p><p>GALATI:  Absolutely.  It's been a pleasure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  Joseph Galati there.</p><p>Coming up -- the streaming wars are heating up, technology giants Amazon  and (AUDIO GAP) Netflix.</p><p>Stay with us for part two of my exclusive interview with the chairman and  senior exec of both IAC and Expedia Group.

Good to see you.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  </p><p>PAYNE:  It's a great looking at -- interesting morning, huh?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are all hands on deck to get the jobs report out. </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Mr. Optimism is what I was  going to call you and sure enough.</p><p>PAYNE:  Hey, man.  I feel - no one is interesting when I went to bed last  night you figured OK, Apple is going to be responsible for at least 100  points to the downside on the Dow.  So you wake up early in the morning and  the Dow is up 200, 300 points, you're like, what the heck is going on?   This is kind of a good strange.  And it's -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Apple is down six percent, market is up 300.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, Apple, Apple - I mean so, essentially add on another 100  points and that's where the market would be if Apple didn't, you know, have  such a, you know, controversial poor, poor earnings report.  Guys, can I  just say one thing on this China thing?  I think it's remarkable from  President Trump's point of view.  So you have this great phone call with  President xi and then you come out with these indictments, right?</p><p>These criminal indictments, the Department of Justice.  In other words,  we're saying, hey, we're not going to use the World Trade Organization,  it's as game system.  We're going to go at you directly.  Now, people have  to understand, this united microelectronics, the Taiwanese company, their  partner in this is a $6 billion state-funded Chinese company.</p><p>We are going directly at them.  Last week we got five Chinese spies on  stealing technology.  I mean, this president, he has a great conversation  with the president of China, he says, but that isn't stop at nothing.  We  are going to come after you in a way that you have never seen has come  after before.  I like that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like it too.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- a better - the Journal writes today in the editorial page  that this a better strategy to cracking down on our biggest problems with  China.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  His indictments are.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Than the blunder bus are ham-handed tariffs which punishes those  who are not the perpetrators in this.  There are also --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE:  -- China, too though and I think economically, we have to do that.   I think it's one of these things where, you know, it's a sacrifice, it's --  you got to say hey, are we willing to do this, are we willing to take a  short period of pain for long term not just prosperity but fairness.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But their argument is you punish the actual culprits.  You  punish --</p><p>PAYNE:  The country is the culprit.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>PAYNE:  The country is the culprit.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But their argument Charles is that the steel and aluminum  tariffs punish those who are not stealing intellectual property and are  manufacturing -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm not uncomfortable with because whatever it takes to get  China to get in line and stop stealing theft behavior is what the  administration needs to do.  I mean, nobody has been pushing back on this.   I understand the implications, the negative implications of the steel and  aluminum but all bets are off in my opinion when it comes to China.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, I think we can do all agree  that attacking a specific issue of theft, industrial espionage is a good  idea.  We probably may be regret that the President let ZTE off the hook.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why did he let ZTE off the hook?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  I think looking back, maybe he might say now that he didn't  really see the reciprocation he was hoping for but maybe this phone call is  the beginning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  I tell you something, someone who came up as - as a broker in New  York City, I see President Trump, the classic New York City salesman and  one of the things the first thing I was taught by the best sales people on  Wall Street is you always give a little but you take back a lot.  I thought  that that was olive branch to President Xi saying, listen, I'm going  against even members of my own party.</p><p>I'm going to do something for you, but you're going do have to do something  for me later.  And so I think he established a great platform for  negotiations by doing that with the other side.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But what about Dagen's point that this messes up the  whole supply chain?</p><p>PAYNE:  Well, you know, it's -- again, it's a short-term thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  The supply chain can move to any country with slave labor or child  labor.  There's a lot of countries out there looked at but this is a short- term thing.  If we're going to be worried about this, I'm telling you, six  years from now China will blow up one of our nuclear submarines because  they will have stolen enough technology from us to be able to do that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not that - I'm not debating the goal, l'm debating the  means to fighting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  I understand.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But that's OK.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- no one has fought it before in an effective way.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And on a 232 tarrif, I will tell you this, I do think President  Trump could easily let give an exemption to Canada and Mexico and I think  that would alleviate, the market would love it and I think after the USMCA,  I'm not sure why he hasn't done that -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- next year.  It's not signed yet.  Congress has to -</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right, right.  But I'm just saying though, again, as part of the  negotiations right, listen, again, give-and-take, that part is -- yesterday  when he answer to a guy asked him manufacturing number came out, you heard  industry after industry, that was their only complaint.  It wasn't about  the China part of this, it was about to Dagen's point, to steel and  aluminum part of this.</p><p>Even though in this earning season, the dollar has been a much bigger  problem but for those companies that have talked to tariffs, whether it's  Caterpillar or others, it's been on the steel and aluminum part.  I agree  with you on there, I really believe, I really believe we can do something  at 232.  Not with China but at least with Canada --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Shall we talk jobs for a second, jobs in America, the October  jobs' report is out in - what?  23 minutes under half an hour from now,  economists are looking for 190,000 jobs added to the economy in the month  of October.  The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 3.7  percent.  The President was in Missouri yesterday and he touted as strong  jobs market and economy.  </p><p>Joining us right now is MacroMavens President, Stephanie Pomboy and the  Wall Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath.  Great to  see you both.  Thank you so much for being here.  </p><p>STEPHANIE POMBOY, PRESIDENT, MACROMAVENS LLC:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephanie, four days until the midterm elections.  The economy  is obviously one of the most important issues, and now we're seeing this  bounce back to a horrible month of October which you predicted.</p><p>POMBOY:  Well, you know, we're -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What now?</p><p>POMBOY:  That's the question, what now?  So I mean, the next couple of  months, anything can happen, you usually get your Santa Claus rally into  year-end and the economic data, this morning's number especially, are  really going to be hard to infer some broader economic message from because  we have the hurricane effect, you know, this morning's report, we'll have  the recovery from the Florence Hurricane.</p><p>And it's not clear that we'll yet have the impact of Michael.  So, this  number could actually surprise on the upside but then, you know, all of  these sort of temporary factors are going to end come January 1, at the  same time we no longer have the year-on-year effect of the tax cuts.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh god.  Here comes Debbie Downer.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>POMBOY:  Mr. Optimism next to the mistress of (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I got to go through some of your concerns, these are real  concerns, and this is important.  So hold on there.</p><p>POMBOY:  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jon, you just heard what Stephanie said, this is going to be a  little hurricany this month in terms of the jobs number.  What else should  we be forced on when this report comes out in about 20 minutes?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Oh, the wage number, the wage number is going to be pretty  good.  We could get average hourly earnings up more than three percent for  the first time in years, and I think that's what we're all going to be  talking about in about 21 minutes that, you know, we're finally seeing what  the unemployment rate down under four percent, you know, some sign that  worker wages are picking up.</p><p>And we'll probably be talking about, you know, what does that mean for  workers?  Good news for workers, what is - also, what does it mean for the  Fed on its interest rate policies?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  And we're also looking at how many people come back into the  labor force.  I guess this would be maybe, Steph, a -- an argument if the  number surprises to the downside doesn't necessarily mean business aren't  thriving, we saw that NFIB report yesterday still at record levels,  companies that can't fill open positions.  </p><p>POMBOY:  Absolutely, I mean, I -- this is -- the struggle is that, you  know, you have a tight labor market in terms of the skilled jobs.  I'm  sorry, in terms of the unskilled jobs, you know, people just -- sorry I'm  getting -- you can't mind qualified labor to fill the job.  So that's the  persistent concern but the problem is, you know, it's not like you can just  say, OK, here are 10,000 suddenly qualified people.</p><p>It's going to be a longer term struggle to fill those jobs in terms of  apprenticeships and really, education and training and whatnot.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Stephanie, one thing that you talked a lot about is the  consumer and whether or not we're actually seeing a strong consumer out  there, two-thirds of the economy and then business spending in the last GDP  report was gone, we have been talking a lot about capital expenditures  being a real positive.  Do you see any change in those two things?  These  are two important things you've been pointing out.  </p><p>POMBOY:  Right.  So, I guess, you know, again, when you look at these  numbers right now, it's really hard to infer a broader economic message  because, you know, the J-Curve Effect from, the tariff which is basically  you're going to pull forward as much spending in inventory build ahead of  the impact of the increase in tariffs come Jan 1, that is boosting  consumption and notwithstanding the weaker print in third quarter.</p><p>Industrial production and, you know, Capex beyond what normally be.  </p><p>PAYNE:  The consumer -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>POMBOY:  And the consumer -</p><p>PAYNE:  There's no signs that the consumer is not strong.</p><p>POMBOY:  But what I would point out is in that third quarter report, the  strength was acutlaly in goods which fits with this whole J-Curve, you  know, where you would buy now, what you anticipate will be for expensive.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE:  A lot of people sitting there and -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE:  -- on stuff because of the tariffs now.  The consumer is ultra,  ultra strong.  I looked at visa's results, American Express - I mean,  MasterCard.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You did, huh?</p><p>PAYNE:  The third quarter numbers.  Yesterday we learned that second  quarter, wages and salaries grew at their fastest pace in a decade, in a  decade.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What does all this mean for the midterm elections now  four days away, we are days away a few days away from what many people are  calling including myself, one of the most consequential elections of our  time in terms of the midterm elections.  Jeff Flock is live in Indianapolis  this morning with that angle.  Jeff, good morning to you.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Certainly the way it seems,  Maria.  Good morning to you.  Signs are up perhaps you see for the  President's visit here later today.  How important is Indiana, well,  President Trump will be here twice in the waning days of the campaign  starting with a rally tonight at Southport High School.  That in support of  Mike Braun, he is the Republic - the Republican businessman who is  challenging Democrat Joe Donnelly here in Indiana.</p><p>Yesterday, Braun getting the support from Senator Lindsey Graham who says,  I like Joe Donnelly, my colleague, but this is the first time I've actually  meaningfully campaigned against a colleague because it's too important this  time, we've got to elect Republicans like Mike Braun.  Listen to Braun.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE BRAUN (R), CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE, INDIANA:  Joe has tried to align  himself in the middle as being somebody behind Trump on every important  piece of legislation he has voted with the radical left.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLOCK:  Donnelly we should point out is a man who has been rated as the  most bipartisan Democrat in the Senate and he has shied away from  supporting President Trump.  He says he's even helped him build the wall.   I leave you with a poll, Maria, the latest poll that had been back-and- forth but our latest Fox News poll shows Democrat Joe Donnelly up 45 to 38  percent, seven-point --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>FLOCK:  -- because they need the President.  We'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did this lead - does this lead just widen just in the last  couple days?  That is a big lead on Donnelly.  </p><p>FLOCK:  It did.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Jeff, thank you.  Jeff Flock.  </p><p>FLOCK:  I know.  The polls have been back-and-forth all along.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sure has.</p><p>FLOCK:  But we got him ahead.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jeff flock is in Indianapolis.  Coming up.  All eyes on Apple.   Why the technology giant stock is down in the premarket.  Look at this,  this is the low of the morning.  Now down 6-1/2 percent after the earnings  report.  Stay with us. </p><p>(COMMCERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  An earnings bonanza.  ExxonMobil the latest to  report earnings this morning.  Cheryl Casone with all the details now.   Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  This first number is  pretty good, Maria.  Let's take a look at ExxonMobil, they reported better- than-expected results for this last quarter.  Earnings per share jump 57  percent from a year ago because the average price for oil is up 44 percent  in the third quarter.  So there's a correlation there.  The stock though  under a little bit of pressure in premarket.</p><p>We are waiting on Chevron.  They're going to report their latest earnings,  maybe about 15 minutes or so.  At this point, the stock is up two percent  in the premarket.  Analysts  are looking for their quarterly profits to  more than double.  Revenue up nearly 30 percent.  Well, right now  ExxonMobil, a different story.  Taking a look at shares of Alibaba, that  was rallying right now, off of the highs.</p><p>The company did cut revenue guidance for the full year.  Earnings per share  did beat expectations, revenue coming in just below the street's estimate.   Alibaba up more than three percent right now.  And of course we're watching  shares of Apple this morning, big time, trading sharply lower as you  mentioned.  This is the lowest trade we really seen on Apple this morning,  down about six and more than a quarter percent there</p><p>They did, of course, hit the street estimates in this - in this last  quarter but the issue disappointing guidance for the current quarter.  So  they beat the estimates, but the guidance was a problem.  The holiday  season, the units that you're talking about.  And there's a lot of  questions about weaker-than-expected demand for their more expensive new  iPhones going forward.</p><p>Also we're watching this story for you.  Google says it is listening to  their employees and they will consider ideas on how they treat complaints  of sexual harassment of the company.  Thousands of workers at Google  officers around the world yesterday stage walked.  They demanded a better  reporting system and they want an elimination of forced arbitration in  these types of cases.</p><p>The walkout following the New York Times report that Executive Andy Rubin  received $90-million pay out after he left the firm despite what Google  considered a credible allegation of sexual misconduct against him.  Shares  of parent Alphabet are higher in the premarket just fractionally, Maria.   Those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much, Cheryl.  We are just a few  minutes away from the October jobs' report.  We are all hands-on deck this  morning, what you need to know ahead of the numbers, next.  Back in a  moment.  NASDAQ just turned negative.  Down 2-1/2 points.  Dow Industrials  holding on to a gain of 237.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMCERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The October jobs' report due out in just a few  minutes.  Economists are expecting it to show 190,000 jobs added to the  economy last month.  It's expected to be unemployment rate holding steady  at 3.7 percent.  We are all hands-on deck this morning.  We got Benchmark  Managing Partner Kevin Kelly, EmployBridge Professional Division President,  Joanie Courtney with us.</p><p>Along with Senior Vice President and head of Traditional Investments Group  at U.S. Bank Wealth Management Lisa Erickson.  We also have a fantastic  panel here on set.  Very quickly the headlines that you're expecting.  Very  quickly.</p><p>PAYNE:  Plus 230, it might have some noise to Stephanie's point but it will  beat.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  It will beat.  We'll be right back with the  numbers.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is jobs  Friday, November 2nd.  We are moments away from the October jobs' report.   Here is what we're expecting.  190,000 jobs added to have been added to  economy in the month of October with the unemployment rate remaining steady  at 3.7 percent.  Markets this morning are rallying ahead of the number.</p><p>Take a look at where we stand with stocks.  Dow Industrials up 230 points,  that is one percent higher.  The S&amp;P 500 is up 19 points.  That is two- thirds of a percent higher.  The NASDAQ os negative but of course but of  course that's partly because Apple is down six percent in the premarket  after earnings.  Dagen McDowell, your expectations on this number 20  seconds away,</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wage growth, whoa!  Fastest potentially in 9-1/2 years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wage growth.  That's the number you're going to be focused on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  North of three percent I'm hoping.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then of course we got the participation rate that is also  something to focus on.  And I know you, Stephanie Pomboy, look at revisions  a lot.  We're going to be wanting to look at the revisions.  Let's get  those numbers right now, Blake Burman is at the Labor Department.  Blake,  over to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  250,000 jobs  created in the month of October, 250,000.  And with that, the unemployment  rate stayed at 3.7 percent.  Maria, when you look at revisions as well over  the last couple of months, September was revised downwards, 16,000 jobs to  118,000, but August was revised upward 16,000 to 286,000, so that is wash,  bringing the three-month average to 218,000 jobs.  And when you look at the  average over the last year, 210,000 jobs.  Sectors that gained all across  the board here, leisure and hospital up 42,000 jobs; health care up 36,000  jobs; manufacturing up 32,000 jobs; construction up 30,000 jobs;  transportation and warehousing up 25,000 jobs; mining, by the way, up 5,000  jobs.</p><p>The labor force participation rate up 0.2 percent to 62.9 percent, though,  that is just up slightly from this time last year, October 2017, when it  was 62.7 percent.  Average hourly earnings, Dagen, take a listen to this up  $0.05 cents, that's 0.2 percent to $27.30, that is a 3.1 percent increase  year-over-year.  That is the highest year-over-year increase since April of  2009.  The average workweek up 0.1 hours to 34.5 hours, but manufacturing  actually dropped 0.1 hours to 40.8 hours.  The U6, which of course, is  those who are marginally attached to the workforce or working part-time for  economic reasons.  7.4 percent, that is the same as August, but it is down  from eight percent this time last year.</p><p>Of course, there was that terrible hurricane that ripped through the  panhandle, Hurricane Michael, the economists here say that had, quote, no  discernible effect on the numbers.  So, the bottomline here, Maria, 250,000  jobs created in October, the unemployment rate stays at 3.7 percent, and  wages are rising.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Good number here, better than expected.  Blake,  thank you so much.  Dagen nails it with the wage comment.  Let's get right  to Stuart Varney, get his initial reaction.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Not  quite a blowout, but a very strong report on all fronts.  250,000 new jobs,  that is very strong.  Wages rising 3.1 percent over the past 12 months,  very strong indeed.  I'm not sure whether that's the highest in eight  years, nine years, two years, or whatever, but that is a very strong gain.   And the U6 coming in at 7.4 percent, it just strikes me that this is a  completely different employment picture than what we saw say two years ago.   This is completely shifted, 250,000 new jobs this month or last month, an  average of 210,000 this year.  That's a strong report, it's a strong  economy, it's full employment, case closed!</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's full employment, you're right, Stuart.  It's great  analysis.  I know you're going to have more.  We will see you in 30  minutes' time, Stu, at the top of the hour with \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" and your  fantastic guests, coming up.  Stuart Varney, join Stuart in 30 minutes.   Let's get right to Lisa Erickson, though, right now.  As Lisa, you're an  economist, you're looking at these numbers, and tell us what it sees --  what you see in terms of what it means for the future.</p><p>LISA ERICKSON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADITIONAL INVESTMENT GROUPS, U.S.  BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Well, we really do see this as a very good news  report, as Stu was just discussing.  We've got a really solid numbers  across the board, 250,000 obviously a very great absolute number and  definitely ahead of consensus expectations.  And on wage gain side, you've  got a nice increase for American workers at 3.1 percent.  What I would say  is that, you know, this should be very reassuring for the stock market.   Obviously, there's been a lot of concerns around whether we can continue  that growth story.  As we've been looking at it, we've maintained our  confidence in a cautiously optimistic outlook.  And I think this just  bolsters that.  </p><p>Longer term, however, I think the thing that we're going to be -- want to  be thinking about is whether that does reinforce the tendency of the Fed to  even potentially become more hawkish.  As long as we continue to get tight  numbers in the labor market, certainly, you want to going to continue on  that rising rate path.  And the other problem potentially presents is the  fact that it could actually widen the divergence with the economies  overseas because as rates go up and the dollar goes up, that can put  pressure on those overseas dollar borrowers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a really good point.  Actually, I've got to get  your opinion, Stephanie, on this.  But first, Dagen, you nailed it on  wages.  Go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart is gone but Stuart is wrong.  Stu, this is a blowout  report.  Charles made a face when Stuart said that.  Quite frankly, I don't  mean to throw you under the bus --</p><p>PAYNE:  It was (INAUDIBLE) that's all.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  250,000 jobs is a blowout.  Wages growing in this country north  of three percent.  That is something that we haven't seen since the early  term -- first term of Barack Obama, of President Obama, April of 2009.   This is a blowout.  The fact that you now have the three-month average job  growth outpacing the average for the last year, shows an economy to quote  James Freeman, at a higher growth plain, a higher growth plateau.  This is  awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, go ahead, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, given how difficult it's been for firms to find new workers,  250k new jobs is big.  And really, as we talk about the elections,  Republicans make their closing argument, the President has delivered, at  least to this point, what he promised.  The manufacturing rival, the  economic revival he promised in 2016 is well underway.  32,000 jobs added  in manufacturing, 30,000 in construction, a lot of good news in this  report. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but let's go bring us back down to earth, Stephanie,  because look at the 30-year yield right now at 3.4 percent.  Look at the  10-year at 3.1 percent.  What does this mean for the Federal Reserve?</p><p>POMBOY:  (INAUDIBLE) I mean, I think Lisa's point is well-taken, and that  is, if anything, this keeps Powell on his track or maybe more aggressive,  and we have this on January 1, where kiwi and basically globally, we've had  still expanding central bank liquidity throughout this year, even as the  Fed has been tightening its balance sheet.  That ends next year, alongside  the (INAUDIBLE) of the tax cut effect, and most importantly -- and The Wall  Street Journal has an article on this today -- corporate interest expense  is going to start to move up sharply because they have almost a billion --  sorry, almost a trillion dollars in debt, $780 billion in debt that rolls  next year at these higher interest rates, that's going to be the real  headwind.  The profits are the number one input into employment growth.   So, I think this is a great report, no question about it.  But is this as  good as it gets past the old Milwaukee, you know, guys, this is as good as  it gets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Isn't that what Jon Hilsenrath wrote the other day in The  Journal, what if this is as good as it gets?  Jon, weigh in here?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, this report is solid from beginning to end.   It's just great news across the labor market.  The thing that I would point  to that especially encouraging in here is that the labor force  participation rate picked up.  What that suggests is that we're getting  workers coming in from the sidelines because wages are picking up, and  there are so many job opportunities out there.  You know, I wrote a story  earlier this week saying that, you know, the private sector is expecting a  slowdown, you don't see it in these numbers, it's a very good report. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but Charles -- I mean, just what Jon just said, I mean, a  3.7 percent unemployment rate, 49-year low, as new people are coming in  shows confidence in the jobs market, shows confidence in the economy.</p><p>PAYNE:  This is an amazing -- this is an amazing number.  And, you know, we  could talk about it two ways, Main Street and Wall Street.  For Main  Street's point of view, this is amazing.  Participation up, wages are up,  dirty fingernail jobs, good producing jobs, manufacturing which we said  would never come back to this country, keeps blowing them away.  Even the  composition of this, so you've got 2,000 retail jobs, but instead, people  are getting jobs in transportation and warehouses.  Amazon and those places  are creating these fulfilment centers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They need vehicle --</p><p>PAYNE:  They pay more than retail.  So, even the composition of the  numbers, some people will say, well, these are about the same numbers  President Obama had in his last year.  Numbers are the same, but the  composition, it's changing to higher paying jobs which I think is also  important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin Kelly, I'm coming to you in a second with your analysis  on this market because the market has given up some gains here.  I want to  get your take on why we're losing some steam here.  But first, Joanie  Courtney, identify for us where are the jobs right now for those people who  want to get in the jobs market, where should they be looking?</p><p>JOANIE COURTNEY, PROFESSIONAL DIVISION PRESIDENT, EMPLOYBRIDGE:  Yes,  Maria, it is such a strong jobs market.  You know, there are 7.1 million  openings across the United States, and they are both in blue collar and  white collar opportunities.  So, you've got engineering, accounting and  finance, health care is very strong, but we also have manufacturing and  logistics, construction.  There's so many opportunities in the market.  So,  the best part about this report to me is definitely the labor participation  rate, seeing more people come back into the job market because wages are  moving, and there are opportunities.  Overall, I mean, this is one of the  best job reports we have seen in the last couple of years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the best jobs reports that we've seen in the last couple  of years, you say, just four days away from the midterm elections.  You  wonder what that's going to could for voters, and yet, markets are off of  the highs.  Kevin Kelly, explain.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yes, one of the reasons why the  markets are off the highs is you're starting to see that yields are going  up, so that goes back to the financing costs.  So, that's been the story  for the last, you know, few months.  When the 10-year treasury goes up, you  see equities take a hit because it's one of their largest input costs.  So,  if you think about the input costs we're talking about today, jobs, right,  wages are going up.  Charles hit the nail on the head.  Listen, we've got  transportation in warehousing jobs 25,000.  That's where e-commerce jobs  are.  We need over 452,000 workers in distribution centers this year and  next year just to meet e-commerce demand, 16 percent year-over-year growth  in that field alone.  </p><p>So, you're seeing retail jobs come down.  Last month, we actually lost  18,000 on that.  So, you have -- you have an equity market that is worried  about rising wages, you have an equity market that's worried about rising  costs of capital that impacts their margins.  That's why you're seeing  guidance whether it's, you know, all the companies on the industrial side,  even technology, talking about next year's revenues and profits, going to  be lower than this year's.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing I would add, Maria, because we focus so much on the  numbers, but these numbers today back up the way that people are feeling in  this country.  That with consumer confidence, we can talk about the polls,  and how people more concerned about health care and the tax reform, and the  tax cuts aren't connecting with voters.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great point. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But consumer confidence is at an 18-year high.  And it was  strong, even in the month of October as the market is selling off, and  people have told me from the rural -- around the rural communities that I  grew up in, for the first time in over a decade, people can find full-time  jobs, they can find full-time work and they don't feel like that they're  trying to scrape here and scrape there, and are living -- I mean, worried  about paying their bills every month.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about -- and higher wages, too. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And so, you are finding work, full-time work, and in --  as to Charles's point, better-paying positions, if you're switching jobs,  and I think that that is really resonating and you see -- market be dammed,  whatever investors are worried about on Wall Street, God bless them, but  this is just great news for all Americans.</p><p>PAYNE:  They're worried about Jay Powell.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're worried about Jay Powell.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PAYNE:  I'll let you add to this, I just want to point to people, I think  October was started by a speech (INAUDIBLE) made on October 3rd where he  said the Fed didn't know where neutral was and that they would certainly  overshoot.  The market fell off a cliff, and it hasn't -- and that to me  was the scariest moment of the entire month.</p><p>POMBOY:  The comment I was going to make on the back of what Dagen was  saying is that, you know, this is a positive thing.  I'm going to, you  know, (INAUDIBLE) my umbrella for a minute, and what we're seeing with the  wage growth is now consumers will be able to shift from relying on central  bank created asset inflation to fund their retirements and their current  commutation with actual good old-fashioned wage growth.  This is the way  it's supposed to be.  It's a positive development.  And it comes in my  view, at a good time, because that asset inflation story is coming to an  abrupt end, home price inflation has already slowed a lot, and I think the  stock market and the corporate bond market are going to follow suit.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I could not agree more.  And I think maybe this is optimism.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FREEMAN:  But what -- but this -- what we're seeing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  What we're seeing is a real economy which gives us a chance to  make the transition back to normal.  The policy makers, the central bankers  of the last decade left us with this enormous challenge to unwind all of  this money that they put into the economy because the tax and regulatory  burdens wouldn't let the economy grow, they tried to conjure prosperity  forcing all of this money in.  This report is more evidence that the real  economy is reasserting itself and we might be able to break this transition  --</p><p>KELLY:  Can I just bring up a point about this economy and how healthy and  strong it is?  Look at leisure and hospitality adding 42,000 jobs when it  was supposed to take a hit because of Hurricane Michael, especially in  Florida.  So, it is so strong that people are out there, and they're  actually spending their money, they're spending their crumbs that they got  from this fiscal policy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, crumbs.  Look at this traffic --</p><p>KELLY:  So, that is a true testament how strong this market is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This -- you're right, this graphic shows the leisure and  hospitality up 42,000, but look at service providing.  I mean, this is a  services economy, we know, but 179,000 jobs created in services, that is --  that is a big number. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to remind people, too, when President Barack Obama  goes on the campaign trail, and continuously tries to take credit for this  economy, it was only for a brief spurt but for the most part during his  eight years in office, we never had three percent wage growth in this  country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We never had an economy that any calendar year grew at three  percent.  It was the Federal Reserve that kept you propped up and  deregulation and the government burden that kept the lid on growth. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that was eight years -- eight years. </p><p>FREEMAN:  But it's also -- it's kind of fun, though, watching President  Obama and his former economic advisers sort of diverging here, where he's  saying, isn't it great?  I built that.  And they're saying he's not so  great.  It's not so great.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You didn't build that.  You didn't build that.  Donald Trump  built that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But it's harder -- it's harder to say it's not so great.  So, I  think we can expect may be he's going to want to claim even more.</p><p>POMBOY:  That should be his new tagline, Donald Trump.  That's genius.  He  didn't build that, I built that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  Let's get a check on markets.  Gerri Willis is  on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this morning with some early  reaction.  And Gerri, we got a pretty good showing with the Dow Industrials  this morning.  It's what we were expecting anyway.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, that's right, Maria.  And  I've been talking to traders all morning.  Pre-number, post-number, they're  speaking with one voice, and what they're saying is here comes the Fed.   You know, this is pointing to a very strong economy, you're seeing this  wage growth kicking up 3.1 percent.  I was told before the number came out,  if we got 190,000 to 230,000 more jobs for the month that that would be  good, that would be solid.  250, that's going to make traders do start  thinking about is this economy overheating and what they worry about, rates  go higher, that takes money out of market, that's how they interpret it.  </p><p>Number two layer here that people are talking about and concerned about in  today's market, what they're happy about, frankly, is this discussion of  China trade, this idea that there are going to be more China talks.  They  love that.  It's on everybody's mind down here.  But for this report, it  makes them think that that idea that maybe the Fed would stop or slow or  pause, maybe not because this is very good news about the economy.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Gerri, I'm glad you mentioned China because, Lisa  Erickson, yesterday in the middle of the day, we learned that the President  had spoken with President Xi in China, and markets definitely moved on  that.  What was your sense of what went on yesterday in markets, and how  are you expecting this market to trade given what we've learned this  morning?</p><p>ERICKSON:  Well, trade market -- the trade issues are certainly a big  overhang, and in fact, that's one of the key things that we're monitoring  as well, of course, in addition to what's going on in the growth picture  and also with the Fed.  But I think, basically, there's been a lot of  volatility because people are not certain what's going to happen.  And so,  when you get some positive headlines like you did yesterday, the market is  going to trade up on that.  You know, as far as the market reaction going  out, I think that basically, this is going to settle in potentially for  some more volatility.  Again, now that the market is seeing that there may  be more of a case for the Fed to continue on a trajectory of raising rates,  that does raise the bar.  It does race the competition for equities.  And  in addition, people are needing to see those growth numbers to continue to  come through.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ERICKSON:  So, again, I think the fundamental picture is balanced.  We are  seeing positives in both the macropicture and as well as corporate  earnings, but you've got this offset with a little bit more competition.   So, it's going to be important to watch that outlook going forward. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stephanie, what are you going to be watching from here to get a  sense of where things go now?  What are your most important metrics?</p><p>POMBOY:  Well, the thing I'm watching most closely is the corporate credit  market, specifically what's happening with spreads.  You know, when you see  the 10-year backing up on numbers like this morning, do corporate yields  follow suit?  And you know, what we've seen in October is that the spreads  have been winding out where people are starting to price in greater risk in  the corporate bond market.</p><p>PAYNE:  Let me ask you about the junk bond market because that's -- have  been sort of a red flag, isn't it?</p><p>POMBOY:  You know, it went from first to worst in October.  It was the top  performing credit market all year, and then it flipped and people couldn't  get away from it fast enough, but that's how it is with high yield.  You  know, it's called junk for a reason.  And people then reacquaint themselves  with the definition of junk, and realize, you know, maybe I'm not going to  get repaid on this debt.  The interesting thing is that you also have half  of what's categorized as investment grade that is just one rung above that  junk threshold.  So, it wouldn't take much of an increase in rates to push  half of the investment-grade universe into that bottom bucket.  </p><p>That's what I'm worried about because the spillover to the stock market is  going to be huge, you know, obviously, companies borrowed like crazy to  fund their buyback and dividend programs.  That have been a key support for  the stock market.  I mean, I think the number one buyer of equities has  been the corporate sector, not retail investors, not --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Which is why -- which is why Kevin Kelly thinks once  the corporations get out of earnings and once companies start buying back  their stock, we're going to see this rally rip.</p><p>POMBOY:  Assuming they have the money with which to do that, you know,  Apple --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  Well, they -- well, they do.  Stephanie, they have over a trillion  --</p><p>POMBOY:  -- buybacks rather than using that --</p><p>KELLY:  Stephanie, they have the money, over a trillion dollars.</p><p>POMBOY:  -- a mountain of cash.  Not every company does.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead, Kevin.</p><p>KELLY:  Oh, I was going to say, they over a trillion dollars of stock  buybacks that are going to occur actually over the next year.  So, you're - - and you're going to see it start taking hold now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  You know, it's going to be pretty interesting is that Apple is  going to come out and start buy back a lot of their stock at these prices.   So, that's going to lend an underlying bid because they've been blacked out  for the last month.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And that'll help -- that'll help Apple certainly and  the broader market.  Jon Hilsenrath, before you go, I know you got a job --  your final number and reaction to this number before you go.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Very strong start to the fourth quarter.  A lot of analysts  have been forecasting that the economy was going to slow down in the fourth  quarter.  This is a sign that it's still ripping.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Jon, we'll see you soon.  Thanks so much for your  insights this morning.  Jon Hilsenrath, always a pleasure.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More from this all-star panel on the October jobs' report after  this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the October jobs number is out, the  economy added 250,000 jobs last month that top the economists'  expectations.  The unemployment rate holding steady at a 49-year low of 3.7  percent.  We want to go right now, it's the final jobs' report before the  midterm elections, we want to go to one of the elections' most pivotal  states, Arizona.  Hillary Vaughn is live this morning in Phoenix with more.   Hillary, good morning to you.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, good morning, Maria.   This is one of the closest Senate races in the country right now.  Democrat  Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema is running against Republican Congresswoman  Martha McSally to fill Jeff Flake's Senate seat.  And the latest Fox News  poll has both candidates in a dead heat, both of them polling with 46  percent of voter support.  This migrant caravan, though, that is headed  towards the U.S.-Mexico border is a local issue here in this border state.   We caught up with Democrat Kyrsten Sinema yesterday at a Get Out To Vote  event with veterans.  Sinema, a former anti-war protester has come under  fire for her anti-military rhetoric in the past.  And I asked her if she  will support the military men and women headed to the U.S. border in her  home state to stop this migrant caravan from crossing over.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KYRSTEN SINEMA (D), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, ARIZONA:  It's not new for  us to have military deployment to the border to provide a support role for  our Customs and Border Patrol agents who were down there.  So, we wish them  well and tell them to stay hydrated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  Former fighter pilot and Republican Martha McSally spent the day  stomping with the President's son, Donald Trump, Jr. to rally support  headed into election day.  McSally tells me that Democrats are to blame for  this migrant caravan and crisis at the border.  And she says it's her  mission, if elected, to close loopholes in the system that allow migrants  to exploit U.S. immigration law.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. MARTHA MCSALLY (R), SENATORIAL CANDIDATE, ARIZONA:  Border security is  national security.  They will be coming to bases in my district that I  represent in Arizona, and our communities are going to welcome them as they  continue to serve and sacrifice to keep our country safe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  Maria, the Green Party candidate just dropped out yesterday and  that could be a game changer in a neck-and-neck race.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hillary, wait, did Sinema just say stay hydrated to the  military?</p><p>VAUGHN:  Yes.  And when I told McSally that, she had the same reaction, she  laughed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Hillary, thank you.  Hillary Vaughn.  Kevin Kelly, Joanie  Courtney, Lisa Erickson, thank you so much for joining us.  Invaluable  insights from all of you, we so appreciate it.  We got this panel on set as  we continue with just a few minutes left.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We got a big weekend this weekend.  Stay with me  tonight, Maria Bartiromo's \"WALL STREET\" 9:00 p.m. Eastern.  More of my  exclusive interview with Barry Diller.  And then I'll see you on Sunday  morning on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" Fox News Channel --</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

The Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 5% and the Dow fell more than 800 points, as investors made a dash for the exits following a streak of record-setting days over the past several weeks.   It was the worst day for stocks since June.    Stocks erased all their gains after a huge bout of exuberance Wednesday, when the S&amp;P 500 \u2014 the broadest measure of Wall Street \u2014 and the Nasdaq hit yet another record high . The Nasdaq had also climbed above 12,000 points for the first time in history Wednesday.    But it didn\u2019t stick. Thursday was the Nasdaq\u2019s largest one-day decline from a record high in its history, according to Bespoke Investment Group.    All three major indexes finished the day sharply lower. The Nasdaq closed down nearly 5%, and the S&amp;P fell 3.5%, while the Dow finished 2.8%, or 808 points, lower.    So, what happened?    For one, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the other two major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 \u2014 for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit.    Even so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 28% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts. The Dow, which only recently turned positive for the year , is back in the red.    \u201cAlthough there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments.    But there are also technical reasons for Thursday\u2019s decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs.    \u201cThe Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.    Stocks in cyclical sectors are expected to perform better as the economy is recovering.    The Big Tech companies such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft, all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer . But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam , either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether.    \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a wake-up call, which isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world. Markets go up and down,\u201d JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, told CNN Business.    Tech stocks were among Thursday\u2019s worst performers.

The Nasdaq Composite   It was the worst day for stocks since June. Stocks erased all their gains after a huge bout of exuberance Wednesday, when the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) \u2014 the broadest measure of Wall Street \u2014 and the Nasdaq hit yet another record high. The Nasdaq had also climbed above 12,000 points for the first time in history Wednesday. But it didn't stick. Thursday was the Nasdaq's largest one-day decline from a record high in its history, according to Bespoke Investment Group. All three major indexes finished the day sharply lower. The Nasdaq closed down nearly 5%, and the S&amp;P fell 3.5%, while the Dow finished 2.8%, or 808 points, lower. So, what happened? For one, the the other two major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow (INDU) and the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) \u2014 for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit. Even so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 28% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts. The Dow, which only recently turned positive for the year, is back in the red. \"Although there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments. But there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs. \"The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,\" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. Stocks in cyclical sectors are expected to perform better as the economy is recovering. The Big Tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer. But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam, either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether. \"It's a bit of a wake-up call, which isn't the worst thing in the world. Markets go up and down,\" JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, told CNN Business. Tech stocks were among Thursday's worst performers. Given the summer rally, it's \"perfectly normal,\" to see tech stocks readjusting a bit, Detrick said. But even investors who are still faithful to their safe tech holdings have reason to be a little concerned: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, told CNN Thursday that a Covid-19 vaccine by October remained \"unlikely,\" though it was possible.

It\u2019s shaping up...</p><p>It\u2019s a wild day on Wall Street, where the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 4.5% and the Dow fell nearly 700 points in the early afternoon, as investors made a dash for the exits following a streak of record-setting days over the past several weeks.   It\u2019s shaping up to be the worst day for stocks since June.    Stocks erased all their gains after a huge bout of exuberance Wednesday, when the S&amp;P 500 \u2014 the broadest measure of Wall Street \u2014 and the Nasdaq hit yet another record high . The Nasdaq had also climbed above 12,000 points for the first time in history Wednesday.    In the early afternoon, all three major indexes remained sharply in the red. The Dow was down 2.4%, or nearly 700 points, and the S&amp;P fell 3.2%.    So, what\u2019s happening?    For one, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the other two major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 \u2014 for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit.    Even so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 30% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts.    \u201cAlthough there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments.    But there are also technical reasons for Thursday\u2019s decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs.    \u201cThe Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,\u201d said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.    Stocks in cyclical sectors are also expected to perform better as the economy is recovering.    The Big Tech companies such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft, all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer . But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam , either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether.    \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a wake-up call, which isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world. Markets go up and down,\u201d JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, told CNN Business.    Given the summer rally, it\u2019s \u201cperfectly normal,\u201d to see tech stocks readjusting a bit, Detrick said.    And even investors who are still faithful to their safe tech holdings have reason to be a little concerned: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, told CNN Thursday that a Covid-19 vaccine by October remained \u201cunlikely,\u201d though it was possible.    Making matters worse, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said late Wednesday that \u201cthe cooperative spirit we had in March and April\u201d on Capitol Hill has \u201cdissipated as we move closer and closer to the election.\u201d This doesn\u2019t bode well for Congress agreeing on another stimulus bill, which the market has been hoping for.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42993763447</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RW-YK31-JCSC-J37B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"565\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>WLS-AM</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC000858D</classCode><className>LPL FINANCIAL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Dow Jones lost 4.4%, the Nasdaq 4.3% and the S&amp;P 500 3.8%. Apple and software stocks were among the big tech losers. Retailers plunged amid another fresh earnings reports and guidance.\u00a0Crude oil prices plunged to 52-week lows, rocking energy stocks.</p><h>Target Misses, Kohl's Guidance Disappoints</h><p>Discount giant\u00a0Target's (TGT) earnings and sales missed third-quarter estimates, with higher costs related to handling digital orders squeezing margins. Kohl's (KSS) earnings and sales topped but the value department store chain's raised guidance was below analysts' consensus. Target stock fell 15% and Kohl's 12%.</p><h>Ross Stores, TJX Cautious On Holidays</h><p>Off-price heavyweights TJX (TJX) and Ross Stores (ROST) reported mixed Q3 results and cautious holiday-quarter guidance. T.J. Maxx parent TJX reported adjusted EPS of 54 cents, below estimates, while a 12% revenue gain to $9.83 billion topped. Ross Stores edged past EPS views while sales grew 7% to $3.35 billion, just missing. Freight costs and pay hikes weighed on results. Ross says it is up against its \"toughest sales comparisons from 2017\" and expects fierce competition. TJX stock tumbled 11% and Ross stock 16%.</p><h>Foot Locker Sprints On Earnings</h><p>Athletic apparel and shoe retailer Foot Locker (FL) came out ahead of analyst forecasts, with profit up 9% to 95 cents a share and sales declining only 0.5% to $1.86 billion. Same-store sales rose 2.9%, ahead of estimates for 2% comps. The stock gapped up 15% Wednesday as shares continue to consolidate.

Meanwhile, Gap (GPS) cut its full-year profit guidance and is mulling closing hundreds of stores as Gap and Old Navy same-store sales underperformed expectations. But Gap, which slightly beat Q3 views, saw its stock rebound Wednesday and Friday from a 14-month low.</p><h>Best Buy Gives Muted Holiday Outlook</h><p>The consumer electronics retailer beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal third quarter ended Nov. 3. But it came up short with its holiday-quarter outlook. Best Buy (BBY) blamed its guidance miss on the fact that this year's fiscal fourth quarter has one less week than the same quarter last year. The retailer expects same-store sales growth to be flat to up 3% in the January quarter. CEO Hubert Joly said Best Buy is promoting many \"exciting products\" this year including big-screen TVs, smart speakers, security cameras, streaming devices and video games.</p><h>Chip Stocks Disappoint On Guidance</h><p>Chip-gear maker Brooks Automation (BRKS) topped fiscal fourth-quarter views, but guided well below consensus for the current quarter.

America will \"remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia\" despite reports that the CIA has concluded Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman was aware of, and perhaps responsible for, the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. U.S. crude inventories rose for a ninth straight week, though gasoline stockpiles fell and crude production was flat week-over-week.

The deal will add 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to Cimarex production.</p><h>Housing Activity Sluggish</h><p>The National Association of Home Builders' homebuilder sentiment gauge tumbled 8 points in November, to 60, the lowest point in two years. Weekly mortgage applications to buy a home fell 5% vs. a year earlier amid interest rate and affordability concerns. Existing-home sales rose 1.4% in September to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.22 million, the first monthly gain in six months. Sales fell 5.1% vs. a year earlier. October housing starts rose 1.5% to a 1.228 million annualized pace, fueled by a jump in multifamily units. But they fell 2.9% vs. a year earlier.

Nissan stock, already battered by slumping sedan sales, hit a multiyear low.</p><p>Boeing (BA) canceled a call with airlines over last month's Lion Air 737 Max crash amid reports that the aerospace giant didn't disclose to pilots safety issues with the newest Max.

The number of deals seemed on pace for a decade high. IPOs shares were, on average, in the black.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After a strong start, the market for new stock offerings fizzled in 2011 as the prospect of a global slowdown and a prolonged European debt crisis battered financial markets. High-profile Internet companies like Groupon, LinkedIn and Zynga, which went public Friday, attracted attention.</p><p>But overall, companies didn't raise as much as they hoped for through IPOs. Main Street investors, who generally don't have access to IPO shares until after they start trading, were likely the biggest losers.</p><p>Many companies had to cancel their debuts, delaying paydays for their early investors. More companies withdrew their IPO plans than have since 2008, the depths of the recession, according to IPO investment firm Renaissance Capital.</p><p>Negative return</p><p>IPOs that went public this year, as a group, lost 13 percent of their value the first negative return since 2008. And about two-thirds of companies that went public this year are trading below their offering price, according to advisory firm IPO Boutique.</p><p>\"The only way to have played the game this year the way I always play it is to have flipped on day one. Take your profit and move on. People who haven't have been decimated,\" said longtime IPO investor Scott Sweet, who owns IPO Boutique.</p><p>This week, the last before the IPO market shuts down for the year, spotlights 2011 trends. Twelve companies had lined up IPOs, which would have been the busiest week since November 2007. That didn't happen.</p><p>Business social network Jive Software and luxury retailer Michael Kors Holdings priced high, sold more shares than expected, and soared on day one. Retail companies like Michael Kors and Dunkin' Donutsparent Dunkin' Brands Groupwere popular with investors this year, as well as tech companies.</p><p>Facebook games maker Zynga raised $1 billion Thursday night, in the biggest Internet IPO since Google's 2004 launch. That valued it at $7 billion. But when the company filed to go public in July, market watchers thought the company had potential for a valuation of $20 billion or more.</p><p>On Friday, shares closed down 5 percent.</p><p>Of the other nine companies slated for the week, three delayed their debuts. Six raised less money than they'd expected. Two of those are already more than 15 percent below their IPO price, giving investors a loss.</p><p>Other high-profile tech companies that went public this year have slid from their first-day pops.</p><p>Jobs-networking site LinkedIn more than doubled in its debut. While it's still up about 50 percent from its initial price, shares have lost 30 percent from the first trading day. Investors who bought in the first day after trading began have likely lost money.</p><p>It's a common story:</p><p>? In its January debut, online-content company Demand Media rose 33 percent. It's since dropped 70 percent.</p><p>? May: Yandex, the Google of Russia, popped 55 percent. It is down 54 percent since.</p><p>? June: Internet radio company Pandora Media rose 9 percent. It has dropped 40 percent since.</p><p>? July: Seattle-based real-estate listings website Zillow rose 79 percent, but has fallen 34 percent since.</p><p>? November: Groupon rose 31 percent, but has dropped 14 percent since then.</p><p>Technology companies that went public in the past 12 months, overall, are down 13 percent, according to Renaissance Capital. Part of that stems from broader market declines. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is down about 8 percent from the end of June.</p><p>Daniel Graeber, a journalist and professor from Grand Rapids, Mich., bought 15 shares of Groupon for $30 each the day it went public, hoping the deals company would be the next Google or Amazon.com. Graeber, 38, has lost money so far, but says he's modestly optimistic that shares will recover. And despite his loss and general market doldrums, he says he's intrigued by Facebook.</p><p>Market watchers expect more big tech deals next year: Facebook, local reviews site Yelp and online retailer Gilt Groupe. Of the three, only Yelp has filed to go public.</p><p>Another IPO bright spot, foreign companies, has faltered. Chinese companies made up more than a quarter of U.S. IPOs in 2010 and led foreign deals in the first half of the year. But those deals have disappeared amid reports of probes by U.S. regulators and a slowdown in the Chinese economy. Online video company Tudou Holdings was the last Chinese company to go public in the U.S. in August. Shares are off 60 percent.</p><p>Less cash next year</p><p>The global economic uncertainty and poor returns throughout the IPO market may also mean less cash for the 200 companies hoping to go public in 2012.</p><p>\"They want to get the company public, they'll do a smaller deal,\" said Frank Maturo, head of cash-equity capital markets for the</p><p>Americas at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.</p><p>LinkedIn and Groupon sold less than 10 percent of their outstanding stock in their IPOs, which is considered a small percent of overall stock to put up for sale in an offering. The small supply helps boost demand for IPO shares.</p><p>The IPO declines and weak stock markets may create an opportunity for investors to buy shares more cheaply as companies and bankers rethink prices for shares.</p><p>\"People haven't made money in the IPO market, people are skeptical. But deals can get done if they get priced right,\" said IPO analyst Francis Gaskins of IPOdesktop.</p><p>&lt;!--body done--&gt;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SEATTM-TEQ1THV87</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SEATTM</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54HT-MG71-JBKM-D2JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8206</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 The Seattle Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The Seattle Times</publicationName><edition>Fourth Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"12\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>December 17, 2011 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0007XJI</classCode><className>DUNKIN' BRANDS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000CPCV</classCode><className>GROUPON INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000CQV0</classCode><className>JIVE SOFTWARE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000D2I5</classCode><className>MICHAEL KORS HOLDINGS LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

S&amp;P  flirting with record territory right now. Also, oil is rising up.  And new  emergency rules are moving Bakken Shale via oil train.  We're going live to  the CME to show you what is happening.  And we have got a signature \"MONEY\"  style Wall Street throw down on Tesla, including a referee.  Look at that.   Plus, Silicon Valley versus Wall Street.  RBS is paying out a billion bucks  in bonuses.  It is causing an outrage.  Does anyone care when Google does  the exact same thing?  Because even when they say it's not, it is always  about money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oil climbing higher right now as the U.S. government looks to add new  emergency regulations around transporting oil via railroads.  Over to Fox  contributor Phil Flynn at the CME.  And Phil, I want to talk about oil, but  natural gas is a big mover today.  What is going on there?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, THE PRICE FUTURES GROUP:  It is.  What we're seeing, of course,  is the collapsing of the curve of the March and the April mainly on  changing weather forecasts.  But Melissa, what's also happening I think  with the natural gas is people are now trying to predict where we're going  to end storage for the entire season.  A lot of people are betting we could  fall below a trillion cubic feet.  Whether we do or not, the big question  is if we do, can we get back to full storage before next winter and that is  really what's driving the trade right now.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And this talk about shipping from the Bakken Shale, I mean that  was on the front of every paper today.  Every oil trader talking about it.</p><p>FLYNN:  It is.  Yeah.  And it is going to add to the cost of the barrel of  oil.  You know, the competition for route space has already been incredible  in that type of the world.  And because oil was taking all the space, you  know, it impacted every market.  Even the grains can't get down to the  United States because of this.  This type of crude, Melissa, I talked to  refiners, it is so pure, it is unbelievable.  It's almost like it's coming  out of the ground refined.  And while that is good for the refiners it is  very volatile, very dangerous.  And they want to check, you know, every  barrel that goes in.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Sure.</p><p>FLYNN:  What this is going to be. And it's more money.  It's going to cost  - right now it is costing a couple of dollars a barrel.</p><p>FRANCIS:  More money and I understand it's going to drive up the price of  cookies?  How so?</p><p>FLYNN:  It is.  This is an outrage, I know.  Right now because rail space  has been taken over by the Bakken Shale, there is no room to move grains  and oats and, we saw oat prices hit the highest level in five years.  It  caused a price spike.  That means that your cookie price could go up at  least 1.5 percent.  This is an outrage.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It's very serious.</p><p>FLYNN:  I think .</p><p>FRANCIS:  We eat a lot of cookies in my house, Phil.  We're out of time.   And that is very serious.  Thank you so much for coming on.  </p><p>FLYNN:  I've got you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I appreciate it.</p><p>FLYNN:  Thank you, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS:  From gas to batteries now, Elon Musk and Tesla sending shockwaves  on Wall Street today.  The carmaker hitting all-time highs after announcing  plans to build the world's largest battery factory with a partnership with  Panasonic.  Not everyone's believer in the battery powered engine that  could.  Time for another Wall Street throw down.  Jeff Reeves of  InvestorPlace.com is a Tesla (INAUDIBLE).  And Maxfund.com Jonas Max Ferris  thinks there are bumpy roads ahead this.  Also, a Fox News contributor,  Jeff, make the bull case right now for me.  </p><p>JEFF REEVES, INVESTORPLACE.COM EDITOR:  Well, you know, short term, I think  Tesla is basically trading on charts and sentiments.  So, I'm not going to  speculate about the next six weeks.  But I think long term Tesla is  definitely where it needs to be and we've seen this with a lot of  innovative companies where they basically become their brand.  You know,  electric vehicles are Tesla.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>REEVES:  What the Prius did, I meant the Prius was the best-selling car in  California.  One of the best-selling cars in the world right now.  It  clearly, it kind of made a lot of strides on the hybrid front.  And it  hasn't lost that brand.  I think if Tesla does this right, it has a huge  runway out of it.  It just has this bottleneck on production.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Jonas, it has a bottleneck on production.  And Jonas, I mean one  of the knocks against it has been, how can they possibly create batteries  fast enough to keep up with demand.  Well, they're solving that problem.  I  mean Elon is so smart he goes down and he's like, well, you know, what, I'm  going to build my own battery factory, so that I don't have a problem.  Why  you do not like this, Jonas?</p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS:  It sounds like Henry Ford when he put rubber plants in  Brazil because he couldn't get rubber fast enough.  Look, the guy is a  genius.  He is a Henry Ford of our generation.  I love Tesla.  I'd like to  own one.  But this stock is a problem now.  It trades as if they are  selling a million cars.  And yeah, you can fantasize about it being the  word distributed power company with this factory and going into other  things like some companies overpriced like Amazon and Apple did, then they  took over those markets, but the reality is it's a car company that sold  22,000 cars roughly last year.  They have to grow sales 50 percent a year,  which is their expectation this year from Elon Musk for a decade or more  just to catch up to like BMW or other car companies.  And they're already  trading at a third of the market value.  And so, if they're absolutely  perfectly flawless in this execution and everybody has got a Tesla and it's  the number one car they then only are going to be worth a little more than  they're worth today.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No, it is pretty crazy.  I mean, Jeff, the stock is just so  incredibly expensive if you look at the forward P.E., and it's trading at  almost 70.  You look at something like GM, it's trading at seven.  Coke,  16.  Google 20.  BMW, 10.  Why is Tesla worth almost 70 times its forward  P.E.? </p><p>REEVES:  Well, I mean I think you're, looking at Coke is probably the wrong  metric there for forward P.E.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, how about GM?  How about BMW?  How about Google?  Google is a  tech company.</p><p>REEVES:  A different car company.  I would, I would posit that it is much  better for you to look at a company like LinkedIn, or Netflix or Amazon.   Companies that have had huge forward P.E.s for a while and yet has had big  run-ups in a last year or two.  I mean the valuation argument is an old  one.  And I think that it's very important.  You remember that in 2015 the  valuation there .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Old and compelling.</p><p>REEVES:  It didn't play out that way.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>REEVES:  Because right now there is just not a lot of growth options that  investors are willing to pay premiums for growth in a company like this.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Get in there, Jonas.</p><p>FERRIS:  There is not a lot of growth options is not a good enough reason  to pay a ridiculous - It is an old argument, but it's exactly - it's kind  of like Amazon played out.  If you recall Amazon got really expensive in  the late '90s on promise of the future.  The stock still fell 90 percent  before years later it caught up to that old price.  And it actually  delivered on promise.  It got - it wasn't just books.  It became this whole  thing where they took over the world.  And that might be Tesla's future in  ten or 15 years, but you're paying that price today where you might see the  stock fall 80 percent over the next ten years before it realizes those  dreams way, way down the road.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  We've got to go.  Next time you guys have got to get a  referee involved.  I don't know.  Thanks so much.</p><p>FERRIS:  Thanks.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Retail stocks are soaring right now.  Shares of Abercrombie &amp;  Fitch teetering their double-digit gains.  Brian Sozzi of Belus Capital  just got off conference calls several of the giants going on in the past  few hours.  He is here on the phone.  Brian, let's start with Target.  What  did you think - what was the best question on that call?  What did you  learn that we wouldn't know if you weren't on the call?</p><p>BRIAN SOZZI, BELUS CAPITAL:  Well, one of the first things I learned in  that call, Melissa, that Target is bringing mannequins into their store.   Kind of goofy, but very interesting.  It might actually get people excited  on buying clothes at Target again.  But one of the most shocking things are  - Target is cutting its capital expenditures by $1 billion this year.  Now,  and that is a serious red flag, because they have not set out (INAUIDBLE)  for how much they are going to have to pay for credit card breech.  But now  you're worrying that Target is going to underinvest in their stores and  lose their cool factor compared to Walmart and Target.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, you think that the massive data breach, that's evidence of  the data breach is having an even bigger impact than people were thinking?   I mean if so, then why is the stock soaring right now?</p><p>SOZZI:  Well, the stock is soaring today because they came out and told us  that their same-store sales, is about flat.  Now, flat is a lot better than  negative in the quarter, but still the company had a long way to improve  their sales.  And I think over the next couple of months you're going to  see Target go on a marketing blitz and promotional blitz to get customers  back in the store.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>SOZZI:  They're worried about their profits.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I want to talk about Abercrombie.  Because you were on that call  as well.  And I'm looking at CISI (ph) is raising its price target on it  right now to 45 from 33.  What did you hear on the Abercrombie call and how  do you feel about that one? </p><p>SOZZI:  Well, I think tomorrow you will all see more brokers will raise  price targeting Abercrombie.  Why?  And it's probably momentum behind the  name.  The company is slashing expenses quicker than anybody would have  thought.  But I do have some (INAUDIBLE) for this call.  First of all,  traffic is down significantly and remains down significantly in Abercrombie  and the domestic stores.  Most importantly the European business really  didn't have a strong quarter at all.  And I'm concerned about that.   Because whole - many other retailers are now starting to turn the quarter  in Europe.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>SOZZI:  Abercrombie is - and still is also lowering prices.  No good for  me.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.  Although that stock is on fire today.  Those investors are  loving it.  It is up almost 11 percent.  Thanks for hopping off those calls  and on to the phone with us, Brian.  We appreciate it.  Back to work.</p><p>SOZZI:  Thank you.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, up next:  Wall Street versus Silicon Valley.  Big bank  bonuses enraged so many, but why don't big tech company bonuses cause the  same fury?  No one cares.  They don't pay attention.  Banks, they hate it.   Tweet me, tell me what you think.  Someone is paying out almost a billion  dollars.  It is today's \"Money Talker.\"  And California's mega drought  could last 200 years.  The true cost of that.  More \"MONEY\" around the  scientists behind it coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  It is the battle of the big pay day.  While Wall Street  executives are scrutinized for their compensation, their Silicon Valley  counterparts are given a pass when it comes to massive paychecks.  Have you  noticed this?  The most recent exec bonus bash hitting RBS.  Word is it's  paying out almost a billion dollars in bonuses.  It is today's \"Money  Talker.\"  And we've got Boyden Global Managing Partner Jeanne Branthover,  Wells Fargo chief economist John Silvia, and \"The Wall Street Journal\"  senior writer Spencer Ante.  Thanks to all of you for joining us.  I don't  know if you guys have noticed this, we were talking about this in our  meeting.  You've got this huge paychecks in Silicon Valley, no one bats an  eye.  They don't care.  Somebody like Eric Schmidt in Google another $100  million just for being chairman.  I mean the head - Marisa Mayer, she  comes, she signs on, for what was it - $129 million.  I'm sure she was  leaving things behind at Google.  And that's why they did it, but still, no  one bats an eye.  At the banks, you know, Jamie Dimon, it's your $20  million.  Everyone is hysterical.  Why is there a double standard?</p><p>JEANNE BRANTHOVER, BOYDEN GLOBAL MANAGING PARTNER:  Because it's financial  services and right now financial services, it's being scrutinized.  They  want transparency.  People feel that they're the reason for the crisis.   And so, therefore any money that is being given out is going to be  criticized. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Spencer, is that what it is all about?</p><p>SPENCER ANTE, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Well, yeah, you know, Wall Street  almost brought the entire global economy to the brink of a global  depression. </p><p>FRANCIS:  But the dot-com bubble burst.  I mean that was a disaster.</p><p>ANTE:  But that was a long time ago.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That was a long time ago. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ANTE:  That was over a decade.  I would say this.  I don't think tech  executives are being given a free pass. </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>ANTE:  They're getting a lot more scrutiny, actually.  And it is  interesting because I think the new bogey man could be the tech executives  because there's rising anger and discontent over inequality in America.   And tech executives are taking home the biggest paychecks in the economy  now.</p><p>FRANCIS:  But what is the evidence that it is shifting?  I mean, John, are  you seeing any of that?  Because I saw people protesting outside Jamie  Dimon's house.  And I don't see them outside Eric Schmidt's house.</p><p>JOHN SILVIA, WELLS FARGO CHIEF ECONOMIST:  Well, I'd go back to what  Spencer had to say.  I think a lot of this has perceived value.  And when  you are talking about someone in the tech area, for example, Facebook or  Google, Apple, people perceive that there is value in what they're doing.   I think when someone goes to a bank .</p><p>FRANCIS:  There is not value in what financial services do?</p><p>SILVIA:  No, I think when someone goes to a bank .</p><p>FRANCIS:  We all use our credit cards and our ATM and our checking account  every single day!</p><p>SILVIA:  But when you go to a bank there is ATM.  And it's not - it is not  sexy.  It's not interesting.  It is just, an ATM. </p><p>ANTE:  It's financial engineering.</p><p>BRANTHOVER:  Exactly.</p><p>ANTE:  That is the reputation.  It's financial .</p><p>FRANCIS:  But you think it is shifting?  I mean .</p><p>ANTE:  I do.  Well, if you go to San Francisco, this is the number one  issue people are talking about is the one percent.  They're protesting  Google buses.  They're getting bricks thrown at the buses.  Tom Perkins,  the famous venture capitalist.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Although he is a conservative. </p><p>ANTE:  Who caused a huge firestorm when he compared what happened to the  google buses to Kristallnacht.   OK, so - that is a good example of why  tech executives are getting more scrutiny.  Not as much as Wall Street.   But if they don't .</p><p>FRANCIS:  They're not going after Cheryl Sandberg.  They're not going after  Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>BRANTHOVER:  But then it is people.  You have to understand.  Look at  everybody's shareholders are looking at where is the future, right?  So,  right now at least in the executive search world people feel that  technology is getting us out of the crisis.  Technology is ..</p><p>FRANCIS:  But who's financing technology?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean who takes them public.</p><p>BRANTHOVER:  They don't think.  That's in the back .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Who enables people to pay for those services online?</p><p>BRANTHOVER:  But you're thinking like the rational business person who  looks at financial services and understands it.  Most people don't.  Most  people as you said, they're using their iPads.  They're using their phones.   They see the value in these companies. </p><p>FRANCIS:  What do you think, John? </p><p>SILVIA:  I think it's all comes back to perceived value.  I mean that was  the story of, you know, \"Money Ball\", the movie.  Some people sat at that  table, and didn't understand why you were going to pay this fellow.  Other  people said hey, here are the numbers.  This is why we pay him.  And I  think it's perceived value that when you're looking at Google, when you  look at your iPad, your iPhone, there is value. </p><p>BRANTHOVER:  Right.</p><p>ANTE:  I would agree with that.  But I would go one step further.  I would  say, it is actually real value.  If you look at the market capitalizations  of these technology companies, they are soaring.  Facebook is worth almost  $200 billion.</p><p>SILVIA:  You're Wall Street, it is perceived value.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Correct.</p><p>SILVIA:  It's what people .</p><p>ANTE:  It's the value today.</p><p>SILVIA:  That's value today.  </p><p>ANTE:  It might be less tomorrow.  </p><p>SILVIA:  You got it.  Just like a Major League Baseball player.  </p><p>ANTE:  Right.  It's been going up. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ANTE:  The fact that these companies are creating value in the market is  justifying these large paychecks to a certain extent.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, we've got to go.  Thanks, guys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Great stuff.  All right, thanks to all three of you.  Some big  business winners and losers when it comes to the president's new defense  budget proposal.  We're looking at possibly the fewest troops since before  World War II.  And a higher reliance on machines and unmanned drones.  Our  Rich Edson has the latest breakdown from D.C.  How does it break down,  Rich?</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX BUSINESS:  Well it depends on what you're looking at in the  aspect of this.  When you talk about fewer troops in the field, you look at  the support that goes behind that.  A lot of manned vehicles, especially on  the ground.  Analysts are pointing to perhaps some vehicles produced by  Oshkosh, General Dynamics, BAE systems.  They're also retiring some  specifics, here's the U2 spy-plane, the classic from the Cold War will be  retired.  The maintenance cost on that will go away for some companies.   Also, the littoral combat shift.  They scaled back the orders on that one.   That hits Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics.  Also, two unmanned drones,  the Predator and the Reaper that is built by General Atomics.  And that  will also be scaled back.  So, there is specific programs in here, I think,  quite generally, anything that's used to support troops are going to get  hit in this budget.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.  So, and who else gets hurt?</p><p>EDSON:  Well, that is pretty much it from that perspective, especially when  you scale that down.  As far as the winners are concerned, you know, you  look at the other side of it, and you're building more of these technology  intense types of weaponry.  And that is right in the wheelhouse of  companies like Lockheed Martin, and many of the others that we've seen.   Boeing is out there developing these types of technologies.  And that is  why you saw many of these stocks even hitting 52-week highs even during an  announcement where the Pentagon is talking about scaling troops down to the  smallest size that we've seen in decades.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.  And how are the contractors taking it?</p><p>EDSON:  Well, thus far, you know, right now the stock prices are taking it  quite well.  And there is still a lot more details to come out in this,  Melissa.  You know, this is just the president's request.  We don't get the  full request until next week.  And then Congress writes the specifics and  who knows what happens with that.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Rich, thank you so much.  Always appreciate it.</p><p>EDSON:  Thanks.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And get ready because we're going to save you money right now.   Doctor Manny is here to tell you how to stop throwing cash in the trash.  I  swear, you are going to be so surprised when you hear what he says.  We  were dying over this earlier today.  It is incredible.</p><p>And why don't people get as angry over bonuses in the tech world as they do  in big banks? Is the popular perception fair anymore?  We fought it out.   Tweet me, and tell me what you think.  You've heard the segment.  Tell me  your response.  Do you ever have too much money?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, we're looking at Dow that's basically flat on the session so  I wanted to show you Best Buy because some news is just crossing on that.   They are announcing that they are going to cut 2,000 managers and you can  see that investors there like that.  It is trading up about 1.6 percent so  far on the session.  </p><p>All right, chew on this.  Americans are literally throwing away more than  $160 billion worth of food this year.  That is nearly a third of the food  that we buy.  You may think you know what to eat and what to keep from the  expiration dates, but we have got some very surprising stats that will help  you keep your cash from going bad.  It is time for your \"Medical Dollars  with Dr. Manny.\" </p><p>So, this is a list of things that you can keep.</p><p>DR. MANNY ALVAREZ, FOX NEWS MEDICAL A-TEAM:  And we're still overweight.</p><p>FRANCIS:  After the ..</p><p>ALVAREZ:  Right.  $160 billion thrown in the garbage, and we're still  overweight.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's because Oreo cookies never go bad.  Fritos, never go bad.   They last till nuclear war, you don't have to worry about it.</p><p>But we're talking about fresh healthy food, eggs.  You can keep three to  five weeks after the expiration date?</p><p>ALVAREZ:  And that is correct.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Are you kidding me?! </p><p>ALVAREZ:  You can.  Listen.  If you go to any country, they - look,  expiration dates have a purpose, of course, is to keep us safe, to make  sure that things don't spoil, so you don't get an infection.  But it is  also to move merchandise around.  I mean you've got a whole supply coming  in.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Say it isn't so?</p><p>ALVAREZ:  It is so.  I know my money.  I used to have a deli.  I know how  these things works.  So, a lot of it you really don't have to pay attention  a lot to the expiration date.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Really?  So, eggs is not one that I would .</p><p>ALVAREZ:  If they are properly kept in the refrigerator, three weeks.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Sandwich meats?</p><p>ALVAREZ:  Sandwich meats.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You can ignore it?</p><p>ALVAREZ:   Nowadays you could keep them before up to two weeks if you want  to.  And basically, if, especially if the packages, as a lot of these meats  that come in vacuum sealed.  And again you can keep them for, as long as  they are properly refrigerated you can keep them for a long time.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Bacon, two weeks, after if it is unopened, packaged dinners with  the USDA seal.  Hotdogs, two weeks after - now, hotdogs - have hotdogs in  my fridge that are five years old.  That is no good.  I thought hotdogs  last forever.  </p><p>ALVAREZ:  Are they frozen? </p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean - aren't they full of preservatives and chemicals anyway?</p><p>ALVAREZ:  Yeah, but I mean, look, like everything else.  It is all about  how they are packaged.  It is all about how they're processed and it's all  about how they're stored.  I mean if you find products, for instance, in  some grocery stores, there is a lot of light coming through the window you  can rest assured that you are eating away nutrients.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  That's it's rotten before you even get out of the store.</p><p>ALVAREZ:  Exactly.  Yeah.  If the temperature of the store is  inappropriate.  There is a lot of things that come into consideration.   That is why these numbers come into play, you know, these expiration dates.   But again, I don't know where they came from to begin with. </p><p>FRANCIS:  That's true.  There is a list of stuff that you should toss.</p><p>ALVAREZ:  Absolutely.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Infant formula.  No, that's one - I always feel like that is a  manipulation.  Because with the infant formula, a lot of it - I mean it's  not refrigerated.  So .</p><p>ALVAREZ:  It's not refrigerated, but it's about the nutrients.  There is a  lot of degradation when it comes from storage. </p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>ALVAREZ:  And certainly, you don't want to keep that for a long time. </p><p>FRANCIS:  We say meat here, but we were just talking about hotdogs and  packaged goods.</p><p>ALVAREZ:  But this is fresh meat.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You're talking about like - steaks.</p><p>ALVAREZ:  The chicken and all of that.  Again, we know about .</p><p>FRANCIS:  Lettuce and spinach.  That is a dangerous one.  And people don't  realize it.  Why is that one you should get rid of? </p><p>ALVAREZ:  Well, because look how many cases of food poisoning we get from  fresh spinach and lettuce.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>ALVAREZ:  So again, as the lettuce oxidizes and everything is more  embedded, there is more chances for bacteria to grow and that, of course,  contaminates the food supply, and ergo you get sick.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So the eggs.  I'm going to keep them for five weeks.  I'm going  to eat them.  And if get sick .</p><p>ALVAREZ:  You call me.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm coming to find you.</p><p>ALVAREZ:  No copay.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm going to be furious!</p><p>ALVAREZ:  That's OK.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No, I will just eat Fritos instead.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Dr. Manny, thanks so much.  Fritos are always safe.  </p><p>All right.  Quick shoutout to Netflix for this one, having a little fun in  the drone zone.

One analyst is expecting as many as 13,000 job cuts.   Charles Payne follows IBM, and Charles, this is one of those stories, you  know, I mean, I know part of it is coming from a union inside IBM of  workers.  There is also an analyst at Bernstein talking about it.  Has that  rumor feel to it.  What do you make of this whole thing?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  I go to tell you, Melissa, any time  we hear about jobs, particularly good jobs, you know, being lost, it's sort  of one of these not just a Wall Street story but it's a Main Street story,  and that's why it captures everybody's attention.  And of course, we're  talking Big Blue, IBM.  But IBM has had some problems.  And this is one of  these rumors you can believe, because apparently this union is part of what  they call the Systems and Technology Unit.  Last report they put out for  their last quarter that units of revenues down 26 percent and gross margin  went to 38 percent from 44 percent in a year.  Obviously there are serious  issues there and IBM is probably going to address it this way.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  And you look at that the stock, I mean, it is trading  higher on the day.  I mean, obviously, investors looking for a change over  there.  But you know, interesting story to see how it really plays out.  </p><p>Charles, thanks so much.  </p><p>PAYNE:  You got it.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  All right.  </p><p>Over California now with the devastating mega drought is showing no signs  of lighting up.  This dramatic before and after picture really tells the  tale, one scientist thinks the golden state might stay dry for the next two  centuries, 200 years.  </p><p>Joining me now on the phone is climatologist Lynn Ingram who says this  phenomena may last 200 years.  What makes you think that, Lynn?  </p><p>LYNN INGRAM, CLIMATOLOGIST (via phone):  Hi.  Well, we study the past  climate, you know, looking back thousands of years and we see these  patterns of wet and dry.  And we see in the past there were periods of over  a century of less than maybe 50 to 60 percent precipitation and so we just  kind of think these climate patterns repeat themselves, then we very well  could be entering a dryer period.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And a lot has to do with temperatures in the Pacific Ocean,  right?  And that it is cooler?  Is there anything that could make a  turnaround and get warmer again?  </p><p>INGRAM:  Well, it is, you know, it has got to do that itself.   Unfortunately, it is just this big body of water that brings where we get  all our moisture for precipitation.  And so, we are kind at the mercy of  the sort of ocean circulation and what sets up these patterns of cooler  water off of our coast and.  So, all we can do is wait and see if we are  going to continue in this dryer period or if things turn around.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And it is so interesting, because I grew up in California and it  is a lot of farmers that are basically out there trying to farm in the  desert and they set up this system, this complex aqueduct system to get  water around places where there isn't usually water.  Are they prepared for  this?  I mean, if we go in to the two hundred years, is it reasonable to  think they can do something, you know, to keep farmers in place and keep  people in place?  </p><p>INGRAM:  Right.  Well, unfortunately, a lot of these dams and canals were  built in the 20th century and that was a relatively wetter century.  And  so, I think some changes are going to have to be made because we really --  if we are entering an average dryer period, we really can't -- we are not  going to have the water, resources that we had before.  And also we have  been depleting our granddaughter, and that is like water in the bank that  we have been using up.  And so, we really need to start banking water  underground which people are talking about now to prepare.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  It is an important story for all our viewers because we all get  so much food and produce and everything else out of California.  So it  impacts you whether you live in California or not.  </p><p>Lynn, thank you so much for joining us.  We appreciate your insight.  </p><p>INGRAM:  Yes, you are very welcome.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  From the U.S. recorder of the globe money has been flying around  world again today.  </p><p>Starting in northern China where one guy is the first person to sue the  government over the country's toxic smog.

What you're seeing now is capital in  places like Chicago and Columbus and other places where they can stay and  build their dreams.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Are the governments more friendly?  I mean, California is got  pretty hostile in terms of visas and tax structure and property prices.  </p><p>KVAMME:  Yes.  I mean, it is really crazy.  I grew up in Silicon Valley and  I lived there, you know, in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and so on.  And in fact,  there was a report recently about how selling in Palo Alto, there were 1100  square feet with one car garage for its foundation was cracked, roof was  leaking from a $1.6 million.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  No, stop it.  You are making that up.  </p><p>KVAMME:  No.  I am not making that up.  And by the way, it was right next  to the train tracks.  I mean, it is crazy in California right now.   Whereas, you know, for $1.6 million in the Midwest, you are going to buy a  palace.  But it really is not just about that.  I mean, what has happened  is we had a huge technology shift with the whole invention of cloud  computing, you know, Amazon web services and rock space and others, you can  actually be an engineer in Columbus, Ohio or Cincinnati or Chicago and not  have to worry about the back end technology you had to do in the past to  build facebook or Google or these other great companies in Silicon Valley.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  And a lot of companies out there are ones everybody knows,  Group On, Angie's List, Orbits, Scrub Hub, Brain Trick (ph), Career  Builder, I mean, one of the companies you are invested in, Farm Logs (ph),  went to Silicon Valley and they came back to Michigan.  How come?  </p><p>KVAMME:  Well, I mean, basically, (INAUDIBLE), who is the founder there  grew up in Michigan, became a computer scientist, went to Silicon Valley  because he thought that was where he had to go in the white culminated  class, you know, PolyGram.  The great incubator this after he got the idea  for Farm Lobby, wait a second.  All right, my customers are in the Midwest.   Why would I be here?  Why am I paying engineers as much money as that to  pay I am here versus moving back to Michigan, where it is have to a third  the cost?  So, he moved back to Michigan so he could be close to his  customers, close to the great engineering talent that is coming out of  places like the Anniversary of Michigan.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.  And Mark, you know what you're talking about, I mean,  coming from (INAUDIBLE) capital going over to create Drive Capital.  Good  luck to you.  Thanks for coming on the show.  </p><p>KVAMME:  Well, thank you very much.  I really appreciate it.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  The closing bell is just about an hour away.  Lots going on in  the last hour of trading always.  Liz, what do you have coming up in your  jammed-pack show?  </p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FBN HOST, COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL:  Let me just start of  by saying, you rocket in this show.  I tell you.  Riveted, I almost came  down late.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  We keep the pace going.  We keep it going.  We got a lot in  there.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  And I'm totally with Dr. Manny about expirations dates because my  dad was a doctor and he said they are just for the lawyers.  Expiration  dates are just for the layers.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Hot dogs you can keep forever -- five, six, ten years.  They are  still good.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Exactly.  </p><p>OK, yes, I know that you know we got new home sales and they have done the  complete opposite of what all the other housing numbers of done which have  been down.  They jumped more than nine percent.  It is a big move and it  makes you wonder who is really benefiting and we want to know who would  benefit for you as far as the owning stock is concerned, we have Farooq  Kathwari who is the CEO of Ethan Allen coming up.  We going to talk to him  about what kind of action he has seen when it comes to sales of Ethan Allen  furniture.  We are going to ask him what it hottest sellers are and what he  sees for the future of the housing market.  It is one of those so-called  derivative plays.  And as we look at what they can put into your home, it  is the new home sales that tend to benefit the kinds of companies like  Ethan Allen.  </p><p>I also want to mention everybody is looking and waiting for JCPenney  numbers \"after the bell\" today.  Watch out.  There is another store chain  you need to be watching out for because it may really provide a much worse  situation than JCPenney as we will talk about that and more coming up.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Liz, all right, looks fortunate.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  Anytime.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Go get ready.  You only have a couple minutes left.  </p><p>CLAMAN:  I'm going.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, up next, with so many airline flights already  cancelled this winter, we are going to tell you how to be sure the trip you  book actually makes it out.  Guess what.  It is all about money.  There's a  formula to is this, you cannot afford to miss it.  We will be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  I want to show you JCPenney right now because this is the  stock that is reporting \"after the bell.\"  And you know, analysts are  saying that any game here, which is relatively significant up on a  percentage basis of almost three percent, is a dead cat bounce.  We are  looking for revenue to fall slightly year over year but earnings out \"after  the bell\" and right now investors spending ahead of it.  </p><p>Now for a little fun with spare change and hopefully this helps you from  wasting when you book your next trip.  The Cancellator, it is real,  traveler beware, it might be targeting your next flight.  Here to explain  his travel expert Mark Murphy.  </p><p>OK.  So the Cancellator is an algorithm that the airlines use and they all  use it and it helps them decide which flights to cancel.  </p><p>MARK MURPHY, FOUNDER, TRAVELPULSE.COM:  Absolutely.  So, and it is just  computer-based, just like the airplanes fly based on computers.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  It is not just weather and they are looking out for safety and we  are going to get killed by a snowstorm, they cancelled our flight?  It is  more complex than that.   </p><p>MURPHY:  Well, there is a lot of things like crew changes.  They are moving  one crew from let's say Dallas-Fort Worth and they want to get them up to  Chicago.  So, they are going to make sure that that plane arrives with that  crew is going connect with a flight, let's say to London Heathrow.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, they would have priority to let them get out before their  storm closes?  I mean, how did they get priority?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Well, just priority in terms of getting those crews to their next  flight or if you're talking about a connection, let's say you are on the  connection, if a lot of people on that connection are business travelers,  high-yield travelers that are connecting on, that is going to get a  priority over, let's say, a flight that will end at that destination with a  bunch of leisure travelers which tend to book far in advance and hey much  lower price than the average business traveler.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So, let me get it straight.  So there's a delay at the airport  and they're trying to figure out which flights they are going to ground and  which flight they are going to let get out.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Profit has a big --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And there is an algorithm in there and it is not just who is  waiting the longest.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Correct.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  There's nothing fair about this.  </p><p>MURPHY:  It is all about fare.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  It has to do with are there a lot of business travelers that pay  a lot of money that flight goes first?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  There is a lot of factor.  This is about any one factor.  It  is not just the weather, it is not just mechanical delays, it is crews,  profitability, it is connections.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  And it is how much people paid.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Of course.  Yes, that factors in.  It is not the only factor, but  it is part of that.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  So now that I know about this how do I game it next time I am  booking a flight, I pay more?  </p><p>MURPHY:  You really can't game it, to be frank, because it has so many  factors of outside of your control.  What you can do is you can be  proactive and book with a travel agent.  Travel agents book 50 percent of  all tickets, 60 percent of all international --.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Why does it help me if the travel agency?  </p><p>MURPHY:  So let's say you are flying and you are connecting in Dallas, but  your flight got the late on the way to Dallas so you are going to miss your  connection.  The agent is aware of that delay.  They are already rebooking  you so by the time.  So by the time you are on the ground --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  They are now out to lunch having some food?  </p><p>MURPHY:  No, mostly they will found out.  A good one, no, they're actively  working on your behalf.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Avoid late in the day flights?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  Because what happens is it goes later in the day, those  issues stack up and then it becomes a domino effect and you may not get  out.  If you take that first flight out of the day, you are much -- have a  much better likelihood --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Can you game which flights there are more business travelers on  like if it is a three class plane or if there is no connection?  How do you  try and figure out which one the big money guys are on?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Rush-hour.  Rush hour to airport --  </p><p>FRANCIS:  What is that?  </p><p>MURPHY:  So, you know, 6:00 to 8:00 in the morning, business travelers on  the way.  5:00 to 8:00 p.m. they are coming home.  So look at those flights  that are, you know, a little later in the morning or that very, very first  flight in the morning.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Mark, thank you.  Very interesting.  I knew there was more to it.   It is always all about money.  </p><p>All right, coming up, you heard it here on FOX Business.  It was a scoop.   (INAUDIBLE) CEO saying of the Bitcoin exchange is going nowhere.  Is the  crypto currency about to implode or is this just the inevitable rocky start  to something fairly great?  We are getting in to the bottom of it.  </p><p>You can never have too much Bitcoin.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Whether it is on Wall Street or Main Street, here is who is  making money today. </p><p>Surprisingly anyone who owns Target, the sign or rich stock is popping  despite the lackluster earnings report revealing falling sales and it hit  to nothing income still, profit came in above estimates.  That's enough to  please investors.  Shares now trading up about seven percent almost, on the  day.  Good for them.  One person making money is the chief executive, Greg  Stein.  He owns about 1.5 million shares meaning he made about $5.5 million  just so far today.  Very nice.  </p><p>Making money from our nation's spying initiative is Boeing.  It is getting  more than $2 billion to build another 16 long-range maritime spy planes for  the Navy.  The new spy aircraft will replace an aging fleet which has  already been used for more than 40 years.  They are based on a version of  the 737 there used anti-submarine and anti-war care surveillance work.   They are proving to be very popular.  Eight have been ordered by the  Australian government.  Boeing stock right now is down around two-tenths of  one percent.  </p><p>Also making money the California -- did you hear about this?  The  California couple that may have stumbled upon one of the greatest treasure  trove ever to be found in the U.S.  The anonymous below was out walking  their dog in the backyard when they stumbled on rusty metal cans.  The  inside, they discovered coins from gold rush era worth more than $10  million.  Currency experts have confirmed the coins are authentic and the  near mint condition.  They plan to sell most of them on Amazon, of all  things while others will be displayed in an upcoming exhibit.  I bet they  are going to have a lot of new friends.  I'd like to be their new friend.   Those are nice.  </p><p>Turning to Bitcoin now, the virtual currency having a tough go of it  lately.  We just got word that Bitcoin derivatives market BTC suspended  trading after a key exchange partner Mount Gox has gone dark.  Of course,  we know Mount Gox has been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors.  FOX Business  obtained chant logs from exchange CEO Mark Karpeles saying he in exchange  are not they're not going anywhere despite the site being offline since  yesterday.  Is it time for the currency to be regulated?  </p><p>Massachusetts bank commissioner David Cotney joins me on this one.  </p><p>Commissioner, thanks for joining me.  What do you make of these  (INAUDIBLE)?  With the CEO saying that they are not going anywhere.  What  do you read into that?  </p><p>DAVID COTNEY, MASSACHUSETTS BANK COMMISSIONER:  Well, I think in the wake  of the shutdown on line of the Mount Gox exchange there are a lot of  unanswered questions, both technical and legal and I think that we are all  going to look forward to having some of those questions answered in the  days ahead.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean, in answering those questions, they obviously just  received the subpoena we are talking about that from federal prosecutors.   What does that mean?  I mean, what are they looking for?  </p><p>COTNEY:  Well, I am sure they are looking for a chain of events to  determine whether anything illegal, whether any fraud occurred because  there are many people now who are asking, you know, where are their  Bitcoin?  Where is my money?  </p><p>FRANCIS:  What do you think needs to be done with Bitcoin?  I mean, you  think it needs more transparency?  Do you think it needs more regulation?   I mean, what is the answer in your mind?  </p><p>COTNEY:  Well, you know, when I talked to financial institutions, when I  talk to consumers, when I talk to businesses, they all want a payment  system that is more secure, more real time and less costly.  And for the  defenders of Bitcoin, they say that this answers many of those.  And to  that end, state regulators from around the country through the conference  of state bank supervisors, we formed a task force to look at these emerging  payment issues as well as some of the legacy payments to determine whether  this should be further regulated and how they should be regulated.  And to  folks within the Bitcoin world, many of them even say that to the extent  that this can become a more regulated type of transaction that will add to  consumer confidence.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  But I guess, I mean, consumer confidence, the whole point of  Bitcoin, what makes people feel confident about it is that they want the  government out of their business.  And inherent to that is a lot of risk  and I feel like people who invest and transact in Bitcoin understand there  is a risk and it is worth it to them because they don't want the government  involve and snooping into what they're doing.  What is wrong with that?  </p><p>COTNEY:  Well, there's nothing wrong or illegal per see of this Bitcoin  network.  But it is important for consumers to know that this is risky,  this is not an FDIC insured type of deposit activity.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  But you don't think they know that?  I mean, would that enough to  satisfy if they said this is very risky.  It is not backed.  It is not  insured.  You know, the government is not guaranteeing anything that is  going on here, buyer beware.  Would that satisfy you if there was that  disclosure for every transaction?  </p><p>COTNEY:  Well, and again, disclosure is probably one of the things that we  will be looking at to determine what information do consumers need to make  some type of informed decision?  And if they feel a transaction that may  not be backed by any type deposit insurance that may have less protection  than that may be the way we go.  But we just need to get further  information on the best way to ensure that consumers have the information  they need.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  Commissioner David Cotney, thanks so much for joining us.  We  appreciate your time.  </p><p>COTNEY:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>FRANCIS:  That is all we have got for now.  I hope that you are making  money today.  Tune in tomorrow for my interview with Florida governor Rick  Scott.  He is making Florida hotbed for startups bringing jobs to the  state.  That is tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.  </p><p>Countdown though with Liz Claman starts right now.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

S&amp;P flirting with record territory right now. Also, oil is rising up. And new emergency rules are moving Bakken Shale via oil train. We're going live to the CME to show you what is happening. And we have got a signature \"MONEY\" style Wall Street throw down on Tesla, including a referee. Look at that. Plus, Silicon Valley versus Wall Street. RBS is paying out a billion bucks in bonuses. It is causing an outrage. Does anyone care when Google does the exact same thing? Because even when they say it's not, it is always about money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oil climbing higher right now as the U.S. government looks to add new emergency regulations around transporting oil via railroads. Over to Fox contributor Phil Flynn at the CME. And Phil, I want to talk about oil, but natural gas is a big mover today. What is going on there?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, THE PRICE FUTURES GROUP: It is. What we're seeing, of course, is the collapsing of the curve of the March and the April mainly on changing weather forecasts. But Melissa, what's also happening I think with the natural gas is people are now trying to predict where we're going to end storage for the entire season. A lot of people are betting we could fall below a trillion cubic feet. Whether we do or not, the big question is if we do, can we get back to full storage before next winter and that is really what's driving the trade right now.</p><p>FRANCIS: And this talk about shipping from the Bakken Shale, I mean that was on the front of every paper today. Every oil trader talking about it.</p><p>FLYNN: It is. Yeah. And it is going to add to the cost of the barrel of oil. You know, the competition for route space has already been incredible in that type of the world. And because oil was taking all the space, you know, it impacted every market. Even the grains can't get down to the United States because of this. This type of crude, Melissa, I talked to refiners, it is so pure, it is unbelievable. It's almost like it's coming out of the ground refined. And while that is good for the refiners it is very volatile, very dangerous. And they want to check, you know, every barrel that goes in.</p><p>FRANCIS: Sure.</p><p>FLYNN: What this is going to be. And it's more money. It's going to cost - right now it is costing a couple of dollars a barrel.</p><p>FRANCIS: More money and I understand it's going to drive up the price of cookies? How so?</p><p>FLYNN: It is. This is an outrage, I know. Right now because rail space has been taken over by the Bakken Shale, there is no room to move grains and oats and, we saw oat prices hit the highest level in five years. It caused a price spike. That means that your cookie price could go up at least 1.5 percent. This is an outrage.</p><p>FRANCIS: It's very serious.</p><p>FLYNN: I think .</p><p>FRANCIS: We eat a lot of cookies in my house, Phil. We're out of time. And that is very serious. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>FLYNN: I've got you.</p><p>FRANCIS: I appreciate it.</p><p>FLYNN: Thank you, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: From gas to batteries now, Elon Musk and Tesla sending shockwaves on Wall Street today. The carmaker hitting all-time highs after announcing plans to build the world's largest battery factory with a partnership with Panasonic. Not everyone's believer in the battery powered engine that could. Time for another Wall Street throw down. Jeff Reeves of InvestorPlace.com is a Tesla (INAUDIBLE). And Maxfund.com Jonas Max Ferris thinks there are bumpy roads ahead this. Also, a Fox News contributor, Jeff, make the bull case right now for me.</p><p>JEFF REEVES, INVESTORPLACE.COM EDITOR: Well, you know, short term, I think Tesla is basically trading on charts and sentiments. So, I'm not going to speculate about the next six weeks. But I think long term Tesla is definitely where it needs to be and we've seen this with a lot of innovative companies where they basically become their brand. You know, electric vehicles are Tesla.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>REEVES: What the Prius did, I meant the Prius was the best-selling car in California. One of the best-selling cars in the world right now. It clearly, it kind of made a lot of strides on the hybrid front. And it hasn't lost that brand. I think if Tesla does this right, it has a huge runway out of it. It just has this bottleneck on production.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jonas, it has a bottleneck on production. And Jonas, I mean one of the knocks against it has been, how can they possibly create batteries fast enough to keep up with demand. Well, they're solving that problem. I mean Elon is so smart he goes down and he's like, well, you know, what, I'm going to build my own battery factory, so that I don't have a problem. Why you do not like this, Jonas?</p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS: It sounds like Henry Ford when he put rubber plants in Brazil because he couldn't get rubber fast enough. Look, the guy is a genius. He is a Henry Ford of our generation. I love Tesla. I'd like to own one. But this stock is a problem now. It trades as if they are selling a million cars. And yeah, you can fantasize about it being the word distributed power company with this factory and going into other things like some companies overpriced like Amazon and Apple did, then they took over those markets, but the reality is it's a car company that sold 22,000 cars roughly last year. They have to grow sales 50 percent a year, which is their expectation this year from Elon Musk for a decade or more just to catch up to like BMW or other car companies. And they're already trading at a third of the market value. And so, if they're absolutely perfectly flawless in this execution and everybody has got a Tesla and it's the number one car they then only are going to be worth a little more than they're worth today.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, it is pretty crazy. I mean, Jeff, the stock is just so incredibly expensive if you look at the forward P.E., and it's trading at almost 70. You look at something like GM, it's trading at seven. Coke, 16. Google 20. BMW, 10. Why is Tesla worth almost 70 times its forward P.E.?</p><p>REEVES: Well, I mean I think you're, looking at Coke is probably the wrong metric there for forward P.E.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, how about GM? How about BMW? How about Google? Google is a tech company.</p><p>REEVES: A different car company. I would, I would posit that it is much better for you to look at a company like LinkedIn, or Netflix or Amazon. Companies that have had huge forward P.E.s for a while and yet has had big run-ups in a last year or two. I mean the valuation argument is an old one. And I think that it's very important. You remember that in 2015 the valuation there .</p><p>FRANCIS: Old and compelling.</p><p>REEVES: It didn't play out that way.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>REEVES: Because right now there is just not a lot of growth options that investors are willing to pay premiums for growth in a company like this.</p><p>FRANCIS: Get in there, Jonas.</p><p>FERRIS: There is not a lot of growth options is not a good enough reason to pay a ridiculous - It is an old argument, but it's exactly - it's kind of like Amazon played out. If you recall Amazon got really expensive in the late '90s on promise of the future. The stock still fell 90 percent before years later it caught up to that old price. And it actually delivered on promise. It got - it wasn't just books. It became this whole thing where they took over the world. And that might be Tesla's future in ten or 15 years, but you're paying that price today where you might see the stock fall 80 percent over the next ten years before it realizes those dreams way, way down the road.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. We've got to go. Next time you guys have got to get a referee involved. I don't know. Thanks so much.</p><p>FERRIS: Thanks.</p><p>FRANCIS: Retail stocks are soaring right now. Shares of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch teetering their double-digit gains. Brian Sozzi of Belus Capital just got off conference calls several of the giants going on in the past few hours. He is here on the phone. Brian, let's start with Target. What did you think - what was the best question on that call? What did you learn that we wouldn't know if you weren't on the call?</p><p>BRIAN SOZZI, BELUS CAPITAL: Well, one of the first things I learned in that call, Melissa, that Target is bringing mannequins into their store. Kind of goofy, but very interesting. It might actually get people excited on buying clothes at Target again. But one of the most shocking things are - Target is cutting its capital expenditures by $1 billion this year. Now, and that is a serious red flag, because they have not set out (INAUIDBLE) for how much they are going to have to pay for credit card breech. But now you're worrying that Target is going to underinvest in their stores and lose their cool factor compared to Walmart and Target.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you think that the massive data breach, that's evidence of the data breach is having an even bigger impact than people were thinking? I mean if so, then why is the stock soaring right now?</p><p>SOZZI: Well, the stock is soaring today because they came out and told us that their same-store sales, is about flat. Now, flat is a lot better than negative in the quarter, but still the company had a long way to improve their sales. And I think over the next couple of months you're going to see Target go on a marketing blitz and promotional blitz to get customers back in the store.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>SOZZI: They're worried about their profits.</p><p>FRANCIS: I want to talk about Abercrombie. Because you were on that call as well. And I'm looking at CISI (ph) is raising its price target on it right now to 45 from 33. What did you hear on the Abercrombie call and how do you feel about that one?</p><p>SOZZI: Well, I think tomorrow you will all see more brokers will raise price targeting Abercrombie. Why? And it's probably momentum behind the name. The company is slashing expenses quicker than anybody would have thought. But I do have some (INAUDIBLE) for this call. First of all, traffic is down significantly and remains down significantly in Abercrombie and the domestic stores. Most importantly the European business really didn't have a strong quarter at all. And I'm concerned about that. Because whole - many other retailers are now starting to turn the quarter in Europe.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>SOZZI: Abercrombie is - and still is also lowering prices. No good for me.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Although that stock is on fire today. Those investors are loving it. It is up almost 11 percent. Thanks for hopping off those calls and on to the phone with us, Brian. We appreciate it. Back to work.</p><p>SOZZI: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, up next: Wall Street versus Silicon Valley. Big bank bonuses enraged so many, but why don't big tech company bonuses cause the same fury? No one cares. They don't pay attention. Banks, they hate it. Tweet me, tell me what you think. Someone is paying out almost a billion dollars. It is today's \"Money Talker.\" And California's mega drought could last 200 years. The true cost of that. More \"MONEY\" around the scientists behind it coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: It is the battle of the big pay day. While Wall Street executives are scrutinized for their compensation, their Silicon Valley counterparts are given a pass when it comes to massive paychecks. Have you noticed this? The most recent exec bonus bash hitting RBS. Word is it's paying out almost a billion dollars in bonuses. It is today's \"Money Talker.\" And we've got Boyden Global Managing Partner Jeanne Branthover, Wells Fargo chief economist John Silvia, and \"The Wall Street Journal\" senior writer Spencer Ante. Thanks to all of you for joining us. I don't know if you guys have noticed this, we were talking about this in our meeting. You've got this huge paychecks in Silicon Valley, no one bats an eye. They don't care. Somebody like Eric Schmidt in Google another $100 million just for being chairman. I mean the head - Marisa Mayer, she comes, she signs on, for what was it - $129 million. I'm sure she was leaving things behind at Google. And that's why they did it, but still, no one bats an eye. At the banks, you know, Jamie Dimon, it's your $20 million. Everyone is hysterical. Why is there a double standard?</p><p>JEANNE BRANTHOVER, BOYDEN GLOBAL MANAGING PARTNER: Because it's financial services and right now financial services, it's being scrutinized. They want transparency. People feel that they're the reason for the crisis. And so, therefore any money that is being given out is going to be criticized.</p><p>FRANCIS: Spencer, is that what it is all about?</p><p>SPENCER ANTE, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, yeah, you know, Wall Street almost brought the entire global economy to the brink of a global depression.</p><p>FRANCIS: But the dot-com bubble burst. I mean that was a disaster.</p><p>ANTE: But that was a long time ago.</p><p>FRANCIS: That was a long time ago.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ANTE: That was over a decade. I would say this. I don't think tech executives are being given a free pass.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>ANTE: They're getting a lot more scrutiny, actually. And it is interesting because I think the new bogey man could be the tech executives because there's rising anger and discontent over inequality in America. And tech executives are taking home the biggest paychecks in the economy now.</p><p>FRANCIS: But what is the evidence that it is shifting? I mean, John, are you seeing any of that? Because I saw people protesting outside Jamie Dimon's house. And I don't see them outside Eric Schmidt's house.</p><p>JOHN SILVIA, WELLS FARGO CHIEF ECONOMIST: Well, I'd go back to what Spencer had to say. I think a lot of this has perceived value. And when you are talking about someone in the tech area, for example, Facebook or Google, Apple, people perceive that there is value in what they're doing. I think when someone goes to a bank .</p><p>FRANCIS: There is not value in what financial services do?</p><p>SILVIA: No, I think when someone goes to a bank .</p><p>FRANCIS: We all use our credit cards and our ATM and our checking account every single day!</p><p>SILVIA: But when you go to a bank there is ATM. And it's not - it is not sexy. It's not interesting. It is just, an ATM.</p><p>ANTE: It's financial engineering.</p><p>BRANTHOVER: Exactly.</p><p>ANTE: That is the reputation. It's financial .</p><p>FRANCIS: But you think it is shifting? I mean .</p><p>ANTE: I do. Well, if you go to San Francisco, this is the number one issue people are talking about is the one percent. They're protesting Google buses. They're getting bricks thrown at the buses. Tom Perkins, the famous venture capitalist.</p><p>FRANCIS: Although he is a conservative.</p><p>ANTE: Who caused a huge firestorm when he compared what happened to the google buses to Kristallnacht. OK, so - that is a good example of why tech executives are getting more scrutiny. Not as much as Wall Street. But if they don't .</p><p>FRANCIS: They're not going after Cheryl Sandberg. They're not going after Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>BRANTHOVER: But then it is people. You have to understand. Look at everybody's shareholders are looking at where is the future, right? So, right now at least in the executive search world people feel that technology is getting us out of the crisis. Technology is ..</p><p>FRANCIS: But who's financing technology?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean who takes them public.</p><p>BRANTHOVER: They don't think. That's in the back .</p><p>FRANCIS: Who enables people to pay for those services online?</p><p>BRANTHOVER: But you're thinking like the rational business person who looks at financial services and understands it. Most people don't. Most people as you said, they're using their iPads. They're using their phones. They see the value in these companies.</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you think, John?</p><p>SILVIA: I think it's all comes back to perceived value. I mean that was the story of, you know, \"Money Ball\", the movie. Some people sat at that table, and didn't understand why you were going to pay this fellow. Other people said hey, here are the numbers. This is why we pay him. And I think it's perceived value that when you're looking at Google, when you look at your iPad, your iPhone, there is value.</p><p>BRANTHOVER: Right.</p><p>ANTE: I would agree with that. But I would go one step further. I would say, it is actually real value. If you look at the market capitalizations of these technology companies, they are soaring. Facebook is worth almost $200 billion.</p><p>SILVIA: You're Wall Street, it is perceived value.</p><p>FRANCIS: Correct.</p><p>SILVIA: It's what people .</p><p>ANTE: It's the value today.</p><p>SILVIA: That's value today.</p><p>ANTE: It might be less tomorrow.</p><p>SILVIA: You got it. Just like a Major League Baseball player.</p><p>ANTE: Right. It's been going up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ANTE: The fact that these companies are creating value in the market is justifying these large paychecks to a certain extent.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, we've got to go. Thanks, guys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Great stuff. All right, thanks to all three of you. Some big business winners and losers when it comes to the president's new defense budget proposal. We're looking at possibly the fewest troops since before World War II. And a higher reliance on machines and unmanned drones. Our Rich Edson has the latest breakdown from D.C. How does it break down, Rich?</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX BUSINESS: Well it depends on what you're looking at in the aspect of this. When you talk about fewer troops in the field, you look at the support that goes behind that. A lot of manned vehicles, especially on the ground. Analysts are pointing to perhaps some vehicles produced by Oshkosh, General Dynamics, BAE systems. They're also retiring some specifics, here's the U2 spy-plane, the classic from the Cold War will be retired. The maintenance cost on that will go away for some companies. Also, the littoral combat shift. They scaled back the orders on that one. That hits Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. Also, two unmanned drones, the Predator and the Reaper that is built by General Atomics. And that will also be scaled back. So, there is specific programs in here, I think, quite generally, anything that's used to support troops are going to get hit in this budget.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. So, and who else gets hurt?</p><p>EDSON: Well, that is pretty much it from that perspective, especially when you scale that down. As far as the winners are concerned, you know, you look at the other side of it, and you're building more of these technology intense types of weaponry. And that is right in the wheelhouse of companies like Lockheed Martin, and many of the others that we've seen. Boeing is out there developing these types of technologies. And that is why you saw many of these stocks even hitting 52-week highs even during an announcement where the Pentagon is talking about scaling troops down to the smallest size that we've seen in decades.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. And how are the contractors taking it?</p><p>EDSON: Well, thus far, you know, right now the stock prices are taking it quite well. And there is still a lot more details to come out in this, Melissa. You know, this is just the president's request. We don't get the full request until next week. And then Congress writes the specifics and who knows what happens with that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Rich, thank you so much. Always appreciate it.</p><p>EDSON: Thanks.</p><p>FRANCIS: And get ready because we're going to save you money right now. Doctor Manny is here to tell you how to stop throwing cash in the trash. I swear, you are going to be so surprised when you hear what he says. We were dying over this earlier today. It is incredible.</p><p>And why don't people get as angry over bonuses in the tech world as they do in big banks? Is the popular perception fair anymore? We fought it out. Tweet me, and tell me what you think. You've heard the segment. Tell me your response. Do you ever have too much money?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, we're looking at Dow that's basically flat on the session so I wanted to show you Best Buy because some news is just crossing on that. They are announcing that they are going to cut 2,000 managers and you can see that investors there like that. It is trading up about 1.6 percent so far on the session.</p><p>All right, chew on this. Americans are literally throwing away more than $160 billion worth of food this year. That is nearly a third of the food that we buy. You may think you know what to eat and what to keep from the expiration dates, but we have got some very surprising stats that will help you keep your cash from going bad. It is time for your \"Medical Dollars with Dr. Manny.\"</p><p>So, this is a list of things that you can keep.</p><p>DR. MANNY ALVAREZ, FOX NEWS MEDICAL A-TEAM: And we're still overweight.</p><p>FRANCIS: After the ..</p><p>ALVAREZ: Right. $160 billion thrown in the garbage, and we're still overweight.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's because Oreo cookies never go bad. Fritos, never go bad. They last till nuclear war, you don't have to worry about it.</p><p>But we're talking about fresh healthy food, eggs. You can keep three to five weeks after the expiration date?</p><p>ALVAREZ: And that is correct.</p><p>FRANCIS: Are you kidding me?!</p><p>ALVAREZ: You can. Listen. If you go to any country, they - look, expiration dates have a purpose, of course, is to keep us safe, to make sure that things don't spoil, so you don't get an infection. But it is also to move merchandise around. I mean you've got a whole supply coming in.</p><p>FRANCIS: Say it isn't so?</p><p>ALVAREZ: It is so. I know my money. I used to have a deli. I know how these things works. So, a lot of it you really don't have to pay attention a lot to the expiration date.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really? So, eggs is not one that I would .</p><p>ALVAREZ: If they are properly kept in the refrigerator, three weeks.</p><p>FRANCIS: Sandwich meats?</p><p>ALVAREZ: Sandwich meats.</p><p>FRANCIS: You can ignore it?</p><p>ALVAREZ: Nowadays you could keep them before up to two weeks if you want to. And basically, if, especially if the packages, as a lot of these meats that come in vacuum sealed. And again you can keep them for, as long as they are properly refrigerated you can keep them for a long time.</p><p>FRANCIS: Bacon, two weeks, after if it is unopened, packaged dinners with the USDA seal. Hotdogs, two weeks after - now, hotdogs - have hotdogs in my fridge that are five years old. That is no good. I thought hotdogs last forever.</p><p>ALVAREZ: Are they frozen?</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean - aren't they full of preservatives and chemicals anyway?</p><p>ALVAREZ: Yeah, but I mean, look, like everything else. It is all about how they are packaged. It is all about how they're processed and it's all about how they're stored. I mean if you find products, for instance, in some grocery stores, there is a lot of light coming through the window you can rest assured that you are eating away nutrients.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. That's it's rotten before you even get out of the store.</p><p>ALVAREZ: Exactly. Yeah. If the temperature of the store is inappropriate. There is a lot of things that come into consideration. That is why these numbers come into play, you know, these expiration dates. But again, I don't know where they came from to begin with.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's true. There is a list of stuff that you should toss.</p><p>ALVAREZ: Absolutely.</p><p>FRANCIS: Infant formula. No, that's one - I always feel like that is a manipulation. Because with the infant formula, a lot of it - I mean it's not refrigerated. So .</p><p>ALVAREZ: It's not refrigerated, but it's about the nutrients. There is a lot of degradation when it comes from storage.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>ALVAREZ: And certainly, you don't want to keep that for a long time.</p><p>FRANCIS: We say meat here, but we were just talking about hotdogs and packaged goods.</p><p>ALVAREZ: But this is fresh meat.</p><p>FRANCIS: You're talking about like - steaks.</p><p>ALVAREZ: The chicken and all of that. Again, we know about .</p><p>FRANCIS: Lettuce and spinach. That is a dangerous one. And people don't realize it. Why is that one you should get rid of?</p><p>ALVAREZ: Well, because look how many cases of food poisoning we get from fresh spinach and lettuce.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>ALVAREZ: So again, as the lettuce oxidizes and everything is more embedded, there is more chances for bacteria to grow and that, of course, contaminates the food supply, and ergo you get sick.</p><p>FRANCIS: So the eggs. I'm going to keep them for five weeks. I'm going to eat them. And if get sick .</p><p>ALVAREZ: You call me.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm coming to find you.</p><p>ALVAREZ: No copay.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm going to be furious!</p><p>ALVAREZ: That's OK.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, I will just eat Fritos instead.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Dr. Manny, thanks so much. Fritos are always safe.</p><p>All right. Quick shoutout to Netflix for this one, having a little fun in the drone zone. Playing off Amazon the announcement that drones can start delivering packages, Netflix is touting. It's touting cheek drone to home service. Saying your DVD can be delivered within seconds and adding it to your queue anywhere you are, anywhere. It's going to be amazing to watch for Amazon's response. I can't wait to see that one.</p><p>All right. Up next, the mega drought still causing pain in California. Now, a new study says it could last for centuries. This could have a long- term effect on industries out west with ripple effects from coast to coast.</p><p>And China's toxic smog is getting even worse. Some experts are drawing similarities to nuclear winter. Find out how one guy is fighting back. \"Piles of Money\" coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: So word out that IBM could start a major round of layoffs starting today. One analyst is expecting as many as 13,000 job cuts. Charles Payne follows IBM, and Charles, this is one of those stories, you know, I mean, I know part of it is coming from a union inside IBM of workers. There is also an analyst at Bernstein talking about it. Has that rumor feel to it. What do you make of this whole thing?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: I go to tell you, Melissa, any time we hear about jobs, particularly good jobs, you know, being lost, it's sort of one of these not just a Wall Street story but it's a Main Street story, and that's why it captures everybody's attention. And of course, we're talking Big Blue, IBM. But IBM has had some problems. And this is one of these rumors you can believe, because apparently this union is part of what they call the Systems and Technology Unit. Last report they put out for their last quarter that units of revenues down 26 percent and gross margin went to 38 percent from 44 percent in a year. Obviously there are serious issues there and IBM is probably going to address it this way.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. And you look at that the stock, I mean, it is trading higher on the day. I mean, obviously, investors looking for a change over there. But you know, interesting story to see how it really plays out.</p><p>Charles, thanks so much.</p><p>PAYNE: You got it.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right.</p><p>Over California now with the devastating mega drought is showing no signs of lighting up. This dramatic before and after picture really tells the tale, one scientist thinks the golden state might stay dry for the next two centuries, 200 years.</p><p>Joining me now on the phone is climatologist Lynn Ingram who says this phenomena may last 200 years. What makes you think that, Lynn?</p><p>LYNN INGRAM, CLIMATOLOGIST (via phone): Hi. Well, we study the past climate, you know, looking back thousands of years and we see these patterns of wet and dry. And we see in the past there were periods of over a century of less than maybe 50 to 60 percent precipitation and so we just kind of think these climate patterns repeat themselves, then we very well could be entering a dryer period.</p><p>FRANCIS: And a lot has to do with temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, right? And that it is cooler? Is there anything that could make a turnaround and get warmer again?</p><p>INGRAM: Well, it is, you know, it has got to do that itself. Unfortunately, it is just this big body of water that brings where we get all our moisture for precipitation. And so, we are kind at the mercy of the sort of ocean circulation and what sets up these patterns of cooler water off of our coast and. So, all we can do is wait and see if we are going to continue in this dryer period or if things turn around.</p><p>FRANCIS: And it is so interesting, because I grew up in California and it is a lot of farmers that are basically out there trying to farm in the desert and they set up this system, this complex aqueduct system to get water around places where there isn't usually water. Are they prepared for this? I mean, if we go in to the two hundred years, is it reasonable to think they can do something, you know, to keep farmers in place and keep people in place?</p><p>INGRAM: Right. Well, unfortunately, a lot of these dams and canals were built in the 20th century and that was a relatively wetter century. And so, I think some changes are going to have to be made because we really -- if we are entering an average dryer period, we really can't -- we are not going to have the water, resources that we had before. And also we have been depleting our granddaughter, and that is like water in the bank that we have been using up. And so, we really need to start banking water underground which people are talking about now to prepare.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is an important story for all our viewers because we all get so much food and produce and everything else out of California. So it impacts you whether you live in California or not.</p><p>Lynn, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate your insight.</p><p>INGRAM: Yes, you are very welcome.</p><p>FRANCIS: From the U.S. recorder of the globe money has been flying around world again today.</p><p>Starting in northern China where one guy is the first person to sue the government over the country's toxic smog. The fed up president is demanding compensation for the money he spent on safety masks, on an air purifier, an indoor treadmill, since outdoor exercise is no longer an option. Look at that. Would you exercise outside? Looking at these photos you see why he would feel this way. The first is Beijing on a normal clear day. Next to it is how the city looks right now. Look at that just two weeks later. That cannot be healthy.</p><p>Moving on to Switzerland, Credit Suisse acknowledging misconduct by a small group of employees that allows some wealthy American clients to stash away billions and un-tax assets. What's wrong with that? City investigators say the bank has been holding up to $12 billion in cash, it is all mine. And more than 22,000 accounts for those U.S. customers and the bank says it is ready to hand over more info on those clients. Chief executive Brady Dugan was on Capitol Hill today to face a grilling by the Senate subcommittee heading to the crow.</p><p>And landing in Brazil where sporting goods brand Adidas is withdrawing some of its world cup t-shirts for being too sexy. One shirt had the words looking to score, while another seemed to show the back of a bikini clad woman. Brazil's tourism board asked the company to drop the shirts thinking they promoted, quote, \"sexual tourism.\" Very cheeky, sexual tourism. It sounds interesting.</p><p>Up next, who needs the valley when you can head to silicon prairie? I like the sound to that. Find out how one entrepreneur left one of the most successful venture capital firms in the country to help create a tax haven in the Midwest.</p><p>At the end of the day it is all about \"Money.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: I'm Cheryl Casone with your FOX Business brief.</p><p>U.S. Bank earnings jumped by 17 percent in the fourth quarter. The FDIC reports the banking industry earned $40.3 billion last quarter up from $30.4 billion the previous year. Losses on loans jumped to a seven year low. For all of 2013 banks earned a record $154.7 billion.</p><p>Hewlett Packard has won a $32 million cybersecurity contract from the department of homeland security. HP will provide software security to 33 federal civilian government agencies to prevent network vulnerabilities and defense against packers.</p><p>New homes sales surge in the month of January by 9.6 percent. That is the fastest pace in 5-1/2 years. According to the commerce department is single-family homes were sold in an annual rate of 468,000 beating analysts' expectations. Sales in the northeast soaring of more than 73 percent.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Move over Silicon Valley, there's a new player in the fight for text tar nets (ph). The Midwest, one venture capital giant is moving away from sunny California and over to Columbus, Ohio. Silicon prairie. I like the name of that.</p><p>Joining me now is Drive capital's Mark Kvamme. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>You know, when I look the way the capital has distributed, a lot of places is cropping up -- Illinois, big money, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, and Missouri. What is the attraction? Is there a lot of good labor?</p><p>MARK KVAMME, DRIVE CAPITAL: Well, I think is it not just labor. I mean, you got to remember, the over 25 percent of the United States research budget is spent in the Midwest with for fabulous universities like University of Michigan, OSU (ph), Carnegie-Mellon, and northwestern and many others that are minting phenomenal engineers. In the past, those engineers if they wanted to follow what they wanted to do, they had to go to Silicon Valley or go to Boston. What you're seeing now is capital in places like Chicago and Columbus and other places where they can stay and build their dreams.</p><p>FRANCIS: Are the governments more friendly? I mean, California is got pretty hostile in terms of visas and tax structure and property prices.</p><p>KVAMME: Yes. I mean, it is really crazy. I grew up in Silicon Valley and I lived there, you know, in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and so on. And in fact, there was a report recently about how selling in Palo Alto, there were 1100 square feet with one car garage for its foundation was cracked, roof was leaking from a $1.6 million.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, stop it. You are making that up.</p><p>KVAMME: No. I am not making that up. And by the way, it was right next to the train tracks. I mean, it is crazy in California right now. Whereas, you know, for $1.6 million in the Midwest, you are going to buy a palace. But it really is not just about that. I mean, what has happened is we had a huge technology shift with the whole invention of cloud computing, you know, Amazon web services and rock space and others, you can actually be an engineer in Columbus, Ohio or Cincinnati or Chicago and not have to worry about the back end technology you had to do in the past to build facebook or Google or these other great companies in Silicon Valley.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. And a lot of companies out there are ones everybody knows, Group On, Angie's List, Orbits, Scrub Hub, Brain Trick (ph), Career Builder, I mean, one of the companies you are invested in, Farm Logs (ph), went to Silicon Valley and they came back to Michigan. How come?</p><p>KVAMME: Well, I mean, basically, (INAUDIBLE), who is the founder there grew up in Michigan, became a computer scientist, went to Silicon Valley because he thought that was where he had to go in the white culminated class, you know, PolyGram. The great incubator this after he got the idea for Farm Lobby, wait a second. All right, my customers are in the Midwest. Why would I be here? Why am I paying engineers as much money as that to pay I am here versus moving back to Michigan, where it is have to a third the cost? So, he moved back to Michigan so he could be close to his customers, close to the great engineering talent that is coming out of places like the Anniversary of Michigan.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. And Mark, you know what you're talking about, I mean, coming from (INAUDIBLE) capital going over to create Drive Capital. Good luck to you. Thanks for coming on the show.</p><p>KVAMME: Well, thank you very much. I really appreciate it.</p><p>FRANCIS: The closing bell is just about an hour away. Lots going on in the last hour of trading always. Liz, what do you have coming up in your jammed-pack show?</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FBN HOST, COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL: Let me just start of by saying, you rocket in this show. I tell you. Riveted, I almost came down late.</p><p>FRANCIS: We keep the pace going. We keep it going. We got a lot in there.</p><p>CLAMAN: And I'm totally with Dr. Manny about expirations dates because my dad was a doctor and he said they are just for the lawyers. Expiration dates are just for the layers.</p><p>FRANCIS: Hot dogs you can keep forever -- five, six, ten years. They are still good.</p><p>CLAMAN: Exactly.</p><p>OK, yes, I know that you know we got new home sales and they have done the complete opposite of what all the other housing numbers of done which have been down. They jumped more than nine percent. It is a big move and it makes you wonder who is really benefiting and we want to know who would benefit for you as far as the owning stock is concerned, we have Farooq Kathwari who is the CEO of Ethan Allen coming up. We going to talk to him about what kind of action he has seen when it comes to sales of Ethan Allen furniture. We are going to ask him what it hottest sellers are and what he sees for the future of the housing market. It is one of those so-called derivative plays. And as we look at what they can put into your home, it is the new home sales that tend to benefit the kinds of companies like Ethan Allen.</p><p>I also want to mention everybody is looking and waiting for JCPenney numbers \"after the bell\" today. Watch out. There is another store chain you need to be watching out for because it may really provide a much worse situation than JCPenney as we will talk about that and more coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: Liz, all right, looks fortunate. Thanks so much.</p><p>CLAMAN: Anytime.</p><p>FRANCIS: Go get ready. You only have a couple minutes left.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm going.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, up next, with so many airline flights already cancelled this winter, we are going to tell you how to be sure the trip you book actually makes it out. Guess what. It is all about money. There's a formula to is this, you cannot afford to miss it. We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. I want to show you JCPenney right now because this is the stock that is reporting \"after the bell.\" And you know, analysts are saying that any game here, which is relatively significant up on a percentage basis of almost three percent, is a dead cat bounce. We are looking for revenue to fall slightly year over year but earnings out \"after the bell\" and right now investors spending ahead of it.</p><p>Now for a little fun with spare change and hopefully this helps you from wasting when you book your next trip. The Cancellator, it is real, traveler beware, it might be targeting your next flight. Here to explain his travel expert Mark Murphy.</p><p>OK. So the Cancellator is an algorithm that the airlines use and they all use it and it helps them decide which flights to cancel.</p><p>MARK MURPHY, FOUNDER, TRAVELPULSE.COM: Absolutely. So, and it is just computer-based, just like the airplanes fly based on computers.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is not just weather and they are looking out for safety and we are going to get killed by a snowstorm, they cancelled our flight? It is more complex than that.</p><p>MURPHY: Well, there is a lot of things like crew changes. They are moving one crew from let's say Dallas-Fort Worth and they want to get them up to Chicago. So, they are going to make sure that that plane arrives with that crew is going connect with a flight, let's say to London Heathrow.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, they would have priority to let them get out before their storm closes? I mean, how did they get priority?</p><p>MURPHY: Well, just priority in terms of getting those crews to their next flight or if you're talking about a connection, let's say you are on the connection, if a lot of people on that connection are business travelers, high-yield travelers that are connecting on, that is going to get a priority over, let's say, a flight that will end at that destination with a bunch of leisure travelers which tend to book far in advance and hey much lower price than the average business traveler.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, let me get it straight. So there's a delay at the airport and they're trying to figure out which flights they are going to ground and which flight they are going to let get out.</p><p>MURPHY: Profit has a big --</p><p>FRANCIS: And there is an algorithm in there and it is not just who is waiting the longest.</p><p>MURPHY: Correct.</p><p>FRANCIS: There's nothing fair about this.</p><p>MURPHY: It is all about fare.</p><p>FRANCIS: It has to do with are there a lot of business travelers that pay a lot of money that flight goes first?</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. There is a lot of factor. This is about any one factor. It is not just the weather, it is not just mechanical delays, it is crews, profitability, it is connections.</p><p>FRANCIS: And it is how much people paid.</p><p>MURPHY: Of course. Yes, that factors in. It is not the only factor, but it is part of that.</p><p>FRANCIS: So now that I know about this how do I game it next time I am booking a flight, I pay more?</p><p>MURPHY: You really can't game it, to be frank, because it has so many factors of outside of your control. What you can do is you can be proactive and book with a travel agent. Travel agents book 50 percent of all tickets, 60 percent of all international --.</p><p>FRANCIS: Why does it help me if the travel agency?</p><p>MURPHY: So let's say you are flying and you are connecting in Dallas, but your flight got the late on the way to Dallas so you are going to miss your connection. The agent is aware of that delay. They are already rebooking you so by the time. So by the time you are on the ground --</p><p>FRANCIS: They are now out to lunch having some food?</p><p>MURPHY: No, mostly they will found out. A good one, no, they're actively working on your behalf.</p><p>FRANCIS: Avoid late in the day flights?</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. Because what happens is it goes later in the day, those issues stack up and then it becomes a domino effect and you may not get out. If you take that first flight out of the day, you are much -- have a much better likelihood --</p><p>FRANCIS: Can you game which flights there are more business travelers on like if it is a three class plane or if there is no connection? How do you try and figure out which one the big money guys are on?</p><p>MURPHY: Rush-hour. Rush hour to airport --</p><p>FRANCIS: What is that?</p><p>MURPHY: So, you know, 6:00 to 8:00 in the morning, business travelers on the way. 5:00 to 8:00 p.m. they are coming home. So look at those flights that are, you know, a little later in the morning or that very, very first flight in the morning.</p><p>FRANCIS: Mark, thank you. Very interesting. I knew there was more to it. It is always all about money.</p><p>All right, coming up, you heard it here on FOX Business. It was a scoop. (INAUDIBLE) CEO saying of the Bitcoin exchange is going nowhere. Is the crypto currency about to implode or is this just the inevitable rocky start to something fairly great? We are getting in to the bottom of it.</p><p>You can never have too much Bitcoin.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it is on Wall Street or Main Street, here is who is making money today.</p><p>Surprisingly anyone who owns Target, the sign or rich stock is popping despite the lackluster earnings report revealing falling sales and it hit to nothing income still, profit came in above estimates. That's enough to please investors. Shares now trading up about seven percent almost, on the day. Good for them. One person making money is the chief executive, Greg Stein. He owns about 1.5 million shares meaning he made about $5.5 million just so far today. Very nice.</p><p>Making money from our nation's spying initiative is Boeing. It is getting more than $2 billion to build another 16 long-range maritime spy planes for the Navy. The new spy aircraft will replace an aging fleet which has already been used for more than 40 years. They are based on a version of the 737 there used anti-submarine and anti-war care surveillance work. They are proving to be very popular. Eight have been ordered by the Australian government. Boeing stock right now is down around two-tenths of one percent.</p><p>Also making money the California -- did you hear about this? The California couple that may have stumbled upon one of the greatest treasure trove ever to be found in the U.S. The anonymous below was out walking their dog in the backyard when they stumbled on rusty metal cans. The inside, they discovered coins from gold rush era worth more than $10 million. Currency experts have confirmed the coins are authentic and the near mint condition. They plan to sell most of them on Amazon, of all things while others will be displayed in an upcoming exhibit. I bet they are going to have a lot of new friends. I'd like to be their new friend. Those are nice.</p><p>Turning to Bitcoin now, the virtual currency having a tough go of it lately. We just got word that Bitcoin derivatives market BTC suspended trading after a key exchange partner Mount Gox has gone dark. Of course, we know Mount Gox has been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors. FOX Business obtained chant logs from exchange CEO Mark Karpeles saying he in exchange are not they're not going anywhere despite the site being offline since yesterday. Is it time for the currency to be regulated?</p><p>Massachusetts bank commissioner David Cotney joins me on this one.</p><p>Commissioner, thanks for joining me. What do you make of these (INAUDIBLE)? With the CEO saying that they are not going anywhere. What do you read into that?</p><p>DAVID COTNEY, MASSACHUSETTS BANK COMMISSIONER: Well, I think in the wake of the shutdown on line of the Mount Gox exchange there are a lot of unanswered questions, both technical and legal and I think that we are all going to look forward to having some of those questions answered in the days ahead.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, in answering those questions, they obviously just received the subpoena we are talking about that from federal prosecutors. What does that mean? I mean, what are they looking for?</p><p>COTNEY: Well, I am sure they are looking for a chain of events to determine whether anything illegal, whether any fraud occurred because there are many people now who are asking, you know, where are their Bitcoin? Where is my money?</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you think needs to be done with Bitcoin? I mean, you think it needs more transparency? Do you think it needs more regulation? I mean, what is the answer in your mind?</p><p>COTNEY: Well, you know, when I talked to financial institutions, when I talk to consumers, when I talk to businesses, they all want a payment system that is more secure, more real time and less costly. And for the defenders of Bitcoin, they say that this answers many of those. And to that end, state regulators from around the country through the conference of state bank supervisors, we formed a task force to look at these emerging payment issues as well as some of the legacy payments to determine whether this should be further regulated and how they should be regulated. And to folks within the Bitcoin world, many of them even say that to the extent that this can become a more regulated type of transaction that will add to consumer confidence.</p><p>FRANCIS: But I guess, I mean, consumer confidence, the whole point of Bitcoin, what makes people feel confident about it is that they want the government out of their business. And inherent to that is a lot of risk and I feel like people who invest and transact in Bitcoin understand there is a risk and it is worth it to them because they don't want the government involve and snooping into what they're doing. What is wrong with that?</p><p>COTNEY: Well, there's nothing wrong or illegal per see of this Bitcoin network. But it is important for consumers to know that this is risky, this is not an FDIC insured type of deposit activity.</p><p>FRANCIS: But you don't think they know that? I mean, would that enough to satisfy if they said this is very risky. It is not backed. It is not insured. You know, the government is not guaranteeing anything that is going on here, buyer beware. Would that satisfy you if there was that disclosure for every transaction?</p><p>COTNEY: Well, and again, disclosure is probably one of the things that we will be looking at to determine what information do consumers need to make some type of informed decision? And if they feel a transaction that may not be backed by any type deposit insurance that may have less protection than that may be the way we go. But we just need to get further information on the best way to ensure that consumers have the information they need.</p><p>FRANCIS: Commissioner David Cotney, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate your time.</p><p>COTNEY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>FRANCIS: That is all we have got for now. I hope that you are making money today. Tune in tomorrow for my interview with Florida governor Rick Scott. He is making Florida hotbed for startups bringing jobs to the state. That is tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.</p><p>Countdown though with Liz Claman starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

S&amp;P flirting with record territory right now. Also, oil is rising up. And new emergency rules are moving Bakken Shale via oil train. We're going live to the CME to show you what is happening. And we have got a signature \"MONEY\" style Wall Street throw down on Tesla, including a referee. Look at that. Plus, Silicon Valley versus Wall Street. RBS is paying out a billion bucks in bonuses. It is causing an outrage. Does anyone care when Google does the exact same thing? Because even when they say it's not, it is always about money.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oil climbing higher right now as the U.S. government looks to add new emergency regulations around transporting oil via railroads. Over to Fox contributor Phil Flynn at the CME. And Phil, I want to talk about oil, but natural gas is a big mover today. What is going on there?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, THE PRICE FUTURES GROUP: It is. What we're seeing, of course, is the collapsing of the curve of the March and the April mainly on changing weather forecasts. But Melissa, what's also happening I think with the natural gas is people are now trying to predict where we're going to end storage for the entire season. A lot of people are betting we could fall below a trillion cubic feet. Whether we do or not, the big question is if we do, can we get back to full storage before next winter and that is really what's driving the trade right now.</p><p>FRANCIS: And this talk about shipping from the Bakken Shale, I mean that was on the front of every paper today. Every oil trader talking about it.</p><p>FLYNN: It is. Yeah. And it is going to add to the cost of the barrel of oil. You know, the competition for route space has already been incredible in that type of the world. And because oil was taking all the space, you know, it impacted every market. Even the grains can't get down to the United States because of this. This type of crude, Melissa, I talked to refiners, it is so pure, it is unbelievable. It's almost like it's coming out of the ground refined. And while that is good for the refiners it is very volatile, very dangerous. And they want to check, you know, every barrel that goes in.</p><p>FRANCIS: Sure.</p><p>FLYNN: What this is going to be. And it's more money. It's going to cost - right now it is costing a couple of dollars a barrel.</p><p>FRANCIS: More money and I understand it's going to drive up the price of cookies? How so?</p><p>FLYNN: It is. This is an outrage, I know. Right now because rail space has been taken over by the Bakken Shale, there is no room to move grains and oats and, we saw oat prices hit the highest level in five years. It caused a price spike. That means that your cookie price could go up at least 1.5 percent. This is an outrage.</p><p>FRANCIS: It's very serious.</p><p>FLYNN: I think .</p><p>FRANCIS: We eat a lot of cookies in my house, Phil. We're out of time. And that is very serious. Thank you so much for coming on.</p><p>FLYNN: I've got you.</p><p>FRANCIS: I appreciate it.</p><p>FLYNN: Thank you, Melissa.</p><p>FRANCIS: From gas to batteries now, Elon Musk and Tesla sending shockwaves on Wall Street today. The carmaker hitting all-time highs after announcing plans to build the world's largest battery factory with a partnership with Panasonic. Not everyone's believer in the battery powered engine that could. Time for another Wall Street throw down. Jeff Reeves of InvestorPlace.com is a Tesla (INAUDIBLE). And Maxfund.com Jonas Max Ferris thinks there are bumpy roads ahead this. Also, a Fox News contributor, Jeff, make the bull case right now for me.</p><p>JEFF REEVES, INVESTORPLACE.COM EDITOR: Well, you know, short term, I think Tesla is basically trading on charts and sentiments. So, I'm not going to speculate about the next six weeks. But I think long term Tesla is definitely where it needs to be and we've seen this with a lot of innovative companies where they basically become their brand. You know, electric vehicles are Tesla.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>REEVES: What the Prius did, I meant the Prius was the best-selling car in California. One of the best-selling cars in the world right now. It clearly, it kind of made a lot of strides on the hybrid front. And it hasn't lost that brand. I think if Tesla does this right, it has a huge runway out of it. It just has this bottleneck on production.</p><p>FRANCIS: Jonas, it has a bottleneck on production. And Jonas, I mean one of the knocks against it has been, how can they possibly create batteries fast enough to keep up with demand. Well, they're solving that problem. I mean Elon is so smart he goes down and he's like, well, you know, what, I'm going to build my own battery factory, so that I don't have a problem. Why you do not like this, Jonas?</p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS: It sounds like Henry Ford when he put rubber plants in Brazil because he couldn't get rubber fast enough. Look, the guy is a genius. He is a Henry Ford of our generation. I love Tesla. I'd like to own one. But this stock is a problem now. It trades as if they are selling a million cars. And yeah, you can fantasize about it being the word distributed power company with this factory and going into other things like some companies overpriced like Amazon and Apple did, then they took over those markets, but the reality is it's a car company that sold 22,000 cars roughly last year. They have to grow sales 50 percent a year, which is their expectation this year from Elon Musk for a decade or more just to catch up to like BMW or other car companies. And they're already trading at a third of the market value. And so, if they're absolutely perfectly flawless in this execution and everybody has got a Tesla and it's the number one car they then only are going to be worth a little more than they're worth today.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, it is pretty crazy. I mean, Jeff, the stock is just so incredibly expensive if you look at the forward P.E., and it's trading at almost 70. You look at something like GM, it's trading at seven. Coke, 16. Google 20. BMW, 10. Why is Tesla worth almost 70 times its forward P.E.?</p><p>REEVES: Well, I mean I think you're, looking at Coke is probably the wrong metric there for forward P.E.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, how about GM? How about BMW? How about Google? Google is a tech company.</p><p>REEVES: A different car company. I would, I would posit that it is much better for you to look at a company like LinkedIn, or Netflix or Amazon. Companies that have had huge forward P.E.s for a while and yet has had big run-ups in a last year or two. I mean the valuation argument is an old one. And I think that it's very important. You remember that in 2015 the valuation there .</p><p>FRANCIS: Old and compelling.</p><p>REEVES: It didn't play out that way.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>REEVES: Because right now there is just not a lot of growth options that investors are willing to pay premiums for growth in a company like this.</p><p>FRANCIS: Get in there, Jonas.</p><p>FERRIS: There is not a lot of growth options is not a good enough reason to pay a ridiculous - It is an old argument, but it's exactly - it's kind of like Amazon played out. If you recall Amazon got really expensive in the late '90s on promise of the future. The stock still fell 90 percent before years later it caught up to that old price. And it actually delivered on promise. It got - it wasn't just books. It became this whole thing where they took over the world. And that might be Tesla's future in ten or 15 years, but you're paying that price today where you might see the stock fall 80 percent over the next ten years before it realizes those dreams way, way down the road.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. We've got to go. Next time you guys have got to get a referee involved. I don't know. Thanks so much.</p><p>FERRIS: Thanks.</p><p>FRANCIS: Retail stocks are soaring right now. Shares of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch teetering their double-digit gains. Brian Sozzi of Belus Capital just got off conference calls several of the giants going on in the past few hours. He is here on the phone. Brian, let's start with Target. What did you think - what was the best question on that call? What did you learn that we wouldn't know if you weren't on the call?</p><p>BRIAN SOZZI, BELUS CAPITAL: Well, one of the first things I learned in that call, Melissa, that Target is bringing mannequins into their store. Kind of goofy, but very interesting. It might actually get people excited on buying clothes at Target again. But one of the most shocking things are - Target is cutting its capital expenditures by $1 billion this year. Now, and that is a serious red flag, because they have not set out (INAUIDBLE) for how much they are going to have to pay for credit card breech. But now you're worrying that Target is going to underinvest in their stores and lose their cool factor compared to Walmart and Target.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, you think that the massive data breach, that's evidence of the data breach is having an even bigger impact than people were thinking? I mean if so, then why is the stock soaring right now?</p><p>SOZZI: Well, the stock is soaring today because they came out and told us that their same-store sales, is about flat. Now, flat is a lot better than negative in the quarter, but still the company had a long way to improve their sales. And I think over the next couple of months you're going to see Target go on a marketing blitz and promotional blitz to get customers back in the store.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>SOZZI: They're worried about their profits.</p><p>FRANCIS: I want to talk about Abercrombie. Because you were on that call as well. And I'm looking at CISI (ph) is raising its price target on it right now to 45 from 33. What did you hear on the Abercrombie call and how do you feel about that one?</p><p>SOZZI: Well, I think tomorrow you will all see more brokers will raise price targeting Abercrombie. Why? And it's probably momentum behind the name. The company is slashing expenses quicker than anybody would have thought. But I do have some (INAUDIBLE) for this call. First of all, traffic is down significantly and remains down significantly in Abercrombie and the domestic stores. Most importantly the European business really didn't have a strong quarter at all. And I'm concerned about that. Because whole - many other retailers are now starting to turn the quarter in Europe.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>SOZZI: Abercrombie is - and still is also lowering prices. No good for me.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Although that stock is on fire today. Those investors are loving it. It is up almost 11 percent. Thanks for hopping off those calls and on to the phone with us, Brian. We appreciate it. Back to work.</p><p>SOZZI: Thank you.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, up next: Wall Street versus Silicon Valley. Big bank bonuses enraged so many, but why don't big tech company bonuses cause the same fury? No one cares. They don't pay attention. Banks, they hate it. Tweet me, tell me what you think. Someone is paying out almost a billion dollars. It is today's \"Money Talker.\" And California's mega drought could last 200 years. The true cost of that. More \"MONEY\" around the scientists behind it coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is the battle of the big pay day. While Wall Street executives are scrutinized for their compensation, their Silicon Valley counterparts are given a pass when it comes to massive paychecks. Have you noticed this? The most recent exec bonus bash hitting RBS. Word is it's paying out almost a billion dollars in bonuses. It is today's \"Money Talker.\" And we've got Boyden Global Managing Partner Jeanne Branthover, Wells Fargo chief economist John Silvia, and \"The Wall Street Journal\" senior writer Spencer Ante. Thanks to all of you for joining us. I don't know if you guys have noticed this, we were talking about this in our meeting. You've got this huge paychecks in Silicon Valley, no one bats an eye. They don't care. Somebody like Eric Schmidt in Google another $100 million just for being chairman. I mean the head - Marisa Mayer, she comes, she signs on, for what was it - $129 million. I'm sure she was leaving things behind at Google. And that's why they did it, but still, no one bats an eye. At the banks, you know, Jamie Dimon, it's your $20 million. Everyone is hysterical. Why is there a double standard?</p><p>JEANNE BRANTHOVER, BOYDEN GLOBAL MANAGING PARTNER: Because it's financial services and right now financial services, it's being scrutinized. They want transparency. People feel that they're the reason for the crisis. And so, therefore any money that is being given out is going to be criticized.</p><p>FRANCIS: Spencer, is that what it is all about?</p><p>SPENCER ANTE, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, yeah, you know, Wall Street almost brought the entire global economy to the brink of a global depression.</p><p>FRANCIS: But the dot-com bubble burst. I mean that was a disaster.</p><p>ANTE: But that was a long time ago.</p><p>FRANCIS: That was a long time ago.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ANTE: That was over a decade. I would say this. I don't think tech executives are being given a free pass.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>ANTE: They're getting a lot more scrutiny, actually. And it is interesting because I think the new bogey man could be the tech executives because there's rising anger and discontent over inequality in America. And tech executives are taking home the biggest paychecks in the economy now.</p><p>FRANCIS: But what is the evidence that it is shifting? I mean, John, are you seeing any of that? Because I saw people protesting outside Jamie Dimon's house. And I don't see them outside Eric Schmidt's house.</p><p>JOHN SILVIA, WELLS FARGO CHIEF ECONOMIST: Well, I'd go back to what Spencer had to say. I think a lot of this has perceived value. And when you are talking about someone in the tech area, for example, Facebook or Google, Apple, people perceive that there is value in what they're doing. I think when someone goes to a bank .</p><p>FRANCIS: There is not value in what financial services do?</p><p>SILVIA: No, I think when someone goes to a bank .</p><p>FRANCIS: We all use our credit cards and our ATM and our checking account every single day!</p><p>SILVIA: But when you go to a bank there is ATM. And it's not - it is not sexy. It's not interesting. It is just, an ATM.</p><p>ANTE: It's financial engineering.</p><p>BRANTHOVER: Exactly.</p><p>ANTE: That is the reputation. It's financial .</p><p>FRANCIS: But you think it is shifting? I mean .</p><p>ANTE: I do. Well, if you go to San Francisco, this is the number one issue people are talking about is the one percent. They're protesting Google buses. They're getting bricks thrown at the buses. Tom Perkins, the famous venture capitalist.</p><p>FRANCIS: Although he is a conservative.</p><p>ANTE: Who caused a huge firestorm when he compared what happened to the google buses to Kristallnacht. OK, so - that is a good example of why tech executives are getting more scrutiny. Not as much as Wall Street. But if they don't .</p><p>FRANCIS: They're not going after Cheryl Sandberg. They're not going after Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>BRANTHOVER: But then it is people. You have to understand. Look at everybody's shareholders are looking at where is the future, right? So, right now at least in the executive search world people feel that technology is getting us out of the crisis. Technology is ..</p><p>FRANCIS: But who's financing technology?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean who takes them public.</p><p>BRANTHOVER: They don't think. That's in the back .</p><p>FRANCIS: Who enables people to pay for those services online?</p><p>BRANTHOVER: But you're thinking like the rational business person who looks at financial services and understands it. Most people don't. Most people as you said, they're using their iPads. They're using their phones. They see the value in these companies.</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you think, John?</p><p>SILVIA: I think it's all comes back to perceived value. I mean that was the story of, you know, \"Money Ball\", the movie. Some people sat at that table, and didn't understand why you were going to pay this fellow. Other people said hey, here are the numbers. This is why we pay him. And I think it's perceived value that when you're looking at Google, when you look at your iPad, your iPhone, there is value.</p><p>BRANTHOVER: Right.</p><p>ANTE: I would agree with that. But I would go one step further. I would say, it is actually real value. If you look at the market capitalizations of these technology companies, they are soaring. Facebook is worth almost $200 billion.</p><p>SILVIA: You're Wall Street, it is perceived value.</p><p>FRANCIS: Correct.</p><p>SILVIA: It's what people .</p><p>ANTE: It's the value today.</p><p>SILVIA: That's value today.</p><p>ANTE: It might be less tomorrow.</p><p>SILVIA: You got it. Just like a Major League Baseball player.</p><p>ANTE: Right. It's been going up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ANTE: The fact that these companies are creating value in the market is justifying these large paychecks to a certain extent.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, we've got to go. Thanks, guys.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Great stuff. All right, thanks to all three of you. Some big business winners and losers when it comes to the president's new defense budget proposal. We're looking at possibly the fewest troops since before World War II. And a higher reliance on machines and unmanned drones. Our Rich Edson has the latest breakdown from D.C. How does it break down, Rich?</p><p>RICH EDSON, FOX BUSINESS: Well it depends on what you're looking at in the aspect of this. When you talk about fewer troops in the field, you look at the support that goes behind that. A lot of manned vehicles, especially on the ground. Analysts are pointing to perhaps some vehicles produced by Oshkosh, General Dynamics, BAE systems. They're also retiring some specifics, here's the U2 spy-plane, the classic from the Cold War will be retired. The maintenance cost on that will go away for some companies. Also, the littoral combat shift. They scaled back the orders on that one. That hits Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. Also, two unmanned drones, the Predator and the Reaper that is built by General Atomics. And that will also be scaled back. So, there is specific programs in here, I think, quite generally, anything that's used to support troops are going to get hit in this budget.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. So, and who else gets hurt?</p><p>EDSON: Well, that is pretty much it from that perspective, especially when you scale that down. As far as the winners are concerned, you know, you look at the other side of it, and you're building more of these technology intense types of weaponry. And that is right in the wheelhouse of companies like Lockheed Martin, and many of the others that we've seen. Boeing is out there developing these types of technologies. And that is why you saw many of these stocks even hitting 52-week highs even during an announcement where the Pentagon is talking about scaling troops down to the smallest size that we've seen in decades.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. And how are the contractors taking it?</p><p>EDSON: Well, thus far, you know, right now the stock prices are taking it quite well. And there is still a lot more details to come out in this, Melissa. You know, this is just the president's request. We don't get the full request until next week. And then Congress writes the specifics and who knows what happens with that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Rich, thank you so much. Always appreciate it.</p><p>EDSON: Thanks.</p><p>FRANCIS: And get ready because we're going to save you money right now. Doctor Manny is here to tell you how to stop throwing cash in the trash. I swear, you are going to be so surprised when you hear what he says. We were dying over this earlier today. It is incredible.</p><p>And why don't people get as angry over bonuses in the tech world as they do in big banks? Is the popular perception fair anymore? We fought it out. Tweet me, and tell me what you think. You've heard the segment. Tell me your response. Do you ever have too much money?</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, we're looking at Dow that's basically flat on the session so I wanted to show you Best Buy because some news is just crossing on that. They are announcing that they are going to cut 2,000 managers and you can see that investors there like that. It is trading up about 1.6 percent so far on the session.</p><p>All right, chew on this. Americans are literally throwing away more than $160 billion worth of food this year. That is nearly a third of the food that we buy. You may think you know what to eat and what to keep from the expiration dates, but we have got some very surprising stats that will help you keep your cash from going bad. It is time for your \"Medical Dollars with Dr. Manny.\"</p><p>So, this is a list of things that you can keep.</p><p>DR. MANNY ALVAREZ, FOX NEWS MEDICAL A-TEAM: And we're still overweight.</p><p>FRANCIS: After the ..</p><p>ALVAREZ: Right. $160 billion thrown in the garbage, and we're still overweight.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's because Oreo cookies never go bad. Fritos, never go bad. They last till nuclear war, you don't have to worry about it.</p><p>But we're talking about fresh healthy food, eggs. You can keep three to five weeks after the expiration date?</p><p>ALVAREZ: And that is correct.</p><p>FRANCIS: Are you kidding me?!</p><p>ALVAREZ: You can. Listen. If you go to any country, they - look, expiration dates have a purpose, of course, is to keep us safe, to make sure that things don't spoil, so you don't get an infection. But it is also to move merchandise around. I mean you've got a whole supply coming in.</p><p>FRANCIS: Say it isn't so?</p><p>ALVAREZ: It is so. I know my money. I used to have a deli. I know how these things works. So, a lot of it you really don't have to pay attention a lot to the expiration date.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really? So, eggs is not one that I would .</p><p>ALVAREZ: If they are properly kept in the refrigerator, three weeks.</p><p>FRANCIS: Sandwich meats?</p><p>ALVAREZ: Sandwich meats.</p><p>FRANCIS: You can ignore it?</p><p>ALVAREZ: Nowadays you could keep them before up to two weeks if you want to. And basically, if, especially if the packages, as a lot of these meats that come in vacuum sealed. And again you can keep them for, as long as they are properly refrigerated you can keep them for a long time.</p><p>FRANCIS: Bacon, two weeks, after if it is unopened, packaged dinners with the USDA seal. Hotdogs, two weeks after - now, hotdogs - have hotdogs in my fridge that are five years old. That is no good. I thought hotdogs last forever.</p><p>ALVAREZ: Are they frozen?</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean - aren't they full of preservatives and chemicals anyway?</p><p>ALVAREZ: Yeah, but I mean, look, like everything else. It is all about how they are packaged. It is all about how they're processed and it's all about how they're stored. I mean if you find products, for instance, in some grocery stores, there is a lot of light coming through the window you can rest assured that you are eating away nutrients.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. That's it's rotten before you even get out of the store.</p><p>ALVAREZ: Exactly. Yeah. If the temperature of the store is inappropriate. There is a lot of things that come into consideration. That is why these numbers come into play, you know, these expiration dates. But again, I don't know where they came from to begin with.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's true. There is a list of stuff that you should toss.</p><p>ALVAREZ: Absolutely.</p><p>FRANCIS: Infant formula. No, that's one - I always feel like that is a manipulation. Because with the infant formula, a lot of it - I mean it's not refrigerated. So .</p><p>ALVAREZ: It's not refrigerated, but it's about the nutrients. There is a lot of degradation when it comes from storage.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>ALVAREZ: And certainly, you don't want to keep that for a long time.</p><p>FRANCIS: We say meat here, but we were just talking about hotdogs and packaged goods.</p><p>ALVAREZ: But this is fresh meat.</p><p>FRANCIS: You're talking about like - steaks.</p><p>ALVAREZ: The chicken and all of that. Again, we know about .</p><p>FRANCIS: Lettuce and spinach. That is a dangerous one. And people don't realize it. Why is that one you should get rid of?</p><p>ALVAREZ: Well, because look how many cases of food poisoning we get from fresh spinach and lettuce.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>ALVAREZ: So again, as the lettuce oxidizes and everything is more embedded, there is more chances for bacteria to grow and that, of course, contaminates the food supply, and ergo you get sick.</p><p>FRANCIS: So the eggs. I'm going to keep them for five weeks. I'm going to eat them. And if get sick .</p><p>ALVAREZ: You call me.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm coming to find you.</p><p>ALVAREZ: No copay.</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm going to be furious!</p><p>ALVAREZ: That's OK.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, I will just eat Fritos instead.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRANCIS: Dr. Manny, thanks so much. Fritos are always safe.</p><p>All right. Quick shoutout to Netflix for this one, having a little fun in the drone zone. Playing off Amazon the announcement that drones can start delivering packages, Netflix is touting. It's touting cheek drone to home service. Saying your DVD can be delivered within seconds and adding it to your queue anywhere you are, anywhere. It's going to be amazing to watch for Amazon's response. I can't wait to see that one.</p><p>All right. Up next, the mega drought still causing pain in California. Now, a new study says it could last for centuries. This could have a long- term effect on industries out west with ripple effects from coast to coast.</p><p>And China's toxic smog is getting even worse. Some experts are drawing similarities to nuclear winter. Find out how one guy is fighting back. \"Piles of Money\" coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: So word out that IBM could start a major round of layoffs starting today. One analyst is expecting as many as 13,000 job cuts. Charles Payne follows IBM, and Charles, this is one of those stories, you know, I mean, I know part of it is coming from a union inside IBM of workers. There is also an analyst at Bernstein talking about it. Has that rumor feel to it. What do you make of this whole thing?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: I go to tell you, Melissa, any time we hear about jobs, particularly good jobs, you know, being lost, it's sort of one of these not just a Wall Street story but it's a Main Street story, and that's why it captures everybody's attention. And of course, we're talking Big Blue, IBM. But IBM has had some problems. And this is one of these rumors you can believe, because apparently this union is part of what they call the Systems and Technology Unit. Last report they put out for their last quarter that units of revenues down 26 percent and gross margin went to 38 percent from 44 percent in a year. Obviously there are serious issues there and IBM is probably going to address it this way.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. And you look at that the stock, I mean, it is trading higher on the day. I mean, obviously, investors looking for a change over there. But you know, interesting story to see how it really plays out.</p><p>Charles, thanks so much.</p><p>PAYNE: You got it.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right.</p><p>Over California now with the devastating mega drought is showing no signs of lighting up. This dramatic before and after picture really tells the tale, one scientist thinks the golden state might stay dry for the next two centuries, 200 years.</p><p>Joining me now on the phone is climatologist Lynn Ingram who says this phenomena may last 200 years. What makes you think that, Lynn?</p><p>LYNN INGRAM, CLIMATOLOGIST (via phone): Hi. Well, we study the past climate, you know, looking back thousands of years and we see these patterns of wet and dry. And we see in the past there were periods of over a century of less than maybe 50 to 60 percent precipitation and so we just kind of think these climate patterns repeat themselves, then we very well could be entering a dryer period.</p><p>FRANCIS: And a lot has to do with temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, right? And that it is cooler? Is there anything that could make a turnaround and get warmer again?</p><p>INGRAM: Well, it is, you know, it has got to do that itself. Unfortunately, it is just this big body of water that brings where we get all our moisture for precipitation. And so, we are kind at the mercy of the sort of ocean circulation and what sets up these patterns of cooler water off of our coast and. So, all we can do is wait and see if we are going to continue in this dryer period or if things turn around.</p><p>FRANCIS: And it is so interesting, because I grew up in California and it is a lot of farmers that are basically out there trying to farm in the desert and they set up this system, this complex aqueduct system to get water around places where there isn't usually water. Are they prepared for this? I mean, if we go in to the two hundred years, is it reasonable to think they can do something, you know, to keep farmers in place and keep people in place?</p><p>INGRAM: Right. Well, unfortunately, a lot of these dams and canals were built in the 20th century and that was a relatively wetter century. And so, I think some changes are going to have to be made because we really -- if we are entering an average dryer period, we really can't -- we are not going to have the water, resources that we had before. And also we have been depleting our granddaughter, and that is like water in the bank that we have been using up. And so, we really need to start banking water underground which people are talking about now to prepare.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is an important story for all our viewers because we all get so much food and produce and everything else out of California. So it impacts you whether you live in California or not.</p><p>Lynn, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate your insight.</p><p>INGRAM: Yes, you are very welcome.</p><p>FRANCIS: From the U.S. recorder of the globe money has been flying around world again today.</p><p>Starting in northern China where one guy is the first person to sue the government over the country's toxic smog. The fed up president is demanding compensation for the money he spent on safety masks, on an air purifier, an indoor treadmill, since outdoor exercise is no longer an option. Look at that. Would you exercise outside? Looking at these photos you see why he would feel this way. The first is Beijing on a normal clear day. Next to it is how the city looks right now. Look at that just two weeks later. That cannot be healthy.</p><p>Moving on to Switzerland, Credit Suisse acknowledging misconduct by a small group of employees that allows some wealthy American clients to stash away billions and un-tax assets. What's wrong with that? City investigators say the bank has been holding up to $12 billion in cash, it is all mine. And more than 22,000 accounts for those U.S. customers and the bank says it is ready to hand over more info on those clients. Chief executive Brady Dugan was on Capitol Hill today to face a grilling by the Senate subcommittee heading to the crow.</p><p>And landing in Brazil where sporting goods brand Adidas is withdrawing some of its world cup t-shirts for being too sexy. One shirt had the words looking to score, while another seemed to show the back of a bikini clad woman. Brazil's tourism board asked the company to drop the shirts thinking they promoted, quote, \"sexual tourism.\" Very cheeky, sexual tourism. It sounds interesting.</p><p>Up next, who needs the valley when you can head to silicon prairie? I like the sound to that. Find out how one entrepreneur left one of the most successful venture capital firms in the country to help create a tax haven in the Midwest.</p><p>At the end of the day it is all about \"Money.\"</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: I'm Cheryl Casone with your FOX Business brief.</p><p>U.S. Bank earnings jumped by 17 percent in the fourth quarter. The FDIC reports the banking industry earned $40.3 billion last quarter up from $30.4 billion the previous year. Losses on loans jumped to a seven year low. For all of 2013 banks earned a record $154.7 billion.</p><p>Hewlett Packard has won a $32 million cybersecurity contract from the department of homeland security. HP will provide software security to 33 federal civilian government agencies to prevent network vulnerabilities and defense against packers.</p><p>New homes sales surge in the month of January by 9.6 percent. That is the fastest pace in 5-1/2 years. According to the commerce department is single-family homes were sold in an annual rate of 468,000 beating analysts' expectations. Sales in the northeast soaring of more than 73 percent.</p><p>FRANCIS: Move over Silicon Valley, there's a new player in the fight for text tar nets (ph). The Midwest, one venture capital giant is moving away from sunny California and over to Columbus, Ohio. Silicon prairie. I like the name of that.</p><p>Joining me now is Drive capital's Mark Kvamme. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>You know, when I look the way the capital has distributed, a lot of places is cropping up -- Illinois, big money, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania, and Missouri. What is the attraction? Is there a lot of good labor?</p><p>MARK KVAMME, DRIVE CAPITAL: Well, I think is it not just labor. I mean, you got to remember, the over 25 percent of the United States research budget is spent in the Midwest with for fabulous universities like University of Michigan, OSU (ph), Carnegie-Mellon, and northwestern and many others that are minting phenomenal engineers. In the past, those engineers if they wanted to follow what they wanted to do, they had to go to Silicon Valley or go to Boston. What you're seeing now is capital in places like Chicago and Columbus and other places where they can stay and build their dreams.</p><p>FRANCIS: Are the governments more friendly? I mean, California is got pretty hostile in terms of visas and tax structure and property prices.</p><p>KVAMME: Yes. I mean, it is really crazy. I grew up in Silicon Valley and I lived there, you know, in the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and so on. And in fact, there was a report recently about how selling in Palo Alto, there were 1100 square feet with one car garage for its foundation was cracked, roof was leaking from a $1.6 million.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, stop it. You are making that up.</p><p>KVAMME: No. I am not making that up. And by the way, it was right next to the train tracks. I mean, it is crazy in California right now. Whereas, you know, for $1.6 million in the Midwest, you are going to buy a palace. But it really is not just about that. I mean, what has happened is we had a huge technology shift with the whole invention of cloud computing, you know, Amazon web services and rock space and others, you can actually be an engineer in Columbus, Ohio or Cincinnati or Chicago and not have to worry about the back end technology you had to do in the past to build facebook or Google or these other great companies in Silicon Valley.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. And a lot of companies out there are ones everybody knows, Group On, Angie's List, Orbits, Scrub Hub, Brain Trick (ph), Career Builder, I mean, one of the companies you are invested in, Farm Logs (ph), went to Silicon Valley and they came back to Michigan. How come?</p><p>KVAMME: Well, I mean, basically, (INAUDIBLE), who is the founder there grew up in Michigan, became a computer scientist, went to Silicon Valley because he thought that was where he had to go in the white culminated class, you know, PolyGram. The great incubator this after he got the idea for Farm Lobby, wait a second. All right, my customers are in the Midwest. Why would I be here? Why am I paying engineers as much money as that to pay I am here versus moving back to Michigan, where it is have to a third the cost? So, he moved back to Michigan so he could be close to his customers, close to the great engineering talent that is coming out of places like the Anniversary of Michigan.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes. And Mark, you know what you're talking about, I mean, coming from (INAUDIBLE) capital going over to create Drive Capital. Good luck to you. Thanks for coming on the show.</p><p>KVAMME: Well, thank you very much. I really appreciate it.</p><p>FRANCIS: The closing bell is just about an hour away. Lots going on in the last hour of trading always. Liz, what do you have coming up in your jammed-pack show?</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FBN HOST, COUNTDOWN TO THE CLOSING BELL: Let me just start of by saying, you rocket in this show. I tell you. Riveted, I almost came down late.</p><p>FRANCIS: We keep the pace going. We keep it going. We got a lot in there.</p><p>CLAMAN: And I'm totally with Dr. Manny about expirations dates because my dad was a doctor and he said they are just for the lawyers. Expiration dates are just for the layers.</p><p>FRANCIS: Hot dogs you can keep forever -- five, six, ten years. They are still good.</p><p>CLAMAN: Exactly.</p><p>OK, yes, I know that you know we got new home sales and they have done the complete opposite of what all the other housing numbers of done which have been down. They jumped more than nine percent. It is a big move and it makes you wonder who is really benefiting and we want to know who would benefit for you as far as the owning stock is concerned, we have Farooq Kathwari who is the CEO of Ethan Allen coming up. We going to talk to him about what kind of action he has seen when it comes to sales of Ethan Allen furniture. We are going to ask him what it hottest sellers are and what he sees for the future of the housing market. It is one of those so-called derivative plays. And as we look at what they can put into your home, it is the new home sales that tend to benefit the kinds of companies like Ethan Allen.</p><p>I also want to mention everybody is looking and waiting for JCPenney numbers \"after the bell\" today. Watch out. There is another store chain you need to be watching out for because it may really provide a much worse situation than JCPenney as we will talk about that and more coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: Liz, all right, looks fortunate. Thanks so much.</p><p>CLAMAN: Anytime.</p><p>FRANCIS: Go get ready. You only have a couple minutes left.</p><p>CLAMAN: I'm going.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, up next, with so many airline flights already cancelled this winter, we are going to tell you how to be sure the trip you book actually makes it out. Guess what. It is all about money. There's a formula to is this, you cannot afford to miss it. We will be right back.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. I want to show you JCPenney right now because this is the stock that is reporting \"after the bell.\" And you know, analysts are saying that any game here, which is relatively significant up on a percentage basis of almost three percent, is a dead cat bounce. We are looking for revenue to fall slightly year over year but earnings out \"after the bell\" and right now investors spending ahead of it.</p><p>Now for a little fun with spare change and hopefully this helps you from wasting when you book your next trip. The Cancellator, it is real, traveler beware, it might be targeting your next flight. Here to explain his travel expert Mark Murphy.</p><p>OK. So the Cancellator is an algorithm that the airlines use and they all use it and it helps them decide which flights to cancel.</p><p>MARK MURPHY, FOUNDER, TRAVELPULSE.COM: Absolutely. So, and it is just computer-based, just like the airplanes fly based on computers.</p><p>FRANCIS: It is not just weather and they are looking out for safety and we are going to get killed by a snowstorm, they cancelled our flight? It is more complex than that.</p><p>MURPHY: Well, there is a lot of things like crew changes. They are moving one crew from let's say Dallas-Fort Worth and they want to get them up to Chicago. So, they are going to make sure that that plane arrives with that crew is going connect with a flight, let's say to London Heathrow.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, they would have priority to let them get out before their storm closes? I mean, how did they get priority?</p><p>MURPHY: Well, just priority in terms of getting those crews to their next flight or if you're talking about a connection, let's say you are on the connection, if a lot of people on that connection are business travelers, high-yield travelers that are connecting on, that is going to get a priority over, let's say, a flight that will end at that destination with a bunch of leisure travelers which tend to book far in advance and hey much lower price than the average business traveler.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, let me get it straight. So there's a delay at the airport and they're trying to figure out which flights they are going to ground and which flight they are going to let get out.</p><p>MURPHY: Profit has a big --</p><p>FRANCIS: And there is an algorithm in there and it is not just who is waiting the longest.</p><p>MURPHY: Correct.</p><p>FRANCIS: There's nothing fair about this.</p><p>MURPHY: It is all about fare.</p><p>FRANCIS: It has to do with are there a lot of business travelers that pay a lot of money that flight goes first?</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. There is a lot of factor. This is about any one factor. It is not just the weather, it is not just mechanical delays, it is crews, profitability, it is connections.</p><p>FRANCIS: And it is how much people paid.</p><p>MURPHY: Of course. Yes, that factors in. It is not the only factor, but it is part of that.</p><p>FRANCIS: So now that I know about this how do I game it next time I am booking a flight, I pay more?</p><p>MURPHY: You really can't game it, to be frank, because it has so many factors of outside of your control. What you can do is you can be proactive and book with a travel agent. Travel agents book 50 percent of all tickets, 60 percent of all international --.</p><p>FRANCIS: Why does it help me if the travel agency?</p><p>MURPHY: So let's say you are flying and you are connecting in Dallas, but your flight got the late on the way to Dallas so you are going to miss your connection. The agent is aware of that delay. They are already rebooking you so by the time. So by the time you are on the ground --</p><p>FRANCIS: They are now out to lunch having some food?</p><p>MURPHY: No, mostly they will found out. A good one, no, they're actively working on your behalf.</p><p>FRANCIS: Avoid late in the day flights?</p><p>MURPHY: Yes. Because what happens is it goes later in the day, those issues stack up and then it becomes a domino effect and you may not get out. If you take that first flight out of the day, you are much -- have a much better likelihood --</p><p>FRANCIS: Can you game which flights there are more business travelers on like if it is a three class plane or if there is no connection? How do you try and figure out which one the big money guys are on?</p><p>MURPHY: Rush-hour. Rush hour to airport --</p><p>FRANCIS: What is that?</p><p>MURPHY: So, you know, 6:00 to 8:00 in the morning, business travelers on the way. 5:00 to 8:00 p.m. they are coming home. So look at those flights that are, you know, a little later in the morning or that very, very first flight in the morning.</p><p>FRANCIS: Mark, thank you. Very interesting. I knew there was more to it. It is always all about money.</p><p>All right, coming up, you heard it here on FOX Business. It was a scoop. (INAUDIBLE) CEO saying of the Bitcoin exchange is going nowhere. Is the crypto currency about to implode or is this just the inevitable rocky start to something fairly great? We are getting in to the bottom of it.</p><p>You can never have too much Bitcoin.</p><p>FRANCIS: Whether it is on Wall Street or Main Street, here is who is making money today.</p><p>Surprisingly anyone who owns Target, the sign or rich stock is popping despite the lackluster earnings report revealing falling sales and it hit to nothing income still, profit came in above estimates. That's enough to please investors. Shares now trading up about seven percent almost, on the day. Good for them. One person making money is the chief executive, Greg Stein. He owns about 1.5 million shares meaning he made about $5.5 million just so far today. Very nice.</p><p>Making money from our nation's spying initiative is Boeing. It is getting more than $2 billion to build another 16 long-range maritime spy planes for the Navy. The new spy aircraft will replace an aging fleet which has already been used for more than 40 years. They are based on a version of the 737 there used anti-submarine and anti-war care surveillance work. They are proving to be very popular. Eight have been ordered by the Australian government. Boeing stock right now is down around two-tenths of one percent.</p><p>Also making money the California -- did you hear about this? The California couple that may have stumbled upon one of the greatest treasure trove ever to be found in the U.S. The anonymous below was out walking their dog in the backyard when they stumbled on rusty metal cans. The inside, they discovered coins from gold rush era worth more than $10 million. Currency experts have confirmed the coins are authentic and the near mint condition. They plan to sell most of them on Amazon, of all things while others will be displayed in an upcoming exhibit. I bet they are going to have a lot of new friends. I'd like to be their new friend. Those are nice.</p><p>Turning to Bitcoin now, the virtual currency having a tough go of it lately. We just got word that Bitcoin derivatives market BTC suspended trading after a key exchange partner Mount Gox has gone dark. Of course, we know Mount Gox has been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors. FOX Business obtained chant logs from exchange CEO Mark Karpeles saying he in exchange are not they're not going anywhere despite the site being offline since yesterday. Is it time for the currency to be regulated?</p><p>Massachusetts bank commissioner David Cotney joins me on this one.</p><p>Commissioner, thanks for joining me. What do you make of these (INAUDIBLE)? With the CEO saying that they are not going anywhere. What do you read into that?</p><p>DAVID COTNEY, MASSACHUSETTS BANK COMMISSIONER: Well, I think in the wake of the shutdown on line of the Mount Gox exchange there are a lot of unanswered questions, both technical and legal and I think that we are all going to look forward to having some of those questions answered in the days ahead.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, in answering those questions, they obviously just received the subpoena we are talking about that from federal prosecutors. What does that mean? I mean, what are they looking for?</p><p>COTNEY: Well, I am sure they are looking for a chain of events to determine whether anything illegal, whether any fraud occurred because there are many people now who are asking, you know, where are their Bitcoin? Where is my money?</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you think needs to be done with Bitcoin? I mean, you think it needs more transparency? Do you think it needs more regulation? I mean, what is the answer in your mind?</p><p>COTNEY: Well, you know, when I talked to financial institutions, when I talk to consumers, when I talk to businesses, they all want a payment system that is more secure, more real time and less costly. And for the defenders of Bitcoin, they say that this answers many of those. And to that end, state regulators from around the country through the conference of state bank supervisors, we formed a task force to look at these emerging payment issues as well as some of the legacy payments to determine whether this should be further regulated and how they should be regulated. And to folks within the Bitcoin world, many of them even say that to the extent that this can become a more regulated type of transaction that will add to consumer confidence.</p><p>FRANCIS: But I guess, I mean, consumer confidence, the whole point of Bitcoin, what makes people feel confident about it is that they want the government out of their business. And inherent to that is a lot of risk and I feel like people who invest and transact in Bitcoin understand there is a risk and it is worth it to them because they don't want the government involve and snooping into what they're doing. What is wrong with that?</p><p>COTNEY: Well, there's nothing wrong or illegal per see of this Bitcoin network. But it is important for consumers to know that this is risky, this is not an FDIC insured type of deposit activity.</p><p>FRANCIS: But you don't think they know that? I mean, would that enough to satisfy if they said this is very risky. It is not backed. It is not insured. You know, the government is not guaranteeing anything that is going on here, buyer beware. Would that satisfy you if there was that disclosure for every transaction?</p><p>COTNEY: Well, and again, disclosure is probably one of the things that we will be looking at to determine what information do consumers need to make some type of informed decision? And if they feel a transaction that may not be backed by any type deposit insurance that may have less protection than that may be the way we go. But we just need to get further information on the best way to ensure that consumers have the information they need.</p><p>FRANCIS: Commissioner David Cotney, thanks so much for joining us. We appreciate your time.</p><p>COTNEY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>FRANCIS: That is all we have got for now. I hope that you are making money today. Tune in tomorrow for my interview with Florida governor Rick Scott. He is making Florida hotbed for startups bringing jobs to the state. That is tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.</p><p>Countdown though with Liz Claman starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONEY-2014022601cb230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BM7-3XV1-JB20-G060-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8027\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MONEY</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>February 26, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOG (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Limitations on Affiliate Marketing</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM0RDFFN0ZDQTk0NDk4N0E0NjNCRjQ1ODk3RkYyNjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzlFMDZCOUYxMjYyNDQ5MEE4OURFMUY4MENGQUI4NUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001242</classCode><className>OIL &amp;

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite hit record high after record high in late 2019. The stock market rally kicked into higher gear as the Fed switched to cutting rates and a China trade war truce took hold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stock market bulls are betting that business investment, corporate earnings and emerging market economies will now revive. The momentum for the stock market rally and Trump economy should carry through at least mid-2020. Then Wall Street will turn its focus to the outcome of the 2020 election\u00a0\u2014 with the risk of a major U-turn in tax and regulatory policy\u00a0\u2014 and reassess the chances of a new Fed rate-hike cycle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple and chips such as Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia are expected to continue to lead the stock market rally into the new year as a \"5G supercycle\" gets underway. Plus, the breadth of leadership is bullish for the stock market forecast for 2020.</p><p>Vertex Pharmaceuticals and other biotechs are leading a healthy medical sector. JPMorgan Chase and other bank stocks are depositing fat gains, while Mastercard and payment stocks look solid. Microsoft and Adobe are faring well as software stocks try to reclaim leadership. Even Caterpillar and many industrial and cyclical names are reviving. While the retail climate remains challenging, standouts from Alibaba to Target are thriving.</p><p>Join IBD experts as they analyze winning stocks on\u00a0\u00a0every morning. Take a free trial!</p><h>Stock Market Forecast 2020: Bad News Is Good News</h><p>In late 2018, recession fears grew as the China trade war escalated and the Federal Reserve continued to hike interest rates despite signs of slowing economic growth and a sharp stock market correction.</p><p>Fast forward to the end of 2019, and policymakers have reversed course, with a trio of Fed rate cuts and a generous dose of new asset purchases fueling stock market gains. Meanwhile Trump's China trade war has culminated in a phase-one China trade deal, avoiding tariffs on the Apple iPhone and turning this year's recession threat into next year's economic stimulus.</p><h>Is The Stock Market Forecast For 2020 A Repeat Of 2017?</h><p>Suddenly, the stock market rally is looking a lot like 2017. Back then, the prospect of Trump tax cuts and deregulation, helped along by a broad upturn in global growth, fueled a remarkably smooth stock market rally. The S&amp;P 500 index had very few days with gains or losses of 1% or more.</p><p>Since the stock market rally revived in early October, the major indexes have been in a strong, steady ascent, with only a modest post-Thanksgiving pause. While a tranquil bull may be hard to sustain for another 12 months, current conditions are positive for the\u00a02020 stock market forecast.</p><p>There is always the risk of the unexpected. Many Wall Street firms worry that lack of clarity about China trade deal terms leaves room for disappointment in the stock market forecast for 2020. Yet the big current risk for investors seems to be missing out on a potential stock market melt-up.</p><p>Is Wall Street too sanguine about the staying power of tame inflation, low interest rates and the economic expansion?\u00a0Peter Berezin, BCA Research chief global investment strategist, thinks so. He sees an inflation threat emerging that could derail the expansion by the end of 2021.</p><p>But, even if he's right, Berezin is bullish about the stock market forecast for 2020.</p><p>\"The second-to-last year of a business cycle expansion tends to generate outsized returns,\" he told clients on a Dec. 18 conference call. \"We may be entering this blowoff phase for global equities.\"</p><h>Stock Market Outlook: No Technical Red Flags</h><p>Wait a second: Are we potentially entering a blowoff stock market phase or have we been in one all year? With the Dow Jones up 22.3%, the S&amp;P 500 index 28.9% and the Nasdaq composite 35.2%, it's a fair question.</p><p>Yet, despite a decadelong secular bull market, technical analysis suggests that Wall Street hasn't yet gotten carried away.</p><p>One key metric tracked by IBD is the 5-year gain in the S&amp;P 500. While powerful rallies interspersed two significant market corrections over the past five years, stocks spent the bulk of the period marking time. Stocks essentially went nowhere from the end of 2014 until Trump's surprise election victory in November 2016.</p><p>Then, after the tax-cut-fueled rally peaked in late January 2018, the China trade war and Fed rate hikes kept the stock market rangebound. The S&amp;P 500 trudged another 21 months before decisively breaking above prior levels in October.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index is only up 57% over the past five years. That compares to an 89% gain at the 2007 peak and a whopping 210% at the 2000 peak.</p><h>Margin Debt Tame, Valuations Aren't Stretched</h><p>Margin debt can also signal when the stock market has become dangerously frothy. Year-over-year  in excess of 55% would raise a red flag. By comparison, the latest data shows margin debt down nearly 5%.</p><p>Valuations have gotten richer over the past year as the S&amp;P 500 surged while earnings flatlined.</p><p>S&amp;P 500 earnings per share are projected to rise 9.6% in 2020, as revenue grows 5.4%, according to FactSet Research. Year-ahead estimates generally prove a bit too bullish.</p><p>\"Stocks aren't cheap,\" said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. Yet above-average valuations make sense \"when investors don't see a recession in sight\" and low bond yields make equity returns look more attractive on a relative basis.</p><p>As of Dec. 27, the S&amp;P 500 traded at 18.2 times 12-month forward earnings. Yardeni said he'd be worried about a correction if the forward price-earnings ratio exceeds 20, which it hasn't done since early 2002.</p><p>That threshold could be in play, if the S&amp;P 500 melts up early in 2020 to his year-end 3500 target. Yardeni sees that as a possibility.</p><h>Will Fed Rate Cuts, Trade Deal Lead To Global Rebound?</h><p>The bull case for the stock market forecast for 2020 hinges on a moderate global economic rebound. That's not a given. Some economists doubt that Fed easing will pack much punch and fret that the phase-one China trade deal may do little to unwind tensions holding back business investment. But those doubts mean that all the good news may not be priced in: There's still a wall of worry for the stock market rally to climb.</p><p>Prospects for a global upturn look pretty good as numerous headwinds fade and tailwinds pick up. After a few years' divergence, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are working in concert. Central bank bond buying has helped push global equities markets higher. The U.S. dollar has eased off its recent perch, a positive for emerging market economies encumbered by dollar-denominated debt.</p><p>\"Our upside case for next year seems to be playing out,\" said Michael Crook, head of Americas investment strategy at UBS Global Wealth Management.</p><h>China Trade Deal Buoys Economic, Stock Market Outlook</h><p>UBS went overweight equities after the U.S. and China agreed to a trade deal, including a slight tariff reduction, on Dec. 13. The biggest impact of the phase-one China trade deal \"comes from removing the downside,\" Crook said.</p><p>While tariffs have caused disruption, the big fear has been that a full-fledged China trade war would morph into a , driving a wedge between the globe's biggest economies.</p><p>Instead, the global economy got a double-dose of relief this month. Not only is there a China trade deal with tariffs coming down, but the odds of a disruptive, no-deal Brexit have faded with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative party winning a majority.</p><h>Monetary Policy Is Global Tailwind</h><p>As those clouds part, the Jedi force of monetary policy may prevail once more, before its power is spent. Lower mortgage rates, tied to easier Fed policy, already have re-energized the U.S. housing sector. In November, building permits hit 1.4 million units at an annual rate, the highest since 2007. Homebuilder confidence is at a 20-year high. Treasury yields have risen in recent months, but are still historically low.</p><p>Globally, reduced uncertainty, easier credit and modest fiscal stimulus\u00a0\u2014 in Europe, China, South Korea and Japan\u00a0\u2014 should get traction.</p><p>The auto market, which has been in reverse, is a wild card. The transition to more exacting emissions standards, reduced government incentives and economic softness cut into global sales, with pronounced weakness in Europe and China. But European sales have turned positive off a depressed base. Chinese sales are expected to follow suit in 2020.</p><p>The recent news that Boeing will suspend 737 Max production is expected to cut up to a half-point from U.S. GDP growth in the first quarter, depending on how long it lasts. But that temporary lull could keep pressure on the dollar, providing more fuel for emerging markets.</p><h>2020 Election Risk: Will Wall Street Fear Trump Loss?</h><p>Fed easing and the China trade deal have lit a fire under financial markets and put a spring in the U.S. economy's step.</p><p>U.S. growth should remain solid up through the 2020 election, with the unemployment rate holding near a 50-year low. While a strong economy and stock market rally won't assure President Trump of reelection, it will make him hard to beat.  in the latest IBD/TIPP Poll. That exception is Joe Biden, and even there Trump is closing the gap.</p><p>That means there's no immediate reason for Wall Street firms to begin pricing in a Trump loss\u00a0\u2014 or loss of GOP Senate control \u2014 in the 2020 election.</p><p>That's probably good news for the stock market forecast for 2020 \u2014 even though the Dow Jones has fared well under Democratic presidents. Why?\u00a0Democratic candidates in the 2020 election cycle \u2014 including front-runner Biden \u2014 all want to substantially reverse Trump's big corporate tax cut, which slashed effective tax rates for S&amp;P 500 companies by roughly one-third.</p><p>It's hard to argue that a direct hit to earnings is anything other than a clear negative for share prices.</p><p>Several candidates seek to raise tax revenue far above Obama levels, with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both calling for a wealth tax.</p><h>2020 Democrats Have Big Policy Agenda</h><p>Sanders\u00a0and Warren also have called for a ban on fracking. While most fracking is on private land, exacting regulation could blow up energy prices and depress big swathes of the U.S.</p><p>The two left-wing contenders also endorse \"Medicare for All.\" More traditional liberal candidates favor a public option, but the  would have a dramatic impact on providers, insurers and millions of jobs.</p><p>Warren has called for breaking up Big Tech giants such as Facebook. Even without control of the Senate, a Democratic president could enact big policy changes on antitrust and a wide range of other corporate issues via regulation and enforcement.</p><p>Democrats also generally support drug price controls that could roil Big Pharma and biotechs.</p><p>There still could be a white-knuckle period for investors and corporate CEOs if the White House and Senate 2020 election contests look like a coin flip. But it probably won't happen at least until the party conventions next summer.</p><p>In the meantime, the strong economy \u2014 and rising Trump support \u2014 could convince Democratic primary voters to shy away from more left-wing candidates, whose economic prescriptions and control of the regulatory state could be more disruptive for business.</p><h>The Outlook For Inflation, Interest Rates And Fed Policy</h><p>The Fed will be on hold, at least through the 2020 election. Yet interest rates are still a wild card. Depending on the path of inflation and unemployment, investors could begin to price in Fed rate hikes for 2021.</p><p>If growth solidifies, longer-term market rates will rise on expectations for future Fed hikes and higher inflation.</p><p>After all, 12 of 17 policymakers penciled in a Fed rate hike for 2021 in their December projections.</p><p>Yet another dovish turn isn't out of the question. Trump still could influence policy with appointments to two open Fed governor seats. Meanwhile Chairman Jerome Powell will oversee an updated strategy for achieving the Fed's 2% inflation target. The midyear update could explicitly encourage inflation overshoots to offset long periods of sub-2% inflation.</p><p>Bottom line: Inflation and upward pressure on interest rates could be a story for the second half of the year, but don't count on it.</p><h>Stock Market Outlook 2020: Which Sectors, Regions Will Thrive?</h><p>At the moment, there's not much to fear except that stocks will get ahead of themselves. How can individual investors participate? IBD outlines a . That starts with a check of the , which is flashing a green light: Confirmed uptrend. Step 2 is using  to identify top stocks to buy and watch. Step 3 involves using  to help winnow out the wheat from the chaff and  to identify proper buy points so you're ready to seize opportunities.</p><p>A broad-based upturn in global growth would lift almost all boats, including the unloved energy, mining and heavy equipment sectors. There are some promising signs, with copper and oil prices both near their highest levels since May. Southern Copper and Caterpillar stock are both near buy points.</p><p>BCA's Berezin thinks emerging markets are poised to reverse some of their long underperformance, as global uncertainty abates, China applies fiscal and credit stimulus, and manufacturing recovers. A softer dollar, also key to his outlook, would give an extra lift to profits earned in foreign currencies.</p><h>The 5G Supercycle: Apple Stock To Nvidia To Verizon</h><p>A key catalyst in 2020 and beyond will be the launch of . Their dramatically faster speeds, greater capacity and near-instant connections are seen as key to autonomous driving and other transformative applications.\u00a0Verizon Communications, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile US and Sprint have begun deploying 5G networks. China, South Korea and Japan are among the early adopters. But those are expensive upgrades.</p><p>So the money, and the stock market gains, may be in the 5G hardware. Apple stock and the broader chip sector have surged in 2019 on expectations for a 5G wireless upgrade cycle, even as many of these names had stagnant or tumbling earnings in recent quarters.</p><p>Apple iPhones released next fall should be 5G ready. On Dec. 23, Wedbush hiked its Apple stock price target, saying iPhone demand should surge 10% as a huge upgrade cycle gets underway.</p><p>Chipmakers with 5G exposure include AMD stock and Nvidia stock to Apple iPhone suppliers such as\u00a0Qualcomm, Qorvo and Skyworks Solutions.</p><p>Just as Nvidia stock and others tend to rally ahead of demand, they can peak before earnings deteriorate. But the 5G upgrade cycle could last for years.</p><h>Medicals Are In Good Health</h><p>The vast, varied medical sector is thriving. With \"Medicare for All\" fears fading, health insurers, hospitals and other medical service firms are rallying after tumbling for much of 2019. With drug-price controls off the table, FDA approvals accelerating and , biotech stocks are soaring after lagging for years.\u00a0Vertex stock,\u00a0Crispr Therapeutics and\u00a0Amgen are faring well, while a slew of smaller names have skyrocketed on positive drug news.</p><p>Medical product and devices makers also doing well, including Dexcom and Edwards Lifesciences.</p><h>Bank Stocks Ride Yield Curve Wave</h><p>Financial stocks have already \"had a good run since the yield curve flipped,\" but remain relatively cheap, Yardeni said.</p><p>Banking giants have been long-term laggards vs. the S&amp;P 500 index. But JPMorgan Chase stock and peers are enjoying a run amid\u00a0an easy Fed, firming economic growth and widening Treasury yield spreads. With the Fed anchoring short-term rates, net interest margins will benefit as long-term rates keep rising.</p><h>Payment Stocks</h><p>Payment stocks are quietly improving, with Mastercard stock breaking out and archrival\u00a0Visa back in a buy zone.\u00a0Fiserv is just out of range, while\u00a0Global Payments is in a buy zone.</p><p>All of these payment stocks look strong. None look like screamers now, but several have been huge long-term leaders, notably Mastercard stock, Visa and Fiserv.</p><h>Retail: Thrive Or Die</h><p>With unemployment at a 50-year low and decent economic growth going forward, wage and job growth should continue to fuel solid consumer spending. But the spoils won't be shared equally.\u00a0Department stores and mall-based chains continue to reel and even mass-disruptor Amazon.com faces some challenges.</p><p>But there are notable pockets of strength. Target stock has soared as the big-box discounter delivers accelerating growth from a hybrid model of physical and online sales. So have Walmart, Best Buy and Costco Wholesale to varying degrees. Off-price discounters like Burlington Stores and salvage vehicle auctioneer Copart remain steady growers, while Lululemon Athletica and RH are thriving among upscale customers. ChipotleMexican Grill is among a handful of tasty restaurant stocks.</p><p>Broadening out to consumer discretionary, Nike is benefiting from solid U.S. and Chinese demand.</p><p>Speaking of China, Alibaba stock is surging, while several other China internets are looking better.</p><h>Communications Sector</h><p>The revamped S&amp;P 500 communications services sector includes Google-parent Alphabet, Facebook, Disney and Netflix, in addition to old staples Verizon and AT&amp;T.</p><p>FactSet Research says the communications services sector is forecast to lead all 11 S&amp;P sectors in 2020 with 9.1% revenue growth, vs. 5.4% for the entire S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Despite antitrust concerns in the 2020 election cycle, Google stock is at record highs and . Disney stock is just below a buy point while Netflix stock is lagging.</p><h>Can Software Bounce Back?</h><p>If business investment improves, that would be good news for software. The sector was the clear leader to start 2019 but faltered and is struggling to catch up.</p><p>Microsoft stock has a been a steady leader throughout 2019. But that largely reflects the Dow tech giant's booming cloud-computing services. Adobe stock and a few other software names such as Paylocity and Fortinet are marching higher. Shopify stock is almost back to new highs, which would be notable. Shopify, an e-commerce software giant, is one of the clear stock market winners of 2019.</p><h>Stock Market Forecast 2020: No Crystal Ball</h><p>When it comes to the 2020 stock market forecast, investors can interpret, but don't try to predict. Right now, the action of the major indexes and leading stocks are favorable for the stock market outlook. So are economic conditions, with Fed policy, China trade and other big uncertainties receding into the background.</p><p>But the 2020 election could quickly alter stock market forecasts, especially if a left-wing candidate wins the Democratic nomination and appears headed for victory in November. A revived or new trade war or some surprise economic news or financial crisis could upend the 2020 market outlook.</p><p>The best way to interpret any developments is to analyze the .

President Donald Trump testing positive for the coronavirus may only be the first of multiple October surprises for Wall Street.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors riding the historic stock market rally from the coronavirus crash bottom on March 23 to record highs in early September pushed a few concerns to the background. The unraveling U.S.-China trade detente. Looming antitrust action against FANG stock stalwarts Alphabet and Facebook. A possible fall <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/tag/coronavirus/\">coronavirus</url> wave. A lapse in fiscal stimulus. A potential Democratic sweep in Election 2020 that promises big tax hikes for corporate profits and investment gains. A drawn-out vote-counting process that jolts stocks like the 2000 hanging-chad election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, all those worries may come to the fore in a matter of weeks. Expect more stock market turbulence.</p><p>\"Uncertainty has rarely been higher for financial markets,\" Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson wrote this week. He sees the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 at risk of falling to their 200-day moving averages before the next stage of the bull market resumes.</p><h>Hopeful Signs In Stock Market Forecast</h><p>Yet the stock market outlook isn't all grim. Three big stabilizing forces should prevent a prolonged slump. Steadying confidence that a coronavirus vaccine is within reach. A government spending tailwind \u2014 once fiscal policy gets through a preelection air pocket. Federal Reserve asset purchases also should provide support, especially with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/economy/federal-reserve-qe-firepower-long-term-treasuries-dow-jones-fed-meeting-sept-2020/\">policymakers committed to stimulate above-2% inflation</url> for an extended period.</p><p>Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, anticipates volatility until the 2020 election winner is clear. But going forward, he has a sunnier stock market forecast.</p><p>\"Once we get resolution, the outlook for stocks will remain positive,\" he told IBD. \"You still have negative real interest rates. That's going to support asset prices and valuations. And we are going to get another massive fiscal policy package under either candidate.\"</p><p>Those factors help explain why Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, is keeping an upbeat market outlook, regardless of who wins the high-stakes election. His stock market forecast sees the S&amp;P 500 rising to 3500 by year-end and 3800 by the end of 2021.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/market-trend/ibds-etf-market-strategy/ibds-etf-market-strategy/\">IBD's ETF Market Timing Strategy</url></p><h>Stock Market Outlook And Election 2020</h><p>\"The stock market is likely to do better if the election delivers two more years of gridlock no matter who wins the White House,\" Yardeni wrote this week.</p><p>A Democratic sweep that ushers in \"radical regime change and a shift to the left will have consequences\" for stock prices, he told IBD.</p><p>Yet \"the policies are going to be (highly) stimulative, rather than policies that cause a recession,\" Yardeni said.</p><p>Meanwhile, revved-up fiscal policy will put the onus on the Federal Reserve to keep up its asset purchases to hold down long-term rates, Yardeni says.</p><p>\"We've crossed into the Twilight Zone of Modern Monetary Theory,\" which holds that deficits don't matter \u2014 unless and until inflation gets uncomfortably high.</p><p>He expects Fed efforts to hold the 10-year Treasury yield at 1% or lower in the near term. The Fed's suppression of long-term rates will be bullish for the stock market forecast. The policy will make safe Treasury returns pale by comparison and raise the discounted value of long-term earnings growth.</p><p>Still, the immediate stock market reaction to a Joe Biden presidency and Democratic Congress might be to sell.</p><h>Biden Tax Hikes On Profits, Capital Gains</h><p>Joe Biden has proposed hiking the long-term capital gains tax rate to 39.6% from 23.8% for million-dollar earners. Expect a flurry of selling of profitable positions. Tax selling happened before far more modest cap-gains tax hikes took effect in 1987 and 2012.</p><p>Overall, Biden's proposed tax hikes amount to $4 trillion over a decade, according to the Tax Policy Center. The plan includes hiking the statutory corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%; doubling the tax on profits of foreign subsidiaries to 21%; and establishing a 15% corporate minimum tax aimed at companies, like Amazon.com, whose tax breaks largely erase tax liability.</p><p>Goldman Sachs has estimated that the proposals, if implemented, could knock 12%, or $20 per share, off 2021 S&amp;P 500 earnings. Yet other Biden proposals to increase federal spending would provide somewhat of an offsetting boost.</p><p>A Biden presidency might be good news for hospitals and health insurers by broadening Affordable Care Act subsidies and resolving the latest constitutional challenge.</p><h>Election 2020 Stock Winners, Losers</h><p>Managed care providers and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/tag/biotech-and-pharma-stock-news/\">drugmakers</url> could be pressured by Biden's proposed Medicare public option and prescription price curbs. However, expanded insurance coverage and a likely increase in coronavirus testing bodes well for biotech and health care equipment stocks, says State Street's Arone. He also sees clean energy and infrastructure as winners in a Biden presidency, boosted by more government support.</p><p>Notably, hospitals, managed care and solar stocks were key winners on the market's Sept. 30 follow-through day, just after the first presidential debate.</p><p>A Trump victory would give a lift to fossil fuel energy stocks, defense companies and financials.</p><p>Hightower Advisors figures the initial difference between a status-quo election and a Democratic sweep would be a range of 5%-10% for the stock market. A Donald Trump reelection would spark a stock market rally of up to 5%, while a Biden victory and Democratic control of Congress could trigger up to a 5% sell-off.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://shop.investors.com/offer/splashresponsive.aspx?id=IBD-Live&amp;intcode=invstcntnartcls%7Ccms%7Cibdlive%7C2020%7C07%7Cibdlive%7Cna%7C%7C727112&amp;src=A00433A\">Join IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the stock market rally on IBD Live.</url></p><h>Senate Control Influences Stock Market Forecast</h><p>If Biden wins, the stock market will take its cue from the outcome of the Senate battle. Currently, the RealClearPolitics polling average shows Democrats picking up four seats, which would give Biden a 51-49 majority. The most positive stock market outlook scenario might be a net Democratic pickup of two seats. That would still leave Biden one short of a majority needed to push through big tax hikes and progressive reforms. Yet independent-minded Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski would probably deprive the GOP of a majority committed to fiscal conservatism.</p><p>Biden appears to have an edge, though his lead narrowed in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/joe-biden-lead-over-donald-trump-narrows-after-presidential-debate-ibd-tipp-poll/\">latest IBD/TIPP Poll</url>. If the presidential race tightens considerably, Wall Street will be on guard for a nail-biter finish, with possible recounts and a court fight.</p><p>Trump's coronavirus diagnosis is sure to disrupt the final month of the campaign. He's set to be in quarantine for the next several days, canceling campaign events.</p><p>The 2000 postelection legal fight went on for five weeks and saw the S&amp;P 500 fall as much 9.6%. That drop, however, probably overstates the impact on stock market psychology. At the time, Wall Street was in the early stages of the 2000-2002 bear market after the dot-com bubble.</p><h>Election 2020 Disputes</h><p>In 2020, though, a legal fight over a disputed Trump vs. Biden election might boil over from the courtroom into the streets. Tensions already are running high over mail-in voting, a hasty Supreme Court nomination and police-related deaths of black Americans, exacerbated by Covid-19 and high unemployment.</p><p>Even without legal maneuverings, the 2020 election winner may not be clear for days. That's because many states won't begin counting an unprecedented number of mail-in votes until Election Day.</p><p>Yet there's still a chance of a quick decision. Florida and North Carolina, two Trump states in 2016, will both get a jump on mail-in ballots well ahead of Nov. 3. If Biden holds a clear lead in either state after election night, it would likely be game over for Trump.</p><p>Whatever the final verdict, it should set the stage for the next leg of the bull market. Yet the gauntlet of world-changing and economy-shaping developments between now and then may lead to a stock-market advance that is less rapid and more volatile than in the recent coronavirus rally.</p><h>Stock Market Forecast In Post-Coronavirus World</h><p>Vladimir Putin's Aug. 11 announcement that Russia approved a coronavirus vaccine was pilloried by the scientific community. Yet Wall Street may have offered a preview of how the stock market may react to a credible breakthrough. The Nasdaq's 1.8% slide led the market lower as the S&amp;P 500 pulled back a more moderate 0.8%. The take-away: A return to normalcy may not be great news for tech stocks.</p><p>The tech sector, utilities and health care were the only industries to see positive earnings growth in Q2, as overall S&amp;P 500 earnings dived 32%, wrote LPL Financial chief equity strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder.</p><p>\"In a year, we may not be setting up as many home offices or buying so many devices for kids to learn remotely,\" Buchbinder wrote. \"If this causes earnings momentum in the sector to fade, technology stocks could be used as a source of funds to move into cyclical value stocks that have lagged.\"</p><p>\"Prepare to pivot from the 'Pandemic trade' to the 'Reopening trade,' \" BCA Research advised clients in a Sept. 29 strategy outlook. \"Vaccine optimism should pave the way for cyclicals to outperform defensives, international stocks to outperform their U.S. peers, and for value to outperform growth.\"</p><p>The next big date for Covid vaccine progress is expected in late October, when Pfizer says it will have results for its pivotal Phase III trial. Moderna data is expected in November. AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine data could soon follow.</p><p>Will all that news set up tech stocks for further selling? Possibly, but the recent Nasdaq correction already has reversed some excess bullishness. Buchbinder wrote on Sept. 28 that he saw the 13% pullback as a buying opportunity for long-term growth tied to cloud computing and e-commerce. Meanwhile, the mid-October release of the iPhone 12, the first Apple 5G iPhone, and the Q3 tech earnings parade may serve as catalysts for a tech-stock rally.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/how-to-research-growth-stocks/\">Why This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks</url></p><h>Antitrust Action Vs.

The Justice Department is reportedly close to suing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/google-stock-buy-now/\">Google</url> for anticompetitive behavior tied to its dominant search position.

Yet there could be nearer-term consequences. For example, the FTC could simultaneously seek an injunction to block the strategic integration of Facebook with Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><h>U.S.-China Cold War</h><p>The re-escalation of U.S.-China economic tensions is another wild card. Until now, the growing conflict over trade and technology has always seemed to stop just short of a red line that imperils U.S. multinationals in the world's second-largest economy. Yet the crossfire is growing more dangerous. Recently, Beijing made official its long-threatened \"unreliable entity list,\" targeting companies whose compliance with U.S. trade restrictions harms Chinese businesses.</p><p>China has yet to reveal the firms that will be placed on its naughty list or the consequences they'll face. Yet Beijing may be getting closer to pulling the trigger as President Trump takes aim at TikTok, WeChat and other Chinese businesses. It's not yet clear whether the Trump administration's new step restricting technology exports to SMIC, China's biggest chipmaker, will lead Beijing to cross that red line.</p><p>U.S.-China relations would likely be rocky under a second Trump term. But Biden also has taken a fairly hard line vs. Beijing during the 2020 election cycle.</p><p>The 21st century superpowers have been moving toward a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/us-china-trade-war-donald-trump/\">new technology cold war</url> for some time. A major economic decoupling would have massive ramifications for global supply chains and economic growth. That could have an outsized impact on the broad stock market and tech giants in particular.</p><p>Wall Street and Silicon Valley are far more exposed to international trade and China than the U.S. economy. But any such decoupling would likely happen over years.</p><h>Coronavirus Cases Vs. Vaccine</h><p>A fall coronavirus wave that coincides with flu season is yet another potential pitfall. So far, national U.S. trends are looking mildly concerning. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/coronavirus-update-coronavirus-map-us-covid-19-death-hospital-testing-trends/\">daily average Covid-19 tally</url> of 42,550 cases over the week through Thursday topped the prior week's average by 7%, while daily tests rose just 1%.</p><p>While the number of hospitalized Covid patients ticked up 3% last week, that's still down by well more than half since late July. Yet North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and some neighboring states are seeing a surge in cases. Many of those states have relatively small populations, but the danger zone could be spreading.</p><p>If Congress fails to renew fiscal stimulus before lawmakers head home for campaign season, a fall coronavirus wave could further dampen growth. Still, Covid-19 vaccine optimism should limit any stock market fallout from a broad worsening of the pandemic.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/research/industry-snapshot/coronavirus-vaccine-supply-race-tests-nations-biotechs/\">'Every Nation For Itself' In The Coronavirus Vaccine Supply Race</url></p><h>Stock Market Forecast Includes Proactive Fed</h><p>The Federal Reserve's Nov. 4-5 meeting \u2014 right after Election Day \u2014 could provide more downside protection for the stock market outlook. Softer data could prompt the Fed to step up asset purchases or at least take a half-step, shifting those purchases to the long end of the Treasury yield curve.</p><p>The 2020 election outcome \u2014 or perhaps even a tense nonresolution \u2014 might help dictate Fed policy moves. Goldman Sachs expects that a Democratic sweep would send the 10-year Treasury yield surging by 30-40 basis points, \"largely reflecting the possibility of substantially higher spending.\"</p><p>If a new fiscal push coincides with positive coronavirus vaccine news, the 10-year Treasury yield could vault well past the 0.50%-0.96% range that has prevailed since March 23. Such a rise, coming as Wall Street comes to terms with a likelihood of significantly higher taxes and heavier-handed regulation, could knock stocks for a loop.</p><p>The Fed probably won't tolerate a big rise in the 10-year Treasury yield, pushing up rates on 30-year mortgages and auto loans. Taking policymakers' foot off the gas at a time of near-8% unemployment would cast doubt on their new commitment to boost inflation to around 2.5% in coming years. Yet Wall Street can only guess if, when, where and how the Fed will draw the line.</p><p>State Street's Arone says \"an awful lot would have to go right\" before the Fed has to worry about capping long-term Treasurys. Fed officials have shown little enthusiasm for expanding on their hefty $120 billion in monthly asset purchases, he notes.</p><h>Fed Policy Raises Long-Term Question</h><p>If Fed policy is to match the Fed's new rhetoric, it could mean a cap on long-term Treasury yields, greater purchases of long-term government bonds, or a combination of the two. If the Fed takes such action in the year's last two meetings, the impact on financial markets could be dramatic.</p><p>All that monetary fuel, and the likely fiscal expansion after elections, would sink the U.S. dollar, boost the price of gold, silver and copper and power the stock market beyond fall turbulence. How will the Fed eventually wean the economy off <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/economy/low-interest-rates-be-careful-treasury-yields-fed-rate-cuts/\">ultralow interest rates</url> when the federal government is expected to produce $2 trillion deficits as far as the eye can see? That will wait for another day.</p><p>YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/president-trump-hospitalized-coronavirus-stock-market-rally-dow-jones-futures/\">Trump Hospitalized With Virus; The Prognosis For Stocks</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/product/marketsmith/?artProdLink=MarketSmith\">Catch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSmith</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/research/ibd-stock-of-the-day/\">IBD Stock Of The Day: See How To Find, Track And Buy The Best Stocks</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/research/fb-stock-buy-now-facebook-stock/\">Is Facebook A Good Buy Now?</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/ibdtipp-americas-most-accurate-pollster/\">IBD/TIPP: America's Most-Accurate Pollster</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-6305031</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6104-0X61-JCBB-K00T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2661\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

But Boeing and\u00a0Tesla were notable losers, while FANG stocks\u00a0Amazon.com and Facebook struggled after earnings.</p><h>Stocks Hit Record Highs</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite hit record highs amid an earnings blitz, rising 1.7% and 2.3%, respectively, for the week. A number of top stocks breaking out into buy zones. The Dow Jones edged up 0.1% as Boeing and Caterpillar were drags. Google, Chipotle, Texas Instruments and Twitter were big earnings winners, while Tesla tumbled. FANG stocks\u00a0Amazon.com and Facebook undercut buy points, though the latter closed above its entry. Software and defense earnings were strong. Chip stocks had several winners but also some losers.</p><h>Google Soars On Blowout Earnings, Buyback</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google-parent\u00a0Alphabet reported Q2 adjusted EPS rose 21% to $14.21 while revenue grew 19% to $38.94 billion, beating views for EPS of $11.30 and sales of $38.16 billion. Google also announced a $25 billion stock buyback. Google said traffic acquisition costs, or what it pays to partner websites, rose less than expected. TAC rose 13% to $7.24 billion. Shares jumped Friday.</p><h>Facebook Cautions; Twitter, Snap User Growth Boom</h><p>Facebook reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings views, but sees slowing revenue growth. Earlier, the company detailed its $5 billion privacy settlement with the FTC, which is imposing new restrictions on the social media giant. Facebook stock initially rose on earnings, but reversed lower to test a buy point. Twitter soared into a buy zone Friday on revenue, and user growth beat estimates. Snapchat-owner Snap reported a smaller-than-expected loss and strong revenue and user growth. Snap stock skyrocketed to a new 52-week high.</p><h>Amazon Earnings Miss</h><p>Amazon earnings rose 3%, the smallest gain in seven quarters and well below views. Revenue climbed\u00a020% to $63.4 billion, slightly topping. Amazon Web Services revenue jumped 37% to $8.38 billion but was slightly behind estimates. Shares fell 1.6% Friday, dipping below a recent buy point.</p><h>Tesla Loss Soars On Weak Sales, Margins</h><p>Tesla lost $1.12 a share vs. views for a 40-cent loss. Revenue jumped 59% to $6.35 billion, below estimates of $6.4 billion. Gross margins were weaker than expected amid record production and Model 3 sedans sold at a relatively high price point. Capital spending and R&amp;D outlays fell yet again, despite current and future projects. Shares plunged nearly 14% Thursday.</p><h>DOJ Begins Big Tech Antitrust Probe</h><p>The Justice Department confirmed it is reviewing Big Tech firms to see if they are stifling competition in online platforms. It's a new level of regulatory oversight for Facebook, Amazon.com, Google parent Alphabet and Apple. Meanwhile, the FTC is probing Facebook after finalizing a $5 billion privacy settlement with the social network. Investors took the DOJ antitrust review in stride.</p><h>Q2 Chip Earnings Are Mixed</h><p>Texas Instruments and chip gear maker\u00a0Teradyne became the latest chip companies with upbeat results and guidance, raising hopes for a late 2019 industry recovery. But other semiconductors, including Xilinx and STMicroelectronics had less-than-stellar results. Intel reported better-than-expected earnings. Also, Apple agreed to buy Intel's smartphone modem business for about $1 billion, giving the iPhone maker the ability to design its own wireless chips. But Intel shares erased early Friday gains, closing down 1.1%.</p><h>Boeing Dives On Messy Q2, 737 Max Issues</h><p>Boeing warned that it could temporarily shut down production of its 737 Max jet if it doesn't return to service early in early Q4. CEO Dennis Muilenburg assured investors that an issue regarding a computer chip on the troubled jet is just a software problem. But the FAA is concerned the solution will require a hardware fix. Boeing reported a massive Q2 loss, with an after-tax charge of $4.9 billion. But Wall Street analysts excluded charges related to the 737 Max grounding and instead calculated an adjusted profit that beat estimates. Boeing told the Air Force that it would not compete for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) contract \"under the current acquisition approach\" over concerns about the contract's fairness. Shares plunged below key support levels.</p><h>Defense Stocks</h><p>Lockheed Martin said EPS climbed 16% to $5, beating views for $4.74, as revenue increased 7.7% to $14.43 billion, above views for $14.16 billion. Lockheed raised its 2019 EPS guidance but warned that the new outlook excludes \"U.S. Government actions related to Turkey,\" which will be ousted from the F-35 program. F-35 supplier Hexcel topped Q2 earnings and revenue forecasts and raised its dividend and full-year profit guidance. Northrop Grumman EPS rose to $5.06 as revenue grew 19% to $8.46 billion, beating analyst estimates.

Shares of the Elon Musk-led company have gained more than 250% this year, pushing the electric vehicle maker's market value to $286 billion.

The firm raised its price target on the stock to $575 from $485. \"Beyond a pull-forward of net additions from consumers being stuck at home will be the combined structural benefits from 1) greater scale and all the operational and financial benefits that brings, 2) an acceleration in engagement growth even in its most mature markets, and 3) pressure on its primary competition for audience time - incumbent TV broadcasters around the world,\" analyst Benjamin Swinburne said. The company will report second-quarter earnings on Thursday after the bell. Shares of the company are down 5% this week. \u2014 Michael Bloom  Bank of America expects fundamentals to drive Apple stock higher  Bank of American raised its price target on Apple to $410 from $390 on Wednesday morning and said it sees the stock continue on its upward trajectory. \"While near term data points are getting  more constructive, we also think positioning has a significant role in the near term price  action,\"analyst Wamsi Mohan said. \"We think that investors are viewing AAPL as (1) a liquid investment to weather an uncertain environment, (2) a tech \"story\" stock with a catalyst of 5G, (3) a large cap tech name relatively less exposed to the regulatory risks (including recent EU tax related litigation win), (4) a beneficiary of passive inflows, and (5) an alternative to low rates,\" he said. Apple stock is up 3% this week.\u2014 Michael Bloom  Travel stocks soaring after vaccine news  Investors bought travel stocks on Wednesday morning amid renewed optimism for a Covid-19 vaccine.

Piper Sandler analysts was also encouraged by the data and raised its price target to $134 per share from $100. The firm said in a note that \"based on an assumed price of $75, we could see ~$18 billion in ... revenues\" from the vaccine. \u2014 Jesse Pound  Goldman moving higher after earnings beat  Shares of Goldman Sachs rose 4% after strong trading results fueled a better-than-expected second quarter. The bank earned $6.26 a share in the second quarter on revenue of $13.3 billion, which was 41% more than a year ago and Goldman's second-highest quarterly revenue on record.

Upbeat earnings results and a raised guidance by Teradyne and Texas Instruments confirm that the global slowdown in microchip demand won't be there as long as apprehended. Chip stocks scaled north and touched record highs amid trade war fears. At the same time, investors shrugged of regulatory concerns over Big Tech. </p><p>The Dow Jones, however, failed to keep up and posted moderate losses after Boeing and Caterpillar announced discouraging earnings results.The S...00 closed at an all-time high of 3,019.56, after gaining 0.5% on Jul 24. The Nasdaq Composite followed suit, recording a new high of 8,321.50, having banked 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) disappointed, shedding 0.3%to close at 27,269.97. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 2% to close at 12.36. Lastly, advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.08-to-1 ratio.Chip Stocks Rally on Strong Sectoral Earnings So FarJul 24 was a great day for chip-related stocks. Semiconductor companies noted record highs in their stock prices after Texas Instruments Inc.TXN[1] and Teradyne Inc.TER[2] announced their second-quarter earnings. In fact, The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) climbed 3.1% to reach 1,622.02, registering a fresh high since April 24.Texas Instruments reported Q2 earnings of $1.36 per share, which significantly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21.The chip maker's revenues of $3.668 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.605 billion as well. The company's advancement in product portfolio across its Analog and Embedded Processing segments, capable manufacturing strategies and efficient capital allocation in key areas remain leading factors in its growth.Teradyne's Q2 earnings of 66 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents as well. The company generated $564 million in revenues which easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $538 million. Teradyne's impressive revenues were boosted by growing demand for the System Test business. In addition, rise in 5G infrastructure, networking and memory test spending also pushed revenues higher in the second quarter.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[3].Antitrust Probes into Big TechLate on Jul 23, the Justice Department revealed that its antitrust wing was reviewing if the country's largest technology firms (all FAANGs except Netflix) were participating in anticompetitive practices. Both Republicans and Democrats support the antitrust review.The news, however, did not dampen investor spirit during Wednesday's trading session, as they felt hopeful of a positive outcome from next week's U.S.-China trade talks.Disappointing Q2 Earnings for Boeing and CaterpillarLastly, Dow' lackluster performance on Jul 24 is largely the outcome of The Boeing CompanyBA[4] and Caterpillar Inc.'s CAT[5] quarterly earnings, which failed to meet analyst expectations.While Boeing's earnings of $2.92 per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85, its revenues of $15.75 billion for Q2 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.40%. The company's underperformance in the second quarter is largely due to a drop in its commercial airplanes deliveries and the grounding of its 737 Max aircrafts after two fatal crashes.Caterpillar disappointed in both earnings and revenues. Its earnings per share of $2.83 fell behind the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.12. Secondly, Caterpillar's revenues for Q2, reported at $14.4 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.5 billion as well. The heavy machinery manufacturer suffered losses because of rise in material costs (that comprised of tariffs) and a decline in Chinese demand.Both Boeing and Caterpillar carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Economic DataNew home sales in the United States climbed in June, making the first move up in three months. On Jul 24, the Commerce Department noted that new home sales rebounded 7% in June to an annual rate of 646,000 units (seasonally adjusted).Stocks That Made HeadlinesEquifax Beats Q2 Earnings Estimates, Cuts '19 EPS View[6]Equifax Inc.EFX[7] reported solid second-quarter 2019 results, wherein the company's earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Amazon.com touted a successful Amazon Prime Day, but shares pulled back. Facebook Libra faced critics on Capitol Hill.</p><h>Stock Market Holds Near Highs</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The stock market\u00a0pulled back from record highs on some weak earnings reports and China trade concerns. The major indexes rebounded on Fed officials hinting at bigger rate cuts, but policymakers walked back those remarks. Earnings from Microsoft, some chipmakers and others also helped. Ultimately, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite fell more than 1%, their worst weekly losses since late May. The Dow slid 0.6%.</p><h>Netflix Dives On Big Subscriber Miss</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The internet TV network added 2.7 million streaming subscribers in the June quarter, vs. its target for 5 million. In the U.S., it lost 126,000 subscribers when it expected to add 300,000. Netflix blamed recent price hikes and a lighter content release slate for the miss. It earned 60 cents a share, down 29%, on sales of $4.92 billion, up 26%, both beating. Netflix shares plunged nearly 16% for the week.</p><h>Microsoft Shows Cloud Strength</h><p>Microsoft earnings rose 21% as fiscal Q4 revenue grew 12% to $33.72 billion. Cloud-related revenue rocketed 39% to $11 billion, helped by Azure infrastructure services and Office 365 software.

Boeing will book an after-tax charge of $4.9 billion in Q2 due to estimated 737 Max. Boeing stock rallied Friday.</p><h>Amazon Prime Day</h><p>Amazon said it sold more than 175 million items during this year's Prime Day shopping event, more than its sales for the past Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.

Kansas City Southern reported better-than-expected earnings, lifting shares.</p><h>Bank Earnings See Margin Squeeze</h><p>Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase trimmed their full-year forecasts for net-interest income, as the prospect of interest-rate cuts from the Fed, along with lower Treasury yields, tempered banks' outlooks. Tame trading and falling rates hit Citigroup results.

The potential concern is that Big Tech companies buy startups to nip competition in the bud, before it can bloom. The\u00a0giant fishing expedition could produce investigative leads or tighten scrutiny of small deals in the future. That might complicate a key venture-capital exit channel.</p><p>The Big Techs pared gains or reversed lower Tuesday but generally rose for the week.</p><h>Nvidia Crushes Q4 Targets</h><p>The graphics chipmaker reported a 136% EPS gain while sales jumped 41% to $3.11 billion, both easily beating.

Roku earnings have turned to losses as the company invests heavily in international expansion and its advertising-based video-on-demand business model.

Revenue surged 75.5% to $156.45 million, marking the third straight quarter of accelerating growth. Both easily beat views. The database software maker gave somewhat mixed guidance. But shares soared.</p><h>Cadence Edges Q4 Views</h><p>Chip design software maker Cadence Design Systems edged analyst estimates for the fourth quarter but disappointed with its first-quarter earnings outlook. The company earned an adjusted 54 cents a share, up 4%, on sales of $600 million, up 5%, in the December quarter. Wall Street expected EPS of 53 cents on sales of $595 million.

Analysts were looking for 57 cents in EPS on $609 million in sales.</p><h>Cybersecurity Software</h><p>CyberArk earnings rose 9% while Q4 revenue climbed 19% to $129.7 million, both beating. But CyberArk guided low on Q1 EPS and sales and for full-year EPS.\u00a0Rapid7 reported a Q4 profit, defying views for a loss, while revenue grew 33% to $91.7 million. But its outlook for annual recurring revenue disappointed.\u00a0Mimecast reported fiscal Q3 profit up 56% while revenue climbed 26% to $110.2 million, both modestly beating. Revenue guidance for the upcoming fiscal 2021 was in line. Qualys said Q4 EPS rose 25%, topping estimates, while revenue climbed 14% to $84.7 million, meeting expectations. For the March quarter, Qualys guided EPS targets up and revenue in line.</p><p>CyberArk stock, Rapid7 and Mimecast sold off, while Qualys rose modestly for the week.</p><h>Dexcom Earnings Double</h><p>Dexcom handily beat fourth-quarter expectations with adjusted profit surging 105% as sales leapt 37% to $462.8 million. The continuous blood sugar monitoring device maker blasted higher on Friday. Insulet and Tandem Diabetes also rose Friday and were solid winners for the week.</p><p/><h>Fed Rate Cut Odds Rise</h><p>Despite the risk that China's coronavirus outbreak could take a turn for the worse and slow U.S. economic growth, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Congress this week that it would take a \"sharp tightening\" in financial conditions\u00a0\u2014 meaning lower stock prices and a widening of credit spreads \u2014 or clear evidence of an economic toll to provoke a rate cut. Still, financial markets see nearly 60% odds of a Fed rate cut as early as July. Those odds rose slightly after Friday's retail sales report came in a bit spotty. The data matched forecasts of a 0.3% rise, both overall and excluding autos. But core sales were flat, after a downwardly revised 0.3% gain in December.</p><h>Cisco Earnings</h><p>Cisco Systems reported that fiscal Q2 adjusted earnings rose 5% as revenue fell 4% to $12 billion, both topping.

The off-price retailer said earnings per share likely came in at $3.21-$3.23, with sales up 10.5%. Burlington also boosted its same-store sales outlook. Off-price rivals Ross Stores and TJX also rose.</p><h>Generac Stock Powers To High</h><p>Generac unexpectedly reported a modest earnings gain in Q4. Wildfires and power shut-offs due to other natural disasters have been stoking demand for the generator maker's products. Analysts believe the firm has solid prospects for ongoing revenue upside. Shares jumped to a new high, though most of the week's gains came on news that Generac will be added to the S&amp;P 400.</p><h>Global Payments Earnings Growth Accelerate</h><p>The payments firm reported 22% EPS growth, the second straight quarter of accelerating growth.

Meanwhile, Euronet Worldwide plunged after serving up mixed earnings and delivering poor guidance.</p><h>Coronavirus Forces Hotel Closures</h><p>Hotel giant Hilton Worldwide said the coronavirus outbreak in China had forced it to close around 150 hotels there, and it tempered growth expectations as the health crisis spreads to other nations and halts business and travel.

Sales growth slowed to 10%. The electronic bond trading site rose for the week, flirting with a buy point.</p><p>XPO Logistics reported that EPS jumped 42%, beating views, while revenue dipped 6% to $4.14 billion, a miss.

Complete coverage tonight of the runup and the jobs report that triggered it.  Plus, a view from the buy side.  My guest, mutual fund manager Frank Cappiello.  And a mammoth defense deal shatters the pre-holiday calm on the street.  Lockheed Martin swallowing Northrop Grumman in an $11- billion buyout.  And fireworks sales are heating up ahead of the 4th.  We'll take a closer look at this $400-million not-always-legal business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANNOUNCER (voice-over): Live from the financial capital of the world, New York City, this is MONEYLINE WITH LOU DOBBS.  Sitting in tonight, Jan Hopkins.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HOPKINS: Good evening.  Fireworks on Wall Street today as the stock market soared to new records in a shortened pre-Independence Day session.  A weaker-than-expected jobs report sending stocks and bonds into the stratosphere.  The Dow Industrials tonight flirting with 7,900, rallying 100 points to 7,895.81, its 29th record of the year.  For the week, the Dow is up 208 points.  Today's blue-chip gains led by American Express as lower interest boosted financial shares.  Proctor &amp; Gamble up 2-3/8.  General Electric up more than $1.75.  AlliedSignal climbed nearly $1.50.  And IBM added 1-3/8.</p><p>Most big tech names gained, helping the NASDAQ post its 19th record this year. after a gain of 12 points.  The bond market also had a stellar pre-holiday session.  Thirty-year issue gaining 1-1/8 points.  The yield dropping to 6.61 percent.  That is a four-and-a- half-month low.</p><p>Investor euphoria triggered this morning by the release of the June jobs report offering solid evidence of slowing growth.  Unemployment rose slightly, job creation slowed, and wages stayed in check.  Bill Dorman is in Washington tonight with more on the report that sparked the buying binge -- Bill?</p><p>BILL DORMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Jan, June's unemployment report is the government's first statistical look at how the economy did last month and, so far, economists and the markets are excited about the outlook for the summer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DORMAN (voice-over): June's unemployment rate came as a mild surprise.  The jobless rate moved up .02 percent to 5 percent.  The Labor Department says 217,000 non-farm jobs were created last month, pretty much in line with expectations for new jobs.</p><p>DAVID BLITZER, DEUTSCHE MORGAN GRENFELL: It's generally speaking a healthy number.  It's a bit better than last month.  It's probably a little bit below the average of the last several months, but, in general, if we create 200,000 jobs every months, this economy will be in great shape over the long haul.</p><p>DORMAN (voice-over): Markets remain focused on inflation prospects over the long haul.  Bonds soared on the news, the Treasury's 30-year bond jumping more than 1 point.  Stocks also welcomed the figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average pushing ahead to new highs.  A key indicator of inflation prospects, wage growth, inched up 4 cents an hour in June.</p><p>ALEXIS HERMAN, LABOR SECRETARY: We've had the modest growth in wages, and we are seeing that employers are adding jobs to their payrolls, which is really continuing to keep the economy growing at a very steady and stable place.</p><p>DORMAN (voice-over): Most economists expect to see more evidence that the economy slowed gently during the second quarter, after roaring ahead by nearly 6 percent in the first three months of the year.  Expectations now are in the range of 1-1/2- to 2-percent growth in the second quarter.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>And that should be just fine with the Federal Reserve Board, which just decided to leave short-term interest rates right where they are.  The Fed's next round of decision-making on interest rates is in August -- Jan?</p><p>HOPKINS: And, Bill, there will be a lot more checks in the economy between now and that meeting in August, right?</p><p>DORMAN: It's true.  You have everything from the GDP figures in the second quarter to inflationary figures such as -- consumer spending's going to get a close look, also, of course, consumer prices and producer prices as well.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks, Bill Dorman in Washington.  And another mega merger today in the rapidly consolidating defense industry.  What used to be five industry giants will soon just be one company.  Lockheed Martin buying Northrop Grumman.  Total value of the deal $11 Billion in stock and debt.  Wall Street loved the deal, pushing Northrop's shares up 24 percent.  Fred Katayama has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Northrop's stock flew faster and higher than its B-2 bombers as investors welcomed Lockheed Martin's $11.6-billion buy out.  Northrop rocketed more than $21, and Lockheed fell more than $4.  U.S. cutbacks in defense spending after the fall of communism spurred the merger.</p><p>NORMAN AUGUSTINE, CEO, LOCKHEED MARTIN: We really had a choice then of either trying to keep 10 or 12 weak companies in the market or</p><p>consolidate, combine, and have two or three very strong companies that could compete in the world market.  We were encouraged by our government to do the latter.</p><p>KATAYAMA (voice-over): Lockheed will marry its strength in satellites and aircraft, like the F-22 fighter, with Northrop's know- how in surveillance systems.  Combined, the companies will boast sales of $37 billion, producing the biggest U.S. defense contractor.  Lockheed is paying a hefty premium for Northrop, but analysts say $1 billion in yearly cost savings will make the deal worthwhile.  This will leave the U.S. defense industry with just two other big guns, Raytheon and BoeingMcDonnell Douglas.</p><p>ROGER THRELFALL AEROSPACE ANALYST, J.P. MORGAN: We believe this is actually the end of the big guns, and we're getting the government saying, \"OK.  We like it.  We like the cost savings, but let's just make sure we haven't gone too far.\"</p><p>KATAYAMA (voice-over): Two years ago, Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta, itself the result of a merger.  Last year, Lockheed Martin merged with Lowell's (ph) defense unit.  Northrop Grumman brought Westinghouse's defense business last year.  Northrop brought Grumman in '94.</p><p>(on camera): Analysts predict the Federal Trade Commission will approve the merger since the same regulators just approved Boeing's buy out of McDonnell Douglas.  Fred Katayama, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOPKINS: The tobacco industry today agreeing to pay Mississippi $3.6 billion, guaranteeing the state its share of a proposed nationwide settlement, even if it isn't approved by Congress.  State Attorney General Michael Moore said the industry will immediately pay the state $170 million and continue making payments every year to cover healthcare costs caused by smoking.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL MOORE, MISSISSIPPI ATTORNEY GENERAL: Today, Mississippi has shown this nation and shown the rest of the world that the tobacco industry will and should be held accountable for the tremendous damage they've done in this country and across this world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOPKINS: Checking tobacco stocks, Philip Morris up 1-3/8, RJR Nabisco up 1/8, Loews gained more $2, and UST added 1/4.  The year- long breakfast cereal price war is over, and consumers will be the losers.  General Mills today raising prices 2.6 percent.  A box of Cheerios, Wheaties, and Lucky Charms will cost up to 10 cents more now.  It's the first time that General Mills has raised prices in four years.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN McMILLIN, FOOD ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL SECURITIES: They've missed earnings for the last two years.  I think they're trying to fund some of the promotional efforts, and maybe it does reflect the fact that lower prices alone do not help stimulate cereal demand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOPKINS: Plenty of demand for General Mills stock.  It gained almost $2.50 today.  Other cereal companies were fortified by the move.  Kellogg jumped 4.  Quaker Oats added more than 75 cents.</p><p>Up next, more on today's record gains on Wall Street.  My guest likens the stock market to a happy household, with Papa Bull, Mama Bull, and Baby Bull all content, but what are the chances of a change to the three bears?  I'll ask fund manager Frank Cappiello right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: Hong Kong stocks taking a surprise dive in the first day of trading after the hand-over to China.  The Hang Sang Index down almost 1 percent.  Analysts were expecting the Chinese government would see to an auspicious start by pressuring brokers to buy, but key property stocks were slammed after Hong Kong's new leadership promised to put a lid on real-estate speculation.</p><p>Back in the U.S., gold prices today plunked to a 12-year low on news that the Australian Central Bank is selling part of its gold reserves.  The price of gold has been dropping for the past year and a half, pushed downward by low inflation and a strong dollar.  At the New York Commodities Exchange, gold for August delivery fell $7.10 an ounce to $325.20 an ounce.</p><p>On Wall Street, July 4th fireworks started earlier as stocks and bonds soared on the June jobs report.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rocketed 100 points to a new all-time high of 7,895.81, and volume on this pre-holiday session, which closed at 1:00, 374 million shares.  Advancing issues beat out decliners by a 5-to-2 margin.  New York Stock Exchange Composite Index closed at a record, up about 6 points.  The S&amp;P 500 also closing at a record, up about 13 points.  The Dow Transportation Index gained about 10 points, also closing at a record.  Dow Utilities up almost 2 points.  The NASDAQ Composite closing at a new record, up 12 points.  The American Stock Exchange Index also closing at a record, up more than 4 points.</p><p>Today's rally brings the value of U.S. stocks to $9-1/2 trillion, and it leaves the Dow just 104 points shy of 8,000.  My guest tonight has predicted 8,000 on the Dow by year's end.  Frank Cappiello manages $1-1/2 billion.  He's president of McCullough, Andrews &amp; Cappiello, and he joins us from Washington tonight.  Frank, welcome back to MONEYLINE.</p><p>FRANK CAPPIELLO, PRESIDENT, McCULLOUGH, ANDREWS &amp; CAPPIELLO: Thank you, Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: Are you surprised that we're this close to 8,000 at this point in the year?</p><p>CAPPIELLO: Yeah.  I thought it would take much longer.  So this is a happy surprise, but, you know, everything is in sync.  This is an amazing economy that's reflecting an amazing stock market.  You have low inflation, low interest rates, rising corporate profits and capital gains.  The capital-gains tax is now a sure thing, and this means that 36 percent earned on earned income -- tax on earned income now switches down to 20 percent for investment returns, and that's going to really be an incentive to invest from here on in.</p><p>HOPKINS: When we actually get an agreement, is it possible, though, that with this capital-gains tax cut that stocks could fall initially?</p><p>CAPPIELLO: Yes.  I anticipate you'd get an early, you know, flushing out of people that are anxious to get out, but I don't think it's going to be as much as the gurus anticipate.  I think the incentive here is the difference between the 36 tax on earned -- 36- percent tax on earned income and, of course, the 20 percent on capital gains.  That's a huge difference.</p><p>HOPKINS: Let's look forward.  We're only halfway through the year.  We're already almost at your year's goal.  Have you changed the goal for the year?</p><p>CAPPIELLO: Yeah.  You know, probably I'd be nudged up to 8,500.  This is a market that is probably going to be the greatest big market of the big stock markets in this century.  It's going to rival the U.S. market of the '20s and the great Japanese market of the '80s.  We're setting in place here one of the great stock markets probably of all time for quite a long time.  When it ends, of course, it's probably going to end ugly, but there's no sign it's going to end anytime soon.</p><p>HOPKINS: And it -- this can continue for a while, in your view.</p><p>CAPPIELLO: Absolutely.  It's going to take a great shock to knock this market or derail this market and, of course, you don't see these surprises, but it's very unlikely, looking at any foreign possibility, any political possibility.  Maybe a fallout from Whitewater would correct the market but not send it down to a bear market.</p><p>HOPKINS: I guess a surprise would stay a surprise, but what things are you looking at that could kind of shock things?</p><p>CAPPIELLO: Well, of course, interest rates -- I mean, the Fed -- everyone thinks the Fed is in control of rates, but, actually, you can have the stock market reflecting over time a rise in interest rates, either through the Japanese refusing to buy any more of our bonds or the dollar plunging in which case we'd have to raise rates to protect the dollar.  There are all sorts of things that could raise rates without the Fed intervention, but, here again, that's very unlikely, Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: So what should investors do in the meantime -- enjoy it, jump in, what?</p><p>CAPPIELLO: Well, if they're invested, they should enjoy it.  If they're not invested, there are a lot of very attractive stocks that still haven't run with the pack.  This has been a -- what we call a ready-to-run market where most of the mutual fund managers have been getting in the big stocks, but they're really ready to run because they can get out of these stocks in a hurry.  The smaller stocks that are growing faster -- small caps are still very attractive.</p><p>HOPKINS: You have been saying that small caps would catch up.  They really haven't yet.</p><p>CAPPIELLO: No.  No.</p><p>HOPKINS: You think that's still to come?</p><p>CAPPIELLO: Yes, I do, and there are a couple of attractive ones in retailing.  For example, a company by the name of Paul Harris is an attractive small stock.  There are some mid cap stocks, mid cap banks, like U.S. Bank Corp. that are still reasonably priced.  You know, this market is only overpriced in the big Dow super blue chips.</p><p>HOPKINS: Your funds have actually underperformed the market.  The growth fund up about 12 percent for the year, and the market up almost twice that.  Have you been in some of those small caps that haven't caught up yet?</p><p>CAPPIELLO: Yes. , both the emerging growth and the growth fund have had a heavy layer of small caps.  They haven't worked.  And we've also been very successful in technology in the past year, but, this year, the technology stocks have been so volatile, it's very, very difficult to get a long run, but, here again, I think these are the stocks that, if you're patient, are going to make money for us.</p><p>HOPKINS: Thanks very much, Frank Cappiello, the president of McCullough, Andrews &amp; Cappiello.  Thanks for joining us from Washington.</p><p>CAPPIELLO: Thank you, Jan.</p><p>HOPKINS: And coming up, an update on our special MONEYLINE report, Hazardous Harvest.  We'll tell you how one state senator is addressing the controversial practice of retreating sewage sludge and using it as fertilizer.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: Tonight's MONEYLINE movers, Inso plunging nearly $9.75.  That's 46 percent of its value.  The software maker warning second- quarter profits will be at least 66 percent less than Wall Street expected.</p><p>Duty Free International climbing 3-5/8.  London-based BAA buying the retailer for $674 million.</p><p>LSI Logic gaining 2-1/8.  Several Wall Street analysts saying rumors the company is losing a significant amount of business to Toshiba are simply untrue.</p><p>Wyle Electronics jumping $6.50.  German conglomerate Vaba (ph) buying the semiconductor distributor for $810 million.</p><p>MCI Communications tacking on 2-3/8.  MCI's new partner, British Telecom, getting a tax break from the British government.  British Telecom's ADRs adding more than $5.50.</p><p>In other corporate news, Ford Motor reporting June vehicle sales rose 4.7 percent.  Increased incentive programs driving the better- than-expected results.  GM and Chrysler reported declines in sales earlier this week.  Ford shares gaining 1/8.</p><p>Western Resources up $1.  The security firm withdrawing its takeover bid for ADT allowing Tyco International to complete its merger with ADT.</p><p>Hormel, the maker of Spam luncheon meat, taking a stand against the other kind of Spam, junk E-mail, asking bulk E-mail giant, Cyberpromotions, to stop using the trademark Spam.  The request was denied.</p><p>A follow-up on our special report last week, Hazardous Harvest.  We told you about the growing controversy over the government policy of recycling sewage sludge as fertilizer for farm crops.  Today, here in New York, a state senator called for special state legislation that will require warning labels on any food products grown with sludge fertilizer.  The proposal from Democratic State Senator David Paterson.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID PATERSON, MEMBER, NEW YORK STATE SENATE: The reason for this is that we want consumers to know exactly and totally any information about the products that we use.  The farm fertilizers, obviously, are involved in the growing of produce, fruits and vegetables, and also dairy products that come from animals that were raised on farms that have these potentially toxic substances in the sludge.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOPKINS: One footnote to that proposal: Similar legislation has been proposed in Congress, but the EPA has already rejected a citizen's petition calling for special labels on food grown with sludge fertilizer.</p><p>The Supreme Court just wrapped up one of its busiest sessions ever, including several landmark decisions that will affect businesses and the way of life in America.  MONEYLINE Contributing Editor James Q. Wilson has reached his own verdict on which of the rulings was most significant.  That's tonight's MONEYLINE focus.</p><p>JAMES Q. WILSON, CNN CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: The Supreme Court session that just ended made some significant and, on the whole, laudatory decisions.  It unanimously denied President Clinton's claim that he could avoid his civil suit, and it rejected the argument that</p><p>the Constitution can be read as banning doctor-assisted suicide.  The Internet has a lot of salacious material on it, but the Court unanimously agreed that its view of freedom of the press does not allow Congress to ban anything in cyberspace that Congress calls vaguely indecent material.</p><p>The most striking decision, however, was the 5-to-4 ruling that the federal government could not order local law-enforcement officers to do background checks on people who wanted to buy guns.  The 10th Amendment to the Constitution says that the powers not delegated to the United States are reserved to the states or to the people.  A while ago, the Court said that the feds could not ban gun sales near schools because such sales, not being part of interstate commerce, were only subject to state control, and the Court has also held that Washington cannot require a state to adopt a certain regulatory policy.</p><p>All of this may have pleased people who would like to see federal power weakened and states' rights expanded, but I doubt this will happen.  Congress can easily reach almost any state activity if it gives the states a choice: Accept our federal grant and the rules that go with it or reject our money.  Not many states will turn down what they regard as free money.  Most important, however, though people say they like states' rights, they also strongly support federal programs, whatever their effects on states.  The Court like Congress will eventually have to accept that.  This is James Q.  Wilson.</p><p>HOPKINS: Up next, we'll take a look at the fireworks business, both legal and otherwise.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HOPKINS: Fireworks are a $400-million-a-year business, and that's just the legal sales.  Despite bans in many states, the fireworks business is -- you guessed it -- booming.  Bill Tucker has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BILL TUCKER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The number of bangs, booms, and bottle rockets has doubled since 1990.  Well over 290 million pounds of fireworks will be set off this year.  That's nearly half a pound of fireworks blown off for every man, woman, and child in the United States.  Most of them will be set off over the next couple of days to celebrate America's Independence Day.  Ironically, except for sparklers, fireworks are banned in 10 of the original 13 colonies.</p><p>New York State has launched one of the toughest crack downs on fireworks.  Busts like this one last month in Long Island net millions of dollars worth of illegal fireworks.</p><p>THOMAS VON ESSEN, FIRE COMMISSIONER, NEW YORK CITY: The first year we started this program, we collected 5,000 cases; the second year 10,000; this year 26,000.  So I know it's become harder for the people to get them if they still want them.</p><p>TUCKER (voice-over): Perhaps nowhere is the evidence of a crack down on illegal fireworks more evident than here in New York City's Chinatown where once fireworks could be had for the asking and now are nowhere to be found.  Public safety is behind the bans.  Fires and explosions such as this one shown in the New York Fire Department demonstration video make the 4th of July its busiest day of the year.

Trading is over on this Friday, August 24th.  Tonight, stock  markets set some summertime records as Jay Powell promises the economy  won't overheat.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Donald Trump's money man gets immunity in the latest White House legal  drama, and it might be the most expensive super car in history.  I'll the  ask President of Bugatti about the new five million euro Divo.  I'm  Stephanie Sy, this is \"Quest Means Business.\"  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Good evening.  Tonight, this is good news.  Those were the words of  US Fed  Chairman Jerome Powell who says the US economy is doing great and inflation  is in check.  In short, Powell says his policy of interest rate rises at  the Fed is working despite any criticism from President Donald Trump.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> His comments sent markets flirting with a return to the record-setting  ways.  Let's take a look at the way the three indices ended today.  The Dow  up 140 points, and you can see new records set by the S&amp;P 500 as well as  the NASDAQ.  That brings our 2018 records here up.  The NASDAQ setting 26  records this year and the S&amp;P now at 15.  </p><p> Earlier at the New York Stock Exchange, trader Tim Anderson told \"Quest  Express\" that Jerome Powell's words are a breath of fresh air for  investors.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> TIM ANDERSON, TRADER, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  I think that clearly his  comments are reassuring for the market and I also think there's this  underlying tone of his delivery not being a PhD economist.  It's almost  like a breath of fresh air.  He's very understandable for a lot of people  to listen to him, you don't have to be a Fed watcher to understand what  he's saying.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SY:  It was clearly an upbeat appearance from the Fed Chairman at Jackson  Hole, Mr. Powell dismissed fears that the US economy is out of control  saying there is no sign of it overheating.  He did not address the  criticism he's received from President Trump over rate hikes; instead, he  insisted the Central Bank will stay on course for future rises.  Powell  also played down fears of rising inflation saying the Fed will do whatever  it takes to keep it in check.  Paul La Monica joins me now.  </p><p> Whatever it takes, that sounds actually like familiar verbiage.  Let's  start with the new records we saw.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ again beating  records.  How long will the party last and what drove that sentiment today?  </p><p> PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, I think today, Stephanie, you  already talked about Jerome Powell's speech and I think that really did it.   He showed the market once again that he's confident about the US economy,  but the Fed has to try and keep inflation in check as well that's why  they're are going to be probably a couple more rate hikes this year, maybe  a few in 2019 as well and the market is okay with that.  </p><p> So even though the President has been attacking the Fed and criticizing  rate hikes, it's not something that Powell is going to change Fed policy  just because President Trump has been making noise about how rate hikes  might be bad news because the market clearly disagrees with the President.  </p><p> SY:  Now, earlier this week, we did hear Jerome Powell sort of nod at the  fact that trade tensions continue with Trump's aggressive trade policy  stance, that that could have future impacts on inflation as well as growth  and yet the markets really seemed to be shrugging that part of story off  and we did not hear a lot of mention about that again today.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  No, in the Fed minutes, you're right.  But the Fed did  acknowledge some members that trade concerns are an issue.  I think right  now, what we're still having is that while some companies have noted that  tariffs and trade issues are starting to hurt earnings, a lot of companies  said it's still just talk, that businesses are mentioning trade issues as a  concern, but it's not hurting the overall profit picture of the economy  just yet.  </p><p> And I the same thing is happening with consumers because Stephanie,  consumer spending has been great.  Retailers have reported for the most  part really strong results.  We're talking about brick and mortar retailers  also, not just Amazon.  </p><p> SY:  Yes, and the Targets of the world are saying this is among the best  consumer environments they've ever seen.  Again, I go back to the question  of how long this will last and why it's important even for Powell to  continue the gradual rate hikes in an environment where inflation doesn't  seem to be really going up at this point.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, inflation isn't going up all that much just yet, but it's  the type of thing that if you let it go unchecked, all of a sudden, you  have rampant inflation and rates would have to go a lot higher than what  the Fed would probably like.  </p><p> [16:05:08]  </p><p> LA MONICA:  I think they're happy and the market clearly is as well, which  is a couple of quarter-point hikes every few meetings.  That's something  that's manageable.  With regards to how much longer this rally can last, if  consumers keep spending, corporations keep spending, profit should still be  pretty good.  The dollar weakened today as well which should help multi- national companies going forward if that continues to go down.  </p><p> So I'm not going to say that this bull run goes on obviously forever.  It  has to peak at some point, but earnings are still justifying this rally it  appears.  </p><p> SY:  Yes, and I think it's interesting that you bring up basically the  notion of pre-emption being important with the gradual rate hikes.  Paul La  Monica, thank you very much.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p> SY:  Later on in the program, I'm going to be speaking to Alan Blinder who  was Vice Chairman of the Fed under Alan Greenspan.  He'll be joining us  from Jackson Hole in just a few minutes.  </p><p> Two top White House officials are quietly lobbying against Donald Trump's  tariffs now that the trade war is threatening a company in their home  state.  Martin Savidge has more from Winnsboro, South Carolina.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The tariffs have been  incredible and ...  </p><p> MARTIN SAVIDGE, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Even as they work for a President who  has proclaimed tariffs are the greatest, CNN has learned from two members  of the South Carolina congressional delegation, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley  and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney have been pushing for a tariff exemption  for a company in their home state.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  We are winning on trade.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  President Trump says he wants to level the trade playing field by  imposing tariffs on as much as $200 billion more imported Chinese products  and parts.  Corporate leaders have been telling Washington how much those  tariffs will hurt business and the economy.  </p><p> But behind the scenes, Mulvaney and Ambassador Haley are advocating for a  small South Carolina company named Element Electronics to get something  every impacted company would love to have - an exemption for their Chinese  supplier.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MIKE FANNING, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA STATE SENATE:  We  have advocates for South Carolina in this Element plant to include these  two individuals that are fighting for the unique case that we have that  could - that makes this policy impossible for us to implement in South  Carolina.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  South Carolina State Senator Mike Fanning welcomes Mulvaney and  Haley's help for Element which is in his district claiming Element deserves  the exemption because it's the only company in America assembling  television sets, selling them to Walmart.  Last month, Element shocked the  tiny town of Winnsboro, population 3,800 announcing it was shutting down,  and laying off 126 employees blaming Trump's proposed tariffs which the  company says will make its TVs too expensive.  </p><p>CNN has reached out to Element Electronics, but they have not responded to  multiple requests.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DAN RUFF, OWNER, RUFF HARDWARE:  Anytime jobs are lost, there's a  trickledown effect where people don't have money to spend.  They can't  spend and so it affects everyone.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Winnsboro and Fairfield County have had what one official calls  the \"year from hell.\"  In July 2017, the construction of two nuclear re  actors was abandoned resulting in the loss of close to 6,000 jobs, next  came the shuttering of a large textile mill that had provided jobs for more  than a century.  The county hospital is closing, and now Element,  Winnsboro's largest remaining private employer is poised to call it quits.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> FANNING:  It rocked me to my core.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Mulvaney and Haley both have a connection to Element.  In 2013,  then Governor Haley lured Element Electronics to the state by offering more  than $1 million of state money as well as tax incentives.  Later, she was  boasting about the economic benefits of the company in a promotional video  for Walmart.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> NIKKI HALEY, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:   ...  Electronics, $7.5 million invested, 500 jobs in Winnsboro.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Before he was Trump's Budget Director, Nick Mulvaney was  Congressman Mulvaney representing the district where Elements set up shop  ...  </p><p> And you don't see the hypocrisy in his effort do that for his state?  </p><p> FANNING:  Absolutely not.  </p><p> SAVIDGE:  Fanning, a Democrat says Mulvaney and Haley's advocacy is neither  hypocritical nor political pointing out in 2016, his district voted  overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton.  He says the pair are helping because  it's justified.  </p><p> But the President's tariff pain will be felt nationwide and these  corporations want to cut backs and layoffs, many communities can only wish  they had two high level administration members fighting for them.  </p><p> Officials with Elements say that if they were to get an exemption or if  those proposed tariffs were to simply go away, they could be back in  business in a matter of months, possibly even think about expanding, which  would be a welcome dose of good news in this small economically hard hit  down.  Martin Savidge, CNN, Winnsboro South Carolina.  </p><p> [16:10:01]  </p><p> SY:  For more on the trade tension and Jerome Powell's speech, Alan Blinder  is the former Vice Chair of the US Fed and he joins me from the action in  Jackson Hole.  Professor Blinder, thank you so much for your time.  I want  to just get your interpretation on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech.  </p><p> ALAN BLINDER, FORMER VICE CHAIRMAN, US FEDERAL RESERVE:  I think it was  very much in defense of status quo which, again, the status quo path, the  path is now - that the Fed is now on and he was giving every indication  we'll continue to be on.  I think if you want to place this in the - at the  margin, was this hawkish or dovish?  I think it was dovish and whatever you  believe, which does not contradict what I just said about interest rates  going up, because the dovishness is about the stopping point.  How far do  you push this?  </p><p> So if you had to choose between reading this as a little hawkish, that  there was a little bit of that and a little dovish, I think it was more of  the latter.  </p><p> SY:  There were, in this path that you're referring to, is that there are  two more planned rate hikes before the end of the year.  Now, based on that  rate of inflation, and Powell's comments that the economy does not seem to  overhearing, do you predict the Fed will stick with both of those hikes?   Is that how you interpreted Powell's comments?  </p><p> BLINDER:  Yes, I think it's likely.  The September one is baked in the  cake, that's for sure.  We're almost there.  Things can happen between now  and December.  That's still a few months away, but I think if the economy  keeps trundling along the path on which it's been trundling, a December  rate hike of another 25 basis points is quite likely.  That's when the Fed  will start getting into serious decision making, how much further, if any,  do we want to go?  </p><p> SY:  They want to avoid that inverted yield curve, I know and the potential  for recession.  I want to kind of switch gears here, sir, because you  probably follow President Trump's tweets criticizing that path to gradually  hike rates that his own appointed Fed Chair, Jerome Powell has set the  Federal on.  How vulnerable do you think this Fed is to political pressure,  especially with the high stakes midterm elections in the US coming up in  November?  </p><p> BLINDER:  It's a very good question.  I think the answer is only modestly.   Because you ask yourself what could Trump do to the Fed?  He's already  appointed Powell instead of some incapable crony of his own, which would  not have been a surprise from President Trump.  Powell is a good man.  He  believes in the independence of the Fed, he has said so, if necessary, he  will say so.  Again, he's got complete 100% banking - backing from inside  the Fed on that subject.  </p><p> I think he has very substantial backing, though not a hundred percent from  members of Congress in their oversight capacity.  So what Trump can do is  two things.  Her can make a nasty tweet as we've seen is his want in many,  many, many context and sometimes they scare people and sometimes they  don't.  I don't think the Fed will scare that easily; or he could use his  remaining  appointment powers.  There's still vacancies on the Fed, in  great distinction to what he's been doing up to now to put terrible people  on the Federal Reserve Board.  That is not what he has chosen to do up to  now.  His appointments to the Fed, his nominees have been good and we hope  it will continue that way, but he does have the capability, if he gets mad,  to send people that will just make Jay Powell's life miserable.  </p><p> SY:  Before I let you go, I want to get your comment on another issue I  know you've been talking about and that is the trade tensions that the  Trump policies have begun.  The Fed did refer in their minutes to these  ongoing tensions and the potential for negative effects.  From the Fed's  point of view, what can they do to mitigate risks to inflation or  potentially growth that Trump's aggressive trade policy might pose?  </p><p> BLINDER:  I think pretty much nothing.  They're watching like all of us are  with no ability to influence trade policy nor should they have, by the way.   The Fed has a great independence.  We were just talking about - though  within the prescribed area and that does not include trade policy.  If it  happens - well, I shouldn't say if it happens, it is happening and the only  question is how severe this trade shock is going to get.  </p><p> A trade shock is a supply shock to the Central Bank, so it's analogous to  giving them the same dilemma that they have in the old days when oil prices  would shoot up.  That causes a bit more inflation.  In this case, it's a  bit more than the oil shock case way back, it was a lot more.  But in this  case, it's a bit more and it takes a bit of a bite out of growth.  </p><p> [16:15:10]  </p><p> BLINDER:  Neither one of those is good and that leaves the Fed with the  same dilemma it had back in the oil shock days.  Do you expand the economy  to make up for the lost growth or do you try to push against the man to  stand against the rise in inflation?  That's the kind of choice the Fed  will have with a big trade war.  </p><p> SY:  All right.  Alan Blinder, thank you so much for your perspective from  Jackson Hole.  </p><p> BLINDER:  Sure.  You're welcome.  Bye.  </p><p> SY:  Still ahead, the man who looked after the US President's business has  been granted immunity in the probe into hush money payments.  And Mr. Trump  says social media companies are censoring people at the same time,  America's tech CEOs are meeting to talk about security during the next  election.  </p><p> The legal troubles which surround some of the US President's former  associates are now reaching the very highest levels of Donald Trump's  business empire.  Sources tell CNN that the Trump organization's Chief  Financial Officer has been granted immunity by Federal prosecutors in the  hush money probe against his former attorney - Trump's former attorney,  Michael Cohen.  </p><p> Cristina Alesci joins me now, lots of details to get to, Cristina.  So,  I'll let you jump right in.  The man we're talking about is Allen  Weisselberg.  He is the CFO of the Trump organization.  Why has he been  granted immunity and what did he give in exchange for it?  </p><p> CRISTINA ALESCI, CORRESPONDENT, CNNMONEY:  Well, Federal prosecutors  granted Allen Weisselberg immunity in exchange for information about  Michael Cohen in connection to the investigation into hush money payments  that Michael Cohen made to women who allegedly had affairs with the  President.  </p><p> This is significant because of who Allen Weisselberg is.  He's the Chief  Financial Officer, yes, and that's a big title in most companies, but in  the Trump organization, this man knew everything about the company's  finances.  He worked for Donald Trump's father.  And he knew exactly what  money came in and what money came out.  He helped prepare the organizations  - he helped prepare taxes.  When President Trump left for Washington, DC,  he left the company in the care of his two sons and Allen Weisselberg.  </p><p> [16:20:04]  </p><p> ALESCI:  So outside of family members, Weisselberg is probably the person  who knows more about the organization than anyone else.  This is not a  person that Donald Trump can say, \"Oh, he doesn't know much.  Oh, he's not  that important,\" the way that he's been trying to do with Michael Cohen.  </p><p> SY:  Is it being suggested that he knows anything that would further  implicate the President in potentially being a co-conspirator in what Cohen  has been charged with which we should remind our viewers which is basically  a violation, a felony violation of US campaign finance law by paying hush  money which in kind is considered a campaign contribution.  </p><p> ALESCI:  Right.  Undeclared ...  </p><p> SY:  Beyond the limits ...  </p><p> ALESCI:  Right.  That's an excellent question.  What we do know is that  Allen Weisselberg was subpoenaed by Federal prosecutors and we know that  there was a deal between Allen Weisselberg's attorney and Federal  prosecutors, but we don't know the scope of the deal.  And when I say deal,  I mean what information is he going to provide.  We don't have the  specifics of that deal, so we don't know whether or not Allen Weisselberg  provided any significant information as to whether the President knew about  these payments when he knew about the payments which is part of the whole  larger question that we're trying to get out since Michael Cohen turned  himself in and that information suggested and implicated the President.  </p><p> SY:  Well, Cohen said straight up that the President directed him to do  this to influence the campaign.  We may see corroboration.  I guess, that's  one of the questions.  </p><p> ALESCI:  Well, that's one of the questions out there.  Can Michael Cohen  really corroborate that?  Does he have evidence of that?  </p><p> SY:  All right, Cristina Alesci, I know you'll keep following it.  Thanks  so much.  </p><p> Donald Trump is targeting the so-called social media giants and accusing  them of censorship.  The President said they silenced millions of people,  that's before he went after CNN again.  </p><p> Earlier this week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told CNN that Twitter does not  discriminate against anyone's political views.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER:  The real question behind the question is are we  doing something according to political ideology or viewpoints?  And we are  not, period.  We do not look at content with regards to political viewpoint  or ideology.  We look at behavior and we use that behavior as a signal to  add to relevance.  We need to constantly show that we are not adding our  own bias, which I fully admit is more left leaning.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SY:  Twitter is among a group of companies meeting today to talk about US  election security.  Clare Sebastian is here.  Clare, good to see you.  I  want to be clear, this is sort of two different stories.  There's a story  of Trump alleging bias at social media companies, that they're somehow  censoring specifically right wing voices within their newsfeeds, and then  there's this meeting that's happening today between all these big tech  social media companies about how to secure their platforms ahead of the  midterms, right?  </p><p> CLARE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Right, exactly.  This is a private  meeting.  We know from a source close to the meeting that it's happening.   We think it's happening at Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco, and it  involves Twitter, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and a number of other tech  companies.  And what's really interesting about this is that we're starting  to see the seeds of coordination.  </p><p> This is the second time that these tech companies have met in a couple of  months.  They met back in May as well - also with officials from DHS and  from the FBI.  So we're seeing kind of more coordination between these tech  companies themselves and potentially the government as well and what it  really speaks to is the fact that they're trying to get out in front of  this problem of manipulation and misinformation before the midterms.  </p><p> We've seen the precipitous loss of trust in these platforms after what  happened in 2016 and since then, they're really trying to show that they're  getting out in front of it.  They've been very active this week with a  number of updates on how they've been taking down abusive accounts and  combating these issues.  </p><p> SY:  Besides it being sort of also an exercise in PR, do you foresee there  being any technological breakthrough that would put these - they're all  such different platforms with different issues that happens, so is that the  type of coordination we might see, a concrete way for them to better secure  their sites?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Well, they will be investing heavily in cyber security and  threat intelligence and ways to identify where the threats are coming from.   So, I think in that respect, they all have these highly - most of the big  ones, Google and Facebook for example, have these highly developed units  that do security.  </p><p> So, certainly perhaps those groups will be able to coordinate.  But I  think, it's interesting, if you look back at what we've seen, when it comes  to election interference and all the misinformation that we've seen since  then, quite often, you see accounts mirrored across Twitter, Facebook issue  - so in that respect, I think it's certainly a good idea for them to work  together.  </p><p> [16:25:04]  </p><p> SY:  And a lot of times, those are trolls or bots.  Speaking of that, we  are learning, this is a really interesting story that the Russian operated  internet research agency which interfered in the US election according to  US intelligence has now also been linked to the debate over vaccinations  and the anti-vax movement.  Clare, how did this all emerge?  And why would  Russian trolls care about that debate?  </p><p> SEBASTIAN:  Well, this is a study from the \"American Journal of Public  Health\" who had been studying tweets specifically over the course of three  years, 2014 to 2017 and they found automated bots, but they also found  accounts that they say are linked to the internet research agency which is  this shadowy organization that has been closely linked by the Mueller  investigation now to election interference.  </p><p> And this is really interesting because it mirrors - it's a very different  area, obviously public health.  We haven't seen that before.  But it  mirrors the kind of tactics we' seen before.  They're not coming down on  one side of the debate.  They say that they found them on both the pro and  anti-vaccine side.  And what we see there is again what we've seen before,  they're trying to drive to the extremes, they're trying to polarize.   They've done an enormous amount of research into the divisive issues in  American social and political life and they take them and they try and  amplify those divisions.  That's what we're seeing here.  </p><p> SY:  Troubling.  Clare Sebastian, thank you so much.  No Australian Prime  Minister has served out a full term in office in more than a decade.  And  now, there's another new leader in Canberra.  We'll take a look at  Australia's political upheaval, next.  </p><p> Hello, I'm Stephanie Sy, coming up on the next half hour of \"Quest Means  Business\" we'll be live in Vancouver where there's $25 million up for grabs  in this weekend's e-sports tournament there and I'll be live with the  President of Bugatti who has just unveiled a brand new $5 million hyper  car.  </p><p> First these are the top headlines we're following on CNN this hour.  </p><p> [16:30:05]  </p><p> The United States has abruptly called off a meeting with North Korea.   President Donald Trump cancelled plans for his Secretary of State Mike  Pompeo to begin another round of talks on denuclearization. </p><p> Mr. Trump cited insufficient progress on the issue and also blamed the  trade battle with China for the cancellation.  A legal challenge to  Zimbabwe's presidential election results has been rejected by its  constitutional court.  It upheld President Emmerson Mnangagwa's win in the  July 30th context. </p><p> Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa contested his loss at the polls which he  called fraudulent and illegal.  Mnangagwa's inauguration remains scheduled  for Saturday.  The family of U.S. Senator John McCain says he has decided  to discontinue treatment for brain cancer. </p><p> He was diagnosed a year ago and spent part of that time at work on Capitol  Hill.  McCain drew the ire of President Donald Trump by casting the  deciding vote to save Obamacare.  A source tells Cnn that the Chief  Financial Officer for the Trump Organization has been granted immunity in  the investigation into Michael Cohen. </p><p> The source says Allen Weisselberg was interviewed several weeks ago about  the hush money paid up to two women who say they had affairs with the U.S.  President.  Pope Francis heads to Ireland this weekend as the Vatican is  urged to take action on the clergy's sex abuse scandal engulfing the  church. </p><p> The Pope will say a mass and is expected to meet with abuse survivors  during his visit.  The first by a Pope to that country in decades.   Australia has a new Prime Minister.  Former cabinet member Scott Morrison  were sworn in on Friday, becoming the fifth person to take the job in the  past five years.</p><p> Now, he's appealing to voters and businesses alike with calls for unity.   Mr. Morrison's predecessor Malcolm Turnbull was forced out of office Friday  by rivals within his own party.  As Scott Morrison assumes his new role,  the former Treasurer-turned leader is already looking to shape economic  policy. </p><p> He made an appeal to voters, Friday, saying, quote, \"the best form of  welfare is a job.\"  He says he believes Australians should keep more of  what they earn.  Australia's stock market have fluctuated on the news from  Canberra, stocks were gripped by a three-day losing streak as the  leadership crisis played out this week.</p><p> But rebounded Friday as Mr. Morrison took office.  The CEO of Australian  Airline Qantas says the uncertainty was quote, \"disappointing and  frustrating\", Alan Joyce called the shake-up not helpful. </p><p> Let's talk more about this leadership change and the market reaction with  Steve Keen, professor of economics at Kingston University joining me via  Skype from Amsterdam.  Steve, thank you so much for joining us.  You know,  the insurgency and Turnbull's party started as I understand it because MPs  actually wanted to install a man named Peter Duncan as PM.</p><p> And he's been -- that Peter Duncan guy has been compared to Donald Trump  actually, and yet Morrison ends up Prime Minister in the end.  Those guys - - neither Duncan or Morrison would have been elected.  So what are voters  thinking, are they happy with this change? </p><p> STEVE KEEN, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, KINGSTON UNIVERSITY:  Oh, actually,  you've got his name wrong, but that's not a problem because you're going to  be a forgotten in politics in a very -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> SY:  Peter -- excuse me? Peter Dutton, excuse me, Peter Dutton -- </p><p> KEEN:  Kind of stop them, yes -- </p><p> SY:  Yes -- </p><p> KEEN:  Is actually been mistaken for now, and finally nothing has been  mistaken for an American entrepreneur selling pop-corn is never come to  people's Prime Minister choice down here, which was quite hilarious side  trip to the whole thing.</p><p> It's really a fuss, an Australian populace(ph) has been a fuss pretty much  for the last 10 years, and I've actually compared this now to at least  Australian or famous incident where an Australian won a ice stadium gold  medal at the Olympics since 2002 in Salt Lake City, not because he is the  best guy, but because the four people ahead of him all fell over and he was  the only one standing, crossing the line.</p><p> So I see Stone Mile(ph) which he's known down in Australia as the  scathing(ph) bad breed(ph) of Australian politics. </p><p> SY:  All right, but he's -- </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> That's an interesting metaphor, I wouldn't have thought Australians were  particularly good at ice skating.  But look, Morrison is not -- he is not a  nobody, he's been in charge of the economy for what, the last three years. </p><p> The economy has been doing pretty well.  What else do we know about Mr.  Morrison and what his policies will be like going forward.  Certainly,  investors seem to like this change. </p><p> [16:35:00] KEEN:  Well, him he's got more -- I thought I was going to use a  different expression, but he's got more background than Malcolm Turnbull  had and less ideology than Tony Abbott who was the previous conservative  Prime Minister.</p><p> There's more likelihood he's going to be doing stuff as of course the  property law, they did close for a substantial part of his pre-academic --  pre-political career, he was a lobbyist for the property lobbying in  Australia when of course Australia has the longest-running property bubble.</p><p> So he'll be doing all he can to maintain that bubble and is the best thing  right now.  So he'll be pumping government money to keep the property mark  otherwise, that will make him really very popular in Australian business  and potentially with the electorate.</p><p> But I think he's really on a hiding to nothing to be the last liberal party  prime minister before the Labor Party takes over at the next election which  he'll delay for as long as possible.</p><p> SY:  OK, you bring up a lot of stuff there, sir, so part of what you said,  first of all, Australia's economy hasn't experienced a recession in more  than a quarter of a century, but you just referred there to one of the  economic pressures that was facing Turnbull. </p><p> From what I understand, wages are extremely stagnant and also there are  high housing costs.  So were those economic pressures playing in to voters'  mind and did that lead in part to Turnbull, his fault? </p><p> KEEN:  No, as entirely due to actually personal animosity, to go back and  the liberal party 45 years when both Tony Abbott who was the previous prime  minister that Malcolm shafted to get the job, and they were both students  at Sydney University. </p><p> Both on the conservative side, no tiny staunchly conservative actually like  Australia back to 1950s in the Curtin's politics, whereas the Turnbull is  more a swath 1970s conservative in that sense.  They hated each other at  university and spent their entire time shafting each other there.</p><p> And now they're spending their time shafting each other in Australian  politics in the house of parliament, and I think the most sensible thing  that Scott Morrison could do will be to appoint Tony Abbott to be the high  commissioner to London and get rid of them and remember particular  council(ph) from the liberal party. </p><p> Whether he has the guts to do it, we'll find out shortly.</p><p> SY:  All right, and we'll see how long the liberal party survives under all  these circumstances.  Steve Keen, thank you so much for your perspective on  this. </p><p> KEEN:  You're welcome.  </p><p> SY:  With Australia divided over climate policies, activists are gearing up  for World Water week which starts on Sunday.  CDP which helps companies  manage their environment policies says more big firms are taking notice and  putting plans in place over how they use water. </p><p> Cate Lamb is CDP's director of water security.  Cate, thank you so much for  being with us.  First of all, how urgent is the issue of water security  around the world? </p><p> CATE LAMB, DIRECTOR OF WATER SECURITY, CDP:  Thank you for having me this  evening Stephanie, I really appreciate being on board.  The issue is that  depends on where you are, ultimately, but for many, businesses is growing  as an issue. </p><p> Just this year, we had more than 7,000 and -- excuse me, 3,770 risks that  falls into CDP from the mid-west's largest growing at the world's largest  businesses, and this is posing a threat, not only to their bottom-line,  from a range of different reasons. </p><p> But we're seeing a range of physical reputational and regulatory risks that  are looking over just the risks -- sorry, this is a total mess, but they're  still coming around from a timeline of both short and long-term risks.   Apologies, Stephanie.</p><p> SY:  That's OK, you know, you know, essentially it's a pretty complicated  set of risks that businesses face.  Why don't you start by telling us which  industries are being most impacted and will be most impacted by water  scarcity issues in the near term.</p><p> LAMB:  Sure thing, so there are range of industries that will effectively  have metals in mining, there's organizations responsible for the production  of food, of course, where agriculture accounts for more than 80 percent of  global water use worldwide. </p><p> We have energy companies who is dependent upon water is really quite  fundamental in order for them to succeed as an organization.  And all of  these sectors are going to be adversely affected by the situation as it  increases. </p><p> At the UN for example is estimating that the world's supply of water is  likely to hit a supply demand gap of around 40 percent in just 12 years  time.  </p><p> So while the world's -- as it turns water scarcity and water stresses off,  impaired, what we're really experiencing is an increased competition for  this finite results, and businesses are finding themselves on the frontline  as they compete for access to this resource with communities, with the  environment and with all that water uses within the basins that they're  located. </p><p> [16:40:00] SY:  Give us some examples, Cate, of how major corporations are  taking action to protect their own bottom-lines, given these circumstances.</p><p> LAMB:  Sure, at CDP, we believe that this closure is really a first and  vital step in order to understand and mitigate the risks that companies are  facing.  And what we're seeing as a result of that is more than two and a  half thousand companies disclosing to us on an annual basis. </p><p> We provide the same work that ultimately enables companies to better  understand the challenges that they're facing and take appropriate steps.   We have an example of Danone where they're pursuing nature as a source of  solution to water-related risks.</p><p> They invested in a range of mine growth restoration projects in a wide  range of locations -- apologies, in order to protect their fresh water  resources that they rely upon.  Well, beverage company AB InBev did the  same, they're investing in river basin management plans, and also again  they took solutions in order to protect the river that they're relying  upon.</p><p> And Fiat-Chrysler, quite surprising perhaps to some of your watches today  also have significant risks that they're facing and they planted 60,000  trees right across Latin America in a range of regions, in order to again  protect the fresh water resources that they're relying upon, facing an  increasing number of companies turning to perhaps non-traditional nature- based solutions that tackle these risks. </p><p> And excitingly in a report that we released just a couple of days ago,  these solutions are coming in at a much lower costs than traditional great  forms of infrastructure.</p><p> SY:  There are of course long-term solutions and maybe also filling a  vacuum where government policy in places like the U.S. and Australia are  not.  Cate Lamb, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> LAMB:  Thank you Stephanie.</p><p> SY:  Powerful heroes are battling for supremacy in Vancouver, at least in  the world of professional video gaming.  It's one of the biggest weekend's  on the calendar for the growing phenomenon of ESports, details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> SY:  This weekend is one of the biggest ESports prices of the year.  More  than $25 million is up for grabs at the international; a professional  video-gaming tournament in Vancouver.  Matthew Black is a reporter for the  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation joining me from Vancouver via Skype.</p><p> [16:45:00] Matt, I know you've been covering this industry for a while, but  what's the atmosphere been like at the International, and how is that  compared to what you might feel at a major sporting event?</p><p> MATTHEW BLACK, REPORTER, CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION:  Well, people  are very excited, it's a real big event, it's the biggest in the ESports  calendar, the biggest money tournament and the last big money tournament  was the one before this.</p><p> So the last four TIs, the last four TIs are the biggest.  As far as the  atmosphere here, it's not all that different from a normal sporting event.   What the set up is like is you walk into the arena, the lights are turned  down a bit, so it's a little different than your normal basketball, hockey  game. </p><p> And when you go down into the sitting area, it's all dark and you see two  teams enter these last post that are sound proof, they come out to entrance  music, they come out to smoke and pyrotechnics, they begin playing and fans  watch on a big screen, that's normally where the jumbotron would be where  you would watch the highlights and plan unfold. </p><p> There's a lot of fans -- a lot of flags rather in the crowd, a lot of fans  who come from different parts of the world, a lot of these teams come from  one particular country or one particular part of the world.  So it has a  bit of a World Cup feel about it, but in terms of the actual atmosphere,  you have cheering, you have booing, you have (INAUDIBLE) and eyeing, it's  not all that different than your usual basketball or hockey game which we'd  normally see at Rogers Arena at this time of year. </p><p> SY:  So you've been covering ESports for a few years, Matt, and there are  certainly some big media deals and sponsorships in the sector we've seen  recently.  But do you see ESports really going mainstream? Maybe even being  at the Olympics one day. </p><p> BLACK:  Yes, it has a way to go before that, there's certainly more and  more support building for that, they have a few obstacles to get through.   One of the realities is that videogames just change so fast, the most  popular game on the planet right now is called Fortnight, it's the most  streamed one.</p><p> Five years ago, no one had ever heard of it, so you can't trust that with a  lot of Olympics sports that have been around for generations and that don't  look all that different than they did a few decades ago.  That will be one  obstacle that they have to overcome. </p><p> But on the other hand, it's very hard to sell a hockey-size arena for one  night, let alone six.  And it's only that they're doing that, it's who is  going to these events, it's really young people, that young audience that  so many industries credit, and ESports seems to be able to deliver that  better than anyone right now.</p><p> And so that's what's got organizations like the Olympics and many pro  sports teams interested in this as well.</p><p> SY:  Indeed, Matthew Black, a reporter for the CDC, thank you Matt, have  fun.  Now the International isn't the only big ESports event this weekend,  the over-watched ESports league is holding its first ever all-star game.   The event is being held in a sold-out Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles, a  purpose-billed venue for professional video-gamers. </p><p> It's also being broadcast on Twitter.  Brandon Snow is chief revenue  officer of Activision Blizzard which operates this ESports League.   Brandon, nice to meet you -- </p><p> BRANDON SNOW, CHIEF REVENUE OFFICER, ESPORTS BLIZZARD:  Thanks -- </p><p> SY:  And thanks for your time.  The over-watched league has struck this  deal with Twitter, can you give us some more details, and what does it mean  for you guys and for Twitter, and for the burgeoning base of ESports fans?</p><p> SNOW:  Sure of course.  It's a wonderful partnership that we're going to  enter in with Twitter.  We're starting it off this weekend with our all- star game as you mentioned.  </p><p> They will be showing near-live highlights on Twitter of those matches of  the games played, and that will continue on as a multi-year arrangement  into next season where they'll continue to show highlights of our games, a  regular season games and we will have a weekly 30-minute live-streamed pre- game show to watch point also airing live under our platform into the next  season.  </p><p> SY:  Now, I know that last month, ESPN signed a deal with you guys for TV  rights, and the Overwatch League as well.  How much importance do you place  in the traditional media outlets versus say, the Twitters of the world or  even comparing it to like the Amazon streaming Twitch -- </p><p> SNOW:  Right -- </p><p> SY:  As far as revenue? </p><p> SNOW:  Sure, well, we want to make sure we have our content in every place  where our fans are engaging with us.  And Twitter is one part of that.  We  have a very important relationship with Twitch who as you mentioned streams  all of our games live on their platform and then into this finals playoffs  and final of this year, we entered into a relationship with \"Disney\" to  show on linear our products.</p><p> And it was the first time to ever have live ESports event on the flagship  products of ESPN.  We had that on Friday night, and then rear of the entire  finals on \"Abc\" the following Sunday.  So for us, it's about continuing to  grow, expand the audience, there's 40 million people playing Overwatch  around the world and we want to make sure that we can engage them with the  sport and in any way that they want to do that. </p><p> And that's whether it'd be digitally streamed linearly on television or  through a short form, counting on Twitter.  </p><p> SY:  All right, I want to ask you the big, sort of the mountain top  question which is where is the landscape for ESports right now.  And how do  you see that changing in that landscape in the future? </p><p> SNOW:  Sure, we are in the cost of mainstream.  If you think about the 2.2  million gamers that are out there, there's already 380 million people  watching ESports.  </p><p> [16:50:00] Eighty percent of those people are under the age of 35.  And --  so we are in a situation of growth that is going to be impressive(ph), and  I think as it relates to potentially existing stick and balls sports that  you're aware of. </p><p> And at the Overwatch League, we're taking that model, but yet, I think  we're moving it beyond to where it has been and improving.  So as -- what  I've commissioned is, we have a 12 league -- 12 team league, city-base  franchise league, no different than you have with any traditional sports -- </p><p> SY:  Yes -- </p><p> SNOW:  And we have a vision of playing home and away games, no different  than what you have in traditional sports.  It's just that you engage in --  you do that in a digital space.</p><p> SY:  I think one wants a piece of that ESports audience, I know that.   Brandon Snow, Chief Revenue Officer of Activision Blizzard, thank you so  much -- </p><p> SNOW:  Of course -- </p><p> SY:  For joining us -- </p><p> SNOW:  Thank you very much for having me.</p><p> SY:  How do you make a super car 30 miles per hour slower and then tag on  an extra $3 million to the price-tag.  Bugatti has done just that, the  company's president will join me to explain next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> SY:  Bugatti's newest super car has 1,500 horsepower, costs twice as much  as the previous model, it's 8 seconds faster and even if you have a spare 6  million bucks, you can't buy one because only 40 are being made and they're  already sold out.</p><p> All right, stop showing me, show the car.  Bugatti unveiled the Divo, a few  hours ago, it's actually slower in terms of miles per hour than the current  model the Chiron.  But Bugatti says the Divo handles much better and so it  goes faster around the track. </p><p> Stephan Winkelmann is the president of Bugatti joining me from Monterey,  California.  Stephan, how much -- </p><p> STEPHAN WINKELMANN, PRESIDENT, BUGATTI:  Hello -- </p><p> SY:  Hi, great to see you.  How much of a technological leap is the Divo or  is it just sort of a tweak version of your Chiron?</p><p> WINKELMANN:  No, the Chiron is a different car, when we speak about  performance, a different -- as you say, no, one is the longitudinal  acceleration and the other one is the latitudinal(ph) acceleration.  So the  handling being nimble and agile. </p><p> And this is what we wanted to underline with this car.  So we have a much  safer short seat, we have an impressive down force, we have -- a design  which is completely new.  </p><p> [16:55:00] We have reduced the weight by more than -- so this is the real  package which is very -- and which is bringing us to invest a lot of money  into a car like this.</p><p> And on top of it, as you said, we only want to do 40, so this balance would  create a collector's item and also a state of the art technology -- like  this.</p><p> SY:  You know, the Divo has been called the most expensive supercar in the  world.  You just talked about how much it costs to develop it, will the  sale of 40 of these be profitable for Bugatti and its parent company  Volkswagen?</p><p> WINKELMANN:  Yes, we are a business case, even if it's not important, it  has to be a business case and this is what we're looking at.</p><p> SY:  OK, you also talked about the sort of cutting edge technology.  I'm  curious, given all that you must spend for research and development into a  vehicle like this, how much do we see those technologies go into the design  of other Volkswagen brands? </p><p> Could we see aspects of what we're seeing in this car? For example, in an  Audi. </p><p> WINKELMANN:  No, what we do here is specifically made for the Bugatti brand  because we know our customers, we know the things we need to do, not only  for the customers, but also to keep the brand at the highest possible  level. </p><p> And therefore this always has to be the tip of the sphere and to have  automotive technology. </p><p> SY:  OK, you are going to be producing the Divo as well as the Chiron, I'm  sorry, I mispronounced it earlier at the same time, I understand it's the  first time that Bugatti is going to actually be producing two models at the  same time.  Is this the future for Bugatti?</p><p> And I have to ask since we see other luxury car-makers, even Rolls Royce,  Bentley, Lamborghini branching out into things like SUVs, could you see  that being in the future for your brand?</p><p> WINKELMANN:  So I have to tell you that -- high-end luxury and super -- was  founded back in '99 and next year we are going to celebrate 110 -- </p><p> SY:  Right -- </p><p> WINKELMANN:  In time, we have much more models, now we're having  today on  this day, and today, we are doing the Chiron and we will do the Divo.  And  if you ask me if that this is -- </p><p> SY:  OK -- </p><p> WINKELMANN:  Ready for more, then yes, the Bugatti brand is ready for more.</p><p> SY:  Stephan Winkelmann, president of Bugatti, thank you so much, we'll  have to end it there.  And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I'm Stephanie Sy,  the news continues here on CNN.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED.

Trading is over on this Friday, August 24th. Tonight, stock markets set some summertime records as Jay Powell promises the economy won't overheat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Donald Trump's money man gets immunity in the latest White House legal drama, and it might be the most expensive super car in history. I'll the ask President of Bugatti about the new five million euro Divo. I'm Stephanie Sy, this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening. Tonight, this is good news. Those were the words of US Fed Chairman Jerome Powell who says the US economy is doing great and inflation is in check. In short, Powell says his policy of interest rate rises at the Fed is working despite any criticism from President Donald Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His comments sent markets flirting with a return to the record-setting ways. Let's take a look at the way the three indices ended today. The Dow up 140 points, and you can see new records set by the S&amp;P 500 as well as the NASDAQ. That brings our 2018 records here up. The NASDAQ setting 26 records this year and the S&amp;P now at 15.</p><p>Earlier at the New York Stock Exchange, trader Tim Anderson told \"Quest Express\" that Jerome Powell's words are a breath of fresh air for investors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM ANDERSON, TRADER, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE: I think that clearly his comments are reassuring for the market and I also think there's this underlying tone of his delivery not being a PhD economist. It's almost like a breath of fresh air. He's very understandable for a lot of people to listen to him, you don't have to be a Fed watcher to understand what he's saying.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: It was clearly an upbeat appearance from the Fed Chairman at Jackson Hole, Mr. Powell dismissed fears that the US economy is out of control saying there is no sign of it overheating. He did not address the criticism he's received from President Trump over rate hikes; instead, he insisted the Central Bank will stay on course for future rises. Powell also played down fears of rising inflation saying the Fed will do whatever it takes to keep it in check. Paul La Monica joins me now.</p><p>Whatever it takes, that sounds actually like familiar verbiage. Let's start with the new records we saw. The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ again beating records. How long will the party last and what drove that sentiment today?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Yes, I think today, Stephanie, you already talked about Jerome Powell's speech and I think that really did it. He showed the market once again that he's confident about the US economy, but the Fed has to try and keep inflation in check as well that's why they're are going to be probably a couple more rate hikes this year, maybe a few in 2019 as well and the market is okay with that.</p><p>So even though the President has been attacking the Fed and criticizing rate hikes, it's not something that Powell is going to change Fed policy just because President Trump has been making noise about how rate hikes might be bad news because the market clearly disagrees with the President.</p><p>SY: Now, earlier this week, we did hear Jerome Powell sort of nod at the fact that trade tensions continue with Trump's aggressive trade policy stance, that that could have future impacts on inflation as well as growth and yet the markets really seemed to be shrugging that part of story off and we did not hear a lot of mention about that again today.</p><p>LA MONICA: No, in the Fed minutes, you're right. But the Fed did acknowledge some members that trade concerns are an issue. I think right now, what we're still having is that while some companies have noted that tariffs and trade issues are starting to hurt earnings, a lot of companies said it's still just talk, that businesses are mentioning trade issues as a concern, but it's not hurting the overall profit picture of the economy just yet.</p><p>And I the same thing is happening with consumers because Stephanie, consumer spending has been great. Retailers have reported for the most part really strong results. We're talking about brick and mortar retailers also, not just Amazon.</p><p>SY: Yes, and the Targets of the world are saying this is among the best consumer environments they've ever seen. Again, I go back to the question of how long this will last and why it's important even for Powell to continue the gradual rate hikes in an environment where inflation doesn't seem to be really going up at this point.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, inflation isn't going up all that much just yet, but it's the type of thing that if you let it go unchecked, all of a sudden, you have rampant inflation and rates would have to go a lot higher than what the Fed would probably like.</p><p>[16:05:08]</p><p>LA MONICA: I think they're happy and the market clearly is as well, which is a couple of quarter-point hikes every few meetings. That's something that's manageable. With regards to how much longer this rally can last, if consumers keep spending, corporations keep spending, profit should still be pretty good. The dollar weakened today as well which should help multi- national companies going forward if that continues to go down.</p><p>So I'm not going to say that this bull run goes on obviously forever. It has to peak at some point, but earnings are still justifying this rally it appears.</p><p>SY: Yes, and I think it's interesting that you bring up basically the notion of pre-emption being important with the gradual rate hikes. Paul La Monica, thank you very much.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>SY: Later on in the program, I'm going to be speaking to Alan Blinder who was Vice Chairman of the Fed under Alan Greenspan. He'll be joining us from Jackson Hole in just a few minutes.</p><p>Two top White House officials are quietly lobbying against Donald Trump's tariffs now that the trade war is threatening a company in their home state. Martin Savidge has more from Winnsboro, South Carolina.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The tariffs have been incredible and ...</p><p>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Even as they work for a President who has proclaimed tariffs are the greatest, CNN has learned from two members of the South Carolina congressional delegation, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney have been pushing for a tariff exemption for a company in their home state.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We are winning on trade.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE: President Trump says he wants to level the trade playing field by imposing tariffs on as much as $200 billion more imported Chinese products and parts. Corporate leaders have been telling Washington how much those tariffs will hurt business and the economy.</p><p>But behind the scenes, Mulvaney and Ambassador Haley are advocating for a small South Carolina company named Element Electronics to get something every impacted company would love to have - an exemption for their Chinese supplier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE FANNING, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA STATE SENATE: We have advocates for South Carolina in this Element plant to include these two individuals that are fighting for the unique case that we have that could - that makes this policy impossible for us to implement in South Carolina.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE: South Carolina State Senator Mike Fanning welcomes Mulvaney and Haley's help for Element which is in his district claiming Element deserves the exemption because it's the only company in America assembling television sets, selling them to Walmart. Last month, Element shocked the tiny town of Winnsboro, population 3,800 announcing it was shutting down, and laying off 126 employees blaming Trump's proposed tariffs which the company says will make its TVs too expensive.</p><p>CNN has reached out to Element Electronics, but they have not responded to multiple requests.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN RUFF, OWNER, RUFF HARDWARE: Anytime jobs are lost, there's a trickledown effect where people don't have money to spend. They can't spend and so it affects everyone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE: Winnsboro and Fairfield County have had what one official calls the \"year from hell.\" In July 2017, the construction of two nuclear re actors was abandoned resulting in the loss of close to 6,000 jobs, next came the shuttering of a large textile mill that had provided jobs for more than a century. The county hospital is closing, and now Element, Winnsboro's largest remaining private employer is poised to call it quits.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FANNING: It rocked me to my core.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE: Mulvaney and Haley both have a connection to Element. In 2013, then Governor Haley lured Element Electronics to the state by offering more than $1 million of state money as well as tax incentives. Later, she was boasting about the economic benefits of the company in a promotional video for Walmart.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIKKI HALEY, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS: ... Electronics, $7.5 million invested, 500 jobs in Winnsboro.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE: Before he was Trump's Budget Director, Nick Mulvaney was Congressman Mulvaney representing the district where Elements set up shop ...</p><p>And you don't see the hypocrisy in his effort do that for his state?</p><p>FANNING: Absolutely not.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Fanning, a Democrat says Mulvaney and Haley's advocacy is neither hypocritical nor political pointing out in 2016, his district voted overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton. He says the pair are helping because it's justified.</p><p>But the President's tariff pain will be felt nationwide and these corporations want to cut backs and layoffs, many communities can only wish they had two high level administration members fighting for them.</p><p>Officials with Elements say that if they were to get an exemption or if those proposed tariffs were to simply go away, they could be back in business in a matter of months, possibly even think about expanding, which would be a welcome dose of good news in this small economically hard hit down. Martin Savidge, CNN, WinnsboroSouth Carolina.</p><p>[16:10:01]</p><p>SY: For more on the trade tension and Jerome Powell's speech, Alan Blinder is the former Vice Chair of the US Fed and he joins me from the action in Jackson Hole. Professor Blinder, thank you so much for your time. I want to just get your interpretation on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech.</p><p>ALAN BLINDER, FORMER VICE CHAIRMAN, US FEDERAL RESERVE: I think it was very much in defense of status quo which, again, the status quo path, the path is now - that the Fed is now on and he was giving every indication we'll continue to be on. I think if you want to place this in the - at the margin, was this hawkish or dovish? I think it was dovish and whatever you believe, which does not contradict what I just said about interest rates going up, because the dovishness is about the stopping point. How far do you push this?</p><p>So if you had to choose between reading this as a little hawkish, that there was a little bit of that and a little dovish, I think it was more of the latter.</p><p>SY: There were, in this path that you're referring to, is that there are two more planned rate hikes before the end of the year. Now, based on that rate of inflation, and Powell's comments that the economy does not seem to overhearing, do you predict the Fed will stick with both of those hikes? Is that how you interpreted Powell's comments?</p><p>BLINDER: Yes, I think it's likely. The September one is baked in the cake, that's for sure. We're almost there. Things can happen between now and December. That's still a few months away, but I think if the economy keeps trundling along the path on which it's been trundling, a December rate hike of another 25 basis points is quite likely. That's when the Fed will start getting into serious decision making, how much further, if any, do we want to go?</p><p>SY: They want to avoid that inverted yield curve, I know and the potential for recession. I want to kind of switch gears here, sir, because you probably follow President Trump's tweets criticizing that path to gradually hike rates that his own appointed Fed Chair, Jerome Powell has set the Federal on. How vulnerable do you think this Fed is to political pressure, especially with the high stakes midterm elections in the US coming up in November?</p><p>BLINDER: It's a very good question. I think the answer is only modestly. Because you ask yourself what could Trump do to the Fed? He's already appointed Powell instead of some incapable crony of his own, which would not have been a surprise from President Trump. Powell is a good man. He believes in the independence of the Fed, he has said so, if necessary, he will say so. Again, he's got complete 100% banking - backing from inside the Fed on that subject.</p><p>I think he has very substantial backing, though not a hundred percent from members of Congress in their oversight capacity. So what Trump can do is two things. Her can make a nasty tweet as we've seen is his want in many, many, many context and sometimes they scare people and sometimes they don't. I don't think the Fed will scare that easily; or he could use his remaining appointment powers. There's still vacancies on the Fed, in great distinction to what he's been doing up to now to put terrible people on the Federal Reserve Board. That is not what he has chosen to do up to now. His appointments to the Fed, his nominees have been good and we hope it will continue that way, but he does have the capability, if he gets mad, to send people that will just make Jay Powell's life miserable.</p><p>SY: Before I let you go, I want to get your comment on another issue I know you've been talking about and that is the trade tensions that the Trump policies have begun. The Fed did refer in their minutes to these ongoing tensions and the potential for negative effects. From the Fed's point of view, what can they do to mitigate risks to inflation or potentially growth that Trump's aggressive trade policy might pose?</p><p>BLINDER: I think pretty much nothing. They're watching like all of us are with no ability to influence trade policy nor should they have, by the way. The Fed has a great independence. We were just talking about - though within the prescribed area and that does not include trade policy. If it happens - well, I shouldn't say if it happens, it is happening and the only question is how severe this trade shock is going to get.</p><p>A trade shock is a supply shock to the Central Bank, so it's analogous to giving them the same dilemma that they have in the old days when oil prices would shoot up. That causes a bit more inflation. In this case, it's a bit more than the oil shock case way back, it was a lot more. But in this case, it's a bit more and it takes a bit of a bite out of growth.</p><p>[16:15:10]</p><p>BLINDER: Neither one of those is good and that leaves the Fed with the same dilemma it had back in the oil shock days. Do you expand the economy to make up for the lost growth or do you try to push against the man to stand against the rise in inflation? That's the kind of choice the Fed will have with a big trade war.</p><p>SY: All right. Alan Blinder, thank you so much for your perspective from Jackson Hole.</p><p>BLINDER: Sure. You're welcome. Bye.</p><p>SY: Still ahead, the man who looked after the US President's business has been granted immunity in the probe into hush money payments. And Mr. Trump says social media companies are censoring people at the same time, America's tech CEOs are meeting to talk about security during the next election.</p><p>The legal troubles which surround some of the US President's former associates are now reaching the very highest levels of Donald Trump's business empire. Sources tell CNN that the Trump organization's Chief Financial Officer has been granted immunity by Federal prosecutors in the hush money probe against his former attorney - Trump's former attorney, Michael Cohen.</p><p>Cristina Alesci joins me now, lots of details to get to, Cristina. So, I'll let you jump right in. The man we're talking about is Allen Weisselberg. He is the CFO of the Trump organization. Why has he been granted immunity and what did he give in exchange for it?</p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, CORRESPONDENT, CNNMONEY: Well, Federal prosecutors granted Allen Weisselberg immunity in exchange for information about Michael Cohen in connection to the investigation into hush money payments that Michael Cohen made to women who allegedly had affairs with the President.</p><p>This is significant because of who Allen Weisselberg is. He's the Chief Financial Officer, yes, and that's a big title in most companies, but in the Trump organization, this man knew everything about the company's finances. He worked for Donald Trump's father. And he knew exactly what money came in and what money came out. He helped prepare the organizations - he helped prepare taxes. When President Trump left for Washington, DC, he left the company in the care of his two sons and Allen Weisselberg.</p><p>[16:20:04]</p><p>ALESCI: So outside of family members, Weisselberg is probably the person who knows more about the organization than anyone else. This is not a person that Donald Trump can say, \"Oh, he doesn't know much. Oh, he's not that important,\" the way that he's been trying to do with Michael Cohen.</p><p>SY: Is it being suggested that he knows anything that would further implicate the President in potentially being a co-conspirator in what Cohen has been charged with which we should remind our viewers which is basically a violation, a felony violation of US campaign finance law by paying hush money which in kind is considered a campaign contribution.</p><p>ALESCI: Right. Undeclared ...</p><p>SY: Beyond the limits ...</p><p>ALESCI: Right. That's an excellent question. What we do know is that Allen Weisselberg was subpoenaed by Federal prosecutors and we know that there was a deal between Allen Weisselberg's attorney and Federal prosecutors, but we don't know the scope of the deal. And when I say deal, I mean what information is he going to provide. We don't have the specifics of that deal, so we don't know whether or not Allen Weisselberg provided any significant information as to whether the President knew about these payments when he knew about the payments which is part of the whole larger question that we're trying to get out since Michael Cohen turned himself in and that information suggested and implicated the President.</p><p>SY: Well, Cohen said straight up that the President directed him to do this to influence the campaign. We may see corroboration. I guess, that's one of the questions.</p><p>ALESCI: Well, that's one of the questions out there. Can Michael Cohen really corroborate that? Does he have evidence of that?</p><p>SY: All right, Cristina Alesci, I know you'll keep following it. Thanks so much.</p><p>Donald Trump is targeting the so-called social media giants and accusing them of censorship. The President said they silenced millions of people, that's before he went after CNN again.</p><p>Earlier this week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told CNN that Twitter does not discriminate against anyone's political views.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER: The real question behind the question is are we doing something according to political ideology or viewpoints? And we are not, period. We do not look at content with regards to political viewpoint or ideology. We look at behavior and we use that behavior as a signal to add to relevance. We need to constantly show that we are not adding our own bias, which I fully admit is more left leaning.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: Twitter is among a group of companies meeting today to talk about US election security. Clare Sebastian is here. Clare, good to see you. I want to be clear, this is sort of two different stories. There's a story of Trump alleging bias at social media companies, that they're somehow censoring specifically right wing voices within their newsfeeds, and then there's this meeting that's happening today between all these big tech social media companies about how to secure their platforms ahead of the midterms, right?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN: Right, exactly. This is a private meeting. We know from a source close to the meeting that it's happening. We think it's happening at Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco, and it involves Twitter, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and a number of other tech companies. And what's really interesting about this is that we're starting to see the seeds of coordination.</p><p>This is the second time that these tech companies have met in a couple of months. They met back in May as well - also with officials from DHS and from the FBI. So we're seeing kind of more coordination between these tech companies themselves and potentially the government as well and what it really speaks to is the fact that they're trying to get out in front of this problem of manipulation and misinformation before the midterms.</p><p>We've seen the precipitous loss of trust in these platforms after what happened in 2016 and since then, they're really trying to show that they're getting out in front of it. They've been very active this week with a number of updates on how they've been taking down abusive accounts and combating these issues.</p><p>SY: Besides it being sort of also an exercise in PR, do you foresee there being any technological breakthrough that would put these - they're all such different platforms with different issues that happens, so is that the type of coordination we might see, a concrete way for them to better secure their sites?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, they will be investing heavily in cyber security and threat intelligence and ways to identify where the threats are coming from. So, I think in that respect, they all have these highly - most of the big ones, Google and Facebook for example, have these highly developed units that do security.</p><p>So, certainly perhaps those groups will be able to coordinate. But I think, it's interesting, if you look back at what we've seen, when it comes to election interference and all the misinformation that we've seen since then, quite often, you see accounts mirrored across Twitter, Facebook issue - so in that respect, I think it's certainly a good idea for them to work together.</p><p>[16:25:04]</p><p>SY: And a lot of times, those are trolls or bots. Speaking of that, we are learning, this is a really interesting story that the Russian operated internet research agency which interfered in the US election according to US intelligence has now also been linked to the debate over vaccinations and the anti-vax movement. Clare, how did this all emerge? And why would Russian trolls care about that debate?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, this is a study from the \"American Journal of Public Health\" who had been studying tweets specifically over the course of three years, 2014 to 2017 and they found automated bots, but they also found accounts that they say are linked to the internet research agency which is this shadowy organization that has been closely linked by the Mueller investigation now to election interference.</p><p>And this is really interesting because it mirrors - it's a very different area, obviously public health. We haven't seen that before. But it mirrors the kind of tactics we' seen before. They're not coming down on one side of the debate. They say that they found them on both the pro and anti-vaccine side. And what we see there is again what we've seen before, they're trying to drive to the extremes, they're trying to polarize. They've done an enormous amount of research into the divisive issues in American social and political life and they take them and they try and amplify those divisions. That's what we're seeing here.</p><p>SY: Troubling. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much. No Australian Prime Minister has served out a full term in office in more than a decade. And now, there's another new leader in Canberra. We'll take a look at Australia's political upheaval, next.</p><p>Hello, I'm Stephanie Sy, coming up on the next half hour of \"Quest Means Business\" we'll be live in Vancouver where there's $25 million up for grabs in this weekend's e-sports tournament there and I'll be live with the President of Bugatti who has just unveiled a brand new $5 million hyper car.</p><p>First these are the top headlines we're following on CNN this hour.</p><p>[16:30:05]</p><p>The United States has abruptly called off a meeting with North Korea. President Donald Trump cancelled plans for his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to begin another round of talks on denuclearization.</p><p>Mr. Trump cited insufficient progress on the issue and also blamed the trade battle with China for the cancellation. A legal challenge to Zimbabwe's presidential election results has been rejected by its constitutional court. It upheld President Emmerson Mnangagwa's win in the July 30th context.</p><p>Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa contested his loss at the polls which he called fraudulent and illegal. Mnangagwa's inauguration remains scheduled for Saturday. The family of U.S. Senator John McCain says he has decided to discontinue treatment for brain cancer.</p><p>He was diagnosed a year ago and spent part of that time at work on Capitol Hill. McCain drew the ire of President Donald Trump by casting the deciding vote to save Obamacare. A source tells Cnn that the Chief Financial Officer for the Trump Organization has been granted immunity in the investigation into Michael Cohen.</p><p>The source says Allen Weisselberg was interviewed several weeks ago about the hush money paid up to two women who say they had affairs with the U.S. President. Pope Francis heads to Ireland this weekend as the Vatican is urged to take action on the clergy's sex abuse scandal engulfing the church.</p><p>The Pope will say a mass and is expected to meet with abuse survivors during his visit. The first by a Pope to that country in decades. Australia has a new Prime Minister. Former cabinet member Scott Morrison were sworn in on Friday, becoming the fifth person to take the job in the past five years.</p><p>Now, he's appealing to voters and businesses alike with calls for unity. Mr. Morrison's predecessor Malcolm Turnbull was forced out of office Friday by rivals within his own party. As Scott Morrison assumes his new role, the former Treasurer-turned leader is already looking to shape economic policy.</p><p>He made an appeal to voters, Friday, saying, quote, \"the best form of welfare is a job.\" He says he believes Australians should keep more of what they earn. Australia's stock market have fluctuated on the news from Canberra, stocks were gripped by a three-day losing streak as the leadership crisis played out this week.</p><p>But rebounded Friday as Mr. Morrison took office. The CEO of Australian Airline Qantas says the uncertainty was quote, \"disappointing and frustrating\", Alan Joyce called the shake-up not helpful.</p><p>Let's talk more about this leadership change and the market reaction with Steve Keen, professor of economics at Kingston University joining me via Skype from Amsterdam. Steve, thank you so much for joining us. You know, the insurgency and Turnbull's party started as I understand it because MPs actually wanted to install a man named Peter Duncan as PM.</p><p>And he's been -- that Peter Duncan guy has been compared to Donald Trump actually, and yet Morrison ends up Prime Minister in the end. Those guys - - neither Duncan or Morrison would have been elected. So what are voters thinking, are they happy with this change?</p><p>STEVE KEEN, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, KINGSTON UNIVERSITY: Oh, actually, you've got his name wrong, but that's not a problem because you're going to be a forgotten in politics in a very --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SY: Peter -- excuse me? Peter Dutton, excuse me, Peter Dutton --</p><p>KEEN: Kind of stop them, yes --</p><p>SY: Yes --</p><p>KEEN: Is actually been mistaken for now, and finally nothing has been mistaken for an American entrepreneur selling pop-corn is never come to people's Prime Minister choice down here, which was quite hilarious side trip to the whole thing.</p><p>It's really a fuss, an Australian populace(ph) has been a fuss pretty much for the last 10 years, and I've actually compared this now to at least Australian or famous incident where an Australian won a ice stadium gold medal at the Olympics since 2002 in Salt Lake City, not because he is the best guy, but because the four people ahead of him all fell over and he was the only one standing, crossing the line.</p><p>So I see Stone Mile(ph) which he's known down in Australia as the scathing(ph) bad breed(ph) of Australian politics.</p><p>SY: All right, but he's --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>That's an interesting metaphor, I wouldn't have thought Australians were particularly good at ice skating. But look, Morrison is not -- he is not a nobody, he's been in charge of the economy for what, the last three years.</p><p>The economy has been doing pretty well. What else do we know about Mr. Morrison and what his policies will be like going forward. Certainly, investors seem to like this change.</p><p>[16:35:00] KEEN: Well, him he's got more -- I thought I was going to use a different expression, but he's got more background than Malcolm Turnbull had and less ideology than Tony Abbott who was the previous conservative Prime Minister.</p><p>There's more likelihood he's going to be doing stuff as of course the property law, they did close for a substantial part of his pre-academic -- pre-political career, he was a lobbyist for the property lobbying in Australia when of course Australia has the longest-running property bubble.</p><p>So he'll be doing all he can to maintain that bubble and is the best thing right now. So he'll be pumping government money to keep the property mark otherwise, that will make him really very popular in Australian business and potentially with the electorate.</p><p>But I think he's really on a hiding to nothing to be the last liberal party prime minister before the Labor Party takes over at the next election which he'll delay for as long as possible.</p><p>SY: OK, you bring up a lot of stuff there, sir, so part of what you said, first of all, Australia's economy hasn't experienced a recession in more than a quarter of a century, but you just referred there to one of the economic pressures that was facing Turnbull.</p><p>From what I understand, wages are extremely stagnant and also there are high housing costs. So were those economic pressures playing in to voters' mind and did that lead in part to Turnbull, his fault?</p><p>KEEN: No, as entirely due to actually personal animosity, to go back and the liberal party 45 years when both Tony Abbott who was the previous prime minister that Malcolm shafted to get the job, and they were both students at Sydney University.</p><p>Both on the conservative side, no tiny staunchly conservative actually like Australia back to 1950s in the Curtin's politics, whereas the Turnbull is more a swath 1970s conservative in that sense. They hated each other at university and spent their entire time shafting each other there.</p><p>And now they're spending their time shafting each other in Australian politics in the house of parliament, and I think the most sensible thing that Scott Morrison could do will be to appoint Tony Abbott to be the high commissioner to London and get rid of them and remember particular council(ph) from the liberal party.</p><p>Whether he has the guts to do it, we'll find out shortly.</p><p>SY: All right, and we'll see how long the liberal party survives under all these circumstances. Steve Keen, thank you so much for your perspective on this.</p><p>KEEN: You're welcome.</p><p>SY: With Australia divided over climate policies, activists are gearing up for World Water week which starts on Sunday. CDP which helps companies manage their environment policies says more big firms are taking notice and putting plans in place over how they use water.</p><p>Cate Lamb is CDP's director of water security. Cate, thank you so much for being with us. First of all, how urgent is the issue of water security around the world?</p><p>CATE LAMB, DIRECTOR OF WATER SECURITY, CDP: Thank you for having me this evening Stephanie, I really appreciate being on board. The issue is that depends on where you are, ultimately, but for many, businesses is growing as an issue.</p><p>Just this year, we had more than 7,000 and -- excuse me, 3,770 risks that falls into CDP from the mid-west's largest growing at the world's largest businesses, and this is posing a threat, not only to their bottom-line, from a range of different reasons.</p><p>But we're seeing a range of physical reputational and regulatory risks that are looking over just the risks -- sorry, this is a total mess, but they're still coming around from a timeline of both short and long-term risks. Apologies, Stephanie.</p><p>SY: That's OK, you know, you know, essentially it's a pretty complicated set of risks that businesses face. Why don't you start by telling us which industries are being most impacted and will be most impacted by water scarcity issues in the near term.</p><p>LAMB: Sure thing, so there are range of industries that will effectively have metals in mining, there's organizations responsible for the production of food, of course, where agriculture accounts for more than 80 percent of global water use worldwide.</p><p>We have energy companies who is dependent upon water is really quite fundamental in order for them to succeed as an organization. And all of these sectors are going to be adversely affected by the situation as it increases.</p><p>At the UN for example is estimating that the world's supply of water is likely to hit a supply demand gap of around 40 percent in just 12 years time.</p><p>So while the world's -- as it turns water scarcity and water stresses off, impaired, what we're really experiencing is an increased competition for this finite results, and businesses are finding themselves on the frontline as they compete for access to this resource with communities, with the environment and with all that water uses within the basins that they're located.</p><p>[16:40:00] SY: Give us some examples, Cate, of how major corporations are taking action to protect their own bottom-lines, given these circumstances.</p><p>LAMB: Sure, at CDP, we believe that this closure is really a first and vital step in order to understand and mitigate the risks that companies are facing. And what we're seeing as a result of that is more than two and a half thousand companies disclosing to us on an annual basis.</p><p>We provide the same work that ultimately enables companies to better understand the challenges that they're facing and take appropriate steps. We have an example of Danone where they're pursuing nature as a source of solution to water-related risks.</p><p>They invested in a range of mine growth restoration projects in a wide range of locations -- apologies, in order to protect their fresh water resources that they rely upon. Well, beverage company AB InBev did the same, they're investing in river basin management plans, and also again they took solutions in order to protect the river that they're relying upon.</p><p>And Fiat-Chrysler, quite surprising perhaps to some of your watches today also have significant risks that they're facing and they planted 60,000 trees right across Latin America in a range of regions, in order to again protect the fresh water resources that they're relying upon, facing an increasing number of companies turning to perhaps non-traditional nature- based solutions that tackle these risks.</p><p>And excitingly in a report that we released just a couple of days ago, these solutions are coming in at a much lower costs than traditional great forms of infrastructure.</p><p>SY: There are of course long-term solutions and maybe also filling a vacuum where government policy in places like the U.S. and Australia are not. Cate Lamb, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>LAMB: Thank you Stephanie.</p><p>SY: Powerful heroes are battling for supremacy in Vancouver, at least in the world of professional video gaming. It's one of the biggest weekend's on the calendar for the growing phenomenon of ESports, details next.</p><p>SY: This weekend is one of the biggest ESports prices of the year. More than $25 million is up for grabs at the international; a professional video-gaming tournament in Vancouver. Matthew Black is a reporter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation joining me from Vancouver via Skype.</p><p>[16:45:00] Matt, I know you've been covering this industry for a while, but what's the atmosphere been like at the International, and how is that compared to what you might feel at a major sporting event?</p><p>MATTHEW BLACK, REPORTER, CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION: Well, people are very excited, it's a real big event, it's the biggest in the ESports calendar, the biggest money tournament and the last big money tournament was the one before this.</p><p>So the last four TIs, the last four TIs are the biggest. As far as the atmosphere here, it's not all that different from a normal sporting event. What the set up is like is you walk into the arena, the lights are turned down a bit, so it's a little different than your normal basketball, hockey game.</p><p>And when you go down into the sitting area, it's all dark and you see two teams enter these last post that are sound proof, they come out to entrance music, they come out to smoke and pyrotechnics, they begin playing and fans watch on a big screen, that's normally where the jumbotron would be where you would watch the highlights and plan unfold.</p><p>There's a lot of fans -- a lot of flags rather in the crowd, a lot of fans who come from different parts of the world, a lot of these teams come from one particular country or one particular part of the world. So it has a bit of a World Cup feel about it, but in terms of the actual atmosphere, you have cheering, you have booing, you have (INAUDIBLE) and eyeing, it's not all that different than your usual basketball or hockey game which we'd normally see at Rogers Arena at this time of year.</p><p>SY: So you've been covering ESports for a few years, Matt, and there are certainly some big media deals and sponsorships in the sector we've seen recently. But do you see ESports really going mainstream? Maybe even being at the Olympics one day.</p><p>BLACK: Yes, it has a way to go before that, there's certainly more and more support building for that, they have a few obstacles to get through. One of the realities is that videogames just change so fast, the most popular game on the planet right now is called Fortnight, it's the most streamed one.</p><p>Five years ago, no one had ever heard of it, so you can't trust that with a lot of Olympics sports that have been around for generations and that don't look all that different than they did a few decades ago. That will be one obstacle that they have to overcome.</p><p>But on the other hand, it's very hard to sell a hockey-size arena for one night, let alone six. And it's only that they're doing that, it's who is going to these events, it's really young people, that young audience that so many industries credit, and ESports seems to be able to deliver that better than anyone right now.</p><p>And so that's what's got organizations like the Olympics and many pro sports teams interested in this as well.</p><p>SY: Indeed, Matthew Black, a reporter for the CDC, thank you Matt, have fun. Now the International isn't the only big ESports event this weekend, the over-watched ESports league is holding its first ever all-star game. The event is being held in a sold-out Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles, a purpose-billed venue for professional video-gamers.</p><p>It's also being broadcast on Twitter. Brandon Snow is chief revenue officer of Activision Blizzard which operates this ESports League. Brandon, nice to meet you --</p><p>BRANDON SNOW, CHIEF REVENUE OFFICER, ESPORTS BLIZZARD: Thanks --</p><p>SY: And thanks for your time. The over-watched league has struck this deal with Twitter, can you give us some more details, and what does it mean for you guys and for Twitter, and for the burgeoning base of ESports fans?</p><p>SNOW: Sure of course. It's a wonderful partnership that we're going to enter in with Twitter. We're starting it off this weekend with our all- star game as you mentioned.</p><p>They will be showing near-live highlights on Twitter of those matches of the games played, and that will continue on as a multi-year arrangement into next season where they'll continue to show highlights of our games, a regular season games and we will have a weekly 30-minute live-streamed pre- game show to watch point also airing live under our platform into the next season.</p><p>SY: Now, I know that last month, ESPN signed a deal with you guys for TV rights, and the Overwatch League as well. How much importance do you place in the traditional media outlets versus say, the Twitters of the world or even comparing it to like the Amazon streaming Twitch --</p><p>SNOW: Right --</p><p>SY: As far as revenue?</p><p>SNOW: Sure, well, we want to make sure we have our content in every place where our fans are engaging with us. And Twitter is one part of that. We have a very important relationship with Twitch who as you mentioned streams all of our games live on their platform and then into this finals playoffs and final of this year, we entered into a relationship with \"Disney\" to show on linear our products.</p><p>And it was the first time to ever have live ESports event on the flagship products of ESPN. We had that on Friday night, and then rear of the entire finals on \"Abc\" the following Sunday. So for us, it's about continuing to grow, expand the audience, there's 40 million people playing Overwatch around the world and we want to make sure that we can engage them with the sport and in any way that they want to do that.</p><p>And that's whether it'd be digitally streamed linearly on television or through a short form, counting on Twitter.</p><p>SY: All right, I want to ask you the big, sort of the mountain top question which is where is the landscape for ESports right now. And how do you see that changing in that landscape in the future?</p><p>SNOW: Sure, we are in the cost of mainstream. If you think about the 2.2 million gamers that are out there, there's already 380 million people watching ESports.</p><p>[16:50:00] Eighty percent of those people are under the age of 35. And -- so we are in a situation of growth that is going to be impressive(ph), and I think as it relates to potentially existing stick and balls sports that you're aware of.</p><p>And at the Overwatch League, we're taking that model, but yet, I think we're moving it beyond to where it has been and improving. So as -- what I've commissioned is, we have a 12 league -- 12 team league, city-base franchise league, no different than you have with any traditional sports --</p><p>SY: Yes --</p><p>SNOW: And we have a vision of playing home and away games, no different than what you have in traditional sports. It's just that you engage in -- you do that in a digital space.</p><p>SY: I think one wants a piece of that ESports audience, I know that. Brandon Snow, Chief Revenue Officer of Activision Blizzard, thank you so much --</p><p>SNOW: Of course --</p><p>SY: For joining us --</p><p>SNOW: Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>SY: How do you make a super car 30 miles per hour slower and then tag on an extra $3 million to the price-tag. Bugatti has done just that, the company's president will join me to explain next.</p><p>SY: Bugatti's newest super car has 1,500 horsepower, costs twice as much as the previous model, it's 8 seconds faster and even if you have a spare 6 million bucks, you can't buy one because only 40 are being made and they're already sold out.</p><p>All right, stop showing me, show the car. Bugatti unveiled the Divo, a few hours ago, it's actually slower in terms of miles per hour than the current model the Chiron. But Bugatti says the Divo handles much better and so it goes faster around the track.</p><p>Stephan Winkelmann is the president of Bugatti joining me from Monterey, California. Stephan, how much --</p><p>STEPHAN WINKELMANN, PRESIDENT, BUGATTI: Hello --</p><p>SY: Hi, great to see you. How much of a technological leap is the Divo or is it just sort of a tweak version of your Chiron?</p><p>WINKELMANN: No, the Chiron is a different car, when we speak about performance, a different -- as you say, no, one is the longitudinal acceleration and the other one is the latitudinal(ph) acceleration. So the handling being nimble and agile.</p><p>And this is what we wanted to underline with this car. So we have a much safer short seat, we have an impressive down force, we have -- a design which is completely new.</p><p>[16:55:00] We have reduced the weight by more than -- so this is the real package which is very -- and which is bringing us to invest a lot of money into a car like this.</p><p>And on top of it, as you said, we only want to do 40, so this balance would create a collector's item and also a state of the art technology -- like this.</p><p>SY: You know, the Divo has been called the most expensive supercar in the world. You just talked about how much it costs to develop it, will the sale of 40 of these be profitable for Bugatti and its parent company Volkswagen?</p><p>WINKELMANN: Yes, we are a business case, even if it's not important, it has to be a business case and this is what we're looking at.</p><p>SY: OK, you also talked about the sort of cutting edge technology. I'm curious, given all that you must spend for research and development into a vehicle like this, how much do we see those technologies go into the design of other Volkswagen brands?</p><p>Could we see aspects of what we're seeing in this car? For example, in an Audi.</p><p>WINKELMANN: No, what we do here is specifically made for the Bugatti brand because we know our customers, we know the things we need to do, not only for the customers, but also to keep the brand at the highest possible level.</p><p>And therefore this always has to be the tip of the sphere and to have automotive technology.</p><p>SY: OK, you are going to be producing the Divo as well as the Chiron, I'm sorry, I mispronounced it earlier at the same time, I understand it's the first time that Bugatti is going to actually be producing two models at the same time. Is this the future for Bugatti?</p><p>And I have to ask since we see other luxury car-makers, even Rolls Royce, Bentley, Lamborghini branching out into things like SUVs, could you see that being in the future for your brand?</p><p>WINKELMANN: So I have to tell you that -- high-end luxury and super -- was founded back in '99 and next year we are going to celebrate 110 --</p><p>SY: Right --</p><p>WINKELMANN: In time, we have much more models, now we're having today on this day, and today, we are doing the Chiron and we will do the Divo.

Trading is over on this Friday, August 24th.  Tonight, stock  markets set some summertime records as Jay Powell promises the economy  won't overheat.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Donald Trump's money man gets immunity in the latest White House legal  drama, and it might be the most expensive super car in history.  I'll the  ask President of Bugatti about the new five million euro Divo.  I'm  Stephanie Sy, this is \"Quest Means Business.\"  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  Tonight, this is good news.  Those were the words of  US Fed  Chairman Jerome Powell who says the US economy is doing great and inflation  is in check.  In short, Powell says his policy of interest rate rises at  the Fed is working despite any criticism from President Donald Trump.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His comments sent markets flirting with a return to the record-setting  ways.  Let's take a look at the way the three indices ended today.  The Dow  up 140 points, and you can see new records set by the S&amp;P 500 as well as  the NASDAQ.  That brings our 2018 records here up.  The NASDAQ setting 26  records this year and the S&amp;P now at 15.  </p><p>Earlier at the New York Stock Exchange, trader Tim Anderson told \"Quest  Express\" that Jerome Powell's words are a breath of fresh air for  investors.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TIM ANDERSON, TRADER, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  I think that clearly his  comments are reassuring for the market and I also think there's this  underlying tone of his delivery not being a PhD economist.  It's almost  like a breath of fresh air.  He's very understandable for a lot of people  to listen to him, you don't have to be a Fed watcher to understand what  he's saying.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  It was clearly an upbeat appearance from the Fed Chairman at Jackson  Hole, Mr. Powell dismissed fears that the US economy is out of control  saying there is no sign of it overheating.  He did not address the  criticism he's received from President Trump over rate hikes; instead, he  insisted the Central Bank will stay on course for future rises.  Powell  also played down fears of rising inflation saying the Fed will do whatever  it takes to keep it in check.  Paul La Monica joins me now.  </p><p>Whatever it takes, that sounds actually like familiar verbiage.  Let's  start with the new records we saw.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ again beating  records.  How long will the party last and what drove that sentiment today?  </p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Yes, I think today, Stephanie, you  already talked about Jerome Powell's speech and I think that really did it.   He showed the market once again that he's confident about the US economy,  but the Fed has to try and keep inflation in check as well that's why  they're are going to be probably a couple more rate hikes this year, maybe  a few in 2019 as well and the market is okay with that.  </p><p>So even though the President has been attacking the Fed and criticizing  rate hikes, it's not something that Powell is going to change Fed policy  just because President Trump has been making noise about how rate hikes  might be bad news because the market clearly disagrees with the President.  </p><p>SY:  Now, earlier this week, we did hear Jerome Powell sort of nod at the  fact that trade tensions continue with Trump's aggressive trade policy  stance, that that could have future impacts on inflation as well as growth  and yet the markets really seemed to be shrugging that part of story off  and we did not hear a lot of mention about that again today.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  No, in the Fed minutes, you're right.  But the Fed did  acknowledge some members that trade concerns are an issue.  I think right  now, what we're still having is that while some companies have noted that  tariffs and trade issues are starting to hurt earnings, a lot of companies  said it's still just talk, that businesses are mentioning trade issues as a  concern, but it's not hurting the overall profit picture of the economy  just yet.  </p><p>And I the same thing is happening with consumers because Stephanie,  consumer spending has been great.  Retailers have reported for the most  part really strong results.  We're talking about brick and mortar retailers  also, not just Amazon.  </p><p>SY:  Yes, and the Targets of the world are saying this is among the best  consumer environments they've ever seen.  Again, I go back to the question  of how long this will last and why it's important even for Powell to  continue the gradual rate hikes in an environment where inflation doesn't  seem to be really going up at this point.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, inflation isn't going up all that much just yet, but it's  the type of thing that if you let it go unchecked, all of a sudden, you  have rampant inflation and rates would have to go a lot higher than what  the Fed would probably like.  </p><p>[16:05:08]  </p><p>LA MONICA:  I think they're happy and the market clearly is as well, which  is a couple of quarter-point hikes every few meetings.  That's something  that's manageable.  With regards to how much longer this rally can last, if  consumers keep spending, corporations keep spending, profit should still be  pretty good.  The dollar weakened today as well which should help multi- national companies going forward if that continues to go down.  </p><p>So I'm not going to say that this bull run goes on obviously forever.  It  has to peak at some point, but earnings are still justifying this rally it  appears.  </p><p>SY:  Yes, and I think it's interesting that you bring up basically the  notion of pre-emption being important with the gradual rate hikes.  Paul La  Monica, thank you very much.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you.  </p><p>SY:  Later on in the program, I'm going to be speaking to Alan Blinder who  was Vice Chairman of the Fed under Alan Greenspan.

Martin Savidge has more from Winnsboro, South Carolina.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The tariffs have been  incredible and ...  </p><p>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Even as they work for a President who  has proclaimed tariffs are the greatest, CNN has learned from two members  of the South Carolina congressional delegation, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley  and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney have been pushing for a tariff exemption  for a company in their home state.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>TRUMP:  We are winning on trade.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  President Trump says he wants to level the trade playing field by  imposing tariffs on as much as $200 billion more imported Chinese products  and parts.  Corporate leaders have been telling Washington how much those  tariffs will hurt business and the economy.  </p><p>But behind the scenes, Mulvaney and Ambassador Haley are advocating for a  small South Carolina company named Element Electronics to get something  every impacted company would love to have - an exemption for their Chinese  supplier.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MIKE FANNING, DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA STATE SENATE:  We  have advocates for South Carolina in this Element plant to include these  two individuals that are fighting for the unique case that we have that  could - that makes this policy impossible for us to implement in South  Carolina.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  South Carolina State Senator Mike Fanning welcomes Mulvaney and  Haley's help for Element which is in his district claiming Element deserves  the exemption because it's the only company in America assembling  television sets, selling them to Walmart.  Last month, Element shocked the  tiny town of Winnsboro, population 3,800 announcing it was shutting down,  and laying off 126 employees blaming Trump's proposed tariffs which the  company says will make its TVs too expensive.  </p><p>CNN has reached out to Element Electronics, but they have not responded to  multiple requests.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DAN RUFF, OWNER, RUFF HARDWARE:  Anytime jobs are lost, there's a  trickledown effect where people don't have money to spend.  They can't  spend and so it affects everyone.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Winnsboro and Fairfield County have had what one official calls  the \"year from hell.\"  In July 2017, the construction of two nuclear re  actors was abandoned resulting in the loss of close to 6,000 jobs, next  came the shuttering of a large textile mill that had provided jobs for more  than a century.  The county hospital is closing, and now Element,  Winnsboro's largest remaining private employer is poised to call it quits.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>FANNING:  It rocked me to my core.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Mulvaney and Haley both have a connection to Element.  In 2013,  then Governor Haley lured Element Electronics to the state by offering more  than $1 million of state money as well as tax incentives.  Later, she was  boasting about the economic benefits of the company in a promotional video  for Walmart.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>NIKKI HALEY, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS:   ...  Electronics, $7.5 million invested, 500 jobs in Winnsboro.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Before he was Trump's Budget Director, Nick Mulvaney was  Congressman Mulvaney representing the district where Elements set up shop  ...  </p><p>And you don't see the hypocrisy in his effort do that for his state?  </p><p>FANNING:  Absolutely not.  </p><p>SAVIDGE:  Fanning, a Democrat says Mulvaney and Haley's advocacy is neither  hypocritical nor political pointing out in 2016, his district voted  overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton.  He says the pair are helping because  it's justified.  </p><p>But the President's tariff pain will be felt nationwide and these  corporations want to cut backs and layoffs, many communities can only wish  they had two high level administration members fighting for them.  </p><p>Officials with Elements say that if they were to get an exemption or if  those proposed tariffs were to simply go away, they could be back in  business in a matter of months, possibly even think about expanding, which  would be a welcome dose of good news in this small economically hard hit  down.  Martin Savidge, CNN, Winnsboro South Carolina.  </p><p>[16:10:01]  </p><p>SY:  For more on the trade tension and Jerome Powell's speech, Alan Blinder  is the former Vice Chair of the US Fed and he joins me from the action in  Jackson Hole.  Professor Blinder, thank you so much for your time.  I want  to just get your interpretation on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's speech.  </p><p>ALAN BLINDER, FORMER VICE CHAIRMAN, US FEDERAL RESERVE:  I think it was  very much in defense of status quo which, again, the status quo path, the  path is now - that the Fed is now on and he was giving every indication  we'll continue to be on.  I think if you want to place this in the - at the  margin, was this hawkish or dovish?  I think it was dovish and whatever you  believe, which does not contradict what I just said about interest rates  going up, because the dovishness is about the stopping point.  How far do  you push this?  </p><p>So if you had to choose between reading this as a little hawkish, that  there was a little bit of that and a little dovish, I think it was more of  the latter.  </p><p>SY:  There were, in this path that you're referring to, is that there are  two more planned rate hikes before the end of the year.  Now, based on that  rate of inflation, and Powell's comments that the economy does not seem to  overhearing, do you predict the Fed will stick with both of those hikes?   Is that how you interpreted Powell's comments?  </p><p>BLINDER:  Yes, I think it's likely.  The September one is baked in the  cake, that's for sure.  We're almost there.  Things can happen between now  and December.  That's still a few months away, but I think if the economy  keeps trundling along the path on which it's been trundling, a December  rate hike of another 25 basis points is quite likely.  That's when the Fed  will start getting into serious decision making, how much further, if any,  do we want to go?  </p><p>SY:  They want to avoid that inverted yield curve, I know and the potential  for recession.  I want to kind of switch gears here, sir, because you  probably follow President Trump's tweets criticizing that path to gradually  hike rates that his own appointed Fed Chair, Jerome Powell has set the  Federal on.  How vulnerable do you think this Fed is to political pressure,  especially with the high stakes midterm elections in the US coming up in  November?  </p><p>BLINDER:  It's a very good question.  I think the answer is only modestly.   Because you ask yourself what could Trump do to the Fed?  He's already  appointed Powell instead of some incapable crony of his own, which would  not have been a surprise from President Trump.  Powell is a good man.  He  believes in the independence of the Fed, he has said so, if necessary, he  will say so.  Again, he's got complete 100% banking - backing from inside  the Fed on that subject.  </p><p>I think he has very substantial backing, though not a hundred percent from  members of Congress in their oversight capacity.  So what Trump can do is  two things.  Her can make a nasty tweet as we've seen is his want in many,  many, many context and sometimes they scare people and sometimes they  don't.  I don't think the Fed will scare that easily; or he could use his  remaining  appointment powers.  There's still vacancies on the Fed, in  great distinction to what he's been doing up to now to put terrible people  on the Federal Reserve Board.  That is not what he has chosen to do up to  now.  His appointments to the Fed, his nominees have been good and we hope  it will continue that way, but he does have the capability, if he gets mad,  to send people that will just make Jay Powell's life miserable.  </p><p>SY:  Before I let you go, I want to get your comment on another issue I  know you've been talking about and that is the trade tensions that the  Trump policies have begun.  The Fed did refer in their minutes to these  ongoing tensions and the potential for negative effects.  From the Fed's  point of view, what can they do to mitigate risks to inflation or  potentially growth that Trump's aggressive trade policy might pose?  </p><p>BLINDER:  I think pretty much nothing.  They're watching like all of us are  with no ability to influence trade policy nor should they have, by the way.   The Fed has a great independence.  We were just talking about - though  within the prescribed area and that does not include trade policy.  If it  happens - well, I shouldn't say if it happens, it is happening and the only  question is how severe this trade shock is going to get.  </p><p>A trade shock is a supply shock to the Central Bank, so it's analogous to  giving them the same dilemma that they have in the old days when oil prices  would shoot up.  That causes a bit more inflation.  In this case, it's a  bit more than the oil shock case way back, it was a lot more.  But in this  case, it's a bit more and it takes a bit of a bite out of growth.  </p><p>[16:15:10]  </p><p>BLINDER:  Neither one of those is good and that leaves the Fed with the  same dilemma it had back in the oil shock days.  Do you expand the economy  to make up for the lost growth or do you try to push against the man to  stand against the rise in inflation?  That's the kind of choice the Fed  will have with a big trade war.  </p><p>SY:  All right.  Alan Blinder, thank you so much for your perspective from  Jackson Hole.  </p><p>BLINDER:  Sure.  You're welcome.  Bye.  </p><p>SY:  Still ahead, the man who looked after the US President's business has  been granted immunity in the probe into hush money payments.  And Mr. Trump  says social media companies are censoring people at the same time,  America's tech CEOs are meeting to talk about security during the next  election.  </p><p>The legal troubles which surround some of the US President's former  associates are now reaching the very highest levels of Donald Trump's  business empire.  Sources tell CNN that the Trump organization's Chief  Financial Officer has been granted immunity by Federal prosecutors in the  hush money probe against his former attorney - Trump's former attorney,  Michael Cohen.  </p><p>Cristina Alesci joins me now, lots of details to get to, Cristina.  So,  I'll let you jump right in.  The man we're talking about is Allen  Weisselberg.  He is the CFO of the Trump organization.  Why has he been  granted immunity and what did he give in exchange for it?  </p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, CORRESPONDENT, CNNMONEY:  Well, Federal prosecutors  granted Allen Weisselberg immunity in exchange for information about  Michael Cohen in connection to the investigation into hush money payments  that Michael Cohen made to women who allegedly had affairs with the  President.  </p><p>This is significant because of who Allen Weisselberg is.  He's the Chief  Financial Officer, yes, and that's a big title in most companies, but in  the Trump organization, this man knew everything about the company's  finances.  He worked for Donald Trump's father.  And he knew exactly what  money came in and what money came out.  He helped prepare the organizations  - he helped prepare taxes.  When President Trump left for Washington, DC,  he left the company in the care of his two sons and Allen Weisselberg.  </p><p>[16:20:04]  </p><p>ALESCI:  So outside of family members, Weisselberg is probably the person  who knows more about the organization than anyone else.  This is not a  person that Donald Trump can say, \"Oh, he doesn't know much.  Oh, he's not  that important,\" the way that he's been trying to do with Michael Cohen.  </p><p>SY:  Is it being suggested that he knows anything that would further  implicate the President in potentially being a co-conspirator in what Cohen  has been charged with which we should remind our viewers which is basically  a violation, a felony violation of US campaign finance law by paying hush  money which in kind is considered a campaign contribution.  </p><p>ALESCI:  Right.  Undeclared ...  </p><p>SY:  Beyond the limits ...  </p><p>ALESCI:  Right.  That's an excellent question.  What we do know is that  Allen Weisselberg was subpoenaed by Federal prosecutors and we know that  there was a deal between Allen Weisselberg's attorney and Federal  prosecutors, but we don't know the scope of the deal.  And when I say deal,  I mean what information is he going to provide.  We don't have the  specifics of that deal, so we don't know whether or not Allen Weisselberg  provided any significant information as to whether the President knew about  these payments when he knew about the payments which is part of the whole  larger question that we're trying to get out since Michael Cohen turned  himself in and that information suggested and implicated the President.  </p><p>SY:  Well, Cohen said straight up that the President directed him to do  this to influence the campaign.  We may see corroboration.  I guess, that's  one of the questions.  </p><p>ALESCI:  Well, that's one of the questions out there.  Can Michael Cohen  really corroborate that?  Does he have evidence of that?  </p><p>SY:  All right, Cristina Alesci, I know you'll keep following it.  Thanks  so much.  </p><p>Donald Trump is targeting the so-called social media giants and accusing  them of censorship.  The President said they silenced millions of people,  that's before he went after CNN again.  </p><p>Earlier this week, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey told CNN that Twitter does not  discriminate against anyone's political views.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>JACK DORSEY, CEO, TWITTER:  The real question behind the question is are we  doing something according to political ideology or viewpoints?  And we are  not, period.  We do not look at content with regards to political viewpoint  or ideology.  We look at behavior and we use that behavior as a signal to  add to relevance.  We need to constantly show that we are not adding our  own bias, which I fully admit is more left leaning.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  Twitter is among a group of companies meeting today to talk about US  election security.  Clare Sebastian is here.  Clare, good to see you.  I  want to be clear, this is sort of two different stories.  There's a story  of Trump alleging bias at social media companies, that they're somehow  censoring specifically right wing voices within their newsfeeds, and then  there's this meeting that's happening today between all these big tech  social media companies about how to secure their platforms ahead of the  midterms, right?  </p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CORRESPONDENT, CNN:  Right, exactly.  This is a private  meeting.  We know from a source close to the meeting that it's happening.   We think it's happening at Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco, and it  involves Twitter, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and a number of other tech  companies.  And what's really interesting about this is that we're starting  to see the seeds of coordination.  </p><p>This is the second time that these tech companies have met in a couple of  months.  They met back in May as well - also with officials from DHS and  from the FBI.  So we're seeing kind of more coordination between these tech  companies themselves and potentially the government as well and what it  really speaks to is the fact that they're trying to get out in front of  this problem of manipulation and misinformation before the midterms.  </p><p>We've seen the precipitous loss of trust in these platforms after what  happened in 2016 and since then, they're really trying to show that they're  getting out in front of it.  They've been very active this week with a  number of updates on how they've been taking down abusive accounts and  combating these issues.  </p><p>SY:  Besides it being sort of also an exercise in PR, do you foresee there  being any technological breakthrough that would put these - they're all  such different platforms with different issues that happens, so is that the  type of coordination we might see, a concrete way for them to better secure  their sites?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Well, they will be investing heavily in cyber security and  threat intelligence and ways to identify where the threats are coming from.   So, I think in that respect, they all have these highly - most of the big  ones, Google and Facebook for example, have these highly developed units  that do security.  </p><p>So, certainly perhaps those groups will be able to coordinate.  But I  think, it's interesting, if you look back at what we've seen, when it comes  to election interference and all the misinformation that we've seen since  then, quite often, you see accounts mirrored across Twitter, Facebook issue  - so in that respect, I think it's certainly a good idea for them to work  together.  </p><p>[16:25:04]  </p><p>SY:  And a lot of times, those are trolls or bots.  Speaking of that, we  are learning, this is a really interesting story that the Russian operated  internet research agency which interfered in the US election according to  US intelligence has now also been linked to the debate over vaccinations  and the anti-vax movement.  Clare, how did this all emerge?  And why would  Russian trolls care about that debate?  </p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Well, this is a study from the \"American Journal of Public  Health\" who had been studying tweets specifically over the course of three  years, 2014 to 2017 and they found automated bots, but they also found  accounts that they say are linked to the internet research agency which is  this shadowy organization that has been closely linked by the Mueller  investigation now to election interference.  </p><p>And this is really interesting because it mirrors - it's a very different  area, obviously public health.  We haven't seen that before.  But it  mirrors the kind of tactics we' seen before.  They're not coming down on  one side of the debate.  They say that they found them on both the pro and  anti-vaccine side.  And what we see there is again what we've seen before,  they're trying to drive to the extremes, they're trying to polarize.   They've done an enormous amount of research into the divisive issues in  American social and political life and they take them and they try and  amplify those divisions.  That's what we're seeing here.  </p><p>SY:  Troubling.  Clare Sebastian, thank you so much.  No Australian Prime  Minister has served out a full term in office in more than a decade.  And  now, there's another new leader in Canberra.  We'll take a look at  Australia's political upheaval, next.  </p><p>Hello, I'm Stephanie Sy, coming up on the next half hour of \"Quest Means  Business\" we'll be live in Vancouver where there's $25 million up for grabs  in this weekend's e-sports tournament there and I'll be live with the  President of Bugatti who has just unveiled a brand new $5 million hyper  car.  </p><p>First these are the top headlines we're following on CNN this hour.  </p><p>[16:30:05]  </p><p>The United States has abruptly called off a meeting with North Korea.   President Donald Trump cancelled plans for his Secretary of State Mike  Pompeo to begin another round of talks on denuclearization. </p><p>Mr. Trump cited insufficient progress on the issue and also blamed the  trade battle with China for the cancellation.  A legal challenge to  Zimbabwe's presidential election results has been rejected by its  constitutional court.  It upheld President Emmerson Mnangagwa's win in the  July 30th context. </p><p>Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa contested his loss at the polls which he  called fraudulent and illegal.  Mnangagwa's inauguration remains scheduled  for Saturday.  The family of U.S. Senator John McCain says he has decided  to discontinue treatment for brain cancer. </p><p>He was diagnosed a year ago and spent part of that time at work on Capitol  Hill.  McCain drew the ire of President Donald Trump by casting the  deciding vote to save Obamacare.  A source tells Cnn that the Chief  Financial Officer for the Trump Organization has been granted immunity in  the investigation into Michael Cohen. </p><p>The source says Allen Weisselberg was interviewed several weeks ago about  the hush money paid up to two women who say they had affairs with the U.S.  President.  Pope Francis heads to Ireland this weekend as the Vatican is  urged to take action on the clergy's sex abuse scandal engulfing the  church. </p><p>The Pope will say a mass and is expected to meet with abuse survivors  during his visit.  The first by a Pope to that country in decades.   Australia has a new Prime Minister.  Former cabinet member Scott Morrison  were sworn in on Friday, becoming the fifth person to take the job in the  past five years.</p><p>Now, he's appealing to voters and businesses alike with calls for unity.   Mr. Morrison's predecessor Malcolm Turnbull was forced out of office Friday  by rivals within his own party.  As Scott Morrison assumes his new role,  the former Treasurer-turned leader is already looking to shape economic  policy. </p><p>He made an appeal to voters, Friday, saying, quote, \"the best form of  welfare is a job.\"  He says he believes Australians should keep more of  what they earn.  Australia's stock market have fluctuated on the news from  Canberra, stocks were gripped by a three-day losing streak as the  leadership crisis played out this week.</p><p>But rebounded Friday as Mr. Morrison took office.  The CEO of Australian  Airline Qantas says the uncertainty was quote, \"disappointing and  frustrating\", Alan Joyce called the shake-up not helpful. </p><p>Let's talk more about this leadership change and the market reaction with  Steve Keen, professor of economics at Kingston University joining me via  Skype from Amsterdam.  Steve, thank you so much for joining us.  You know,  the insurgency and Turnbull's party started as I understand it because MPs  actually wanted to install a man named Peter Duncan as PM.</p><p>And he's been -- that Peter Duncan guy has been compared to Donald Trump  actually, and yet Morrison ends up Prime Minister in the end.  Those guys - - neither Duncan or Morrison would have been elected.  So what are voters  thinking, are they happy with this change? </p><p>STEVE KEEN, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, KINGSTON UNIVERSITY:  Oh, actually,  you've got his name wrong, but that's not a problem because you're going to  be a forgotten in politics in a very -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SY:  Peter -- excuse me? Peter Dutton, excuse me, Peter Dutton -- </p><p>KEEN:  Kind of stop them, yes -- </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>KEEN:  Is actually been mistaken for now, and finally nothing has been  mistaken for an American entrepreneur selling pop-corn is never come to  people's Prime Minister choice down here, which was quite hilarious side  trip to the whole thing.</p><p>It's really a fuss, an Australian populace(ph) has been a fuss pretty much  for the last 10 years, and I've actually compared this now to at least  Australian or famous incident where an Australian won a ice stadium gold  medal at the Olympics since 2002 in Salt Lake City, not because he is the  best guy, but because the four people ahead of him all fell over and he was  the only one standing, crossing the line.</p><p>So I see Stone Mile(ph) which he's known down in Australia as the  scathing(ph) bad breed(ph) of Australian politics. </p><p>SY:  All right, but he's -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>That's an interesting metaphor, I wouldn't have thought Australians were  particularly good at ice skating.  But look, Morrison is not -- he is not a  nobody, he's been in charge of the economy for what, the last three years. </p><p>The economy has been doing pretty well.  What else do we know about Mr.  Morrison and what his policies will be like going forward.  Certainly,  investors seem to like this change. </p><p>[16:35:00] KEEN:  Well, him he's got more -- I thought I was going to use a  different expression, but he's got more background than Malcolm Turnbull  had and less ideology than Tony Abbott who was the previous conservative  Prime Minister.</p><p>There's more likelihood he's going to be doing stuff as of course the  property law, they did close for a substantial part of his pre-academic --  pre-political career, he was a lobbyist for the property lobbying in  Australia when of course Australia has the longest-running property bubble.</p><p>So he'll be doing all he can to maintain that bubble and is the best thing  right now.  So he'll be pumping government money to keep the property mark  otherwise, that will make him really very popular in Australian business  and potentially with the electorate.</p><p>But I think he's really on a hiding to nothing to be the last liberal party  prime minister before the Labor Party takes over at the next election which  he'll delay for as long as possible.</p><p>SY:  OK, you bring up a lot of stuff there, sir, so part of what you said,  first of all, Australia's economy hasn't experienced a recession in more  than a quarter of a century, but you just referred there to one of the  economic pressures that was facing Turnbull. </p><p>From what I understand, wages are extremely stagnant and also there are  high housing costs.  So were those economic pressures playing in to voters'  mind and did that lead in part to Turnbull, his fault? </p><p>KEEN:  No, as entirely due to actually personal animosity, to go back and  the liberal party 45 years when both Tony Abbott who was the previous prime  minister that Malcolm shafted to get the job, and they were both students  at Sydney University. </p><p>Both on the conservative side, no tiny staunchly conservative actually like  Australia back to 1950s in the Curtin's politics, whereas the Turnbull is  more a swath 1970s conservative in that sense.  They hated each other at  university and spent their entire time shafting each other there.</p><p>And now they're spending their time shafting each other in Australian  politics in the house of parliament, and I think the most sensible thing  that Scott Morrison could do will be to appoint Tony Abbott to be the high  commissioner to London and get rid of them and remember particular  council(ph) from the liberal party. </p><p>Whether he has the guts to do it, we'll find out shortly.</p><p>SY:  All right, and we'll see how long the liberal party survives under all  these circumstances.  Steve Keen, thank you so much for your perspective on  this. </p><p>KEEN:  You're welcome.  </p><p>SY:  With Australia divided over climate policies, activists are gearing up  for World Water week which starts on Sunday.  CDP which helps companies  manage their environment policies says more big firms are taking notice and  putting plans in place over how they use water. </p><p>Cate Lamb is CDP's director of water security.  Cate, thank you so much for  being with us.  First of all, how urgent is the issue of water security  around the world? </p><p>CATE LAMB, DIRECTOR OF WATER SECURITY, CDP:  Thank you for having me this  evening Stephanie, I really appreciate being on board.  The issue is that  depends on where you are, ultimately, but for many, businesses is growing  as an issue. </p><p>Just this year, we had more than 7,000 and -- excuse me, 3,770 risks that  falls into CDP from the mid-west's largest growing at the world's largest  businesses, and this is posing a threat, not only to their bottom-line,  from a range of different reasons. </p><p>But we're seeing a range of physical reputational and regulatory risks that  are looking over just the risks -- sorry, this is a total mess, but they're  still coming around from a timeline of both short and long-term risks.   Apologies, Stephanie.</p><p>SY:  That's OK, you know, you know, essentially it's a pretty complicated  set of risks that businesses face.  Why don't you start by telling us which  industries are being most impacted and will be most impacted by water  scarcity issues in the near term.</p><p>LAMB:  Sure thing, so there are range of industries that will effectively  have metals in mining, there's organizations responsible for the production  of food, of course, where agriculture accounts for more than 80 percent of  global water use worldwide. </p><p>We have energy companies who is dependent upon water is really quite  fundamental in order for them to succeed as an organization.  And all of  these sectors are going to be adversely affected by the situation as it  increases. </p><p>At the UN for example is estimating that the world's supply of water is  likely to hit a supply demand gap of around 40 percent in just 12 years  time.  </p><p>So while the world's -- as it turns water scarcity and water stresses off,  impaired, what we're really experiencing is an increased competition for  this finite results, and businesses are finding themselves on the frontline  as they compete for access to this resource with communities, with the  environment and with all that water uses within the basins that they're  located. </p><p>[16:40:00] SY:  Give us some examples, Cate, of how major corporations are  taking action to protect their own bottom-lines, given these circumstances.</p><p>LAMB:  Sure, at CDP, we believe that this closure is really a first and  vital step in order to understand and mitigate the risks that companies are  facing.  And what we're seeing as a result of that is more than two and a  half thousand companies disclosing to us on an annual basis. </p><p>We provide the same work that ultimately enables companies to better  understand the challenges that they're facing and take appropriate steps.   We have an example of Danone where they're pursuing nature as a source of  solution to water-related risks.</p><p>They invested in a range of mine growth restoration projects in a wide  range of locations -- apologies, in order to protect their fresh water  resources that they rely upon.  Well, beverage company AB InBev did the  same, they're investing in river basin management plans, and also again  they took solutions in order to protect the river that they're relying  upon.</p><p>And Fiat-Chrysler, quite surprising perhaps to some of your watches today  also have significant risks that they're facing and they planted 60,000  trees right across Latin America in a range of regions, in order to again  protect the fresh water resources that they're relying upon, facing an  increasing number of companies turning to perhaps non-traditional nature- based solutions that tackle these risks. </p><p>And excitingly in a report that we released just a couple of days ago,  these solutions are coming in at a much lower costs than traditional great  forms of infrastructure.</p><p>SY:  There are of course long-term solutions and maybe also filling a  vacuum where government policy in places like the U.S. and Australia are  not.  Cate Lamb, thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>LAMB:  Thank you Stephanie.</p><p>SY:  Powerful heroes are battling for supremacy in Vancouver, at least in  the world of professional video gaming.

Matthew Black is a reporter for the  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation joining me from Vancouver via Skype.</p><p>[16:45:00] Matt, I know you've been covering this industry for a while, but  what's the atmosphere been like at the International, and how is that  compared to what you might feel at a major sporting event?</p><p>MATTHEW BLACK, REPORTER, CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION:  Well, people  are very excited, it's a real big event, it's the biggest in the ESports  calendar, the biggest money tournament and the last big money tournament  was the one before this.</p><p>So the last four TIs, the last four TIs are the biggest.  As far as the  atmosphere here, it's not all that different from a normal sporting event.   What the set up is like is you walk into the arena, the lights are turned  down a bit, so it's a little different than your normal basketball, hockey  game. </p><p>And when you go down into the sitting area, it's all dark and you see two  teams enter these last post that are sound proof, they come out to entrance  music, they come out to smoke and pyrotechnics, they begin playing and fans  watch on a big screen, that's normally where the jumbotron would be where  you would watch the highlights and plan unfold. </p><p>There's a lot of fans -- a lot of flags rather in the crowd, a lot of fans  who come from different parts of the world, a lot of these teams come from  one particular country or one particular part of the world.  So it has a  bit of a World Cup feel about it, but in terms of the actual atmosphere,  you have cheering, you have booing, you have (INAUDIBLE) and eyeing, it's  not all that different than your usual basketball or hockey game which we'd  normally see at Rogers Arena at this time of year. </p><p>SY:  So you've been covering ESports for a few years, Matt, and there are  certainly some big media deals and sponsorships in the sector we've seen  recently.  But do you see ESports really going mainstream? Maybe even being  at the Olympics one day. </p><p>BLACK:  Yes, it has a way to go before that, there's certainly more and  more support building for that, they have a few obstacles to get through.   One of the realities is that videogames just change so fast, the most  popular game on the planet right now is called Fortnight, it's the most  streamed one.</p><p>Five years ago, no one had ever heard of it, so you can't trust that with a  lot of Olympics sports that have been around for generations and that don't  look all that different than they did a few decades ago.  That will be one  obstacle that they have to overcome. </p><p>But on the other hand, it's very hard to sell a hockey-size arena for one  night, let alone six.  And it's only that they're doing that, it's who is  going to these events, it's really young people, that young audience that  so many industries credit, and ESports seems to be able to deliver that  better than anyone right now.</p><p>And so that's what's got organizations like the Olympics and many pro  sports teams interested in this as well.</p><p>SY:  Indeed, Matthew Black, a reporter for the CDC, thank you Matt, have  fun.  Now the International isn't the only big ESports event this weekend,  the over-watched ESports league is holding its first ever all-star game.   The event is being held in a sold-out Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles, a  purpose-billed venue for professional video-gamers. </p><p>It's also being broadcast on Twitter.  Brandon Snow is chief revenue  officer of Activision Blizzard which operates this ESports League.   Brandon, nice to meet you -- </p><p>BRANDON SNOW, CHIEF REVENUE OFFICER, ESPORTS BLIZZARD:  Thanks -- </p><p>SY:  And thanks for your time.  The over-watched league has struck this  deal with Twitter, can you give us some more details, and what does it mean  for you guys and for Twitter, and for the burgeoning base of ESports fans?</p><p>SNOW:  Sure of course.  It's a wonderful partnership that we're going to  enter in with Twitter.  We're starting it off this weekend with our all- star game as you mentioned.  </p><p>They will be showing near-live highlights on Twitter of those matches of  the games played, and that will continue on as a multi-year arrangement  into next season where they'll continue to show highlights of our games, a  regular season games and we will have a weekly 30-minute live-streamed pre- game show to watch point also airing live under our platform into the next  season.  </p><p>SY:  Now, I know that last month, ESPN signed a deal with you guys for TV  rights, and the Overwatch League as well.  How much importance do you place  in the traditional media outlets versus say, the Twitters of the world or  even comparing it to like the Amazon streaming Twitch -- </p><p>SNOW:  Right -- </p><p>SY:  As far as revenue? </p><p>SNOW:  Sure, well, we want to make sure we have our content in every place  where our fans are engaging with us.  And Twitter is one part of that.  We  have a very important relationship with Twitch who as you mentioned streams  all of our games live on their platform and then into this finals playoffs  and final of this year, we entered into a relationship with \"Disney\" to  show on linear our products.</p><p>And it was the first time to ever have live ESports event on the flagship  products of ESPN.  We had that on Friday night, and then rear of the entire  finals on \"Abc\" the following Sunday.  So for us, it's about continuing to  grow, expand the audience, there's 40 million people playing Overwatch  around the world and we want to make sure that we can engage them with the  sport and in any way that they want to do that. </p><p>And that's whether it'd be digitally streamed linearly on television or  through a short form, counting on Twitter.  </p><p>SY:  All right, I want to ask you the big, sort of the mountain top  question which is where is the landscape for ESports right now.  And how do  you see that changing in that landscape in the future? </p><p>SNOW:  Sure, we are in the cost of mainstream.  If you think about the 2.2  million gamers that are out there, there's already 380 million people  watching ESports.  </p><p>[16:50:00] Eighty percent of those people are under the age of 35.  And --  so we are in a situation of growth that is going to be impressive(ph), and  I think as it relates to potentially existing stick and balls sports that  you're aware of. </p><p>And at the Overwatch League, we're taking that model, but yet, I think  we're moving it beyond to where it has been and improving.  So as -- what  I've commissioned is, we have a 12 league -- 12 team league, city-base  franchise league, no different than you have with any traditional sports -- </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>SNOW:  And we have a vision of playing home and away games, no different  than what you have in traditional sports.  It's just that you engage in --  you do that in a digital space.</p><p>SY:  I think one wants a piece of that ESports audience, I know that.   Brandon Snow, Chief Revenue Officer of Activision Blizzard, thank you so  much -- </p><p>SNOW:  Of course -- </p><p>SY:  For joining us -- </p><p>SNOW:  Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>SY:  How do you make a super car 30 miles per hour slower and then tag on  an extra $3 million to the price-tag.  Bugatti has done just that, the  company's president will join me to explain next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  Bugatti's newest super car has 1,500 horsepower, costs twice as much  as the previous model, it's 8 seconds faster and even if you have a spare 6  million bucks, you can't buy one because only 40 are being made and they're  already sold out.</p><p>All right, stop showing me, show the car.  Bugatti unveiled the Divo, a few  hours ago, it's actually slower in terms of miles per hour than the current  model the Chiron.  But Bugatti says the Divo handles much better and so it  goes faster around the track. </p><p>Stephan Winkelmann is the president of Bugatti joining me from Monterey,  California.  Stephan, how much -- </p><p>STEPHAN WINKELMANN, PRESIDENT, BUGATTI:  Hello -- </p><p>SY:  Hi, great to see you.  How much of a technological leap is the Divo or  is it just sort of a tweak version of your Chiron?</p><p>WINKELMANN:  No, the Chiron is a different car, when we speak about  performance, a different -- as you say, no, one is the longitudinal  acceleration and the other one is the latitudinal(ph) acceleration.  So the  handling being nimble and agile. </p><p>And this is what we wanted to underline with this car.  So we have a much  safer short seat, we have an impressive down force, we have -- a design  which is completely new.  </p><p>[16:55:00] We have reduced the weight by more than -- so this is the real  package which is very -- and which is bringing us to invest a lot of money  into a car like this.</p><p>And on top of it, as you said, we only want to do 40, so this balance would  create a collector's item and also a state of the art technology -- like  this.</p><p>SY:  You know, the Divo has been called the most expensive supercar in the  world.  You just talked about how much it costs to develop it, will the  sale of 40 of these be profitable for Bugatti and its parent company  Volkswagen?</p><p>WINKELMANN:  Yes, we are a business case, even if it's not important, it  has to be a business case and this is what we're looking at.</p><p>SY:  OK, you also talked about the sort of cutting edge technology.  I'm  curious, given all that you must spend for research and development into a  vehicle like this, how much do we see those technologies go into the design  of other Volkswagen brands? </p><p>Could we see aspects of what we're seeing in this car? For example, in an  Audi. </p><p>WINKELMANN:  No, what we do here is specifically made for the Bugatti brand  because we know our customers, we know the things we need to do, not only  for the customers, but also to keep the brand at the highest possible  level. </p><p>And therefore this always has to be the tip of the sphere and to have  automotive technology. </p><p>SY:  OK, you are going to be producing the Divo as well as the Chiron, I'm  sorry, I mispronounced it earlier at the same time, I understand it's the  first time that Bugatti is going to actually be producing two models at the  same time.  Is this the future for Bugatti?</p><p>And I have to ask since we see other luxury car-makers, even Rolls Royce,  Bentley, Lamborghini branching out into things like SUVs, could you see  that being in the future for your brand?</p><p>WINKELMANN:  So I have to tell you that -- high-end luxury and super -- was  founded back in '99 and next year we are going to celebrate 110 -- </p><p>SY:  Right -- </p><p>WINKELMANN:  In time, we have much more models, now we're having  today on  this day, and today, we are doing the Chiron and we will do the Divo.  And  if you ask me if that this is -- </p><p>SY:  OK -- </p><p>WINKELMANN:  Ready for more, then yes, the Bugatti brand is ready for more.</p><p>SY:  Stephan Winkelmann, president of Bugatti, thank you so much, we'll  have to end it there.  And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, I'm Stephanie Sy,  the news continues here on CNN.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED.

Since the beginning of the year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost about 10 percent of its value, as did the S&amp;P 500. The Nasdaq dropped roughly 8 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The vast majority of losses have come since October, when the stock market, which was experiencing the longest bull run in history, took a turn for the worst. The stock market was on pace for its worst December since 1931, but avoided doing so by making record single-day gains last Wednesday, when the Dow jumped by more than 1,000 points.</p><p>The stock market woes come despite signs that the general economy is still doing well - with record low unemployment, strong GDP growth and relatively low inflation.</p><p>But this year, a number of other factors outweighed those positive economic indicators. President Donald Trump's trade war with China, the slowdown in global economic growth and concern that the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates too quickly all contributed to a pessimistic reaction from the stock market. The federal government shutdown that began early Saturday has only added to the anxiety.</p><p>Many of the same factors that affected the economy in 2018 are likely to continue into the new year.

The Nasdaq dropped roughly 8 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The vast majority of losses have come since October, when the stock market, which was experiencing the longest bull run in history, took a turn for the worst. The stock market was on pace for its worst December since 1931, but avoided doing so by making record single-day gains last Wednesday, when the Dow jumped by more than 1,000 points.</p><p>The stock market woes come despite signs that the general economy is still doing well - with record low unemployment, strong GDP growth and relatively low inflation.</p><p>But this year, a number of other factors outweighed those positive economic indicators. President Donald Trump's trade war with China, the slowdown in global economic growth and concern that the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates too quickly all contributed to a pessimistic reaction from the stock market. The federal government shutdown that began early Saturday has only added to the anxiety.</p><p>Many of the same factors that affected the economy in 2018 are likely to continue into the new year.

Some of those concerns included the Department of Justice announcing a probe into the \"market-leading online platforms,\" the weaker-than-expected eurozone flash manufacturing PMI for July, and Caterpillar lowering its full-year EPS guidance.\u00a0<br/>Notable earnings-related gainers included<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Visa </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">V </emphasis>183.33, +2.43, +1.3%),\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UPS\u00a0</emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UPS </emphasis>114.39, +9.12, +8.7%),\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Texas Instruments </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TXN </emphasis>129.00, +8.93, +7.4%), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Northrop Grumman </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NOC\u00a0</emphasis>342.97, +18.98, +5.9%), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chipotle Mexican Grill </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CMG </emphasis>777.96, +38.36, +5.2%), and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Snap </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SNAP </emphasis>17.61, +2.78, +18.8%). The market's ability to find support in these companies was encouraging for investors worried about market leadership being too concentrated among a handful of tech giants.\u00a0<br/>The S&amp;P 500 communication services (+0.9%) and financials (+0.9%) sectors were the day's best-performing sectors. Semiconductor stocks had a field day, rallying on Texas Instruments' solid results. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index advanced 3.1%, boosting its year-to-date gain to a staggering 40%.<br/>Conversely, the consumer staples (-0.6%), real estate (-0.1%), and materials (-0.02%) sectors finished lower.\u00a0<br/>Separately, for most of the day, the DoJ regulatory threat weighed on shares of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook\u00a0</emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FB </emphasis>204.66, +2.30, +1.1%),\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AMZN </emphasis>2000.81, +6.32, +0.3%), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOOG </emphasis>1137.81, -8.40, -0.7%), and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AAPL </emphasis>208.67, -0.17, -0.1%). The FTC also confirmed that Facebook will pay a $5 billion fine for its privacy mishaps, but the stock still rallied heading into its earnings report after the close.\u00a0<br/>Although the probe added to the uncertainty facing these companies, the positive mood in the market helped shares recoup a bulk of their early losses. In addition, the fact that interest rates remain low should remain a positive consideration for risk assets.\u00a0<br/>U.S. Treasury yields finished lower on Wednesday.\u00a0The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 1.82%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 2.05%. The U.S. Dollar Index was unchanged at 97.72.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.\u00a0<br/>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.02%) finished fractionally higher, and the small-cap Russell 2000 increased 0.3%.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FB </emphasis>164.15, -13.32, -7.5%), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOOG </emphasis>1036.23, -67.40, -6.1%), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AMZN </emphasis>1692.69, -82.38, -4.6%), and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AAPL </emphasis>173.30, -1.77, -1.0%) were all singled out in various reports indicating that the companies could face antitrust scrutiny by the Department of Justice and/or Federal Trade Commission.<br/>These companies represent some of the most widely-held stocks in the U.S., and their out-sized losses weighed heavily on the Nasdaq and on the S&amp;P 500 communication services (-2.8%), information technology (-1.8%), and consumer discretionary (-1.2%) sectors. The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.<br/>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.<br/>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.\u00a0<br/>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%. The 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.22. WTI crude decreased 0.5% to $53.25/bbl, giving up an intraday rebound effort.<br/>In other corporate news, German company Infineon announced plans to acquire <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cypress Semiconductor</emphasis> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CY </emphasis>22.07, +4.25, +23.9%) for approximately $10 billion, or $23.85 per share, in cash.

Although it was not entirely surprising, the news continues to support the market's view that the trade dispute will not be over soon. <br/>Separately, manufacturing PMI data out of Europe and Asia indicated slower or flat growth last month, adding to the concerns that slower economic growth will lead to lower earnings prospects.\u00a0<br/>In U.S. data, investors will receive the ISM Manufacturing Index for May (Briefing.com consensus 52.6) and Construction Spending for April (Briefing.com consensus 0.4%) at 10:00 a.m. ET. Auto and truck sales will be released throughout the day.<br/>Persisting trade and growth concerns have also heightened the flight for safety in U.S. Treasuries, driving yields even lower across the curve.\u00a0<br/>The 2-yr yield is down seven basis points to 1.87%, and the 10-yr yield is down three basis points to 2.11%. The noticeable drop in the 2-yr yield is also reflective of the market's view that the Fed may cut rates to address slower growth. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.1% to 97.64. WTI crude is up 1.5% to $54.32/bbl after falling nearly 9% last week on concerns that slower growth will weaken demand.<br/>In U.S. Corporate news:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Alphabet\u00a0(GOOG 1072.00, -31.63): -2.9% after The Wall Street Journal\u00a0indicated sources that said the Department of Justice is preparing an antitrust investigation of Google.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Boeing\u00a0(BA 336.94, -4.67): -1.4% after the company notified the FAA of improperly manufactured parts on the 737 MAX and 737 NG.\u00a0</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Cypress Semiconductor\u00a0(CY 22.30, +4.48): +25.1% after Germany's Infineon Technologies (IFNNY) said it will acquire the company for $23.85/share, or $10.1 billion, in cash.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Apple (AAPL 174.62, -0.45): -0.3% ahead of its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>Reviewing overnight developments:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Equity indices in the Asia-Pacific region started the week on a mixed, and cautious, note with trade worries hanging like a wet blanket on investors.\u00a0Japan's Nikkei -0.9%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng -0.03%, China's Shanghai Composite -0.3%, India's Sensex +1.4%, South Korea's Kospi +1.3%, Australia's ASX All Ordinaries -1.3%.In economic data:China's May Caixin Manufacturing PMI 50.2 (expected 50.0; last 50.2)Japan's May Manufacturing PMI 49.8 (expected 49.6; last 49.6); Capital Spending 6.1% yr/yr (expected 2.6%; last 5.7%)Australia's May Manufacturing PMI 51.0 (expected 51.1; last 50.9)South Korea's May Nikkei Manufacturing PMI 48.4 (expected 49.5; last 50.2)In news:Lots of attention this morning on a White Paper out of China that places blame on U.S. for the negotiations unraveling.

Friday's 1.3% decline in the S&amp;P 500 sent it below its 200-day moving average (2776) and extended its weekly decline to 2.6%.<br/>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (-1.4%), the Nasdaq Composite (-1.5%), and the Russell 2000 (-1.4%) extended their weekly losses to 3.0%, 2.4%, and 3.2%.<br/>The 5% tariff rate will go into effect on June 10 and will increase incrementally during the summer to reach 25% on Oct. 1. The White House could remove these tariffs altogether if Mexico makes a concerted effort to curb the flow of undocumented migrants entering the U.S.\u00a0<br/>The news catalyzed de-risking efforts, leading to eight of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finishing with losses over 1.0%. The utilities (+0.5%) and real estate (+0.8%) sectors finished higher amid a steep drop in U.S. Treasury yields.<br/>Another trade dispute on top of a U.S.-China trade war with no clear end in sight fueled ongoing concerns that trade tensions will lower economic, and earnings, growth prospects.<br/>China added to these fears after it announced that it is drafting a list of unreliable foreign entities that harm the interests of its firms, increasing speculation about Chinese retaliation against the U.S. On a related note, China's manufacturing sector slipped into contraction in May.<br/>Global growth concerns were transparent by the 5.2% drop in WTI crude ($53.48/bbl, -$2.92) and by investors seeking safety in a crowded U.S. Treasury market. The 2-yr yield dropped 12 basis points to 1.94%, and the 10-yr yield dropped nine basis points to 2.14%.

Each of the major averages rose at least 2.0%, led by the 2.7% gain in the Nasdaq Composite, and the S&amp;P 500 (+2.1%) climbed back above its 200-day moving average (2775).\u00a0<br/>Tuesday's advance was rooted in yesterday's ability in the broader market to withstand heavy losses from\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple\u00a0</emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AAPL </emphasis>179.64, +6.34, +3.7%),\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon\u00a0</emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AMZN </emphasis>1729.56, +36.87, +2.2%), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOOG</emphasis>\u00a01053.05, +16.82, +1.6%), and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FB </emphasis>167.50, +3.35, +2.0%), which all fell on antitrust concerns. <br/>The turnaround in these mega-cap stocks ensured there was little to impede the rebound effort, especially when given the seemingly supportive comments from the Fed.\u00a0<br/>Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters, acknowledged the trade uncertainty and the persistently low inflation levels. Although no rate cut was promised, Mr. Powell said that the Fed will act appropriately to sustain the economic expansion, assuring the market that the Fed is still on its side.<br/>Cyclical sectors led the rally with the S&amp;P 500 information technology (+3.3%), materials (+2.8%), financials (+2.7%), consumer discretionary (+2.6%), and industrials (+2.4%) sectors all finishing with gains over 2.0%. The defensive-oriented utilities (unch) and real estate (-0.6%) sectors were left out of the rally.\u00a0<br/>Favorable trade headlines were pointed as having an early effect on the market. China said it wants dialogue and mutual respect in talks with the U.S. while speculation arose that President Trump's Mexico tariffs could be blocked by Congress. However, China's comments were largely in-line with prior rhetoric, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Hill </emphasis>reported that President Trump is weighing a national emergency to implement new tariffs on Mexico.<br/>Counter to the view that the stock market was oversold on a short-term basis, the Treasury market exhibited weakness on the view that it had gotten overbought on a short-term basis. The 2-yr  yield increased five basis points to 1.88%, and the 10-yr yield increased four basis points to 2.12%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 97.10.

The major indices, led by a 2.3% gain in the Russell 2000, are all up at least 1.8% and trading at session highs.<br/>Today's move began in earnest at the sound of the opening bell, as market participants reacted favorably to headlines that seemingly cooled down the temperature surrounding the trade dispute with China, and provided some cover to think the tariff on imported goods from Mexico could be averted, either due to a deal with the U.S. ahead of the June 10 deadline or a possible vote in Congress to forestall the action, according to the Washington Post.<br/>In reality, the mood of the market had been lifted on Monday when the S&amp;P 500 exhibited some relative strength in the face of large losses suffered by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet (GOOG</emphasis> 1051.22, +14.99, +1.5%), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook (FB</emphasis> 166.54, +2.39, +1.5%), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon.com (AMZN</emphasis> 1723.80, +31.11, +1.8%), and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple (AAPL</emphasis> 178.68, +5.37, +3.1%), which fell prone to some regulatory angst on the part of investors.<br/>Those mega-cap stocks have managed to bounce back some today on the belief that any investigation into their business practices is likely to be a drawn out one; moreover, there is some underlying hope that none of the companies would eventually be broken up by the government.<br/>Their gains today have helped bolster the broader market, yet the buying interest has been widespread. The information technology (+2.6%), financials (+2.3%), industrials (+2.1%), and consumer discretionary (+2.1%) sectors are all up at least 2.0%. The only sectors not participating today are the defensive-oriented real estate (-1.1%) and utilities (-1.0%) sectors.<br/>Some of the fallout for the latter two sectors hearkens back to the Treasury market, where yields have risen noticeably across the curve on a counter-trade rooted in the idea that Treasuries were primed for a pullback from a short-term overbought condition.<br/>The 2-yr note yield has spiked seven basis points to 1.90% while the 10-yr note yield has jumped five basis points to 2.14%.\u00a0<br/>The losses in the Treasury market have unfolded despite some softening CPI data out of the eurozone and a 0.8% decline in U.S. factory orders for April.<br/>The non-response in the Treasury market to otherwise disappointing economic data and some seemingly supportive remarks from Fed Chair Powell and Chicago Fed President Evans, both of whom are FOMC voters, underscores how the Treasury market is succumbing to the overbought perspective.<br/>Neither Mr. Powell nor Mr. Evans promised a rate cut soon while speaking at a conference in Chicago, yet both paid heed to the risks of undershooting the 2.0% inflation target and the risks of the trade uncertainty, which has been construed by some today as a dovish policy leaning.<br/>Separately, there was no mistaking the leaning in the analyst community with respect to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Uber (UBER</emphasis> 42.17, +0.92, +2.2%). No fewer than 20 firms initiated coverage of the stock after its IPO, 16 of which had the equivalent of a Buy recommendation.</p><h/><p>NASDAQ - 2218 - 757 - 1.21 bln</p><h/><p>NYSE - 2298 - 573 - 325 mln</p><h/><p>DJ30 - +454.12 - 25273.9</p><h/><p>NASDAQ - +156.06 - 7489.05</p><h/><p>SP500 - +47.84 - 2792.29</p><h/><h>Nasdaq holds the lead - Jun 04 - 12:25 ET</h><p><br/>[BRIEFING.COM] The major averages hover near their recently established session highs. The Nasdaq (+1.9%) remains in the lead while the S&amp;P 500 (+1.6%) follows a bit behind.

Lingering trade and growth concerns also helped curb risk sentiment and underpin the strength in U.S. Treasuries. A swarm of buyers in the last 30 minutes of action, however, helped the broader market close off its session lows.\u00a0<br/>The tech-sensitive Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6%.

The other eight S&amp;P 500 sectors finished higher, led by materials (+3.4%), to provide offsetting support.<br/>Persisting concerns about trade and growth helped restrain buying conviction throughout the day. China blamed the U.S. for the setback in trade talks, which reinforced fears that a protracted trade war will squeeze global growth, and earnings, prospects. Global manufacturing PMI data, including in the U.S., revealed slower or flat growth in May.<br/>On a related note, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (FOMC Voter) said that slower economic growth could be sharper-than-expected due to the trade uncertainty. Mr. Bullard added that a rate cut may soon be warranted to boost inflation.\u00a0<br/>Growing expectations for a rate cut, and general growth concerns, helped send the 2-yr yield down 12 basis points to 1.83%. The 10-yr yield declined six basis points to 2.08%. The U.S. Dollar Index fell 0.5% to 97.22. WTI crude decreased 0.5% to $53.25/bbl, giving up an intraday rebound effort.<br/>In other corporate news, German company Infineon announced plans to acquire <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cypress Semiconductor</emphasis> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CY </emphasis>22.07, +4.25, +23.9%) for approximately $10 billion, or $23.85 per share, in cash.

Risk &amp; Reward  starts right now. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST:  The bulls and bears are out with  heavy volatility shocking the markets all week including today. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to Risk &amp; Reward. I'm Jo Ling Kent in for Deirdre Bolton. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It has been a wild ride with the Dow ending higher today as the European  central banks says it's ready for new stimulus. We've got you covered from  the markets to oil and everything in between. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have Lori Rothman on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Lori,  help us makes sense of this going into Friday. Where do we leave it today] </p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. Say to make sense of this  market they be extraordinarily rich and they won't be carrying their hair  out struggling with all of this volatility.</p><p>So, this is it where we stand right now. It was a rally today. We closed  off best levels. You know, stocks fell off so deeply yesterday. We fell  below those the late August lows and that left a lot of traders believe in  the market was oversold that they came back. And then of course, you got to  talk about the price of oil. </p><p>So, oil came back above $30 for a time. It faded but still managed to snap  a three-session losing streak to close at $29.73 a barrel. That was  critical. So, a lot of these oil names that had been absolutely clobbered  over the last year came up big time. You got names like CONSOL energy up 19  percent. Southwest energy, up almost 19 percent today. So, that's really  the story here.</p><p>So, between the technical and the oil story people come back to stocks here  today. The Dow will close at 15,882. After the bell earnings, Starbucks is  the headliner. Kind of a disappointment. Shares down in the extended  session, 4 percent at moment. Stocks revenue from Starbucks. </p><p>The things were great here in the U.S. despite that whole big to do about  the plain red coffee cups over the Christmas season. But everything was  fine there. And of course, the problem as we've been reporting month after  month now with Asia, the sales locations in Asia and the whole region were  a little bit soft. </p><p>And so, of course investors are concerned with all these companies with  exposure to that part of the world. Back to you, Jo Ling. </p><p>KENT:  Lori, thank you so much for joining us. And now to Arizona  republican Senator, John McCain saying voters will associate the plunge in  the stock market with President Obama and the democrats. </p><p>With me now to break this down the CEO of CKE, the parent company of  Hardee's and Carl's Jr., he's the former Mitt Romney economic advisor, Andy  Puzder. Andy, what do you think of McCain's comments? Did that crash in  2008 scar him to think that it will happen again? </p><p>ANDY PUZDER, HARDEE'S &amp; CARL'S JR. CEO:  Well, it clearly it scared him.  But there were a lot of other things going on in the economy at that time  that also made that decline in the stock market more significant. </p><p>We're 10 years or 10 months from the election so a lot can happen in 10  months. If the stock market is still in big trouble in 10 months I would  say democrats will have a real problem. But that's a -- 10 months is a long  time from now. </p><p>KENT:  Well, you know, Andy, we see the latest GOP polls or polls of the  GOP race, Donald Trump widening his lead to over 20 points over Senator Ted  Cruz in New Hampshire, very important early voting state. So, do you think  this means that Trump will actually be able to carry a win and how much  does that matter after Iowa and going in to South Carolina? </p><p>PUZDER:  Well, the Iowa and New Hampshire are very, very important states  and if Donald Trump can win both of those states I think it could be very  significant. The interesting thing about the Iowa poll for me was that, Ted  Cruz, after his comment about New York values and such, he actually went  from 6 percent to 14 percent in the polls. </p><p>So, he had more than, you know, more than doubled the percentage of vote  that he was getting. So, I think there is still a lot -- there's a lot of  moving pieces out there. This is very, very difficult election to predict.  Donald Trump looks very strong now. </p><p>KENT:  Yes.</p><p>PUZDER But nobody's voted yet. So, we really need to have some people out  there voting. And the big -- for me, the poll I look at is, how does each  republican candidate do against Hillary Clinton. Because there is one  issue.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KENT:  Right. Well, we see in the Monmouth poll that Trump is able to carry  it for the republicans at least as of now. But, Andy, I have to ask you who  are you going to be supporting in these primaries? </p><p>PUZDER:  Sure. I wish I knew. At the moment I'm not -- I'm not committed to  anybody. I think we have a great slate of candidates I could get behind any  of them for president. But again, I become a one issue candidate, or one  issue voter, which is who can win? And if I felt positive about who had the  best chance to win I'd be out there supporting that person because we  really need to win. </p><p>KENT:  All right. So, they are still trying to earn your vote.</p><p>PUZDER:  Yes.</p><p>KENT:  Well, what about Donald Trump making headlines by saying he wants to  force Apple to manufacture all of its products including the iPhone in the  U.S. if elected president. Listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We're going to get things  coming. We're going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and  things in this country instead of in other companies.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT:  All right. For the record, Apple does make its MacBook pros in  Austin, Texas. But looking at broader point, Andy, does this work? </p><p>PUZDER:  Well, when he says he's going to get them do. If you offer them  incentives that make it economically rational for them to manufacture those  products in the United States I think they would be glad to do so. The  president can't force them to do that. You know, it would take an act to  Congress. You really couldn't discriminate against Apple in particular. </p><p>KENT:  Right. </p><p>PUZDER:  So, I'm not sure why he is singling Apple. I mean, Ford makes cars  or GM makes cars in Asia. Are we going to require that they make all their  cars here? Are we going to tell Toyota and BMW that, you know, we're not  going to allow our car manufacturers to manufacture in their country? </p><p>You know, it's a -- it's a very, very difficult thing for him to do.</p><p>KENT:  Right.</p><p>PUZDER:  But he is appealing to these blue-collar voters...</p><p>KENT:  That's exactly it. </p><p>PUZDER:  ... who feel like the economy is coming at him in two ways. One is  that jobs are going to China. And the other is that the jobs that stay here  are being taken by people that are here illegally. </p><p>So, I think what he is doing is he's appealing to this base that is risen  up for him that really is concerned about their jobs, and their families  and their income. </p><p>KENT:  Right.</p><p>PUZDER:  And part of that is jobs going to China. The other part is jobs  going to people that aren't -- that aren't here legally. So, I think that  he is appealing to his base. I don't know -- I don't -- I'd love to see him  do things that made, that incentivized companies to manufacture in the  United States, any president should do that. </p><p>KENT:  Andy, I want to ask you. You have some news today. Hardee's and  Carl, Jr.'s is they are going to put out $4 menu for people. You want to  compete with Wendy's and other fast-food chains in a really tough fast-food  environment. </p><p>PUZDER:  Yes. </p><p>KENT:  Why go in that direction and not stick with the cheaper items on the  menus like the dollar menu type of thing? </p><p>PUZDER:  Well, we've never had a dollar menu. What we're doing is we're  bundling products. So, it's a $4, for $4 you get really great double  cheeseburger, you get a great spicy chicken sandwich, a soda and fries. So,  it's a really -- I think it's a superior deal to what any of our  competitors are offering. </p><p>But when your competitors are bundling and selling a lot of products for a  set price, if you don't -- if you don't respond to that you're going to  lose customers. And, you know, we want to keep people coming into the  restaurants. And we think this is a good deal for them. We'll do fine with  it. I'm real happy with this. No dollar menus, though. Dollar menus are a  bad idea. </p><p>KENT:  Al right. You heard it here. Andy Puzder, he's a CEO of Hardee's and  Carl's Jr. at CKE and a former Mitt Romney economic advisor. Your  endorsement up for grabs. We'll be watching for that. Thanks for joining  us.</p><p>PUZDER:  Thanks, Jo. </p><p>KENT:  A new Fox report saying some of Hillary Clinton's e-mails on her  private server contained information that was so secret that even senior  lawmakers involved in oversight could not even read them or access them. </p><p>One of those lawmakers is here with us right now, judiciary committee  member, which has oversight of the Department of Justice and the FBI.  Representative Doug Collins. Representative, thanks for coming on. </p><p>DOUG COLLINS, GEORGIA STATE REPRESENTATIVE:  Jo, glad to be here today. </p><p>KENT:  So, I'm told you have military clearance to access lots of  classified information. What does it feel like not to be able to access  this sensitive data? </p><p>COLLINS:  Well, I think it's interesting for those of us in the military  who dealt with classified information on various levels in our careers, but  also as members of Congress, it is just mystifying to me why the former  Secretary of State is having such a problem trying to frankly, trying to  explain a way something she should not be explaining away. </p><p>There is nothing that the Justice Department now should not do to get to  the bottom of this Congress whatever it takes, this was a malfeasance of  law. And it's one frankly where I'm calling on Mrs. Clinton to suspend her  presidential campaign. </p><p>She needs to be straight with the American people. And if she's mishandled  classified information that could put people's lives in danger. That is  disqualification for a Commander-in-Chief and I'm just shocked that she is  taking it so lightly. </p><p>KENT:  All right. So, does this then obviously, for you in your opinion,  undercut Clinton's claim that the material was innocuous and basically  fully contradict that? </p><p>COLLINS:  It totally contradicts that. When you deal with these special  access kind of programs, these are deals that deal with current ongoing  operations that are -- that are so classified that they require even a more  disclosure notice past the top secret clearance on which normally members  can have. </p><p>That is not someone not even is mentioned remotely to be unclassified  setting that should throw off alarms all over the system. And for her just  to cavalierly say, oh, there is nothing but innocuous stuff on here, is  frankly at this point she is being disingenuous. </p><p>She is I think she is lying to the American people because something she  doesn't want to talk about. </p><p>KENT:  Representative, one quick question for you, because you can't access  it, what do you think are in those emails? What do you presume in them? </p><p>COLLINS:  Well, I'm not going to presume because at this point in time  those were -- they're classified the way they were classified because of  significance of the national security and world implications. </p><p>KENT:  OK. </p><p>COLLINS:  And to say any different, I mean, that's just something that  should make her to have to answer this. And the Department of Justice needs  to be all over this even more than they already are. </p><p>KENT:  Congressman Doug Collins, good to talk with you. Thank you for  joining us.</p><p>COLLINS:  Jo, I appreciate it. Thanks so much. </p><p>KENT:  And Judge Napolitano weighing in on Hillary's predicament saying  last night this could be Clinton's down fall. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  The case against her  is overwhelming, damning and from her perspective grave. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT:  Coming up, Hillary Clinton responds. Hear what she had to say. </p><p>And first, sexual assault and now some German refugees are suing. Find out  why. We have an attorney who says the U.S. could face a similar situation. </p><p>And bringing new meaning to the phrase, \"killing them with kindness.\"  Facebook chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg saying likes can help  fight terrorists. Colonel Ralph Peters weighing in on Sandberg's  counterterrorism strategy after this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, Facebook COO:  They launch what think called a like attack  on the Facebook page of the NPD. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  This is the continuation of an interagency dispute that has been  going on now for some months. As the State Department has confirmed, I  never sent or received any material marked classified. And that hasn't  changed. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And when she says she never sent or received anything marked  classified it's a word game. Nothing is marked classified. It's marked  confidential, secret, top secret or SAP.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT:  Former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton continues to brush off  reports that her private server contained highly classified intelligence. </p><p>Attorney Troy Slaten is joining me to break this down. So you think, Troy,  that he -- that Hillary is playing a word game here? Are we talking about  just vocab is different? </p><p>TROY SLATEN, ATTORNEY:  I mean, she is. I mean, Jo, anybody that  understands what the secret service does, and that's what her main  defenses, is that the secret service was protecting the server, knows that  they're not looking at the traffic that's going in and out from this  server. </p><p>She is playing a word game. Just because it wasn't marked classified at  that moment doesn't mean it that it didn't contain classified information.  And she should know. And the I.G. report confirms what everybody already  widely knew. And that's that she had some of our nation's most secret stuff  on that personal, unsecured server. </p><p>KENT:  All right, Troy. We also have some sound hit that we want to play  for you, that some say Hillary Clinton had an ulterior motive when she  praised President Obama in the last debate over the weekend. Listen to what  she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CLINTON:  That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama.  Thanks goodness, President Obama vetoed it. President Obama has led our  country out of the great recession. </p><p>TRUMP:  You notice how positive she is about the president? You know why,  right? You know why. Because she wants to stay out of the clink. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT:  All right, Troy, do you think that Hillary is appealing to President  Obama here, especially as some of his surrogates go out and essentially  campaign for her or do you think that trump is incorrect? </p><p>SLATEN:  No. I think it might even be more nefarious than that, Jo. The  person that decides whether or not she'll be indicted is the Attorney  General of the United States. The Attorney General is like the D.A. for the  United States. She is the one, Loretta Lynch, who will decide whether or  not Hillary is indicted. </p><p>And Loretta Lynch was appointed by President Obama. Now it would be the  scandal of all scandals if it turned out that the president or the White  House was putting any pressure on the Justice Department to stop an  indictment from coming out just because she is running for president or  that this is an election year. </p><p>KENT:  All right. Well, we have some other developing news, Troy. Under new  changes to the U.S. Visa waiver program, nationals who've been in Iran,  Iraq, Sudan, or Syria since March 2011, can no longer visit the United  States under the visa waiver program. </p><p>And then over in Germany you also have developments there. Refugees that  were welcomed by Chancellor Angela Merkel are now suing the government,  some of them are, for taking too long to process their claims for asylum. </p><p>My first question is, do you think the U.S. is going to face any sort of  backlash like that from refugees? Are they entirely different situations  here? </p><p>SLATEN:  I mean they are different situations. It looks like the people in  Germany are really fighting back against this onslaught of what was  unfettered migration of people that they weren't really able to properly  vet. Now I think that it's good that the United States has put the brakes  on this, but, no.</p><p>The Congress has the ultimate authority under the Constitution to regulate  immigration. And I don't think that anyone would have a successful lawsuit  to say that the United States is taking too long to vet them and decide  whether or not they could have entry into the United States. </p><p>But in Germany, we're seeing that the people that are coming in that are  not having a chance to assimilate because there are too many people coming  in, I mean, they're having mass sexual assaults and rapes in Cologne which  happens to be the same city where they're filing lawsuits for taking too  long to grant them asylum status. </p><p>KENT:  All right. Well, there is a lot to debate there but we have to move  on to another lighter topic. </p><p>A snowboarder who survived an avalanche at Lake Tahoe's Sugar Bowl Resort  in California is facing a very serious matter now. It's a lawsuit for  criminal trespassing. And you can see this GoPro camera captioning  Christian Michael Mares tumble down the slope. </p><p>He was really lucky narrowly dodging all those trees you see there, finally  landing half buried in the snow. He is pretty lucky to be alive at this  point. But a lawsuit filed by the resort is alleging he triggered the  avalanche in an area that was clearly marked as closed. </p><p>So, Troy, even though he says he didn't know it was an area that was off  limits. How do you think the case is going to proceed here? The sheriff's  office got a -- has in the sense right now? </p><p>SLATEN:  So, he is facing two potential legal problems. First is a criminal  action by -- initiated by the sheriff, will be prosecuted by the D.A. that  alleges that he was trespassing. He was in an area on private property  without permission. </p><p>But he is also facing a potential lawsuit by the operators of the ski  resort who had to mount a response to rescue him, and it place a lot of  lives in danger because by him going into that off-limits area he triggered  this avalanche. </p><p>And 27 people die every year from avalanches. And this is an area has been  off limits since the 2010-2011 season. So, he's got a lot of explaining to  do. And it may ultimately be up to a jury to decide whether it was clearly  marked, and whether an average, reasonable person would know that you're  not supposed to go there. </p><p>The fact that he had a GoPro camera mounted to his helmet may lead people  to believe that he was an extreme sports advocate, and therefore looking  for some danger. </p><p>KENT:  Well, either way, it is very well-documented. Troy Slaten, thank you  so much for joining us tonight. </p><p>SLATEN:  Thanks for having me, Jo. </p><p>KENT:  Whoopi Goldberg threatening to leave the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>WHOOPI GOLDBERG, ACTRESS &amp; HOST:  I don't think that's America. I don't  want it to be America. Maybe time for me to move? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT:  Find out what Donald Trump said that has her potentially packing her  bags. And Facebook COO, Sheryl Sandberg is trying to kill ISIS with  kindness. </p><p>Coming up, Colonel Ralph Peters talking to us about if Facebook -- if a  Facebook-like attack would actually work. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDBERG:  They launch what they called a like attack on the Facebook page  of the NPD.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KENT:  Facebook executive, the COO, Sheryl Sandberg believes that Facebook  likes can help counter ISIS recruitment. Listen to what she had to say at  the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANDBERG:  The best antidote to bad speech is a good speech. They launch  what they called a like attack on the Facebook page of the NPD. So, the NPD  is the new Nazi party. That page is filled with intolerance. </p><p>And rather than scream and protest, they got 100,000 people to like the  page who did not the like the page and then put messages of tolerance on  the page. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT:  Retired U.S. Lieutenant Colonel and Fox News military analyst, Ralph  Peters joins me now. Colonel, can we really kill ISIS and their recruitment  an propaganda with kindness there? </p><p>RALPH PETERS, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, we should start by sending  cupcakes. I like cupcakes. They must like cupcakes too, right? Now, truly  Ms. Sandberg's remarks in Davos are one of the most remarkable combinations  of naivet, and cynicism that I have ever encountered. </p><p>The cynicism is obviously Facebook doesn't want to block sites. It wants  track. They doesn't want a reputation of blocking sites. So, this is seems  to be an immaculate solution. Don't block a terror sites just get people to  like them but then write nice things instead of bad things terrorists  write. </p><p>Well, then you get the naivet,. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT:  So, how do you think this plays in, Colonel, to the broader  discussion that the White House has been trying to have with Silicon Valley  and big tech companies to hand over information that they believe they need  without a search warrant? </p><p>PETERS:  Well, Silicon Valley does not take terrorism seriously as you saw  in the case of Ms. Sandberg. They're all fine with disrupting the way we  communicate. But they don't see how the terrorists are disrupting the  world. </p><p>But if I may just say about, you know, what she wants to do is get people  to write nice things. Our State Department and others have been trying to  counter ISIS on the web and it doesn't work. It doesn't work because people  who graduated from MIT or Harvard or Yale, they have no idea how these  terrorists think. </p><p>And what we offer, our counteroffer is crazy. Islamic state offers the, you  know, dysfunctional young basement dwellers revenge, a chance to torture  and kill males. To rape and enslave women. And if you get killed you get  the bullet train to paradise. What is our counteroffer? Our counteroffer is  a job at Wal-Mart. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT:  And that's what they're trying -- that I think that's what, if you  look at what Sheryl Sandberg is attempting to say here, regardless of what  you think of her argument, is that a counter speech and counter propaganda  is something that needs to be done. And what you see actually is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETERS:  You can't do it. </p><p>KENT:  ... the White House saying that they want to do, who knows if they  actually agree on this. But I want to move on to Google...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETERS:  No, but truly they cannot do it. We can't do it because we have  nothing to offer those guys. </p><p>KENT:  But, Colonel, with all due respect if you look at who controls the  pipelines and the ability of the terrorists to actually communicate it  happens on those platforms. So, that is...</p><p>PETERS:  Yes.</p><p>KENT:  ... being able to work with these companies and actually convince  them to do something more, perhaps you could argue is one of the ways to  counter what is happening in terms of recruitment, right? </p><p>PETERS:  We, of course we want them to block their -- yes, we want them to  block their sites. We want -- we need some back door de-encryption  capability at certain points. But when you get into these ideas that, no,  we just have to say nice things to counter their bad things, the example  she used about neo-Nazi Party, the NPD in Germany. Bad example because  since Cologne, their numbers are actually increasing. </p><p>This doesn't work. When you have the overeducated trying to convince the  undereducated that if you really, you just need to be nicer and everything  will go your way, it does not work. Your upper class can never convince to  love it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT:  So, you're looking for more out of them? You're not looking to  abandon cooperating or collaborating? </p><p>PETERS:  Oh, of course not. We want them, we need Silicon Valley to do far  more but then they are lacking to do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT:  Well, speaking of Silicon Valley, Colonel, I want to ask you about  Google. They're also coming out and saying ISIS must be blocked out of the  open web. And Donald Trump, the frontrunner had said something relatively  similar. Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're losing a lot of people because of the internet and we have to  do something. We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that  really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them, maybe in  certain areas, closing that internet up in some way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KENT:  It could be argued that Google and Trump may be on the same page  here. What do you think, colonel? </p><p>PETERS:  Well, I think Google is much closer to the truth than Ms. Sandberg  was. The internet is without question the greatest tool for spreading  hatred since the invention of moveable type plates for the printing press  in the 15th century. </p><p>It's just remarkable how effective it is. The point I am trying to make is,  you know, if you can't outthink your enemy symmetrically you do it  asymmetrically. And our attempt to argue with them on the internet we  cannot win the argument on with speech with arguments with rhetoric. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT:  So, it has to be mechanical and technical.</p><p>PETERS:  You have to kill them. Yes, you have to kill them. </p><p>KENT:  All right. Colonel Ralph Peters talking about asymmetric warfare. We  always like talking about that. Thank you for joining us. </p><p>PETERS:  Thank you. </p><p>KENT:  Whoopi Goldberg threatening to pack her bags and leave the United  States. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLDBERG:  I don't think that is America. I don't want it to be America.  Maybe it's time for me to move? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT:  Find out what Donald Trump said that has Whoopi packing her bags. </p><p>And there could be trouble in paradise. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LENA DUNHAM, ACTRESS:  Do you consider yourself a feminist? </p><p>CLINTON:  Yes. Absolutely. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT:  A new report saying that actress Lena Dunham a very avid Hillary  supporter, has some misgiving how the candidate treats women. Those details  are coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WHOOPI GOLDBERG, ACTOR:  I have been part of that when they just use a  blanket statement to talk about black people or when they use a blanket  statement to talk about white people or women or any other group.  I don't  think that's America.  Maybe it's time for me to move.  I can afford to go. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Where would you go? </p><p>GOLDBERG:  I don't know.  You know I have always been an American.  This  has always been my country, and we have been able to have discussions.  And  suddenly now, it's turning into -- not them.  I need all the candidates to  get it together.  Get back to American values.  </p><p>JO LING KENT, RISK AND REWARD HOST:  That was Whoopi Goldberg saying she  might leave the country if GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is elected  President.  The View Co-Host saying Trump needs to stop blaming other  people for the problems in America.  With me right now to break this down  is Crystal Wright.  She is the Editor of the Conservative Black Chick Blog  and Author of Con Job, the book on your screen right now.  So what do you  think about Whoopi Goldberg's comments? </p><p>CRYSTAL WRIGHT, CONSERVATIVE BLACK CHICK BLOG:  Go, Whoopi, leave.  You  already said you have enough money to leave America.  You don't like Donald  Trump's discussion.  Finally, we have a candidate who is not talking in  political correctness code.  Muslims are the ones that are trying to kill  Americans.  Illegal immigrants are the ones who are criminals.  They come  here, they steal our jobs and they murder us.  Whoopi, what is wrong with  what Donald Trump said.  We have a candidate sticking up for Americans, too  bad for you. </p><p>KENT:  He certainly has very blunt things to say.  But one of Hillary  Clinton's supporters, Lena Dunham, according to her.  She was disturbed  about the women sexually assaulted by former President Bill Clinton.  So  Dunham interviewed Hillary last year and asked about a topic -- feminism  which is close to the actress' heart. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you consider yourself a feminist? </p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, PRESIDENTAL CANDIDATE:  Yes, absolutely. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KENT:  Could Hillary's past come back to hurt her?  How do you take a  surrogate like Lena Dunham seriously when there are two different opinions  that are contradictory? </p><p>WRIGHT:  Lena Dunham alleges she was raped in college.  Yet, she is going  to stand by Hillary Clinton who says she is the poster child for feminism  which couldn't be further from the truth.  She stood by a man who has  disrespected her when he was Governor of Arkansas over and over again --  when he was the governor of Arkansas.  They tried to shut down the  allegations when they said Bill molested them.  Lena Dunham is a farce, she  is a joke, and she is a surrogate. </p><p>KENT:  What contradictory feelings represent younger women just learning  about these issues for the first time? </p><p>WRIGHT:  They look to Lena Dunham, and they don't do their homework.  They  say if Lena likes Hillary, I'll like Hillary.  </p><p>KENT:  Where do they go?  Do they go to Bernie? </p><p>WRIGHT:  Bernie is getting a lot of millennial votes.  Women look up to  Lena Dunham.  She is a powerful figure.  She is powerful in Hollywood and  college students are poisoned on college campuses with a liberal agenda.   They are not getting the other side.  I just think that Bernie is pulling  off some of the millennials but sadly a lot of young women in America are  misinformed.  We are not doing a good job as Republicans getting our  message out.  Hillary's message to women everywhere is the on way you can  be President of the United States is stand by a philandering whore monger  man.  </p><p>KENT:  She's one candidate of several that the Democrats choose from.  Very  interesting to talk to you about -- Leonardo Dicaprio ripping the coal and  oil and gas industry, says he received the World Economic Forum's Crystal  Award on Tuesday.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEONARDO DICAPRIO, ACTOR:  We simply cannot afford to allow the corporate  greed of the coal, oil, and gas industries to determine the future of  humanity.  Those entities with a financial interest in preserving this  destructive system had denied and even covered under the evidence of our  changing climate.  Enough is enough.  You know better.  The world knows  better.  History will place the blame for this devastation squarely at  their feet. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KENT:  Well, Dicaprio himself has reportedly taken 20 trips across the  United States and around the world, mostly on private planes in 2014 alone.   So Crystal, is he being hypocritical here? </p><p>WRIGHT:  Let's talk about emissions on those private jets you are flying  around the world.  It's ok for Leonardo have corporate greed in Hollywood  and to make millions upon millions of dollars for films, but it's not ok  for gas and oil companies who employ people around the world, their greed  isn't ok.  This is once again liberal Hollywood hypocrisy. </p><p>KENT:  Do you have think you can count all of his campaigning about climate  change as basically a neutral? </p><p>WRIGHT:  I don't know how he could give that speech with a straight face,  frankly.  I don't.  Like he said, talk about his carbon footprints.  You  know. </p><p>KENT:  All right, Crystal Wright, Conservative Black Chick Editor, Author  of the book Con Job, always fun to see you.  Thank you for your  perspective. </p><p>WRIGHT:  Thanks.</p><p>KENT:  All right, Denmark announcing unvaccinated refugees has sudden  illness into their country that hasn't been seen in 20 years.  Coming up,  Dr. Siegel on if we should be worried about the 10,000 refugees coming in  to United States.  Also, several other health stories in the news.  Dr.  Siegel's going to tell us the side effects of led in your water -- and how  China's smog can affect your health after this. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KENT:  Denmark reporting that refugees have brought in a highly contagious  and sometimes fatal bacterial infection into their country.  Dr. Marc  Siegel is here with us now.  Dr. Siegel, explain what this infection does  to the body and what some of the symptoms are. </p><p>MARC SIEGEL, MEDICAL TEAM:  First of all, Jo, I have always been one of the  people saying let's not be politically correct when it comes to refugees  and diseases, because they may not be screened the way other people are  screened.  We are not screening for diphtheria.  It's a dangerous disease.   The worst thing about it, it gives respiratory symptoms.  It's highly  contagious.  A lot of us had the vaccine for this but it wears often with  10 years.  It could easily re-emerge in Denmark. </p><p>I would encourage everybody to get the booster vaccine.  Everyone should  have it every 10 years. </p><p>KENT:  How does it spread and can you see a scenario where refugees being  accepted into a country getting treated for it in a timely fashion. </p><p>SIEGEL:  It spreads by coughing and sneezing, sometimes by touch.  It's  really easy to get if you haven't been -- been immunized to it, but it  wears off. </p><p>KENT:  How do you think public health can prevent that from happening and  still allowing refugees to come in?  Is that possible? </p><p>SIEGEL:  No, it's not possible.  You can treat it with an antibiotic.   Everybody around this cluster will have to be vaccinated for it right now.   If I were practicing medicine in Denmark, I would say to my patients let me  give you a booster shot. </p><p>KENT:  What do you do to refugees who have been accepted who need this  vaccination? </p><p>SIEGEL:  You have to give them the vaccination.  So who is going to pay for  that?  You will have to give them the vaccine. </p><p>KENT:  How much would that cost? </p><p>SIEGEL:  That's costs over $100. </p><p>KENT:  For each person? </p><p>SIEGEL:  That's right.  </p><p>KENT:  All right, breaking it down for us, Dr. Marc Siegel.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIEGEL:  And I'm not against that.  We used to do that with tuberculosis,  that wasn't a good vaccine.  This is a very good vaccine. </p><p>KENT:  All right, good to know.  So we know the cost, we know it's  happening, thank you so much for getting us the details, Dr. Marc Siegel. </p><p>All right, over 7,000 students trying to get the government to forgive  millions of dollars in debt because they couldn't get jobs after college.   Coming up, a guest who says getting a job is their own problem.  </p><p>And another Biden slip up, a jump in the polls for Bernie Sanders has Biden  on the attack on behalf of Hillary Clinton.  Here the V.P. calls out  socialism in Bernie Sanders after this. </p><p>BERNIE SANDERS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  We are 50 points behind the  inevitable democratic nominee.  Well, guess what?  That inevitable  candidate ain't so inevitable today. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why are young people drawn to Bernie?  Perhaps an  explanation lays an answer rapper Killer Mike gave earlier this week.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How does a rapper supporting Senator Sanders? </p><p>KILLER MIKE, RAPPER:  Smoking a joint and reading his tweets.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SANDERS:  We were 50 points behind the inevitable democratic nominee.   Well, guess what?  That inevitable candidate ain't so inevitable today.   All over the country, we are seeing huge turnouts of people who are sick  and tired of establishment politics. </p><p>KENT:  Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders continues to jump in the polls,  Vice President Joe Biden takes what appears to be a jab at the nominee in  Davos. </p><p>JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT:  We need a more progressive tax country not none  my country, but other countries, not confiscatory policy, not socialism, a  tax code.  Everybody pays proportionally a fair share. </p><p>KENT:  With me is the Former Republican Governor of Vermont, Jim Douglas.   You have known Bernie Sanders for 40 years.  Are the mainstream democrats  officially worried about Bernie?  He is beating Hillary Clinton in New  Hampshire by 27 points. </p><p>JIM DOUGLAS, FORMER REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF VERMONT:  I think they are  concerned.  It's hard to know at this point what will happen ultimately,  remember, 12 years ago at this point Howard Deen was leading in the polls.   Howard had huge crowds as well.  We'll have to see how it plays out.  But  there is no question the establishment democrats are feeling the burn. </p><p>KENT:  I want to show you some highlights from Bernie's last democratic  debate over the weekend.  See what you think. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS:  Bernie Sanders who has fought for universal healthcare my entire  life.  He wants to end Medicare and Medicaid and the Children's Health  Insurance Program.  That's nonsense.  I don't take money from big banks.  I  don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs.  We are not going tear  up the Affordable Care Act, I helped write it.  But we'll move on top of  that to care for all. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KENT:  Governor Douglas, you have known Bernie Sanders for 40 years.  What  do you think is not coming across that the voters should know about him as  they go into these early-voting contests? </p><p>DOUGLAS:  On the positive side, what you see is what you get.  He's very  transparent and his message hasn't changed.  The only difference is he  substituted millionaires for billionaires.  And I admire someone who has  the courage of his convictions.  But he's out of the mainstream.  He  believes in free college and free healthcare and taxing the rich regardless  of the consequences.  He's pretty much an isolationist in terms of foreign  trade policy.  But he has a certain appeal as you can see from the crowds  he's been drawing. </p><p>KENT:  Governor Jim Douglas, what do you think the final outcome will be  from where you sit in the northeast? </p><p>DOUGLAS:  Well, obviously New Hampshire is our next door neighbor and there  is a home court advantage there.  But this is a long road to the  nomination.  As I mentioned, we have been through this before, candidacies  rise and fall very quickly.  He would seem to be enough out of the  mainstream that American voters would probably want someone more centrist.   But ironically, Joe, he's appealing to a lot of the same people Donald  Trump is. </p><p>KENT:  A lot of the swing voters looking for something out of the  mainstream.  Governor Douglas, we are out of time.  I'm so sorry.  Thank  you so much for joining us. </p><p>DOUGLAS:  Thanks, Joe, take care. </p><p>KENT:  Thanks.  Now people are asking, dude, where's my job?  Over 7,000  students are trying to get the government to forgive millions of dollars in  debt because they couldn't get a job after immediately college.  Coming up,  a guest who says getting a job is their own -- the students'  responsibility. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Scott, things aren't at happy as they used to be down  here at the unemployment office.  Joblessness is no longer just for  philosophy majors.  Useful people are starting to feel the pinch.  I have  five years of modern dance and six years of tap.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KENT:  In the past six months, more 7,500 borrowers owing $164 million have  applied to have their student debt wiped out.  They are able to do that  because an obscure federal law forgives debt for borrowers who can prove  their schools used illegal tactics to recruit them, say promising them a  job or something like that.  (Inaudible) Charlie Kirk is here with me now.   So I want to give some context here, the U.S. Education Department already  agreed do cancel $28 million for 1,300 former students of Corinthian  because that college went bankrupt last year.  So how does this particular  claim compare? </p><p>CHARLIE KIRK, POINT USA FOUNDER:  Yeah, it's not as strong an argument as  the Corinthian.  If the Department of Education agrees to forgive the  student loans in this current pool, it could start a slippery slope.  It's  $164 million in the aggregate.  There might be other students who say wait  a second, they got their student loans forgiven, I was sold a bill of  goods.  </p><p>KENT:  Is it a qualifying claim to say I couldn't find a job because my  school promised so I can make that argument.  Does that actually work? </p><p>KIRK:  In this particular instance, I really don't think.  If a school goes  bankruptcy and they were being deceiving and illegal in their recruiting  tactics, they are saying they were deceiving.  They weren't necessarily  being as strong to the message.  They are a college trying to recruit  students.  They are going to try to market their school as best they can. </p><p>KENT:  That was Charlie Kirk, thank you so much, coming up next, Making  Money with Charles Payne.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

Risk &amp; Reward starts right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST: The bulls and bears are out with heavy volatility shocking the markets all week including today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to Risk &amp; Reward. I'm Jo Ling Kent in for Deirdre Bolton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It has been a wild ride with the Dow ending higher today as the European central banks says it's ready for new stimulus. We've got you covered from the markets to oil and everything in between.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have Lori Rothman on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Lori, help us makes sense of this going into Friday. Where do we leave it today]</p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Say to make sense of this market they be extraordinarily rich and they won't be carrying their hair out struggling with all of this volatility.</p><p>So, this is it where we stand right now. It was a rally today. We closed off best levels. You know, stocks fell off so deeply yesterday. We fell below those the late August lows and that left a lot of traders believe in the market was oversold that they came back. And then of course, you got to talk about the price of oil.</p><p>So, oil came back above $30 for a time. It faded but still managed to snap a three-session losing streak to close at $29.73 a barrel. That was critical. So, a lot of these oil names that had been absolutely clobbered over the last year came up big time. You got names like CONSOL energy up 19 percent. Southwest energy, up almost 19 percent today. So, that's really the story here.</p><p>So, between the technical and the oil story people come back to stocks here today. The Dow will close at 15,882. After the bell earnings, Starbucks is the headliner. Kind of a disappointment. Shares down in the extended session, 4 percent at moment. Stocks revenue from Starbucks.</p><p>The things were great here in the U.S. despite that whole big to do about the plain red coffee cups over the Christmas season. But everything was fine there. And of course, the problem as we've been reporting month after month now with Asia, the sales locations in Asia and the whole region were a little bit soft.</p><p>And so, of course investors are concerned with all these companies with exposure to that part of the world. Back to you, Jo Ling.</p><p>KENT: Lori, thank you so much for joining us. And now to Arizona republican Senator, John McCain saying voters will associate the plunge in the stock market with President Obama and the democrats.</p><p>With me now to break this down the CEO of CKE, the parent company of Hardee's and Carl's Jr., he's the former Mitt Romney economic advisor, Andy Puzder. Andy, what do you think of McCain's comments? Did that crash in 2008 scar him to think that it will happen again?</p><p>ANDY PUZDER, HARDEE'S &amp; CARL'S JR. CEO: Well, it clearly it scared him. But there were a lot of other things going on in the economy at that time that also made that decline in the stock market more significant.</p><p>We're 10 years or 10 months from the election so a lot can happen in 10 months. If the stock market is still in big trouble in 10 months I would say democrats will have a real problem. But that's a -- 10 months is a long time from now.</p><p>KENT: Well, you know, Andy, we see the latest GOP polls or polls of the GOP race, Donald Trump widening his lead to over 20 points over Senator Ted Cruz in New Hampshire, very important early voting state. So, do you think this means that Trump will actually be able to carry a win and how much does that matter after Iowa and going in to South Carolina?</p><p>PUZDER: Well, the Iowa and New Hampshire are very, very important states and if Donald Trump can win both of those states I think it could be very significant. The interesting thing about the Iowa poll for me was that, Ted Cruz, after his comment about New York values and such, he actually went from 6 percent to 14 percent in the polls.</p><p>So, he had more than, you know, more than doubled the percentage of vote that he was getting. So, I think there is still a lot -- there's a lot of moving pieces out there. This is very, very difficult election to predict. Donald Trump looks very strong now.</p><p>KENT: Yes.</p><p>PUZDER But nobody's voted yet. So, we really need to have some people out there voting. And the big -- for me, the poll I look at is, how does each republican candidate do against <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>Because there is one issue.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT: Right. Well, we see in the Monmouth poll that Trump is able to carry it for the republicans at least as of now. But, Andy, I have to ask you who are you going to be supporting in these primaries?</p><p>PUZDER: Sure. I wish I knew. At the moment I'm not -- I'm not committed to anybody. I think we have a great slate of candidates I could get behind any of them for president. But again, I become a one issue candidate, or one issue voter, which is who can win? And if I felt positive about who had the best chance to win I'd be out there supporting that person because we really need to win.</p><p>KENT: All right. So, they are still trying to earn your vote.</p><p>PUZDER: Yes.</p><p>KENT: Well, what about Donald Trump making headlines by saying he wants to force Apple to manufacture all of its products including the iPhone in the U.S. if elected president. Listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to get things coming. We're going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other companies.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: All right. For the record, Apple does make its MacBook pros in Austin, Texas. But looking at broader point, Andy, does this work?</p><p>PUZDER: Well, when he says he's going to get them do. If you offer them incentives that make it economically rational for them to manufacture those products in the United States I think they would be glad to do so. The president can't force them to do that. You know, it would take an act to Congress. You really couldn't discriminate against Apple in particular.</p><p>KENT: Right.</p><p>PUZDER: So, I'm not sure why he is singling Apple. I mean, Ford makes cars or GM makes cars in Asia. Are we going to require that they make all their cars here? Are we going to tell Toyota and BMW that, you know, we're not going to allow our car manufacturers to manufacture in their country?</p><p>You know, it's a -- it's a very, very difficult thing for him to do.</p><p>KENT: Right.</p><p>PUZDER: But he is appealing to these blue-collar voters...</p><p>KENT: That's exactly it.</p><p>PUZDER: ... who feel like the economy is coming at him in two ways. One is that jobs are going to China. And the other is that the jobs that stay here are being taken by people that are here illegally.</p><p>So, I think what he is doing is he's appealing to this base that is risen up for him that really is concerned about their jobs, and their families and their income.</p><p>KENT: Right.</p><p>PUZDER: And part of that is jobs going to China. The other part is jobs going to people that aren't -- that aren't here legally. So, I think that he is appealing to his base. I don't know -- I don't -- I'd love to see him do things that made, that incentivized companies to manufacture in the United States, any president should do that.</p><p>KENT: Andy, I want to ask you. You have some news today. Hardee's and Carl, Jr.'s is they are going to put out $4 menu for people. You want to compete with Wendy's and other fast-food chains in a really tough fast-food environment.</p><p>PUZDER: Yes.</p><p>KENT: Why go in that direction and not stick with the cheaper items on the menus like the dollar menu type of thing?</p><p>PUZDER: Well, we've never had a dollar menu. What we're doing is we're bundling products. So, it's a $4, for $4 you get really great double cheeseburger, you get a great spicy chicken sandwich, a soda and fries. So, it's a really -- I think it's a superior deal to what any of our competitors are offering.</p><p>But when your competitors are bundling and selling a lot of products for a set price, if you don't -- if you don't respond to that you're going to lose customers. And, you know, we want to keep people coming into the restaurants. And we think this is a good deal for them. We'll do fine with it. I'm real happy with this. No dollar menus, though. Dollar menus are a bad idea.</p><p>KENT: Al right. You heard it here. Andy Puzder, he's a CEO of Hardee's and Carl's Jr. at CKE and a former Mitt Romney economic advisor. Your endorsement up for grabs. We'll be watching for that. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>PUZDER: Thanks, Jo.</p><p>KENT: A new Fox report saying some of <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>e-mails on her private server contained information that was so secret that even senior lawmakers involved in oversight could not even read them or access them.</p><p>One of those lawmakers is here with us right now, judiciary committee member, which has oversight of the Department of Justice and the FBI. Representative Doug Collins. Representative, thanks for coming on.</p><p>DOUG COLLINS, GEORGIA STATE REPRESENTATIVE: Jo, glad to be here today.</p><p>KENT: So, I'm told you have military clearance to access lots of classified information. What does it feel like not to be able to access this sensitive data?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, I think it's interesting for those of us in the military who dealt with classified information on various levels in our careers, but also as members of Congress, it is just mystifying to me why the former Secretary of State is having such a problem trying to frankly, trying to explain a way something she should not be explaining away.</p><p>There is nothing that the Justice Department now should not do to get to the bottom of this Congress whatever it takes, this was a malfeasance of law. And it's one frankly where I'm calling on Mrs. Clinton to suspend her presidential campaign.</p><p>She needs to be straight with the American people. And if she's mishandled classified information that could put people's lives in danger. That is disqualification for a Commander-in-Chief and I'm just shocked that she is taking it so lightly.</p><p>KENT: All right. So, does this then obviously, for you in your opinion, undercut Clinton's claim that the material was innocuous and basically fully contradict that?</p><p>COLLINS: It totally contradicts that. When you deal with these special access kind of programs, these are deals that deal with current ongoing operations that are -- that are so classified that they require even a more disclosure notice past the top secret clearance on which normally members can have.</p><p>That is not someone not even is mentioned remotely to be unclassified setting that should throw off alarms all over the system. And for her just to cavalierly say, oh, there is nothing but innocuous stuff on here, is frankly at this point she is being disingenuous.</p><p>She is I think she is lying to the American people because something she doesn't want to talk about.</p><p>KENT: Representative, one quick question for you, because you can't access it, what do you think are in those emails? What do you presume in them?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, I'm not going to presume because at this point in time those were -- they're classified the way they were classified because of significance of the national security and world implications.</p><p>KENT: OK.</p><p>COLLINS: And to say any different, I mean, that's just something that should make her to have to answer this. And the Department of Justice needs to be all over this even more than they already are.</p><p>KENT: Congressman Doug Collins, good to talk with you. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>COLLINS: Jo, I appreciate it. Thanks so much.</p><p>KENT: And Judge Napolitano weighing in on Hillary's predicament saying last night this could be Clinton's down fall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: The case against her is overwhelming, damning and from her perspective grave.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Coming up, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>responds. Hear what she had to say.</p><p>And first, sexual assault and now some German refugees are suing. Find out why. We have an attorney who says the U.S. could face a similar situation.</p><p>And bringing new meaning to the phrase, \"killing them with kindness.\" Facebook chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg saying likes can help fight terrorists. Colonel Ralph Peters weighing in on Sandberg's counterterrorism strategy after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, Facebook COO: They launch what think called a like attack on the Facebook page of the NPD.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: This is the continuation of an interagency dispute that has been going on now for some months. As the State Department has confirmed, I never sent or received any material marked classified. And that hasn't changed.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And when she says she never sent or received anything marked classified it's a word game. Nothing is marked classified. It's marked confidential, secret, top secret or SAP.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Former Secretary of State, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>continues to brush off reports that her private server contained highly classified intelligence.</p><p>Attorney Troy Slaten is joining me to break this down. So you think, Troy, that he -- that Hillary is playing a word game here? Are we talking about just vocab is different?</p><p>TROY SLATEN, ATTORNEY: I mean, she is. I mean, Jo, anybody that understands what the secret service does, and that's what her main defenses, is that the secret service was protecting the server, knows that they're not looking at the traffic that's going in and out from this server.</p><p>She is playing a word game. Just because it wasn't marked classified at that moment doesn't mean it that it didn't contain classified information. And she should know. And the I.G. report confirms what everybody already widely knew. And that's that she had some of our nation's most secret stuff on that personal, unsecured server.</p><p>KENT: All right, Troy. We also have some sound hit that we want to play for you, that some say <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>had an ulterior motive when she praised President Obama in the last debate over the weekend. Listen to what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama. Thanks goodness, President Obama vetoed it. President Obama has led our country out of the great recession.</p><p>TRUMP: You notice how positive she is about the president? You know why, right? You know why. Because she wants to stay out of the clink.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: All right, Troy, do you think that Hillary is appealing to President Obama here, especially as some of his surrogates go out and essentially campaign for her or do you think that trump is incorrect?</p><p>SLATEN: No. I think it might even be more nefarious than that, Jo. The person that decides whether or not she'll be indicted is the Attorney General of the United States. The Attorney General is like the D.A. for the United States. She is the one, Loretta Lynch, who will decide whether or not Hillary is indicted.</p><p>And Loretta Lynch was appointed by President Obama. Now it would be the scandal of all scandals if it turned out that the president or the White House was putting any pressure on the Justice Department to stop an indictment from coming out just because she is running for president or that this is an election year.</p><p>KENT: All right. Well, we have some other developing news, Troy. Under new changes to the U.S. Visa waiver program, nationals who've been in Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria since March 2011, can no longer visit the United States under the visa waiver program.</p><p>And then over in Germany you also have developments there. Refugees that were welcomed by Chancellor Angela Merkel are now suing the government, some of them are, for taking too long to process their claims for asylum.</p><p>My first question is, do you think the U.S. is going to face any sort of backlash like that from refugees? Are they entirely different situations here?</p><p>SLATEN: I mean they are different situations. It looks like the people in Germany are really fighting back against this onslaught of what was unfettered migration of people that they weren't really able to properly vet. Now I think that it's good that the United States has put the brakes on this, but, no.</p><p>The Congress has the ultimate authority under the Constitution to regulate immigration. And I don't think that anyone would have a successful lawsuit to say that the United States is taking too long to vet them and decide whether or not they could have entry into the United States.</p><p>But in Germany, we're seeing that the people that are coming in that are not having a chance to assimilate because there are too many people coming in, I mean, they're having mass sexual assaults and rapes in Cologne which happens to be the same city where they're filing lawsuits for taking too long to grant them asylum status.</p><p>KENT: All right. Well, there is a lot to debate there but we have to move on to another lighter topic.</p><p>A snowboarder who survived an avalanche at Lake Tahoe's Sugar Bowl Resort in California is facing a very serious matter now. It's a lawsuit for criminal trespassing. And you can see this GoPro camera captioning Christian Michael Mares tumble down the slope.</p><p>He was really lucky narrowly dodging all those trees you see there, finally landing half buried in the snow. He is pretty lucky to be alive at this point. But a lawsuit filed by the resort is alleging he triggered the avalanche in an area that was clearly marked as closed.</p><p>So, Troy, even though he says he didn't know it was an area that was off limits. How do you think the case is going to proceed here? The sheriff's office got a -- has in the sense right now?</p><p>SLATEN: So, he is facing two potential legal problems. First is a criminal action by -- initiated by the sheriff, will be prosecuted by the D.A. that alleges that he was trespassing. He was in an area on private property without permission.</p><p>But he is also facing a potential lawsuit by the operators of the ski resort who had to mount a response to rescue him, and it place a lot of lives in danger because by him going into that off-limits area he triggered this avalanche.</p><p>And 27 people die every year from avalanches. And this is an area has been off limits since the 2010-2011 season. So, he's got a lot of explaining to do. And it may ultimately be up to a jury to decide whether it was clearly marked, and whether an average, reasonable person would know that you're not supposed to go there.</p><p>The fact that he had a GoPro camera mounted to his helmet may lead people to believe that he was an extreme sports advocate, and therefore looking for some danger.</p><p>KENT: Well, either way, it is very well-documented. Troy Slaten, thank you so much for joining us tonight.</p><p>SLATEN: Thanks for having me, Jo.</p><p>KENT: Whoopi Goldberg threatening to leave the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHOOPI GOLDBERG, ACTRESS &amp; HOST: I don't think that's America. I don't want it to be America. Maybe time for me to move?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Find out what Donald Trump said that has her potentially packing her bags. And Facebook COO, Sheryl Sandberg is trying to kill ISIS with kindness.</p><p>Coming up, Colonel Ralph Peters talking to us about if Facebook -- if a Facebook-like attack would actually work.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDBERG: They launch what they called a like attack on the Facebook page of the NPD.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KENT: Facebook executive, the COO, Sheryl Sandberg believes that Facebook likes can help counter ISIS recruitment. Listen to what she had to say at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDBERG: The best antidote to bad speech is a good speech. They launch what they called a like attack on the Facebook page of the NPD. So, the NPD is the new Nazi party. That page is filled with intolerance.</p><p>And rather than scream and protest, they got 100,000 people to like the page who did not the like the page and then put messages of tolerance on the page.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Retired U.S. Lieutenant Colonel and Fox News military analyst, Ralph Peters joins me now. Colonel, can we really kill ISIS and their recruitment an propaganda with kindness there?</p><p>RALPH PETERS, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST: Well, we should start by sending cupcakes. I like cupcakes. They must like cupcakes too, right? Now, truly Ms. Sandberg's remarks in Davos are one of the most remarkable combinations of naivet, and cynicism that I have ever encountered.</p><p>The cynicism is obviously Facebook doesn't want to block sites. It wants track. They doesn't want a reputation of blocking sites. So, this is seems to be an immaculate solution. Don't block a terror sites just get people to like them but then write nice things instead of bad things terrorists write.</p><p>Well, then you get the naivet,.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT: So, how do you think this plays in, Colonel, to the broader discussion that the White House has been trying to have with Silicon Valley and big tech companies to hand over information that they believe they need without a search warrant?</p><p>PETERS: Well, Silicon Valley does not take terrorism seriously as you saw in the case of Ms. Sandberg. They're all fine with disrupting the way we communicate. But they don't see how the terrorists are disrupting the world.</p><p>But if I may just say about, you know, what she wants to do is get people to write nice things. Our State Department and others have been trying to counter ISIS on the web and it doesn't work. It doesn't work because people who graduated from MIT or Harvard or Yale, they have no idea how these terrorists think.</p><p>And what we offer, our counteroffer is crazy. Islamic state offers the, you know, dysfunctional young basement dwellers revenge, a chance to torture and kill males. To rape and enslave women. And if you get killed you get the bullet train to paradise. What is our counteroffer? Our counteroffer is a job at Wal-Mart.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT: And that's what they're trying -- that I think that's what, if you look at what Sheryl Sandberg is attempting to say here, regardless of what you think of her argument, is that a counter speech and counter propaganda is something that needs to be done. And what you see actually is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETERS: You can't do it.</p><p>KENT: ... the White House saying that they want to do, who knows if they actually agree on this. But I want to move on to Google...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETERS: No, but truly they cannot do it. We can't do it because we have nothing to offer those guys.</p><p>KENT: But, Colonel, with all due respect if you look at who controls the pipelines and the ability of the terrorists to actually communicate it happens on those platforms. So, that is...</p><p>PETERS: Yes.</p><p>KENT: ... being able to work with these companies and actually convince them to do something more, perhaps you could argue is one of the ways to counter what is happening in terms of recruitment, right?</p><p>PETERS: We, of course we want them to block their -- yes, we want them to block their sites. We want -- we need some back door de-encryption capability at certain points. But when you get into these ideas that, no, we just have to say nice things to counter their bad things, the example she used about neo-Nazi Party, the NPD in Germany. Bad example because since Cologne, their numbers are actually increasing.</p><p>This doesn't work. When you have the overeducated trying to convince the undereducated that if you really, you just need to be nicer and everything will go your way, it does not work. Your upper class can never convince to love it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT: So, you're looking for more out of them? You're not looking to abandon cooperating or collaborating?</p><p>PETERS: Oh, of course not. We want them, we need Silicon Valley to do far more but then they are lacking to do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT: Well, speaking of Silicon Valley, Colonel, I want to ask you about Google. They're also coming out and saying ISIS must be blocked out of the open web. And Donald Trump, the frontrunner had said something relatively similar. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're losing a lot of people because of the internet and we have to do something. We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them, maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: It could be argued that Google and Trump may be on the same page here. What do you think, colonel?</p><p>PETERS: Well, I think Google is much closer to the truth than Ms. Sandberg was. The internet is without question the greatest tool for spreading hatred since the invention of moveable type plates for the printing press in the 15th century.</p><p>It's just remarkable how effective it is. The point I am trying to make is, you know, if you can't outthink your enemy symmetrically you do it asymmetrically. And our attempt to argue with them on the internet we cannot win the argument on with speech with arguments with rhetoric.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT: So, it has to be mechanical and technical.</p><p>PETERS: You have to kill them. Yes, you have to kill them.</p><p>KENT: All right. Colonel Ralph Peters talking about asymmetric warfare. We always like talking about that. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>PETERS: Thank you.</p><p>KENT: Whoopi Goldberg threatening to pack her bags and leave the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLDBERG: I don't think that is America. I don't want it to be America. Maybe it's time for me to move?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Find out what Donald Trump said that has Whoopi packing her bags.</p><p>And there could be trouble in paradise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LENA DUNHAM, ACTRESS: Do you consider yourself a feminist?</p><p>CLINTON: Yes. Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: A new report saying that actress Lena Dunham a very avid Hillary supporter, has some misgiving how the candidate treats women. Those details are coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WHOOPI GOLDBERG, ACTOR: I have been part of that when they just use a blanket statement to talk about black people or when they use a blanket statement to talk about white people or women or any other group. I don't think that's America. Maybe it's time for me to move. I can afford to go.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where would you go?</p><p>GOLDBERG: I don't know. You know I have always been an American. This has always been my country, and we have been able to have discussions. And suddenly now, it's turning into -- not them. I need all the candidates to get it together. Get back to American values.</p><p>JO LING KENT, RISK AND REWARD HOST: That was Whoopi Goldberg saying she might leave the country if GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is elected President. The View Co-Host saying Trump needs to stop blaming other people for the problems in America. With me right now to break this down is Crystal Wright. She is the Editor of the Conservative Black Chick Blog and Author of Con Job, the book on your screen right now. So what do you think about Whoopi Goldberg's comments?</p><p>CRYSTAL WRIGHT, CONSERVATIVE BLACK CHICK BLOG: Go, Whoopi, leave. You already said you have enough money to leave America. You don't like Donald Trump's discussion. Finally, we have a candidate who is not talking in political correctness code. Muslims are the ones that are trying to kill Americans. Illegal immigrants are the ones who are criminals. They come here, they steal our jobs and they murder us. Whoopi, what is wrong with what Donald Trump said. We have a candidate sticking up for Americans, too bad for you.</p><p>KENT: He certainly has very blunt things to say. But one of <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>supporters, Lena Dunham, according to her. She was disturbed about the women sexually assaulted by former President Bill Clinton. So Dunham interviewed Hillary last year and asked about a topic -- feminism which is close to the actress' heart.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you consider yourself a feminist?</p><p><person><nameText>HILLARY CLINTON, </nameText></person>PRESIDENTAL CANDIDATE: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Could Hillary's past come back to hurt her? How do you take a surrogate like Lena Dunham seriously when there are two different opinions that are contradictory?</p><p>WRIGHT: Lena Dunham alleges she was raped in college. Yet, she is going to stand by <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>who says she is the poster child for feminism which couldn't be further from the truth. She stood by a man who has disrespected her when he was Governor of Arkansas over and over again -- when he was the governor of Arkansas. They tried to shut down the allegations when they said Bill molested them. Lena Dunham is a farce, she is a joke, and she is a surrogate.</p><p>KENT: What contradictory feelings represent younger women just learning about these issues for the first time?</p><p>WRIGHT: They look to Lena Dunham, and they don't do their homework. They say if Lena likes Hillary, I'll like Hillary.</p><p>KENT: Where do they go? Do they go to Bernie?</p><p>WRIGHT: Bernie is getting a lot of millennial votes. Women look up to Lena Dunham. She is a powerful figure. She is powerful in Hollywood and college students are poisoned on college campuses with a liberal agenda. They are not getting the other side. I just think that Bernie is pulling off some of the millennials but sadly a lot of young women in America are misinformed. We are not doing a good job as Republicans getting our message out. Hillary's message to women everywhere is the on way you can be President of the United States is stand by a philandering whore monger man.</p><p>KENT: She's one candidate of several that the Democrats choose from. Very interesting to talk to you about -- Leonardo Dicaprio ripping the coal and oil and gas industry, says he received the World Economic Forum's Crystal Award on Tuesday. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEONARDO DICAPRIO, ACTOR: We simply cannot afford to allow the corporate greed of the coal, oil, and gas industries to determine the future of humanity. Those entities with a financial interest in preserving this destructive system had denied and even covered under the evidence of our changing climate. Enough is enough. You know better. The world knows better. History will place the blame for this devastation squarely at their feet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Well, Dicaprio himself has reportedly taken 20 trips across the United States and around the world, mostly on private planes in 2014 alone. So Crystal, is he being hypocritical here?</p><p>WRIGHT: Let's talk about emissions on those private jets you are flying around the world. It's ok for Leonardo have corporate greed in Hollywood and to make millions upon millions of dollars for films, but it's not ok for gas and oil companies who employ people around the world, their greed isn't ok. This is once again liberal Hollywood hypocrisy.</p><p>KENT: Do you have think you can count all of his campaigning about climate change as basically a neutral?</p><p>WRIGHT: I don't know how he could give that speech with a straight face, frankly. I don't. Like he said, talk about his carbon footprints. You know.</p><p>KENT: All right, Crystal Wright, Conservative Black Chick Editor, Author of the book Con Job, always fun to see you. Thank you for your perspective.</p><p>WRIGHT: Thanks.</p><p>KENT: All right, Denmark announcing unvaccinated refugees has sudden illness into their country that hasn't been seen in 20 years. Coming up, Dr. Siegel on if we should be worried about the 10,000 refugees coming in to United States. Also, several other health stories in the news. Dr. Siegel's going to tell us the side effects of led in your water -- and how China's smog can affect your health after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KENT: Denmark reporting that refugees have brought in a highly contagious and sometimes fatal bacterial infection into their country. Dr. Marc Siegel is here with us now. Dr. Siegel, explain what this infection does to the body and what some of the symptoms are.</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, MEDICAL TEAM: First of all, Jo, I have always been one of the people saying let's not be politically correct when it comes to refugees and diseases, because they may not be screened the way other people are screened. We are not screening for diphtheria. It's a dangerous disease. The worst thing about it, it gives respiratory symptoms. It's highly contagious. A lot of us had the vaccine for this but it wears often with 10 years. It could easily re-emerge in Denmark.</p><p>I would encourage everybody to get the booster vaccine. Everyone should have it every 10 years.</p><p>KENT: How does it spread and can you see a scenario where refugees being accepted into a country getting treated for it in a timely fashion.</p><p>SIEGEL: It spreads by coughing and sneezing, sometimes by touch. It's really easy to get if you haven't been -- been immunized to it, but it wears off.</p><p>KENT: How do you think public health can prevent that from happening and still allowing refugees to come in? Is that possible?</p><p>SIEGEL: No, it's not possible. You can treat it with an antibiotic. Everybody around this cluster will have to be vaccinated for it right now. If I were practicing medicine in Denmark, I would say to my patients let me give you a booster shot.</p><p>KENT: What do you do to refugees who have been accepted who need this vaccination?</p><p>SIEGEL: You have to give them the vaccination. So who is going to pay for that? You will have to give them the vaccine.</p><p>KENT: How much would that cost?</p><p>SIEGEL: That's costs over $100.</p><p>KENT: For each person?</p><p>SIEGEL: That's right.</p><p>KENT: All right, breaking it down for us, Dr. Marc Siegel.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIEGEL: And I'm not against that. We used to do that with tuberculosis, that wasn't a good vaccine. This is a very good vaccine.</p><p>KENT: All right, good to know. So we know the cost, we know it's happening, thank you so much for getting us the details, Dr. Marc Siegel.</p><p>All right, over 7,000 students trying to get the government to forgive millions of dollars in debt because they couldn't get jobs after college. Coming up, a guest who says getting a job is their own problem.</p><p>And another Biden slip up, a jump in the polls for Bernie Sanders has Biden on the attack on behalf of <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>Here the V.P. calls out socialism in Bernie Sanders after this.</p><p>BERNIE SANDERS, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are 50 points behind the inevitable democratic nominee. Well, guess what? That inevitable candidate ain't so inevitable today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are young people drawn to Bernie? Perhaps an explanation lays an answer rapper Killer Mike gave earlier this week.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How does a rapper supporting Senator Sanders?</p><p>KILLER MIKE, RAPPER: Smoking a joint and reading his tweets.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SANDERS: We were 50 points behind the inevitable democratic nominee. Well, guess what? That inevitable candidate ain't so inevitable today. All over the country, we are seeing huge turnouts of people who are sick and tired of establishment politics.</p><p>KENT: Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders continues to jump in the polls, Vice President Joe Biden takes what appears to be a jab at the nominee in Davos.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT: We need a more progressive tax country not none my country, but other countries, not confiscatory policy, not socialism, a tax code. Everybody pays proportionally a fair share.</p><p>KENT: With me is the Former Republican Governor of Vermont, Jim Douglas. You have known Bernie Sanders for 40 years. Are the mainstream democrats officially worried about Bernie? He is beating <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>in New Hampshire by 27 points.</p><p>JIM DOUGLAS, FORMER REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF VERMONT: I think they are concerned. It's hard to know at this point what will happen ultimately, remember, 12 years ago at this point Howard Deen was leading in the polls. Howard had huge crowds as well. We'll have to see how it plays out. But there is no question the establishment democrats are feeling the burn.</p><p>KENT: I want to show you some highlights from Bernie's last democratic debate over the weekend. See what you think.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: Bernie Sanders who has fought for universal healthcare my entire life. He wants to end Medicare and Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. That's nonsense. I don't take money from big banks. I don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. We are not going tear up the Affordable Care Act, I helped write it. But we'll move on top of that to care for all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Governor Douglas, you have known Bernie Sanders for 40 years. What do you think is not coming across that the voters should know about him as they go into these early-voting contests?</p><p>DOUGLAS: On the positive side, what you see is what you get. He's very transparent and his message hasn't changed. The only difference is he substituted millionaires for billionaires. And I admire someone who has the courage of his convictions. But he's out of the mainstream. He believes in free college and free healthcare and taxing the rich regardless of the consequences. He's pretty much an isolationist in terms of foreign trade policy. But he has a certain appeal as you can see from the crowds he's been drawing.</p><p>KENT: Governor Jim Douglas, what do you think the final outcome will be from where you sit in the northeast?</p><p>DOUGLAS: Well, obviously New Hampshire is our next door neighbor and there is a home court advantage there. But this is a long road to the nomination. As I mentioned, we have been through this before, candidacies rise and fall very quickly. He would seem to be enough out of the mainstream that American voters would probably want someone more centrist. But ironically, Joe, he's appealing to a lot of the same people Donald Trump is.</p><p>KENT: A lot of the swing voters looking for something out of the mainstream. Governor Douglas, we are out of time. I'm so sorry. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>DOUGLAS: Thanks, Joe, take care.</p><p>KENT: Thanks. Now people are asking, dude, where's my job? Over 7,000 students are trying to get the government to forgive millions of dollars in debt because they couldn't get a job after immediately college. Coming up, a guest who says getting a job is their own -- the students' responsibility.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Scott, things aren't at happy as they used to be down here at the unemployment office. Joblessness is no longer just for philosophy majors. Useful people are starting to feel the pinch. I have five years of modern dance and six years of tap.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KENT: In the past six months, more 7,500 borrowers owing $164 million have applied to have their student debt wiped out. They are able to do that because an obscure federal law forgives debt for borrowers who can prove their schools used illegal tactics to recruit them, say promising them a job or something like that. (Inaudible) Charlie Kirk is here with me now. So I want to give some context here, the U.S. Education Department already agreed do cancel $28 million for 1,300 former students of Corinthian because that college went bankrupt last year. So how does this particular claim compare?</p><p>CHARLIE KIRK, POINT USA FOUNDER: Yeah, it's not as strong an argument as the Corinthian. If the Department of Education agrees to forgive the student loans in this current pool, it could start a slippery slope. It's $164 million in the aggregate. There might be other students who say wait a second, they got their student loans forgiven, I was sold a bill of goods.</p><p>KENT: Is it a qualifying claim to say I couldn't find a job because my school promised so I can make that argument. Does that actually work?</p><p>KIRK: In this particular instance, I really don't think. If a school goes bankruptcy and they were being deceiving and illegal in their recruiting tactics, they are saying they were deceiving. They weren't necessarily being as strong to the message. They are a college trying to recruit students. They are going to try to market their school as best they can.</p><p>KENT: That was Charlie Kirk, thank you so much, coming up next, Making Money with Charles Payne.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2016 Fox News Network, LLC.

Risk &amp; Reward starts right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST: The bulls and bears are out with heavy volatility shocking the markets all week including today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to Risk &amp; Reward. I'm Jo Ling Kent in for Deirdre Bolton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It has been a wild ride with the Dow ending higher today as the European central banks says it's ready for new stimulus. We've got you covered from the markets to oil and everything in between.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have Lori Rothman on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Lori, help us makes sense of this going into Friday. Where do we leave it today&gt;</p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Say to make sense of this market they be extraordinarily rich and they won't be carrying their hair out struggling with all of this volatility.</p><p>So, this is it where we stand right now. It was a rally today. We closed off best levels. You know, stocks fell off so deeply yesterday. We fell below those the late August lows and that left a lot of traders believe in the market was oversold that they came back. And then of course, you got to talk about the price of oil.</p><p>So, oil came back above $30 for a time. It faded but still managed to snap a three-session losing streak to close at $29.73 a barrel. That was critical. So, a lot of these oil names that had been absolutely clobbered over the last year came up big time. You got names like CONSOL energy up 19 percent. Southwest energy, up almost 19 percent today. So, that's really the story here.</p><p>So, between the technical and the oil story people come back to stocks here today. The Dow will close at 15,882. After the bell earnings, Starbucks is the headliner. Kind of a disappointment. Shares down in the extended session, 4 percent at moment. Stocks revenue from Starbucks.</p><p>The things were great here in the U.S. despite that whole big to do about the plain red coffee cups over the Christmas season. But everything was fine there. And of course, the problem as we've been reporting month after month now with Asia, the sales locations in Asia and the whole region were a little bit soft.</p><p>And so, of course investors are concerned with all these companies with exposure to that part of the world. Back to you, Jo Ling.</p><p>KENT: Lori, thank you so much for joining us. And now to Arizona republican Senator, John McCain saying voters will associate the plunge in the stock market with President Obama and the democrats.</p><p>With me now to break this down the CEO of CKE, the parent company of Hardee's and Carl's Jr., he's the former Mitt Romney economic advisor, Andy Puzder. Andy, what do you think of McCain's comments? Did that crash in 2008 scar him to think that it will happen again?</p><p>ANDY PUZDER, HARDEE'S &amp; CARL'S JR. CEO: Well, it clearly it scared him. But there were a lot of other things going on in the economy at that time that also made that decline in the stock market more significant.</p><p>We're 10 years or 10 months from the election so a lot can happen in 10 months. If the stock market is still in big trouble in 10 months I would say democrats will have a real problem. But that's a -- 10 months is a long time from now.</p><p>KENT: Well, you know, Andy, we see the latest GOP polls or polls of the GOP race, Donald Trump widening his lead to over 20 points over Senator Ted Cruz in New Hampshire, very important early voting state. So, do you think this means that Trump will actually be able to carry a win and how much does that matter after Iowa and going in to South Carolina?</p><p>PUZDER: Well, the Iowa and New Hampshire are very, very important states and if Donald Trump can win both of those states I think it could be very significant. The interesting thing about the Iowa poll for me was that, Ted Cruz, after his comment about New York values and such, he actually went from 6 percent to 14 percent in the polls.</p><p>So, he had more than, you know, more than doubled the percentage of vote that he was getting. So, I think there is still a lot -- there's a lot of moving pieces out there. This is very, very difficult election to predict. Donald Trump looks very strong now.</p><p>KENT: Yes.</p><p>PUZDER But nobody's voted yet. So, we really need to have some people out there voting. And the big -- for me, the poll I look at is, how does each republican candidate do against <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton. </nameText></person>Because there is one issue.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT: Right. Well, we see in the Monmouth poll that Trump is able to carry it for the republicans at least as of now. But, Andy, I have to ask you who are you going to be supporting in these primaries?</p><p>PUZDER: Sure. I wish I knew. At the moment I'm not -- I'm not committed to anybody. I think we have a great slate of candidates I could get behind any of them for president. But again, I become a one issue candidate, or one issue voter, which is who can win? And if I felt positive about who had the best chance to win I'd be out there supporting that person because we really need to win.</p><p>KENT: All right. So, they are still trying to earn your vote.</p><p>PUZDER: Yes.</p><p>KENT: Well, what about Donald Trump making headlines by saying he wants to force Apple to manufacture all of its products including the iPhone in the U.S. if elected president. Listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to get things coming. We're going to get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other companies.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: All right. For the record, Apple does make its MacBook pros in Austin, Texas. But looking at broader point, Andy, does this work?</p><p>PUZDER: Well, when he says he's going to get them do. If you offer them incentives that make it economically rational for them to manufacture those products in the United States I think they would be glad to do so. The president can't force them to do that. You know, it would take an act to Congress. You really couldn't discriminate against Apple in particular.</p><p>KENT: Right.</p><p>PUZDER: So, I'm not sure why he is singling Apple. I mean, Ford makes cars or GM makes cars in Asia. Are we going to require that they make all their cars here? Are we going to tell Toyota and BMW that, you know, we're not going to allow our car manufacturers to manufacture in their country?</p><p>You know, it's a -- it's a very, very difficult thing for him to do.</p><p>KENT: Right.</p><p>PUZDER: But he is appealing to these blue-collar voters...</p><p>KENT: That's exactly it.</p><p>PUZDER: ... who feel like the economy is coming at him in two ways. One is that jobs are going to China. And the other is that the jobs that stay here are being taken by people that are here illegally.</p><p>So, I think what he is doing is he's appealing to this base that is risen up for him that really is concerned about their jobs, and their families and their income.</p><p>KENT: Right.</p><p>PUZDER: And part of that is jobs going to China. The other part is jobs going to people that aren't -- that aren't here legally. So, I think that he is appealing to his base. I don't know -- I don't -- I'd love to see him do things that made, that incentivized companies to manufacture in the United States, any president should do that.</p><p>KENT: Andy, I want to ask you. You have some news today. Hardee's and Carl, Jr.'s is they are going to put out $4 menu for people. You want to compete with Wendy's and other fast-food chains in a really tough fast-food environment.</p><p>PUZDER: Yes.</p><p>KENT: Why go in that direction and not stick with the cheaper items on the menus like the dollar menu type of thing?</p><p>PUZDER: Well, we've never had a dollar menu. What we're doing is we're bundling products. So, it's a $4, for $4 you get really great double cheeseburger, you get a great spicy chicken sandwich, a soda and fries. So, it's a really -- I think it's a superior deal to what any of our competitors are offering.</p><p>But when your competitors are bundling and selling a lot of products for a set price, if you don't -- if you don't respond to that you're going to lose customers. And, you know, we want to keep people coming into the restaurants. And we think this is a good deal for them. We'll do fine with it. I'm real happy with this. No dollar menus, though. Dollar menus are a bad idea.</p><p>KENT: Al right. You heard it here. Andy Puzder, he's a CEO of Hardee's and Carl's Jr. at CKE and a former Mitt Romney economic advisor. Your endorsement up for grabs. We'll be watching for that. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>PUZDER: Thanks, Jo.</p><p>KENT: A new Fox report saying some of <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>e-mails on her private server contained information that was so secret that even senior lawmakers involved in oversight could not even read them or access them.</p><p>One of those lawmakers is here with us right now, judiciary committee member, which has oversight of the Department of Justice and the FBI. Representative Doug Collins. Representative, thanks for coming on.</p><p>DOUG COLLINS, GEORGIA STATE REPRESENTATIVE: Jo, glad to be here today.</p><p>KENT: So, I'm told you have military clearance to access lots of classified information. What does it feel like not to be able to access this sensitive data?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, I think it's interesting for those of us in the military who dealt with classified information on various levels in our careers, but also as members of Congress, it is just mystifying to me why the former Secretary of State is having such a problem trying to frankly, trying to explain a way something she should not be explaining away.</p><p>There is nothing that the Justice Department now should not do to get to the bottom of this Congress whatever it takes, this was a malfeasance of law. And it's one frankly where I'm calling on Mrs. Clinton to suspend her presidential campaign.</p><p>She needs to be straight with the American people. And if she's mishandled classified information that could put people's lives in danger. That is disqualification for a Commander-in-Chief and I'm just shocked that she is taking it so lightly.</p><p>KENT: All right. So, does this then obviously, for you in your opinion, undercut Clinton's claim that the material was innocuous and basically fully contradict that?</p><p>COLLINS: It totally contradicts that. When you deal with these special access kind of programs, these are deals that deal with current ongoing operations that are -- that are so classified that they require even a more disclosure notice past the top secret clearance on which normally members can have.</p><p>That is not someone not even is mentioned remotely to be unclassified setting that should throw off alarms all over the system. And for her just to cavalierly say, oh, there is nothing but innocuous stuff on here, is frankly at this point she is being disingenuous.</p><p>She is I think she is lying to the American people because something she doesn't want to talk about.</p><p>KENT: Representative, one quick question for you, because you can't access it, what do you think are in those emails? What do you presume in them?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, I'm not going to presume because at this point in time those were -- they're classified the way they were classified because of significance of the national security and world implications.</p><p>KENT: OK.</p><p>COLLINS: And to say any different, I mean, that's just something that should make her to have to answer this. And the Department of Justice needs to be all over this even more than they already are.</p><p>KENT: Congressman Doug Collins, good to talk with you. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>COLLINS: Jo, I appreciate it. Thanks so much.</p><p>KENT: And Judge Napolitano weighing in on Hillary's predicament saying last night this could be Clinton's down fall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: The case against her is overwhelming, damning and from her perspective grave.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Coming up, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>responds. Hear what she had to say.</p><p>And first, sexual assault and now some German refugees are suing. Find out why. We have an attorney who says the U.S. could face a similar situation.</p><p>And bringing new meaning to the phrase, \"killing them with kindness.\" Facebook chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg saying likes can help fight terrorists. Colonel Ralph Peters weighing in on Sandberg's counterterrorism strategy after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, Facebook COO: They launch what think called a like attack on the Facebook page of the NPD.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: This is the continuation of an interagency dispute that has been going on now for some months. As the State Department has confirmed, I never sent or received any material marked classified. And that hasn't changed.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And when she says she never sent or received anything marked classified it's a word game. Nothing is marked classified. It's marked confidential, secret, top secret or SAP.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Former Secretary of State, <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>continues to brush off reports that her private server contained highly classified intelligence.</p><p>Attorney Troy Slaten is joining me to break this down. So you think, Troy, that he -- that Hillary is playing a word game here? Are we talking about just vocab is different?</p><p>TROY SLATEN, ATTORNEY: I mean, she is. I mean, Jo, anybody that understands what the secret service does, and that's what her main defenses, is that the secret service was protecting the server, knows that they're not looking at the traffic that's going in and out from this server.</p><p>She is playing a word game. Just because it wasn't marked classified at that moment doesn't mean it that it didn't contain classified information. And she should know. And the I.G. report confirms what everybody already widely knew. And that's that she had some of our nation's most secret stuff on that personal, unsecured server.</p><p>KENT: All right, Troy. We also have some sound hit that we want to play for you, that some say <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>had an ulterior motive when she praised President Obama in the last debate over the weekend. Listen to what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama. Thanks goodness, President Obama vetoed it. President Obama has led our country out of the great recession.</p><p>TRUMP: You notice how positive she is about the president? You know why, right? You know why. Because she wants to stay out of the clink.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: All right, Troy, do you think that Hillary is appealing to President Obama here, especially as some of his surrogates go out and essentially campaign for her or do you think that trump is incorrect?</p><p>SLATEN: No. I think it might even be more nefarious than that, Jo. The person that decides whether or not she'll be indicted is the Attorney General of the United States. The Attorney General is like the D.A. for the United States. She is the one, Loretta Lynch, who will decide whether or not Hillary is indicted.</p><p>And Loretta Lynch was appointed by President Obama. Now it would be the scandal of all scandals if it turned out that the president or the White House was putting any pressure on the Justice Department to stop an indictment from coming out just because she is running for president or that this is an election year.</p><p>KENT: All right. Well, we have some other developing news, Troy. Under new changes to the U.S. Visa waiver program, nationals who've been in Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria since March 2011, can no longer visit the United States under the visa waiver program.</p><p>And then over in Germany you also have developments there. Refugees that were welcomed by Chancellor Angela Merkel are now suing the government, some of them are, for taking too long to process their claims for asylum.</p><p>My first question is, do you think the U.S. is going to face any sort of backlash like that from refugees? Are they entirely different situations here?</p><p>SLATEN: I mean they are different situations. It looks like the people in Germany are really fighting back against this onslaught of what was unfettered migration of people that they weren't really able to properly vet. Now I think that it's good that the United States has put the brakes on this, but, no.</p><p>The Congress has the ultimate authority under the Constitution to regulate immigration. And I don't think that anyone would have a successful lawsuit to say that the United States is taking too long to vet them and decide whether or not they could have entry into the United States.</p><p>But in Germany, we're seeing that the people that are coming in that are not having a chance to assimilate because there are too many people coming in, I mean, they're having mass sexual assaults and rapes in Cologne which happens to be the same city where they're filing lawsuits for taking too long to grant them asylum status.</p><p>KENT: All right. Well, there is a lot to debate there but we have to move on to another lighter topic.</p><p>A snowboarder who survived an avalanche at Lake Tahoe's Sugar Bowl Resort in California is facing a very serious matter now. It's a lawsuit for criminal trespassing. And you can see this GoPro camera captioning Christian Michael Mares tumble down the slope.</p><p>He was really lucky narrowly dodging all those trees you see there, finally landing half buried in the snow. He is pretty lucky to be alive at this point. But a lawsuit filed by the resort is alleging he triggered the avalanche in an area that was clearly marked as closed.</p><p>So, Troy, even though he says he didn't know it was an area that was off limits. How do you think the case is going to proceed here? The sheriff's office got a -- has in the sense right now?</p><p>SLATEN: So, he is facing two potential legal problems. First is a criminal action by -- initiated by the sheriff, will be prosecuted by the D.A. that alleges that he was trespassing. He was in an area on private property without permission.</p><p>But he is also facing a potential lawsuit by the operators of the ski resort who had to mount a response to rescue him, and it place a lot of lives in danger because by him going into that off-limits area he triggered this avalanche.</p><p>And 27 people die every year from avalanches. And this is an area has been off limits since the 2010-2011 season. So, he's got a lot of explaining to do. And it may ultimately be up to a jury to decide whether it was clearly marked, and whether an average, reasonable person would know that you're not supposed to go there.</p><p>The fact that he had a GoPro camera mounted to his helmet may lead people to believe that he was an extreme sports advocate, and therefore looking for some danger.</p><p>KENT: Well, either way, it is very well-documented. Troy Slaten, thank you so much for joining us tonight.</p><p>SLATEN: Thanks for having me, Jo.</p><p>KENT: Whoopi Goldberg threatening to leave the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHOOPI GOLDBERG, ACTRESS &amp; HOST: I don't think that's America. I don't want it to be America. Maybe time for me to move?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Find out what Donald Trump said that has her potentially packing her bags. And Facebook COO, Sheryl Sandberg is trying to kill ISIS with kindness.</p><p>Coming up, Colonel Ralph Peters talking to us about if Facebook -- if a Facebook-like attack would actually work.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDBERG: They launch what they called a like attack on the Facebook page of the NPD.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Facebook executive, the COO, Sheryl Sandberg believes that Facebook likes can help counter ISIS recruitment. Listen to what she had to say at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDBERG: The best antidote to bad speech is a good speech. They launch what they called a like attack on the Facebook page of the NPD. So, the NPD is the new Nazi party. That page is filled with intolerance.</p><p>And rather than scream and protest, they got 100,000 people to like the page who did not the like the page and then put messages of tolerance on the page.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Retired U.S. Lieutenant Colonel and Fox News military analyst, Ralph Peters joins me now. Colonel, can we really kill ISIS and their recruitment an propaganda with kindness there?</p><p>RALPH PETERS, FOX NEWS MILITARY ANALYST: Well, we should start by sending cupcakes. I like cupcakes. They must like cupcakes too, right? Now, truly Ms. Sandberg's remarks in Davos are one of the most remarkable combinations of naivet\u201a and cynicism that I have ever encountered.</p><p>The cynicism is obviously Facebook doesn't want to block sites. It wants track. They doesn't want a reputation of blocking sites. So, this is seems to be an immaculate solution. Don't block a terror sites just get people to like them but then write nice things instead of bad things terrorists write.</p><p>Well, then you get the naivet\u201a.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT: So, how do you think this plays in, Colonel, to the broader discussion that the White House has been trying to have with Silicon Valley and big tech companies to hand over information that they believe they need without a search warrant?</p><p>PETERS: Well, Silicon Valley does not take terrorism seriously as you saw in the case of Ms. Sandberg. They're all fine with disrupting the way we communicate. But they don't see how the terrorists are disrupting the world.</p><p>But if I may just say about, you know, what she wants to do is get people to write nice things. Our State Department and others have been trying to counter ISIS on the web and it doesn't work. It doesn't work because people who graduated from MIT or Harvard or Yale, they have no idea how these terrorists think.</p><p>And what we offer, our counteroffer is crazy. Islamic state offers the, you know, dysfunctional young basement dwellers revenge, a chance to torture and kill males. To rape and enslave women. And if you get killed you get the bullet train to paradise. What is our counteroffer? Our counteroffer is a job at Wal-Mart.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT: And that's what they're trying -- that I think that's what, if you look at what Sheryl Sandberg is attempting to say here, regardless of what you think of her argument, is that a counter speech and counter propaganda is something that needs to be done. And what you see actually is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETERS: You can't do it.</p><p>KENT: ... the White House saying that they want to do, who knows if they actually agree on this. But I want to move on to Google...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PETERS: No, but truly they cannot do it. We can't do it because we have nothing to offer those guys.</p><p>KENT: But, Colonel, with all due respect if you look at who controls the pipelines and the ability of the terrorists to actually communicate it happens on those platforms. So, that is...</p><p>PETERS: Yes.</p><p>KENT: ... being able to work with these companies and actually convince them to do something more, perhaps you could argue is one of the ways to counter what is happening in terms of recruitment, right?</p><p>PETERS: We, of course we want them to block their -- yes, we want them to block their sites. We want -- we need some back door de-encryption capability at certain points. But when you get into these ideas that, no, we just have to say nice things to counter their bad things, the example she used about neo-Nazi Party, the NPD in Germany. Bad example because since Cologne, their numbers are actually increasing.</p><p>This doesn't work. When you have the overeducated trying to convince the undereducated that if you really, you just need to be nicer and everything will go your way, it does not work. Your upper class can never convince to love it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT: So, you're looking for more out of them? You're not looking to abandon cooperating or collaborating?</p><p>PETERS: Oh, of course not. We want them, we need Silicon Valley to do far more but then they are lacking to do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT: Well, speaking of Silicon Valley, Colonel, I want to ask you about Google. They're also coming out and saying ISIS must be blocked out of the open web. And Donald Trump, the frontrunner had said something relatively similar. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're losing a lot of people because of the internet and we have to do something. We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them, maybe in certain areas, closing that internet up in some way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: It could be argued that Google and Trump may be on the same page here. What do you think, colonel?</p><p>PETERS: Well, I think Google is much closer to the truth than Ms. Sandberg was. The internet is without question the greatest tool for spreading hatred since the invention of moveable type plates for the printing press in the 15th century.</p><p>It's just remarkable how effective it is. The point I am trying to make is, you know, if you can't outthink your enemy symmetrically you do it asymmetrically. And our attempt to argue with them on the internet we cannot win the argument on with speech with arguments with rhetoric.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENT: So, it has to be mechanical and technical.</p><p>PETERS: You have to kill them. Yes, you have to kill them.</p><p>KENT: All right. Colonel Ralph Peters talking about asymmetric warfare. We always like talking about that. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>PETERS: Thank you.</p><p>KENT: Whoopi Goldberg threatening to pack her bags and leave the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLDBERG: I don't think that is America.

Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: A new report saying that actress Lena Dunham a very avid Hillary supporter, has some misgiving how the candidate treats women. Those details are coming up next.</p><p>WHOOPI GOLDBERG, ACTOR: I have been part of that when they just use a blanket statement to talk about black people or when they use a blanket statement to talk about white people or women or any other group. I don't think that's America. Maybe it's time for me to move. I can afford to go.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where would you go?</p><p>GOLDBERG: I don't know. You know I have always been an American. This has always been my country, and we have been able to have discussions. And suddenly now, it's turning into -- not them. I need all the candidates to get it together. Get back to American values.</p><p>JO LING KENT, RISK AND REWARD HOST: That was Whoopi Goldberg saying she might leave the country if GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is elected President. The View Co-Host saying Trump needs to stop blaming other people for the problems in America. With me right now to break this down is Crystal Wright. She is the Editor of the Conservative Black Chick Blog and Author of Con Job, the book on your screen right now. So what do you think about Whoopi Goldberg's comments?</p><p>CRYSTAL WRIGHT, CONSERVATIVE BLACK CHICK BLOG: Go, Whoopi, leave. You already said you have enough money to leave America. You don't like Donald Trump's discussion. Finally, we have a candidate who is not talking in political correctness code. Muslims are the ones that are trying to kill Americans. Illegal immigrants are the ones who are criminals. They come here, they steal our jobs and they murder us. Whoopi, what is wrong with what Donald Trump said. We have a candidate sticking up for Americans, too bad for you.</p><p>KENT: He certainly has very blunt things to say. But one of <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton's </nameText></person>supporters, Lena Dunham, according to her. She was disturbed about the women sexually assaulted by former President Bill Clinton. So Dunham interviewed Hillary last year and asked about a topic -- feminism which is close to the actress' heart.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you consider yourself a feminist?</p><p><person><nameText>HILLARY CLINTON, </nameText></person>PRESIDENTAL CANDIDATE: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Could Hillary's past come back to hurt her? How do you take a surrogate like Lena Dunham seriously when there are two different opinions that are contradictory?</p><p>WRIGHT: Lena Dunham alleges she was raped in college. Yet, she is going to stand by <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>who says she is the poster child for feminism which couldn't be further from the truth. She stood by a man who has disrespected her when he was Governor of Arkansas over and over again -- when he was the governor of Arkansas. They tried to shut down the allegations when they said Bill molested them. Lena Dunham is a farce, she is a joke, and she is a surrogate.</p><p>KENT: What contradictory feelings represent younger women just learning about these issues for the first time?</p><p>WRIGHT: They look to Lena Dunham, and they don't do their homework. They say if Lena likes Hillary, I'll like Hillary.</p><p>KENT: Where do they go? Do they go to Bernie?</p><p>WRIGHT: Bernie is getting a lot of millennial votes. Women look up to Lena Dunham. She is a powerful figure. She is powerful in Hollywood and college students are poisoned on college campuses with a liberal agenda. They are not getting the other side. I just think that Bernie is pulling off some of the millennials but sadly a lot of young women in America are misinformed. We are not doing a good job as Republicans getting our message out. Hillary's message to women everywhere is the on way you can be President of the United States is stand by a philandering whore monger man.</p><p>KENT: She's one candidate of several that the Democrats choose from. Very interesting to talk to you about -- <person><nameText>Leonardo Dicaprio </nameText></person>ripping the coal and oil and gas industry, says he received the World Economic Forum's Crystal Award on Tuesday. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>LEONARDO DICAPRIO, </nameText></person>ACTOR: We simply cannot afford to allow the corporate greed of the coal, oil, and gas industries to determine the future of humanity. Those entities with a financial interest in preserving this destructive system had denied and even covered under the evidence of our changing climate. Enough is enough. You know better. The world knows better. History will place the blame for this devastation squarely at their feet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Well, Dicaprio himself has reportedly taken 20 trips across the United States and around the world, mostly on private planes in 2014 alone. So Crystal, is he being hypocritical here?</p><p>WRIGHT: Let's talk about emissions on those private jets you are flying around the world. It's ok for Leonardo have corporate greed in Hollywood and to make millions upon millions of dollars for films, but it's not ok for gas and oil companies who employ people around the world, their greed isn't ok. This is once again liberal Hollywood hypocrisy.</p><p>KENT: Do you have think you can count all of his campaigning about climate change as basically a neutral?</p><p>WRIGHT: I don't know how he could give that speech with a straight face, frankly. I don't. Like he said, talk about his carbon footprints. You know.</p><p>KENT: All right, Crystal Wright, Conservative Black Chick Editor, Author of the book Con Job, always fun to see you. Thank you for your perspective.</p><p>WRIGHT: Thanks.</p><p>KENT: All right, Denmark announcing unvaccinated refugees has sudden illness into their country that hasn't been seen in 20 years. Coming up, Dr. Siegel on if we should be worried about the 10,000 refugees coming in to United States. Also, several other health stories in the news. Dr. Siegel's going to tell us the side effects of led in your water -- and how China's smog can affect your health after this.</p><p>KENT: Denmark reporting that refugees have brought in a highly contagious and sometimes fatal bacterial infection into their country. Dr. Marc Siegel is here with us now. Dr. Siegel, explain what this infection does to the body and what some of the symptoms are.</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, MEDICAL TEAM: First of all, Jo, I have always been one of the people saying let's not be politically correct when it comes to refugees and diseases, because they may not be screened the way other people are screened. We are not screening for diphtheria. It's a dangerous disease. The worst thing about it, it gives respiratory symptoms. It's highly contagious. A lot of us had the vaccine for this but it wears often with 10 years. It could easily re-emerge in Denmark.</p><p>I would encourage everybody to get the booster vaccine. Everyone should have it every 10 years.</p><p>KENT: How does it spread and can you see a scenario where refugees being accepted into a country getting treated for it in a timely fashion.</p><p>SIEGEL: It spreads by coughing and sneezing, sometimes by touch. It's really easy to get if you haven't been -- been immunized to it, but it wears off.</p><p>KENT: How do you think public health can prevent that from happening and still allowing refugees to come in? Is that possible?</p><p>SIEGEL: No, it's not possible. You can treat it with an antibiotic. Everybody around this cluster will have to be vaccinated for it right now. If I were practicing medicine in Denmark, I would say to my patients let me give you a booster shot.</p><p>KENT: What do you do to refugees who have been accepted who need this vaccination?</p><p>SIEGEL: You have to give them the vaccination. So who is going to pay for that? You will have to give them the vaccine.</p><p>KENT: How much would that cost?</p><p>SIEGEL: That's costs over $100.</p><p>KENT: For each person?</p><p>SIEGEL: That's right.</p><p>KENT: All right, breaking it down for us, Dr. Marc Siegel.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIEGEL: And I'm not against that. We used to do that with tuberculosis, that wasn't a good vaccine. This is a very good vaccine.</p><p>KENT: All right, good to know. So we know the cost, we know it's happening, thank you so much for getting us the details, Dr. Marc Siegel.</p><p>All right, over 7,000 students trying to get the government to forgive millions of dollars in debt because they couldn't get jobs after college.

All over the country, we are seeing huge turnouts of people who are sick and tired of establishment politics.</p><p>KENT: Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders continues to jump in the polls, Vice President Joe Biden takes what appears to be a jab at the nominee in Davos.</p><p>JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT: We need a more progressive tax country not none my country, but other countries, not confiscatory policy, not socialism, a tax code. Everybody pays proportionally a fair share.</p><p>KENT: With me is the Former Republican Governor of Vermont, Jim Douglas. You have known Bernie Sanders for 40 years. Are the mainstream democrats officially worried about Bernie? He is beating <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>in New Hampshire by 27 points.</p><p>JIM DOUGLAS, FORMER REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF VERMONT: I think they are concerned. It's hard to know at this point what will happen ultimately, remember, 12 years ago at this point Howard Deen was leading in the polls. Howard had huge crowds as well. We'll have to see how it plays out. But there is no question the establishment democrats are feeling the burn.</p><p>KENT: I want to show you some highlights from Bernie's last democratic debate over the weekend. See what you think.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: Bernie Sanders who has fought for universal healthcare my entire life. He wants to end Medicare and Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. That's nonsense. I don't take money from big banks. I don't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. We are not going tear up the Affordable Care Act, I helped write it. But we'll move on top of that to care for all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENT: Governor Douglas, you have known Bernie Sanders for 40 years. What do you think is not coming across that the voters should know about him as they go into these early-voting contests?</p><p>DOUGLAS: On the positive side, what you see is what you get. He's very transparent and his message hasn't changed. The only difference is he substituted millionaires for billionaires. And I admire someone who has the courage of his convictions. But he's out of the mainstream. He believes in free college and free healthcare and taxing the rich regardless of the consequences. He's pretty much an isolationist in terms of foreign trade policy. But he has a certain appeal as you can see from the crowds he's been drawing.</p><p>KENT: Governor Jim Douglas, what do you think the final outcome will be from where you sit in the northeast?</p><p>DOUGLAS: Well, obviously New Hampshire is our next door neighbor and there is a home court advantage there. But this is a long road to the nomination. As I mentioned, we have been through this before, candidacies rise and fall very quickly. He would seem to be enough out of the mainstream that American voters would probably want someone more centrist. But ironically, Joe, he's appealing to a lot of the same people Donald Trump is.</p><p>KENT: A lot of the swing voters looking for something out of the mainstream. Governor Douglas, we are out of time. I'm so sorry. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>DOUGLAS: Thanks, Joe, take care.</p><p>KENT: Thanks. Now people are asking, dude, where's my job? Over 7,000 students are trying to get the government to forgive millions of dollars in debt because they couldn't get a job after immediately college. Coming up, a guest who says getting a job is their own -- the students' responsibility.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Scott, things aren't at happy as they used to be down here at the unemployment office. Joblessness is no longer just for philosophy majors. Useful people are starting to feel the pinch. I have five years of modern dance and six years of tap.</p><p>KENT: In the past six months, more 7,500 borrowers owing $164 million have applied to have their student debt wiped out. They are able to do that because an obscure federal law forgives debt for borrowers who can prove their schools used illegal tactics to recruit them, say promising them a job or something like that. (Inaudible) Charlie Kirk is here with me now. So I want to give some context here, the U.S. Education Department already agreed do cancel $28 million for 1,300 former students of Corinthian because that college went bankrupt last year. So how does this particular claim compare?</p><p>CHARLIE KIRK, POINT USA FOUNDER: Yeah, it's not as strong an argument as the Corinthian. If the Department of Education agrees to forgive the student loans in this current pool, it could start a slippery slope. It's $164 million in the aggregate. There might be other students who say wait a second, they got their student loans forgiven, I was sold a bill of goods.</p><p>KENT: Is it a qualifying claim to say I couldn't find a job because my school promised so I can make that argument. Does that actually work?</p><p>KIRK: In this particular instance, I really don't think. If a school goes bankruptcy and they were being deceiving and illegal in their recruiting tactics, they are saying they were deceiving. They weren't necessarily being as strong to the message. They are a college trying to recruit students. They are going to try to market their school as best they can.</p><p>KENT: That was Charlie Kirk, thank you so much, coming up next, Making Money with Charles Payne.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2016012101cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HX6-1BG1-DXH2-61SV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6572\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>RISK &amp;

The settlement also eliminates mandatory arbitration and limits Google's use of non-disclosure agreements for employees involved in these cases.<br/>It also includes a $310 million commitment to fund and create a diversity, equity and inclusion advisory council comprised of outside experts.<br/>In a post announcing the settlement, Google's head of people operations Eileen Naughton said the company is committing to five new guiding principles and a list of detailed changes.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 28: Google to enforce 30% take from in-app purchases next year<br/>Google said on Monday that it will enforce rules that require app developers distributing Android software on the Google Play Store to use its in-app payment system.<br/>The move means developers have until Sept. 30, 2021 to use Google's billing system, which takes a 30% fee from payments, instead of independent payment systems. The announcement brings Google Play's policies in line with Apple's App Store policies, which have come under fire from developers and regulators over several issues, including its own 30% cut.<br/>Apple has argued against scrutiny of its App Store by pointing out that other app stores, like Google Play, also take a 30% fee from in-app purchases.<br/>Google's existing policy said developers have to use Google's billing system on in-app purchases made within the Google Play Store, but it had not been enforced, Google said on Monday in a blog post.<br/>Google didn't name apps that had been skirting the rule. It said 97% of developers selling digital goods already comply with its policies. Netflix and Spotify prompt users inside their Android apps to use a credit card to pay them directly.<br/>\"We want to be sure our policies are clear and up to date so they can be applied consistently and fairly to all developers, and so we have clarified the language in our Payments Policy to be more explicit that all developers selling digital goods in their apps are required to use Google Play's billing system,\" Google said in the announcement, signed by Sameer Samat, a VP of product management.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 25: Google will pause ads referencing election after polls close on Nov. 3<br/>Google said in a letter to advertisers on Friday that it will pause election-specific ads on Nov. 3 after polls close.<br/>\"Given the likelihood of delayed election results this year, when polls close on November 3, we will pause ads referencing the 2020 election, the candidates, or its outcome,\" Google told CNBC. \"This is a temporary measure, and we'll notify advertisers when this policy is lifted.\"<br/>The restrictions apply to Google Ads, DV360, YouTube and AdX Authorized Buyer, according to an email sent from Google to advertisers obtained by CNBC. The letter says Google expects \"an unprecedented amount of votes will be counted after election day.\"<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 25: Alphabet Class A<br/>Alphabet's Google services experienced a brief shutdown Thursday evening, with users reporting issues with services like Gmail, YouTube, Google drive and the flagship search engine. Google is investigating the cause of the disruption, but a person with knowledge of the situation told The New York Times the company has ruled out a cyberattack.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 25: Cloud gaming battle heats up as Amazon enters the ring to take on Microsoft and Google<br/>LONDON - As Microsoft battles it out with Sony in this year's edition of the console wars, it's now got another rival to worry about.<br/>Amazon announced Thursday that it would launch its own cloud gaming service, a kind of \"Netflix for games\" that forgoes the need for consoles or dedicated hardware to play video games. Called Luna, the platform comes with a library of 100 titles and users can play with a special Luna controller.<br/>The entry of Amazon into the raft of companies developing such game-streaming services has long been rumored. The company's announcement now marks an official challenge to the likes of Microsoft and Google, which have both recently launched their own respective cloud gaming products.<br/>But Amazon is taking a slightly different approach to those companies. Instead of going for an all-access subscription - like Microsoft is with Xbox Game Pass - Amazon is launching so-called \"channels\" for a range of publishers, for which users have to pay a monthly fee. Only Ubisoft and Amazon itself have been confirmed as companies included in that offering so far, with Amazon's Luna+ channel priced at $6 a month.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 24: Google will help employees pay off student loans amid 'debt crisis'<br/>Google's latest employee perk to attract talent is help with student loans.<br/>Starting in 2021, Google will match up to $2,500 per full-time employee per year toward their student loan payments, John Casey, Google's director of Global Benefits told employees Thursday, according to an internal email viewed by CNBC.<br/>\"College degrees are out of reach for too many people around the world, and the soaring student loan debt crisis has widened an already pervasive wealth gap, globally,\" Casey said in Thursday's email. He added that Americans, in particular, face a student loan deficit upward of $1.5 trillion dollars, which he said is twice what it was a decade ago.<br/>The company's new perk aims to help students save the extra money so they can do things like purchase a home or start a family, Casey said in a Thursday blog post.<br/>Google will roll out the new benefit in the U.S. first, but plans to expand to employees globally. During Q4, the company will \"collect additional information to inform the rollout,\" Casey said in the email. \"It gets complicated with different lenders country by country,\" he added.<br/>The new perk comes as the company, whose famous in-office perks aren't available during remote work, competes against tech companies like Facebook and Apple for young tech talent. The cost of living is particularly expensive in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the bulk of tech companies and employees are headquartered.<br/>Casey told employees the latest announcement is an expansion of its education reimbursements for employees, and that it partnered with Google's employee resource groups Black Googler Network and Black Leadership Advisory Group, which he credited for \"helping us to get this done.\"<br/>\"Because the burden of student loans weighs disproportionately on communities of color and women, this is a step toward building a more equitable Google too,\" Casey said in Thursday's email.</p><p>September 24: Google explores offering flexible work-from-home options after the pandemic<br/>Google is re-thinking its long-term work options for employees after a survey revealed that most of them don't want to come back to the office full-time. CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" crew reports.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 23: United turns to interactive Google map to help travelers unsure of where to go in coronavirus era<br/>United Airlines is turning to a Google-powered interactive map to help still-scarce travelers find destinations that fit the coronavirus era.<br/>The map, which launched on United's website Wednesday, allows travelers to punch in the most they want to spend on a ticket and filter airports by their destination activities or descriptions: beaches, beer and breweries, culture, food and drink, hiking, national parks, outdoors, romantic, skiing and snowboarding, and snorkeling and scuba.<br/>For example, a search for a return trip from Newark, New Jersey, the first week in November with a preference for national parks and hiking yielded a $117 flight to Denver, a $97 flight to Las Vegas, a $207 flight to Portland, Oregon, all in basic economy, among other destinations.<br/>Air travel demand is stuck at less than a third of the same levels a year ago and airlines are scrambling to come up with ways to encourage travelers to book. Executives have noted that travelers are waiting much longer to book than last year, a result of so much uncertainty surrounding the virus as well as work, school and child care.<br/>United's new booking tool, which uses Google's flight search engine, also allows travelers to browse flights without set dates.<br/>\"Where in the past, more people would look for flights to specific destinations on specific dates, we're seeing that today, travelers are often more open about the destinations that they would like to visit,\" United spokeswoman Christine Salamone said in an email. \"They know they'd like to get away, but they're not exactly sure where they want to go.\"<br/>United executives and those at other airlines have said they've seen relatively good demand for destinations that allow travelers to physically distance, such as those near national parks and others that offer outdoor activities.<br/>Earlier this month, United launched a map on its site that lists state travel restrictions and is considering to expanding that to international destinations, many of which remain off-limits to U.S.</p><p>September 23: Apple, Amazon and Google will emerge as winners from a major market shift, tech analyst Gene Munster predicts<br/>Long-time tech analyst Gene Munster believes big tech is on the cusp of a major shift: It's becoming a stock pickers' market.<br/>The Loup Ventures founder and managing partner expects FAANG stocks, otherwise known as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, will fail to collectively rally like they did during most of 2020&amp;#8242; s record run.<br/>\"There's going to be a fracturing of the performance within FAANG,\" Munster told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Tuesday. \"Think of that group of haves being Apple, Amazon and Google, and the have nots being Netflix and Facebook.\"<br/>Munster sees the split coming down to adapting to the coronavirus - as well as evolving and thriving in a post-pandemic world.<br/>\"The companies that are the haves are ultimately going to be involved in much bigger businesses,\" said Munster.<br/>He's most bullish on Apple's prospects, and highlights its innovation in the health and wellness space.<br/>\"It's very simple. Cash is king, and that will ultimately will be driven even higher with wearables,\" he said.<br/>Munster speculates newer Apple watches and AirPods will be designed to attract more health-conscious consumers. He also predicts the 5G upgrade cycle will boost the bottom line.<br/>\"This company should earn close to $6 [a share] in earnings in just a couple of years,\" he noted. \"Put a 35x multiple on that, and you have a $200 stock.\"<br/>According to Munster, it's a good time to consider buying shares. Apple shares, which had a 4-1 stock split on Aug. 31, have soared 52% so far this year. But they're off 19% from the all-time high.<br/>He sees Amazon reaping long-term benefits from its logistics investments during the pandemic rush to buy online. In Google's case, it's more of a innovative play independent of the virus.<br/>\"Think about what's going on with Verily around health and wellness - also what they're doing with Waymo around autonomous transportation,\" said Munster.</p><p>September 23: Google will try 'hybrid' work-from-home models, as most employees don't want to come in every day<br/>Google is rethinking its long-term work options for employees, as most of them say they don't want to come back to the office full-time.<br/>Sixty-two percent of Google employees want to return to their offices at some point, but not every day, according to a recent survey of employee office preferences the company released this week. So Google is working on \"hybrid\" models, including rearranging its offices and figuring out more long-term remote work options, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in an interview with Time magazine on Wednesday.<br/>\"I see the future as being more flexible,\" Pichai said in the interview. \"We firmly believe that in-person, being together, having a sense of community is super important when you have to solve hard problems and create something new so we don't see that changing. But we do think we need to create more flexibility and more hybrid models.\"<br/>The long-term planning comes as Google, which has been looked at as a model for Silicon Valley workplaces, slowly reveals more details of its plans to return its employees back to the office while also competing with other tech companies for top talent. Earlier in the summer, the company gave staffers the option to work from home through July 2021 amid the global pandemic. That came as Facebook announced a similar timeline, while other companies, such as Twitter, said employees can work remotely \"forever.\"<br/>Google began preparations early on in the pandemic and more recently made changes including to its internal communication forums, CNBC first reported.

In terms of the agreement, Loon will help Vodacom provide service to un-served and under-served parts of the country with a network of floating cell phone towers that operate 20 kilometres above Earth. <br/>Using the Loon solution, Vodacom will expand mobile network access to Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, two regions that have proven hard to cover in the past due to the vast and logistically challenging geographical areas, together with low population density. The Loon solution will provide a 4G service that supports Data, Voice, SMS and USSD, which will also enable mobile financial services. The service will be available to any Vodacom subscriber with a standard 4G-VoLTE enabled handset and SIM card. Users will not need to do anything special to connect to the service; they will connect just as they would to a normal cell tower. In fact, it's unlikely that a user will know that they are connected to the service provided by a high altitude balloon, except for the fact that they may have a signal in a location where it previously did not exist.<br/>Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub says \"Vodacom's partnership with Loon is a perfect example of how technological innovation can connect the most rural communities in Africa. We are pleased to be part of this initiative in Mozambique, which is helping to bridge the digital divide. This is even more pertinent in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more Mozambicans will now have access to healthcare information through our Loon partnership.</p><p>April 29: Alphabet Class A HAPS Alliance Members Outline Commercial Opportunity in Earth's Stratosphere<br/>Mountain View, CA, April 29, 2020 -- Loon LLC, Airbus Defence and Space, HAPSMobile Inc., Intelsat US LLC, and Nokia Corporation see a rare, untapped commercial opportunity in the skies above Earth's atmosphere. All members of the recently-formed HAPS Alliance, the companies outlined in a White Paper published today a multi-billion dollar market opportunity in Earth's stratosphere, spanning telecommunications, high-resolution earth observation, and weather prediction and modeling.<br/>Earth's stratosphere - which spans from just above the lower atmosphere to the edge of space - has long been deemed unsuitable for commercial operations because of its harsh conditions. However, advances in technology over the last decade have made operating in the stratosphere possible, making the region ripe for commercial activity going forward.<br/>The White Paper outlines significant opportunity in the telecommunications sector, with the ability of stratospheric technologies to drive significant growth in the $3.9 trillion mobile technologies and services business by bringing millions of people online, reconnecting people after disasters, building out the next generation of 5G networks, and connecting the future of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.<br/>Another area of commercial opportunity outlined in the White Paper is earth observation (EO) and weather prediction and modeling. The $3 billion satellite segment of the EO market is growing steadily, as is the $4.4 billion drone service market. As stratospheric technologies develop, they will tap into portions of both markets, while stimulating new market demand due to their unique capabilities. Potential use-cases include: collecting data around natural and man-made disasters to enable more effective responses to wildfires, oil spills, floods and more; tracking meteorology to improve weather forecasts; monitoring natural resources, agriculture and infrastructure; and tracking large stretches of oceans for illegal fishing, pollution, or piracy.</p><p>February 03: Alphabet Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Results<br/>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - February 3, 2020 - Alphabet Inc.

The tensions rattled throughout global markets on Monday, which sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower by 160 points or 0.6%. In addition, the Nasdaq Composite declined by 1.6% due to pressure on chipmakers and U.S. technology companies. Major tech giants cut off supply agreements, stirring fear in investors that the trade war tensions were elevating. For instance, Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cut off Huawei's access to a variety of Google services such as the Android system, Google Play store, and popular apps such as YouTube and Gmail. Google's response came shortly after the U.S. issued a trade blacklist, which banned American companies from selling to Huawei without a proper U.S. government license. However, despite the tensions surrounding Huawei, U.S. stocks began to recover on Tuesday after the U.S. government granted the Company a temporary reprieve on restrictions. Leading into Wednesday, markets pulled back once again after several weaker-than-expected corporate retail earnings and the Federal Reserve's minutes were released. The Fed's minutes highlighted that officials were comfortable with the central bank's accommodative policies, even though it was split on the outlook for interest rates. Markets continued to slip again leading into Thursday after the U.S.-China trade tensions arose once again. Beijing officials told the U.S. that it would need to correct its \"wrong actions\" in order for the two negotiate trade talks, especially after the U.S. blacklisted Huawei.

Specifically, investors weighed in on the technology companies which reported this week. The companies reported mixed results throughout the week, causing a shaky overall market. On Monday, markets edged higher throughout the day as investors focused in on Spotify's quarterly results. However, during Monday's extended trading hours, Alphabet's worse-than-expected revenue growth caused markets to pull back. Then on Tuesday, markets quickly retreated throughout the day, erasing the gains from Monday. Despite Alphabet's pullback, markets began to recover after the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 144 points or 0.5%. Investors focused their attention on Apple, as the Company reported its first-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday. Apple reported better-than-expected earnings, resulting in a strong opening on Wednesday, but the release of the ISM Manufacturing Index report for April caused markets to quickly nose dive.

Mozambique<br/>Loon and Vodacom partner to bring network access to previously uncovered populations via stratospheric internet balloons<br/>Mountain View, CA, May 13, 2020 -- Alphabet's Loon and Vodacom have signed a deal to use Loon's balloon-powered internet solution to expand the Vodacom network in Mozambique. In terms of the agreement, Loon will help Vodacom provide service to un-served and under-served parts of the country with a network of floating cell phone towers that operate 20 kilometres above Earth. <br/>Using the Loon solution, Vodacom will expand mobile network access to Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, two regions that have proven hard to cover in the past due to the vast and logistically challenging geographical areas, together with low population density. The Loon solution will provide a 4G service that supports Data, Voice, SMS and USSD, which will also enable mobile financial services. The service will be available to any Vodacom subscriber with a standard 4G-VoLTE enabled handset and SIM card. Users will not need to do anything special to connect to the service; they will connect just as they would to a normal cell tower. In fact, it's unlikely that a user will know that they are connected to the service provided by a high altitude balloon, except for the fact that they may have a signal in a location where it previously did not exist.<br/>Vodacom Group CEO Shameel Joosub says \"Vodacom's partnership with Loon is a perfect example of how technological innovation can connect the most rural communities in Africa. We are pleased to be part of this initiative in Mozambique, which is helping to bridge the digital divide. This is even more pertinent in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, where more Mozambicans will now have access to healthcare information through our Loon partnership.</p><p>1.4 People's News<br/>Thu Jul 30, 2020<br/>David C.

Ken Buck (R-Colo.) about it's 'monopolistic advantage during a hearing in front of the House antitrust subcommittee.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 29: Watch Google parent Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai's opening testimony to Congress<br/>The CEOs from four of the largest tech companies are testifying in front of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust Wednesday.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 28: Google CEO Sundar Pichai plans to tell Congress the company faces plenty of competition<br/>Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the company has offered a competitive platform that has lowered prices advertisers, giving consumers more choice, according to prepared remarks the executive made ahead of Wednesday's hearing before the House Antitrust Subcommittee.<br/>\"A competitive digital ad marketplace gives publishers and advertisers, and therefore consumers, an enormous amount of choice,\" Pichai stated. \"For example, competition in ads - from Twitter, Instagram, Comcast and others - has helped lower online advertising costs by 40% over the last 10 years, with these saving passed down to consumers through lower prices.\"<br/>Nonetheless, Google remains the largest digital ad platform by market share. Last year, Google held 31.6% of total digital advertising spending with Facebook and Amazon holding 22.7% and 7.8% respectively, according to eMarketer.<br/>The statement comes ahead of Pichai joining Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before the House Antitrust Subcommittee on Wednesday. The committee's probe is expected to result in a report and legislative proposals for how to address antitrust issues in the digital marketplace. Potential laws could inform how state regulators crack down on anti-competitive practices in the future.<br/>Google's most common critics ask questions about whether it favors its own products or suppresses competitors through its dominance in search and digital advertising. The company has already faced fines from the European Commission's competition authority over its shopping search tool and Android mobile operating system, which Pichai said in his prepared remarks was \"deliberately\" built to encourage competition.<br/>Pichai goes on to cite Amazon's Alexa, Twitter, Snapchat, and Facebook-owned WhatsApp as competitive platforms where people get information.<br/>\"In areas like travel and real estate, Google faces strong competition for search queries from many businesses that are experts in those areas,\" Pichai stated in the written remarks.</p><p>July 27: Google will keep employees home until July 2021<br/>CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" crew discuss Google's decision to have employees work from home until July 2021.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 24: Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google CEO congressional hearing officially delayed<br/>The highly anticipated antitrust hearing featuring CEOs from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google has officially been postponed by the House Judiciary Committee. A new date has not been announced.<br/>The hearing was initially set to take place on Monday, but is now delayed due to memorial services for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., which are scheduled to take place on the same day.<br/>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, were prepared to testify virtually on Monday before the House Antitrust Subcommittee. The hearing is meant to be a culmination of an investigation into the four tech giants that began in June 2019 to assess their competitive practices and the efficacy of antitrust laws for the new digital marketplace. Following the hearing, the subcommittee is expected to issue a report of its findings as well as legislative proposals aiming to update the antitrust laws.<br/>The probe had already been delayed by the pandemic, pushing back the timeline for issuing the report from early April to likely sometime in the Fall.<br/>While Congress' investigation won't directly result in any enforcement actions on the companies, probes by U.S. antitrust regulators, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, could. The DOJ is reportedly preparing a case against Google while the FTC continues to investigate Facebook and Amazon, according to reports. Regulators have also been asking questions about Apple, though formal scrutiny has so far only been announces in the abroad. The company is facing two antitrust investigations in the European Union.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 23: Microsoft's slowdown in search advertising could spell tough news ahead for Google<br/>Microsoft's advertising business struggled last quarter, as advertisers cut their budgets during the coronavirus pandemic and corresponding spike in U.S. unemployment.<br/>That outcome could spell bad news for search advertising rival Google, whose parent company Alphabet reports second quarter earnings next week.<br/>On Wednesday, Microsoft said that search revenue minus traffic acquisition costs fell 18% from the year-ago quarter as customers spent less on ads.<br/>One quarter ago, that part of Microsoft's business was up 1% year-over-year, while Google search ad revenue declined 9.4%. Google's search engine is more widely used than Microsoft's Bing; Google had about 84% market share in June, while Bing had 6%, according to NetMarketShare.<br/>Microsoft as a whole saw slower growth as the coronavirus affected many parts of its business last quarter, but portions of its business like gaming, cloud infrastructure and productivity software helped smooth out the results as people remained at home around the world to reduce spread of the coronavirus. Alphabet is less diversified than Microsoft, with 84% of its revenue coming from Google advertising in the first quarter.<br/>Analysts polled by Refinitiv currently expect $37.35 billion in second-quarter revenue from Alphabet, suggesting a 4% year-over-year decline. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<br/>Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said Wednesday that the company expects search revenue for the current quarter, excluding traffic acquisition costs, to be down \"in the low 20% range.\" (Microsoft's fiscal year ended June 30.)<br/>Amid a broad sell-off in tech stocks on Thursday, Alphabet Class A shares were down as much as 3.5% and Microsoft stock traded as much as 4.4% lower.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 22: Homebuyers can now turn to Google Search for detailed info about mortgages<br/>Google on Wednesday updated its search engine with new tools for people shopping for mortgages, including a calculator, recent average mortgage rates and key terms homebuyers may need to know during the mortgage shopping process.<br/>Google teamed up with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to launch the new tools because it found that a lot of people were asking questions like \"what is a mortgage?\" and \"what is APR?\" among others.<br/>The tools are available on phones when you search \"mortgage.\" Just scroll down past the ads and you'll see it.<br/>Here's the kind of information it provides.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 21: Apple, Google and Sony will be critical to MLB season shortened by coronavirus<br/>Major League Baseball will look to Big Tech companies like Apple and Google to help with its shortened season that is scheduled to begin Thursday.<br/>On Monday, MLB provided a preview of how games will look and sound during the pandemic, with features like artificial crowd noise and an upgraded replay system for fans watching from home.<br/>Two games are scheduled for opening night: The defending World Series champion Washington Nationals host the New York Yankees at 7 p.m. ET, followed by the Los Angeles Dodgers hosting the San Francisco Giants at 10 p.m. ET.<br/>As part of the league's Covid-19 health and safety protocols, MLB said it would ban traditional video stations shared throughout clubhouses. The league took advantage of its 2016 partnership with Apple to expand the dugout iPad program. It will now distribute 15 iPads to each team for players and staff to dissect performances and additional team content like scouting reports.<br/>Google will also play a part, with all 30 teams using Google Cloud to run MLB's stat-tracking system, Statcast, and provide digital infrastructure for everything from team websites to online ticket sales.<br/>MLB partnered with the Google in March to be the league's official cloud partner. Jason Gaedtke, MLB chief technology officer, said Monday that the league selected Google for the firm's \"strength in large scale data processing, analytics and specifically machine-learning.\"<br/>With its Statcast 3D platform powered by Google, MLB said broadcasts can re-create game footage in a variety of virtual perspectives. Concepts like displaying a player's home run trails, pitching angles from a catcher and umpire's perspective and how play is affected by weather conditions will now be available for national and regional broadcast partners.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 20: Alphabet Class A<br/>Credit Suisse hiked its price target on the Google parent to $1,850 per share from $1,600 per share. The new price target implies an upside of 22% from Friday's close of $1,516.85. The analyst cited: \"1) ongoing monetization improvements in Search advertising through product/AI driven updates, 2) greater-than expected revenue contribution from non-Search businesses (YouTube, Cloud, and Play), 3) optionality and shareholder value creation from new monetization initiatives such as Maps\" positive catalysts for the stock. Alphabet shares rose more than 2%.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 17: Google will ban ads from running on stories spreading debunked coronavirus conspiracy theories<br/>Google next month will ban publishers from using its ad platform to show advertisements next to content that promotes conspiracy theories about Covid-19. It will also ban ads that promote those theories. In cases where a particular site publishes a certain threshold of material that violates these policies, it will ban the entire site from using its ad platforms.<br/>Alphabet's Google already prohibits ads from running against content that makes harmful claims about disease prevention and unsubstantiated cures, including anti-vaccine promotions or content that encourages users to forgo treatment. The company is now taking it a step further and banning ads against content that make claims going against authoritative scientific consensus. Banned claims would include conspiracy theories like vaccines being attempts to genetically modify the population, that Bill Gates created Covid-19 or that the disease was a bioweapon made in a Chinese lab.<br/>Google received nearly $135 billion in advertising revenue in 2019, in part through programs like AdSense and Ad Manager, in which websites that are approved can run programmatic advertising on their sites and make money using Google. About 15% of Google's revenue in the first quarter came from \"Google Network Members' properties,\" which the company said in its annual report primarily comes from sites participating in AdMob, AdSense and Google Ad Manager programs.<br/>Google will begin enforcing the change on Aug. 18, and can remove ads from single articles or, in some cases, entire sites. When it comes to removing ads from an entire site, the company said for most of its policies it has a percentage threshold for policy violations before it will fully demonetize a website. (The violation of some policies, like one preventing child sex abuse material, is considered by the company to be so egregious that they result in immediate site-level action).<br/>The news comes the same week as CNBC first reported that Google had begun running ads again on financial market website Zero Hedge.</p><p>1.6 Stock Buzz</p><p>1.7 Analyst Recommendations: Past Month</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"160\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"264\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Brokerage</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Current Rating</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 27, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Buy</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 26, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Buy</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 25, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Buy</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 24, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Buy</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>SECTION 2 Corporate Profile and Independent Ratings<br/>2.1 Activities<br/>Alphabet Inc maintains an index of Websites and other online content, and makes this information freely available through its search engine to anyone with an Internet connection.

All members of the recently-formed HAPS Alliance, the companies outlined in a White Paper published today a multi-billion dollar market opportunity in Earth's stratosphere, spanning telecommunications, high-resolution earth observation, and weather prediction and modeling.<br/>Earth's stratosphere - which spans from just above the lower atmosphere to the edge of space - has long been deemed unsuitable for commercial operations because of its harsh conditions. However, advances in technology over the last decade have made operating in the stratosphere possible, making the region ripe for commercial activity going forward.<br/>The White Paper outlines significant opportunity in the telecommunications sector, with the ability of stratospheric technologies to drive significant growth in the $3.9 trillion mobile technologies and services business by bringing millions of people online, reconnecting people after disasters, building out the next generation of 5G networks, and connecting the future of Internet of Things (IoT) devices.<br/>Another area of commercial opportunity outlined in the White Paper is earth observation (EO) and weather prediction and modeling. The $3 billion satellite segment of the EO market is growing steadily, as is the $4.4 billion drone service market. As stratospheric technologies develop, they will tap into portions of both markets, while stimulating new market demand due to their unique capabilities. Potential use-cases include: collecting data around natural and man-made disasters to enable more effective responses to wildfires, oil spills, floods and more; tracking meteorology to improve weather forecasts; monitoring natural resources, agriculture and infrastructure; and tracking large stretches of oceans for illegal fishing, pollution, or piracy.</p><p>February 03: Alphabet Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Results<br/>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - February 3, 2020 - Alphabet Inc.

The tensions rattled throughout global markets on Monday, which sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower by 160 points or 0.6%. In addition, the Nasdaq Composite declined by 1.6% due to pressure on chipmakers and U.S. technology companies. Major tech giants cut off supply agreements, stirring fear in investors that the trade war tensions were elevating. For instance, Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cut off Huawei's access to a variety of Google services such as the Android system, Google Play store, and popular apps such as YouTube and Gmail. Google's response came shortly after the U.S. issued a trade blacklist, which banned American companies from selling to Huawei without a proper U.S. government license. However, despite the tensions surrounding Huawei, U.S. stocks began to recover on Tuesday after the U.S. government granted the Company a temporary reprieve on restrictions. Leading into Wednesday, markets pulled back once again after several weaker-than-expected corporate retail earnings and the Federal Reserve's minutes were released. The Fed's minutes highlighted that officials were comfortable with the central bank's accommodative policies, even though it was split on the outlook for interest rates. Markets continued to slip again leading into Thursday after the U.S.-China trade tensions arose once again. Beijing officials told the U.S. that it would need to correct its \"wrong actions\" in order for the two negotiate trade talks, especially after the U.S. blacklisted Huawei.

Specifically, investors weighed in on the technology companies which reported this week. The companies reported mixed results throughout the week, causing a shaky overall market. On Monday, markets edged higher throughout the day as investors focused in on Spotify's quarterly results. However, during Monday's extended trading hours, Alphabet's worse-than-expected revenue growth caused markets to pull back. Then on Tuesday, markets quickly retreated throughout the day, erasing the gains from Monday. Despite Alphabet's pullback, markets began to recover after the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 144 points or 0.5%. Investors focused their attention on Apple, as the Company reported its first-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday. Apple reported better-than-expected earnings, resulting in a strong opening on Wednesday, but the release of the ISM Manufacturing Index report for April caused markets to quickly nose dive. The report fell short of expectations which caused the Dow Jones Transportation Average to slip by 130 points or 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated by as much as 312 points or 1.17% throughout Wednesday. Wednesday's bearish close carried on into Thursday following the Federal Reserve's policy update. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ), Under Armour, Inc.

Here are some of the highlights.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 29: App Store competition will be in focus for Apple during Big Tech hearings<br/>CNBC's Josh Lipton takes a look at the scrutiny Apple will face during the Big Tech hearings on Capitol Hill.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 29: Apple tried to lure Amazon's video app by offering a lower 15% fee, email shows<br/>In the summer of 2017, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that Amazon's Prime Video service would be launching on the Apple TV set-top box, after a long and noticeable absence.<br/>An email released by the House Antitrust Subcommittee on Wednesday shed new light into the negotiations that led to that announcement. It shows an Apple exec offered Amazon a 15% fee on subscriptions that signed up through the app, which is lower than Apple's customary 30% fee for most in-app purchases.<br/>The email suggests that big players can negotiate for better business terms on Apple's App Store, contradicting Apple's public stance that all apps are treated the same on its platform. \"We apply the rules to all developers evenly,\" Cook testified on Wednesday.<br/>Software makers are required to use Apple's payment mechanism for any digital purchases inside an iPhone app. Apple typically takes 30% of the initial purchase price, including 30% from the first year of subscription services that customers buy through the app, then drops the fee to 15% in the second year of a subscription. The 30% fee is a core part of Spotify's antitrust complaint with EU regulators.<br/>In May 2016, Bezos told an interviewer that Amazon refused to sell devices like Apple TV or Google's Chromecast on Amazon.com because it was unable to agree on terms for placing Amazon Prime Video on those devices.<br/>\"When we sell those devices, we want our player - our Prime Video player - to be on the device, and we want it to be on the device with acceptable business terms,\" he said. \"You can always get the player on the device. The question is, can you get it on there with acceptable business terms?\"<br/>At some point later in the year, Bezos met with Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue and discussed business terms for this and other matters, according to the document released Wednesday.<br/>\"Jeff, I really enjoyed our time together,\" emailed Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in November 2016.<br/>\"Here are the details of what we discussed on Prime Video - Amazon Prime Video app in iOS and Apple TV - 15% rev share for customers that signup using the app (uses our payment); no rev share for customers that already subscribe.\"<br/>In addition, Cue said that if Amazon was able to sell services like Showtime in its app, that Apple would only take 15% if the customer originally signed up through Apple.<br/>It's not clear if the companies ended up agreeing to the terms in the email.</p><p>July 28: Tim Cook will testify that Apple is in fierce competition with Google and Huawei<br/>Apple CEO Tim Cook plans to tell the House Antitrust Subcommittee on Wednesday that the company is in fierce competition with rivals for the smartphone market.<br/>\"The smartphone market is fiercely competitive, and companies like Samsung, LG, Huawei, and Google have built very successful smartphone businesses offering different approaches,\" Cook said in prepared remarks released by the committee. \"Apple does not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business.\"<br/>Cook is one of four technology CEOs who will appear in Wednesday's hearing. He will be joined by Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. All four CEOs released prepared remarks on Tuesday night.<br/>Cook's prepared remarks suggest that the company will heavily employ a defense leaning on the fact that Apple does not have a majority of the smartphone market - only 46% of smartphones shipped in the U.S. in the first quarter were Apple's, according to Counterpoint Research.<br/>Apple is facing criticism over its App Store, which is the only way to install consumer software on an iPhone. Detractors say that the store has challenging and inconsistent rules, and that Apple's 30% take of digital transactions made through apps sold in the store is too high.<br/>Cook plans to discuss the origins of the store, which was created in 2008, and Apple's reasons why it maintains control over what stays on the App Store and what's not allowed. Detractors often say that Apple's approach to software distribution is like a walled garden, and Apple is the gatekeeper.<br/>\"Clearly, if Apple is a gatekeeper, what we have done is open the gate wider. We want to get every app we can on the store, not keep them off,\" Cook said in the remarks.<br/>Cook will also defend the company's 30% fee of digital transactions on the App Store.<br/>\"Apple's commissions are comparable or lower than commissions charged by the majority of our competitors.</p><p>July 27: Apple<br/>Apple rose more than 2% and was among the best-performing stocks despite a JPMorgan analyst saying the tech giant could lose steam after reporting earnings later this week. \"We believe investors looking for further upside have to focus on the longer-term earnings trajectory rather than expect near-term upside, as the likelihood of an earnings beat in F3Q (Jun) as well as strong early 5G cycle volumes (driving upside to calendar 2H20 estimates) appear to be priced in,\" the analyst said.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>July 25: Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google CEO hearing rescheduled to Wednesday<br/>The major Congressional hearing on competition in the U.S. tech sector has been delayed two days to Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee confirmed on Saturday.<br/>The antitrust hearing - set to feature Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai - was originally scheduled for Monday but was postponed due to it conflicting with the memorial service for the late Rep. John Lewis, as CNBC reported earlier. The House Judiciary Committee and the Antitrust Subcommittee confirmed the move in a postponement listed on the subcomittee's website.<br/>In essence, lawmakers intend the hearing to be the culmination of an extended investigation into the four technology giants.

A new date has not been announced.<br/>The hearing was initially set to take place on Monday, but is now delayed due to memorial services for the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., which are scheduled to take place on the same day.<br/>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, were prepared to testify virtually on Monday before the House Antitrust Subcommittee. The hearing is meant to be a culmination of an investigation into the four tech giants that began in June 2019 to assess their competitive practices and the efficacy of antitrust laws for the new digital marketplace. Following the hearing, the subcommittee is expected to issue a report of its findings as well as legislative proposals aiming to update the antitrust laws.<br/>The probe had already been delayed by the pandemic, pushing back the timeline for issuing the report from early April to likely sometime in the Fall.<br/>While Congress' investigation won't directly result in any enforcement actions on the companies, probes by U.S. antitrust regulators, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, could. The DOJ is reportedly preparing a case against Google while the FTC continues to investigate Facebook and Amazon, according to reports.

But because Fortnite's in-app purchases are digital goods like character outfits, both Apple and Google take a 30% cut of the game's revenue according to store policies.<br/>\"Apple has locked down and crippled the ecosystem by inventing an absolute monopoly on the distribution of software, on the monetization of software,\" Sweeney told CNBC's Julia Boorstin.<br/>In 2019, the company released the Epic Game Store, a platform for distributing software on Windows and Mac computers, in which the primary selling point to game makers is that it takes a lower 12% fee from sales.<br/>But the Epic Game Store has yet to launch on iPhones, because Apple has strict guidelines preventing competing software stores on the App Store.<br/>\"They are preventing an entire category of businesses and applications from being engulfed in their ecosystem by virtue of excluding competitors from each aspect of their business that they're protecting,\" Sweeney said.<br/>In addition to Fortnite, Epic makes the Unreal Engine, software that makes it much easier to make 3D-based video games.

The term premium between the yield of a 7-year Apple Inc. bond of 0.91% and the yield of a 1 year bond of 0.24% is 0.67%. Further, the yield curve is steepening from a term premium of 0.85% a month ago to a current level of 0.67%. This indicates investor expectations of falling inflation and/or decreasing demand for longer-term bonds. In comparison, the term premium of Treasury is 0.27%, down from 0.35% a month ago. </p><p>SECTION 9 Patents<br/>9.1 Number of Patents Issued to Apple by the US Patent Office and the European Patent Office (Past 12 Months)<br/>There were a total of 2,875 patents issued to Apple in the past 12 months.

On Monday, markets ended slightly lower mainly due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war and corporate quarterly financial results. U.S. President Donald Trump pressured China to reach an agreement as quickly as possible and threatened that if a deal isn't reached soon and if he is re-elected again, the terms of the agreement will be tougher. Despite Monday's slip, markets quickly recovered on Tuesday as investors honed in on the Fed's decisions. On Wednesday, markets got a boost early on from Apple's better-than-expected quarterly financial results. However, markets then began to retreat shortly after as the Fed was expected to deliver its announcement in the afternoon. U.S. markets spiraled downward after the Fed announced a rate cut, which many investors and analysts expected. However, the Fed hinted that it is in no rush to deliver further easing, according to MarketWatch. Many investors described Powell's decision as a \"hawkish cut,\" but Powell described the cut \"as a mid-cycle adjustment, and markets are worried that means there isn't much more easing coming,\" according to Kit Juckes, Global Head of FX Strategy at Societe Generale. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by as much as 500 points while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was delivering his announcement during a press conference. Despite the pullback on Wednesday, markets quickly recovered again on Thursday as the Dow Jones rose by as much as 300 points. However, the market quickly turned once again in the late afternoon after Trump announced he would impose an additional 10% tariff on USD 300 Billion worth of Chinese goods starting on September 1st.</p><p>July 31 2019: Apple Offers New Augmented Reality Art Sessions<br/>Apple(Registered) today opened registration for a series of new art-based Today at Apple(Registered) augmented reality (AR) experiences, called [AR]T, offered at Apple Stores around the world.

I am very proud of the resilience of all of our people across the globe, in particular about our ability to rapidly adopt the new ways of working and ensure the continuity of the work we perform for our clients during these still unprecedented times. The series of actions we implemented at the end of the first quarter to reduce our cost and preserve our cash, combined with additional measures taken this quarter, have paid off and has demonstrated our strong financial flexibility. I am therefore very pleased with the solid results and in particular with our strong free cash flow in this quarter.<br/>Update on COVID-19Although our backlog remains stable, we do see the impact of COVID-19 in some parts of the business, in particular in our work for private sector clients as well as in our architectural business where we have experienced a weaker demand. At the same time, we do see continued strong demand in the public sector in most of our regions for work in infrastructure and water resiliency.</p><p>May 06: Arcadis shareholders re-appoint Deanna Goodwin as Supervisory Board member<br/>Amsterdam, 6 May 2020 - Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD), the leading global Design &amp; Consultancy organization for natural and built assets, confirms that all resolutions that were brought up for vote were supported during its Annual General Meeting earlier today.<br/>Ms. Deanna Goodwin was re-appointed to the Supervisory Board of Arcadis for a period of four years.<br/>As a precautionary measure to protect its cash position in the current COVID-19 situation, the company had already withdrawn the dividend proposal from the agenda of the Annual General Meeting.

Meanwhile, those who care for our health and our safety deserve our unconditional support and respect.<br/>During the first quarter, we took immediate and significant action to protect the wellbeing of our people, clients and communities. In a very short time frame, we enabled 90% of our people to work from home, using digital collaboration platforms and cloud-based engineering applications. We are performing many projects which are vital for society, for example important infrastructure projects like the High Speed 2 railway in the UK, flood protection for water authorities in the Netherlands and the US and environmental remediation work for public and private clients in the US.

Following London, New York City, and Hong Kong, Geneva and San Francisco took the fourth and fifth spots, respectively, as the most expensive cities on the list. The ten least expensive cities are in Asia with the majority of those found in China.<br/>The 2020 Arcadis ICC Index covers 100 of the world's large cities across six continents. The cost comparison was developed covering twenty building functions, based on a survey of construction costs, review of market conditions and the professional judgement from its global team of experts. This year, coverage has been extended to cities in Eastern Europe including Poland, Serbia and Montenegro. The main change to the index is that the cost of construction in cities is now relative to Amsterdam, instead of London. This change has no direct effect on the relative ranking of cities.<br/>In addition to providing a comparative index of global construction costs, this report also focuses on emerging trends associated with climate change - highlighting Arcadis work being done in many markets to reduce the environmental impacts of construction. This year's report addresses two challenges: the unfolding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the unchanged need for the industry to focus on rethinking resilience amid climate change while plotting a course towards a carbon neutral future. Construction processes alone are responsible for nearly 12% of global, energy-related CO2 emissions and heating and cooling buildings is one of the biggest single causes of global warming.<br/>Source: West Corporation</p><p>March 26: Arcadis response to COVID-19<br/>Arcadis has taken measures to protect the health and safety of employees and their families, clients and society and to ensure business resiliency Arcadis stops the current share buy-back program and withdraws the proposal for dividend payment to enhance its cash position as a precautionary measure Arcadis closely monitors directions by the Dutch government regarding COVID-19 impacting the AGM Amsterdam, 26 March 2020 - Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD), the leading global Design &amp; Consultancy organization for natural and built assets is responding to the consequences of the global COVID-19 pandemic.<br/>First priority in dealing with the current COVID-19 outbreak is to protect the health &amp; safety of employees and their families, clients and society.

The re-assessment of the business case for the ALEN associate leads to a full provision of the exposure.

The divestment process initially provided clear indications of serious interest by third parties, however recent developments, including the unsatisfactory performance of the biggest asset, resulted in offers that led us to re-assess our exposure.<br/>We have therefore decided to intervene now, and to stop further investments in the ALEN associate. This is obviously very disappointing, but we are no longer willing to negatively impact our financial performance and to expose Arcadis' stakeholders to a situation with uncertain outcomes. Our local partners will continue with the operation and we will support them in their attempt to sell the assets in due course. Given the uncertainties, we do not expect the overall value to cover for the expected credit loss on guarantees.<br/>Notwithstanding this disappointment, we are pleased with the improved performance in our core business. We have a strong balance sheet and can manage the impact.

OPERATING EBITA INCREASED BY 17% TO EUR53 MILLION RESULTING IN A MARGIN IMPROVEMENT TO 8.3%, UP FROM 7.4% LAST YEAR. THE HIGHER RESULTS CAME FROM CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE IN NORTH AMERICA, THE NETHERLANDS AND AUSTRALIA AND FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA.<br/>Peter Oosterveer, CEO Arcadis, comments: \"I am pleased with the continued strong performance in North America, the Netherlands and Australia, and equally pleased with the further improvements resulting from the measures we took in Latin America and Asia. Our results in the UK are solid, but we see that the ongoing Brexit uncertainty impacts the timing of infrastructure and buildings projects. The implementation of the new Oracle Cloud solution in North America, which went live in late July, has created a delay in our cash generation of around EUR50 million, however the actions we have taken will allow us to remedy the situation in the fourth quarter.<br/>Good progress was made on our Innovation &amp; Growth agenda. Our efforts to accelerate the upscaling of digital solutions resulted in a significant contract win with Transport for London to digitally improve frequency and reliability of London Underground. We also see that the market for environmental consultancy services continues to grow. With the signed heads of agreement with Evocra, an Australian based water solutions company, we are further strengthening our global environmental expertise. By using their internationally patented processes we can offer additional solutions to remove PFAS from contaminated water, which complements our existing suite of PFAS solutions.</p><p>October 22 2019: Arcadis signs exclusive agreement with EVOCRA to gain global license for innovative PFAS treatment technology<br/>Amsterdam, 22 October, 2019 - Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD), the leading global Design &amp; Consultancy organization for natural and built assets, today announced it has signed a Heads of Agreement with EVOCRA, enabling an exclusive commercial negotiating period within which the parties will finalize a license agreement for sole rights to the EVOCRA technology for PFAS solutions. This technology, which has already been proven at commercial scale on two projects in Australia, will be a welcome addition to Arcadis' existing suite of PFAS solutions, allowing Arcadis to continue to offer a differentiated solution for clients globally.<br/>PFAS, or per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances, were incorporated in commercial, industrial and consumer products, including textile coatings, stain repellents, electronics and mist suppressants. PFAS were also components of firefighting foams known as Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF).<br/>In recent years, under increasing scientific and regulatory scrutiny and community awareness, more is being understood about PFAS toxicity, environmental persistence, aquifer mobility and the potential for this emerging contaminant to bioaccumulate in natural environments and enter the food chain.<br/>EVOCRA, an Australian-based water treatment company, have a patented technology that uses ozone fractionation to separate and concentrate PFAS from impacted media. Their process has been demonstrated at commercial scale as having the ability to remove PFAS and deliver an output that meets the most stringent discharge requirements set by regulators and other relevant authorities.<br/>Source: West Corporation</p><p>July 25 2019: Arcadis Reports Second Quarter and First Half Year Results 2019<br/>ARCADIS REPORTS SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST HALF YEAR RESULTS 2019<br/>Organic growth, continued solid results and sustained cash flow improvement <br/>Operational:<br/> First half year financials:<br/>Amsterdam, 25 July 2019 - Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD), the leading global Design &amp; Consultancy organization for natural and built assets, reports continued solid results and a sustained cash flow improvement for the first half year of 2019. Organic growth was 2% and operating EBITA margin improved to 7.6%, up from 7.2% last year. The results were led by a strong performance in North America. <br/>Peter Oosterveer, CEO Arcadis comments: \"Arcadis delivered another solid quarter leading to 2% organic growth and an operating margin of 7.6% for the first half year. The sustained cashflow improvement allowed us to further reduce our debt to a leverage ratio of 1.6, well within our 2020 strategic target range. I am particularly pleased with the continued strong revenue growth and margin improvement in the Americas, as well as the better results in Asia Pacific. In Europe &amp; the Middle East, we saw strong performance in the Netherlands, the impact of one less working day, and lower results in France. The actions identified in prior quarters for Asia, the Middle East and Latin America have resulted in improved results in all three regions.<br/>As part of our innovation and growth agenda we will continue to invest in our people and digital offerings. This to exploit our growth opportunities in sustainable cities and smart mobility, future proof industries, environmental consultancy, and water management. Following a successful demo day with Techstars, allowing 10 global startups to present their innovative solutions for the City of the Future, Arcadis will use the opportunity to continue our cooperation with these startups via pilot integration into Arcadis projects and potentially through additional equity investments.</p><p>June 26 2019: Arcadis Awarded Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest Design Services Contract<br/>Amsterdam, June 26, 2019 - Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD), the leading global Design &amp; Consultancy organization for natural and built assets, today announced that a A$26 million contract has been awarded to Metron T2M, a joint venture between Arcadis Australia Pacific Pty Ltd and Mott MacDonald Australia Pty Ltd, to help deliver the metro upgrade of the T3 Bankstown Line between Sydenham and Bankstown.<br/>Metron T2M will deliver design services for the stations and the railway corridor between Marrickville and Punchbowl.<br/>Sydney Metro is Australia's biggest public transport project, delivering 31 stations and 66 kilometers of new metro rail, revolutionizing travel in Australia's biggest city.<br/>Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest extends the metro rail 30 kilometers from the end of Sydney Metro Northwest at Chatswood under Sydney, through new Central Business District (CBD) stations and Southwest to Bankstown.<br/>Phil Kajewski, Managing Director TransportationAustralia Pacific, Arcadis stated: \"This is an incredibly important piece of the Sydney Metro project and we are very excited to help bring this to life. Being able to easily move around our cities is critical not only to the sustainable growth of our cities, but to the quality of life of our citizens.\"<br/>\"Our scope of work includes the upgrade of nine train stations along the Bankstown line to enable them to accommodate the new fleet of single deck, frequently stopping, driver-less trains. It also includes the upgrade of the rail systems along the 14 kilometer corridor between stations,\" said Kajewski.<br/>The T3 Bankstown Line creates a significant bottleneck for the existing rail network - it effectively slows down the network because of the way it merges with other railway lines close to the Sydney CBD. By moving Bankstown Line services to the new standalone metro system, the bottleneck will be removed, providing more reliable journeys for customers from all across Sydney.<br/>Community feedback helps shape Sydney MetroBankstown Line upgrade.</p><p>May 20 2019: Startups present innovative plans at first Arcadis City of 2030 Accelerator, Powered by Techstars Demo Day<br/>Amsterdam, 20 May, 2019 - Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD), the leading global Design &amp; Consultancy for natural and built assets, and Techstars, the worldwide network that helps entrepreneurs succeed, today announced that the demo day of the Arcadis City of 2030 Accelerator, Powered by Techstars will take place in Amsterdam on May 28.

I am very proud of the resilience of all of our people across the globe, in particular about our ability to rapidly adopt the new ways of working and ensure the continuity of the work we perform for our clients during these still unprecedented times. The series of actions we implemented at the end of the first quarter to reduce our cost and preserve our cash, combined with additional measures taken this quarter, have paid off and has demonstrated our strong financial flexibility. I am therefore very pleased with the solid results and in particular with our strong free cash flow in this quarter.<br/>Update on COVID-19Although our backlog remains stable, we do see the impact of COVID-19 in some parts of the business, in particular in our work for private sector clients as well as in our architectural business where we have experienced a weaker demand.

Also, a series of actions is implemented to ensure business resiliency.<br/>CEO STATEMENTPeter Oosterveer, CEO Arcadis comments: \"For all our people and clients, everyday life and work has been severely disrupted by the impact of COVID-19.

Meanwhile, those who care for our health and our safety deserve our unconditional support and respect.<br/>During the first quarter, we took immediate and significant action to protect the wellbeing of our people, clients and communities. In a very short time frame, we enabled 90% of our people to work from home, using digital collaboration platforms and cloud-based engineering applications. We are performing many projects which are vital for society, for example important infrastructure projects like the High Speed 2 railway in the UK, flood protection for water authorities in the Netherlands and the US and environmental remediation work for public and private clients in the US.

Following London, New York City, and Hong Kong, Geneva and San Francisco took the fourth and fifth spots, respectively, as the most expensive cities on the list. The ten least expensive cities are in Asia with the majority of those found in China.<br/>The 2020 Arcadis ICC Index covers 100 of the world's large cities across six continents. The cost comparison was developed covering twenty building functions, based on a survey of construction costs, review of market conditions and the professional judgement from its global team of experts. This year, coverage has been extended to cities in Eastern Europe including Poland, Serbia and Montenegro. The main change to the index is that the cost of construction in cities is now relative to Amsterdam, instead of London. This change has no direct effect on the relative ranking of cities.<br/>In addition to providing a comparative index of global construction costs, this report also focuses on emerging trends associated with climate change - highlighting Arcadis work being done in many markets to reduce the environmental impacts of construction. This year's report addresses two challenges: the unfolding effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the unchanged need for the industry to focus on rethinking resilience amid climate change while plotting a course towards a carbon neutral future. Construction processes alone are responsible for nearly 12% of global, energy-related CO2 emissions and heating and cooling buildings is one of the biggest single causes of global warming.<br/>Source: West Corporation</p><p>March 26: Arcadis response to COVID-19<br/>Arcadis has taken measures to protect the health and safety of employees and their families, clients and society and to ensure business resiliency Arcadis stops the current share buy-back program and withdraws the proposal for dividend payment to enhance its cash position as a precautionary measure Arcadis closely monitors directions by the Dutch government regarding COVID-19 impacting the AGM Amsterdam, 26 March 2020 - Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD), the leading global Design &amp; Consultancy organization for natural and built assets is responding to the consequences of the global COVID-19 pandemic.<br/>First priority in dealing with the current COVID-19 outbreak is to protect the health &amp; safety of employees and their families, clients and society.

The re-assessment of the business case for the ALEN associate leads to a full provision of the exposure.

The divestment process initially provided clear indications of serious interest by third parties, however recent developments, including the unsatisfactory performance of the biggest asset, resulted in offers that led us to re-assess our exposure.<br/>We have therefore decided to intervene now, and to stop further investments in the ALEN associate. This is obviously very disappointing, but we are no longer willing to negatively impact our financial performance and to expose Arcadis' stakeholders to a situation with uncertain outcomes. Our local partners will continue with the operation and we will support them in their attempt to sell the assets in due course. Given the uncertainties, we do not expect the overall value to cover for the expected credit loss on guarantees.<br/>Notwithstanding this disappointment, we are pleased with the improved performance in our core business. We have a strong balance sheet and can manage the impact.

THE HIGHER RESULTS CAME FROM CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE IN NORTH AMERICA, THE NETHERLANDS AND AUSTRALIA AND FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA.<br/>Peter Oosterveer, CEO Arcadis, comments: \"I am pleased with the continued strong performance in North America, the Netherlands and Australia, and equally pleased with the further improvements resulting from the measures we took in Latin America and Asia. Our results in the UK are solid, but we see that the ongoing Brexit uncertainty impacts the timing of infrastructure and buildings projects. The implementation of the new Oracle Cloud solution in North America, which went live in late July, has created a delay in our cash generation of around EUR50 million, however the actions we have taken will allow us to remedy the situation in the fourth quarter.<br/>Good progress was made on our Innovation &amp; Growth agenda. Our efforts to accelerate the upscaling of digital solutions resulted in a significant contract win with Transport for London to digitally improve frequency and reliability of London Underground. We also see that the market for environmental consultancy services continues to grow. With the signed heads of agreement with Evocra, an Australian based water solutions company, we are further strengthening our global environmental expertise. By using their internationally patented processes we can offer additional solutions to remove PFAS from contaminated water, which complements our existing suite of PFAS solutions.</p><p>October 22 2019: Arcadis signs exclusive agreement with EVOCRA to gain global license for innovative PFAS treatment technology<br/>Amsterdam, 22 October, 2019 - Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD), the leading global Design &amp; Consultancy organization for natural and built assets, today announced it has signed a Heads of Agreement with EVOCRA, enabling an exclusive commercial negotiating period within which the parties will finalize a license agreement for sole rights to the EVOCRA technology for PFAS solutions. This technology, which has already been proven at commercial scale on two projects in Australia, will be a welcome addition to Arcadis' existing suite of PFAS solutions, allowing Arcadis to continue to offer a differentiated solution for clients globally.<br/>PFAS, or per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances, were incorporated in commercial, industrial and consumer products, including textile coatings, stain repellents, electronics and mist suppressants. PFAS were also components of firefighting foams known as Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF).<br/>In recent years, under increasing scientific and regulatory scrutiny and community awareness, more is being understood about PFAS toxicity, environmental persistence, aquifer mobility and the potential for this emerging contaminant to bioaccumulate in natural environments and enter the food chain.<br/>EVOCRA, an Australian-based water treatment company, have a patented technology that uses ozone fractionation to separate and concentrate PFAS from impacted media. Their process has been demonstrated at commercial scale as having the ability to remove PFAS and deliver an output that meets the most stringent discharge requirements set by regulators and other relevant authorities.<br/>Source: West Corporation</p><p>August 01 2019: Arcadis launches second year of startup accelerator program to shape future cities<br/>Start-ups invited to participate in Arcadis City of 2030 Accelerator, Powered by Techstars<br/>Amsterdam, August 1, 2019 - Arcadis, the leading global Design and Consultancy organization for natural and built assets, and Techstars, the worldwide network that helps entrepreneurs succeed, today launched the second year of the Arcadis City of 2030 Accelerator, Powered by Techstars, a global program aimed at identifying and developing innovative start-ups to transform the natural and built environment.

Organic growth was 2% and operating EBITA margin improved to 7.6%, up from 7.2% last year. The results were led by a strong performance in North America. <br/>Peter Oosterveer, CEO Arcadis comments: \"Arcadis delivered another solid quarter leading to 2% organic growth and an operating margin of 7.6% for the first half year. The sustained cashflow improvement allowed us to further reduce our debt to a leverage ratio of 1.6, well within our 2020 strategic target range. I am particularly pleased with the continued strong revenue growth and margin improvement in the Americas, as well as the better results in Asia Pacific. In Europe &amp; the Middle East, we saw strong performance in the Netherlands, the impact of one less working day, and lower results in France. The actions identified in prior quarters for Asia, the Middle East and Latin America have resulted in improved results in all three regions.<br/>As part of our innovation and growth agenda we will continue to invest in our people and digital offerings. This to exploit our growth opportunities in sustainable cities and smart mobility, future proof industries, environmental consultancy, and water management. Following a successful demo day with Techstars, allowing 10 global startups to present their innovative solutions for the City of the Future, Arcadis will use the opportunity to continue our cooperation with these startups via pilot integration into Arcadis projects and potentially through additional equity investments.</p><p>June 26 2019: Arcadis Awarded Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest Design Services Contract<br/>Amsterdam, June 26, 2019 - Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD), the leading global Design &amp; Consultancy organization for natural and built assets, today announced that a A$26 million contract has been awarded to Metron T2M, a joint venture between Arcadis Australia Pacific Pty Ltd and Mott MacDonald Australia Pty Ltd, to help deliver the metro upgrade of the T3 Bankstown Line between Sydenham and Bankstown.<br/>Metron T2M will deliver design services for the stations and the railway corridor between Marrickville and Punchbowl.<br/>Sydney Metro is Australia's biggest public transport project, delivering 31 stations and 66 kilometers of new metro rail, revolutionizing travel in Australia's biggest city.<br/>Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest extends the metro rail 30 kilometers from the end of Sydney Metro Northwest at Chatswood under Sydney, through new Central Business District (CBD) stations and Southwest to Bankstown.<br/>Phil Kajewski, Managing Director TransportationAustralia Pacific, Arcadis stated: \"This is an incredibly important piece of the Sydney Metro project and we are very excited to help bring this to life. Being able to easily move around our cities is critical not only to the sustainable growth of our cities, but to the quality of life of our citizens.\"<br/>\"Our scope of work includes the upgrade of nine train stations along the Bankstown line to enable them to accommodate the new fleet of single deck, frequently stopping, driver-less trains. It also includes the upgrade of the rail systems along the 14 kilometer corridor between stations,\" said Kajewski.<br/>The T3 Bankstown Line creates a significant bottleneck for the existing rail network - it effectively slows down the network because of the way it merges with other railway lines close to the Sydney CBD. By moving Bankstown Line services to the new standalone metro system, the bottleneck will be removed, providing more reliable journeys for customers from all across Sydney.<br/>Community feedback helps shape Sydney MetroBankstown Line upgrade.</p><p>May 20 2019: Startups present innovative plans at first Arcadis City of 2030 Accelerator, Powered by Techstars Demo Day<br/>Amsterdam, 20 May, 2019 - Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD), the leading global Design &amp; Consultancy for natural and built assets, and Techstars, the worldwide network that helps entrepreneurs succeed, today announced that the demo day of the Arcadis City of 2030 Accelerator, Powered by Techstars will take place in Amsterdam on May 28.

The subject transactions with private entities associated with its Chief Executive Officer (\"CDS\") result in the complete divestment of all liabilities associated with its legacy homebuilding operations, the retention by CHCI of approximately $18,500,000 of prior capital investments by CDS in the homebuilding assets, and the entry into a new asset management agreement (the \"2019 AMA\") that increases CHCI's revenue opportunities associated with the assets owned by CDS that anchor the transformation of CHCI's operating platform (collectively the \"Platform Transition Transaction\"). The 2019 AMA replaces the original asset management agreement, that was effective January 1, 2018 (the \"2018 AMA\") and its cost-plus revenue feature with a modified market rate fee structure that preserves the stability of the cost-plus feature but removes the revenue cap element of the 2018 AMA. The 2019 AMA positions CHCI as developer and asset manager of a portfolio of CDS assets in Northern Virginia that includes stabilized buildings and development assets that, at full build out, will include nearly 7 million square feet of investment-grade, transit-oriented and mixed-use assets encompassing more than 2,500 multi-family rental units, Class A and Trophy office, retail, hotels, and commercial parking garages located adjacent to two Metro stations on Washington DC Metro's Silver Line in the Dulles Corridor; representing an estimated assets under management (\"AUM\") value of $2.5 to $3.0 Billion at completion (the \"CRE Portfolio\").<br/>\"This transformative transaction completes our exit from homebuilding, provides growth capital to the Company and creates a simplified, clean and investable balance sheet,\" said Christopher Clemente, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CHCI.</p><p>April 30 2019: Comstock Holding CompaniesComstock Holding Announces Balance Sheet Recapitalization and Completion of Platform Transition<br/>Divestment of Residual Homebuilding Assets and Entry into Amended and Restated Asset Management Agreement Positions Comstock for Future<br/>RESTON, Va., April 30, 2019 -- Comstock Holding Companies, Inc., (NASDAQ: CHCI) (\"CHCI\" or the \"Company\"), today announced it has completed a series of transactions that accomplish its previously announced plan to wind-down its for-sale homebuilding activities and transition its operating platform to commercial development and asset management.

The 2019 AMA replaces the original asset management agreement, that was effective January 1, 2018 (the \"2018 AMA\") and its cost-plus revenue feature with a modified market rate fee structure that preserves the stability of the cost-plus feature but removes the revenue cap element of the 2018 AMA. The 2019 AMA positions CHCI as developer and asset manager of a portfolio of CDS assets in Northern Virginia that includes stabilized buildings and development assets that, at full build out, will include nearly 7 million square feet of investment-grade, transit-oriented and mixed-use assets encompassing more than 2,500 multi-family rental units, Class A and Trophy office, retail, hotels, and commercial parking garages located adjacent to two Metro stations on Washington DC Metro's Silver Line in the Dulles Corridor; representing an estimated assets under management (\"AUM\") value of $2.5 to $3.0 Billion at completion (the \"CRE Portfolio\").<br/>\"This transformative transaction completes our exit from homebuilding, provides growth capital to the Company and creates a simplified, clean and investable balance sheet,\" said Christopher Clemente, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CHCI.</p><p>April 30 2019: Comstock Holding CompaniesComstock Holding Announces Balance Sheet Recapitalization and Completion of Platform Transition<br/>Divestment of Residual Homebuilding Assets and Entry into Amended and Restated Asset Management Agreement Positions Comstock for Future<br/>RESTON, Va., April 30, 2019 -- Comstock Holding Companies, Inc., (NASDAQ: CHCI) (\"CHCI\" or the \"Company\"), today announced it has completed a series of transactions that accomplish its previously announced plan to wind-down its for-sale homebuilding activities and transition its operating platform to commercial development and asset management.
