Welcome to \"News Stream.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> President Trump calls off the historic U.S.-North Korean summit but  Pyongyang says it is still willing to meet. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Iran nuclear deal in focus as E.U., Russian, Chinese, and Iranian officials  discuss ways to keep the deal alive. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Plus, disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein turns himself in to police in  New York. Sources say he has been arrested on rape charges.</p><p> Welcome to the program. We begin with the situation on the Korean  Peninsula. China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience  after landmark talks on North Korea's nuclear program were abruptly called  off. Donald Trump had agreed to meet Kim Jong-un in Singapore next month,  but the U.S. president cancelled. </p><p> In a letter, he cited recent hostile comments from the North Korean regime  as a reason for pulling out.  Officials in Pyongyang say Kim Jong-un is  ready to meet Mr. Trump at any time. The president says a meeting wouldn't  be appropriate right now, but he left the door open to future talks.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I hope that Kim Jong-un will  ultimately do what is right not only for himself but perhaps most  importantly what's right for his people who are suffering greatly and  needlessly. All of the Korean people, North and South, deserve to be able  to live together in harmony, prosperity, and peace. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JONES:  Well the latest from both sides of this debate now, Joe Johns is in  Washington for us. Matt Rivers is in Seoul, South Korea. Joe to you first,  is the White House still hopeful, expecting a meeting at all or just  washing its hands of Kim for the foreseeable? </p><p> JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hannah, it's pretty clear  that the White House here has left the door open I think that you said at  the very beginning. At the same time, they're being realistic about this  and there is some sentiment that a return to maximum sanctions might be in  order. </p><p> The problem with that of course is getting the international community to  go along particularly some of the countries in the region such as China as  well as South Korea. Those two countries, at least have been subject to  entreaties, if you will, from North Korea during this period, which creates  a question at least for some of the international partners about which of  the two parties that were involved in this summit that went down were in  fact holding the moral high ground, if you will. </p><p> In fact it was the President of the United States, it was the White House,  the administration that pulled out of this very important summit and not  North Korea so, a lot of thought going into this. The big question, of  course, can they return to maximum sanctions? It can be difficult, simply  because some of the countries that would have to go along might not. </p><p> JONES:  Let's bring in Matt Rivers. Matt is standing by for us in Seoul,  South Korea at the moment. Matt, I'm wondering if the North Koreans have  responded yet to this letter, responded formally at least. I mean, we  understand that they say they're still up for a summit at some point, but  is there any sign of any regret perhaps for some of the rhetoric, the  aggressive rhetoric news in recent days? </p><p> [08:05:01] MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Publicly, no. No  signs of regret at least at this point, Hannah. What we did get was a  statement from a high ranking official within North Korea's foreign  ministry. And in that statement, it said in part, we reiterate to the U.S.  that we are willing to sit face-to-face at any time and in any way. </p><p> And that is the only silver lining that many people here in South Korea are  looking at here. That and also the willingness of the president of the  United States to leave the door open for a future summit as well. Both  sides, the U.S. and North Korea seemingly willing to leave the door open  for a summit down the road. </p><p> And that's kind of been the only point of hope here in South Korea because  today, frankly, has been a day disappointment here especially for South  Korea's government, for President Moon Jae-in who put so much stock in this  summit, served as a middle man between North Korea and the United States. </p><p> There is deep disappointment that this summit did not happen and so the  only thing left at this point would be to hope that there is, well, that  they can put a lot of stock in the relatively measured statements that we  got both from the president of the U.S. as well as that statement from the  North Korean foreign ministry. </p><p> JONES:  Let's bring in Joe Johns again. Joe is still standing by for us in  Washington. Joe, you were talking at the end of your last answer there  about maximum pressure. What exactly does maximum pressure mean if that is  going to be the policy that the U.S. adopts now as far as Pyongyang is  concerned? </p><p> JOHNS:  Well, it certainly were means among other things, more economic  pressure on a country that has already worked its way through quite a bit  of economic pressure. It also means attempting to get China back on board.  Of course, as you know, China accounts for so much of North Korea's  economy, if you will. The administration has also talked, obviously, as we  heard, about keeping the military on high alert for anything that would  suggest hostility. </p><p> This, of course, can be perceived in that region as a threat from Donald  Trump and return, if you will, to some of the rhetoric that we heard  earlier in the Trump administration, very strident rhetoric which was seen,  I, think, around the world in many quarters as an escalation and bringing  the world one step closer to some very risky business, if you will, Hannah. </p><p> JONES:  All right, Joe, live for us in Washington. Matt also standing by in  Seoul. My thanks to you both. </p><p> Well, just hours before Donald Trump's announcement on that summit, North  Korea appeared to destroy tunnels and observation buildings at its nuclear  test site and in fact, our Will Ripley was there and broke the news then to  the North Koreans of President Trump's announcement. Will describes now the  long ride that he took to get there and that awkward moment. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We were on the way back from  the nuclear test site at Punggye-ri here to Wonsan when the news broke  overnight that President Trump has cancelled the upcoming summit in  Singapore. </p><p> It was incredibly awkward and uncomfortable to be on the train with North  Koreans after just witnessing the destruction of their nuclear test site at  Punggye-ri, something they had hoped would lead to substantial progress in  relations between the U.S. and North Korea. And instead the situation went  downhill.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two, one.</p><p> (EXPLOSION)</p><p> RIPLEY:  I'm here at North Korea's nuclear test site at Punggye-ri, a place  that foreign journalists have never been allowed before and we are here,  the North Korean government says, to witness the destruction of this site.  They say it will never be able to be used again. </p><p> (EXPLOSION)</p><p> RIPLEY (voice-over):  With each powerful explosion, the earth shakes. We  travel around 15 hours to get here. First by bus through the coastal city  of Wonsan. </p><p> Compartment seven, here we are. </p><p> Then, some 12 hours by train.</p><p> This is one of those moments where you blink and realize I'm having dinner  on a train going through North Korea. </p><p> A luxury ride by North Korean standards. </p><p> They just came through and they closed all the blinds and told us that for  the entire train ride, we can't film anything out the windows. We pull into  Punggye-ri station, then begin the nearly two-hour drive to the test site.  Once again, no filming along the way. </p><p> We passed through a number of what look like small farming villages. There  was no sign of life, completely empty except for the handful of soldiers at  the guard posts along the way. </p><p> We get a briefing from the deputy director of North Korea's Nuclear Weapons  Institute. </p><p> [08:10:02] He won't tell us his name. Then, we're allowed to inspect the  tunnels. North Korea says they could have easily conducted more nuclear  tests here. They say two tunnels have never been used. </p><p> So they by rigging it with explosives and blowing it up that's a meaningful  step towards denuclearization. No nuclear weapons experts at our small  group, only journalists. </p><p> It's actually quite beautiful here, the North Koreans say that the  ecosystem hasn't been damaged by all of these nuclear test for more than a  decade. They say no radiation has seeped out. Journalists aren't allowed to  carry radiation detectors ourselves. They were taken away at the airport  so, we have to take their word for it. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation):  The dismantling of the nuclear  test grounds conducted with high level of transparency has clearly attested  once again to the proactive and peace-loving efforts of the government of  the DPRK. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RIPLEY:  You really do get the sense that you're witnessing history here,  which is why we're documenting every single building on this site because  by the end o the day it will all be gone. </p><p> We hike to an observation post built just for us and watch Punggye-ri go up  in smoke.</p><p> (EXPLOSION)</p><p> RIPLEY:  The official statement from North Korea's ministry of foreign  affairs indicates that Pyongyang is still interested in a dialogue with  Washington. They say they are ready to talk with President Trump at  anytime. They say dialogue between the two countries is crucial to improve  the situation on the Peninsula. </p><p> And they say that the nuclear test site destruction was, in their words, a  meaningful transparent step towards denuclearization. A sign of goodwill  ahead of any potential talks with the United States. Will Ripley, CNN,  Wonsan, North Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JONES:  Will, thanks very much. Let's bring in Barbara Demick (inaudible)  for us. Barbara is the former Beijing and Seoul bureau chief for the \"L.A.  Times\" and she has written a book called North Korea titled, \"Nothing to  Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea.\" She joins us from New York via Skype.  Barbara, great to have you on. </p><p> And with no summit in sight at the moment then, it seems that the U.S.  policy is going to be applying maximum pressure on North Korea, the impact  of which presumably trickle straight down and hurts the ordinary people in  North Korea that you've written about. </p><p> BARBARA DEMICK, FORMER BEIJING AND SEOUL BUREAU CHIEF, L.A. TIMES:  That's  exactly right. And these -- we've had this discussion before, but sanctions  tend to hurt the ordinary North Koreans who over the years have been very  dependent on international food aid, medical aid, and you know, I've heard  from a lot o4 people in the NGO community that they can't get in x-ray  machines for TB patients, very difficult to get in medicines. </p><p> It really is unfortunate I would guess, had I been, you know, talking to  people in North Korea that they were really hopeful there would have been a  breakthrough and I think they're the ones who are most directly affected. </p><p> JONES:  Yes, well, I mean the main players though in all of this of course,  they force their geopolitical format. There's been a lot of talk about  China in all of this. Let's ask you about that given your experience in the  region. Some people said that China sidelined by not being involved in this  summit were its go ahead not being at the table as well. Donald Trump seems  to be almost blaming China as well for the fact that the summit hasn't  happened. What are your thoughts on that? </p><p> DEMICK:  I think China is in a very complicated role, you know, publicly  they've cheered on the summit saying they're here to facilitate, but I  think they were very fearful of being sidelined  by the North Koreans and  the U.S. I mean, there's a very delicate balance here and I think Beijing  is fearful of a situation like you have in Vietnam where a communist  country draws closer to the U.S. rather than to China.</p><p> And although it's rarely spoken by the main players in public, you know,  the North Koreans are also fearful of China. You know, one of the reasons  they've been developing this nuclear program is so that they don't need to  rely on China for their security and you know, strangely enough, you know,  I think the North Koreans when they said there is a deal that U.S. troops  can stay on the peninsula, what they were saying, although they were never  articulated, is that, you know, we're afraid of China too.</p><p> JONES:  Right.</p><p> DEMICK:  I don't think China wants, you know, a nuclear arms North Korea.  They don't want to dangerous neighbor, but I don't think they really want a  peace treat with the U.S. that doesn't involve them. </p><p> JONES:  It does seem that both sides though are still leaving the  possibility of some talks on the table at the moment. Can you foresee a  situation when potentially we would have not just Donald Trump and Kim  Jong-un, but also have Moon Jae-in and also Xi Jinping as well so we have  four-party talks instead of just the two? </p><p> [08:15:02] DEMICK:  Well, you remember we've had, for many years six-party  talks that's included Japan and Russia. I think we could return to a multi- party situation, but I know -- I think that, you know, there were so much  momentum and energy going into this summit and everybody was so excited,  and I think, you know, that the wind has been taken out of those sails and  I'm not really hopeful over that big breakthrough. I think many of us are  kind of disappointed.</p><p> JONES:  While we wait to see. Barbara Demick, we appreciate your analysis.  Thank you.</p><p> DEMICK:  Thank you.</p><p> JONES:  Now, the U.S. film producer, Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on  sexual assault charges by police in New York. That is according to a CNN  source. He did turn himself in to a police station a short time ago and  will face court itself for the next few hours. The source has told CNN that  Weinstein will be charged with raping one woman and forcing another to  perform oral sex on him.</p><p> There has been a flood, of course, of accusations against the producer and  they were the trigger for women around the world to come forward with  accounts of sexual harassments and abuse at the hands of powerful men.  Those pictures from not too long ago of Harvey Weinstein. Let's get the  very latest then from New York. CNN's Brynn Gingras is there for us righ  now. This remind us, Brynn, of the background to this case and of course  the fact that Harvey Weinstein (inaudible) himself, while he has turned  himself in, as far as I understand, denies all the accusations against him? </p><p> BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, he still is. And we're expecting  to hear from his attorney likely after court proceedings later this  morning, but yes, of course we know about how big, how global this case has  gone. When that \"New Yorker\" article revealed some names of people who made  strong accusations against Harvey Weinstein, I can tell you from a source  that the NYPD began investigating immediately. </p><p> So this is a very dear investigation to the NYPD as they have been working  on it for months, and today finally, the first criminal charges are going  to be filed in the case. But I can tell you here it's a busy (inaudible)  here in Tribeca in Manhattan. We have tons of media out here because inside  that precinct house behind me is Harvey Weinstein. He is officially under  arrest. </p><p> That means that he has taken a booking photo. That means he's been  fingerprinted and soon he's going to head back out those doors and head  right to court. And that's where he's going to face charges of a criminal  sex act as well as rape and we're expecting his bond, Hannah, to be set at  $2 million, Hannah.</p><p> JONES:  And when we look ahead to any kind of future trial as well, this  would obviously have a huge amount of attention from around the world,  given the fact that he is so prominent in Hollywood as well. What kind of  time frame are we looking at for a trial? </p><p> GINGRAS:  You know, that's always up in the air, right? But here's the  thing. Like I said, this is the first criminal charges to be file. We are  expecting more to come. This was just the first. We know that there are  investigations still happening in Los Angeles. We know investigations in  London, and we also know that there's a federal probe here in New York City  that's happening as well as a current grand jury has been convened and  continues to listen to testimonies from at least four women in this case.  So, we do expect more charges to be filed to both of these cases. So, it's  a long way, but this is just the beginning it seems for Harvey Weinstein. </p><p> JONES:  Brynn, thanks so much indeed. Brynn's live there for us in New  York. </p><p> Now, Europe's new data privacy law is just a few hours old and Facebook and  Google are already in trouble for allegedly trying to skirt the rules. More  on that coming up.</p><p> [08:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> JONES:  Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" Europe's sweeping data protection  regulation goes into effect this Friday. CNN has learned separate lawsuits  have already been filed against Facebook, Google, WhatsApp and Instagram,  alleging that the companies are failing to comply. </p><p> Testifying in front of E.U. leaders on Tuesday, Facebook CEO Mark  Zuckerberg insisted his company would follow the new rules. But out Samuel  Burke now reports legal experts believe Facebook is already violating the  new law. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer,  Max Schrems has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for  nearly a decade. And today he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook  for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law called GDPR the  day it came into force.</p><p> MAX SCHREMS, LAWYER:  We were looking for big companies that really  willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and trying to get  away with it.</p><p> BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulation says he's taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p> SCHREMS:  (Inaudible) this idea if we don't want this, we think it's stupid  so we don't want to comply with it. And there are no obvious business  interests. There are certain things you simply can do with data anymore  that give a profit. </p><p> BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent. According to legal  experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MICHAEL VEALE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY EXPERT, UNIVESITY OF LONDON:  On your  Facebook profile, you can pretend things like sexuality, religion or  political beliefs, and if you put that on, you don't have any choice but  for Facebook to use it to personalize content to every advertising and so  on.</p><p> BURKE:  There's only an \"I accept\" button. </p><p> VEALE:  Exactly. </p><p> BURKE:  There's not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p> VEALE:  Exactly, you got to --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your  profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites too. </p><p> VEALE:  Facebook can infer from the great amount of data it has about you  across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send  data to Facebook.</p><p> BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making  these inferences that they make about us?</p><p> VEALE:  Yes. That law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without  explicit consent.</p><p> BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook.  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to four percent of its  global annual revenue. Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could  face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p> In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer said that company  has, quote, introduced better tools for people to access, download and  delete their information. The company also says it's building a new tool  that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them,  it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURKE:  Lawyer Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent  the kind of data scrapping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have  engaged in. </p><p> SCHREMS:  If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in  this digitalized age. In the end, you as a customer have the possibility to  use let's say Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data. </p><p> BURKE:  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already re-drawing the line between profit and privacies.  Samuel Burke, CNN, London. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JONES:  The new rules have very strict wording but what happens if there  really are violations. Our Kristie Lu Stout asked Vera Jourova, the  European justice (inaudible) if the E.U. is ready to enforce these new  rules.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [08:25:00] VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN JUSTICE COMMISSIONER:  Of course, we made  it very serious that we will enforce the GDPR rules because they bring the  necessary better protection for the citizens to have their privacy better  protected. And that's why we count with the enforcement of the rules. We  have a network of data protection authorities in all the member state and  they will pay due attention to all possible breaches. </p><p> KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM HOST:  A question about Facebook because  we know that Mark Zuckerberg was just in Brussel earlier this week. Did the  European Union get the sense that Facebook is not only willing to comply  with GDPR, but willing to self-regulate so that the E.U. won't find itself  in a position to pass more laws to protect data privacy?</p><p> JOUROVA:  Well, we heard the replies of Mr. Zuckerberg. He said that he can  guarantee that Facebook will be fully compliant with the strict European  rules. I have no reason not to believe him at this stage, but of course it  will be under a very strict control, as I said, from (inaudible) to  protection authorities and Facebook will belong to the companies where we  will pay full attention to because the volume of data they are harvesting  in the E.U., the data from Europeans is extremely big and that's why the  risk is also rather big.</p><p> LU STOUT:  OK, so far we've talked about GDPR and what it means for  companies. Let's talk about consumers and a possible consumer backlash  because the number of consumers out there who like data mining, who say  that it allows them to have a very comfortable online experience, a  seamless experience that is tailored just for them. How do you appeal to  those digital users to embrace GDPR and what it represents?</p><p> JOUROVA:  Well, that's a crucial thing that the people, as you say, the  consumers understand that they have the rights fully in place. They have  fully under their control with what's happening to their private data and  that they should be more aware of the possibilities which GDPR gives them.  </p><p> For instance, to give well informed consent to using of the private data  but also to say no, we do not want to be in the system and for instance in  Facebook. We do not want to discourage the people from using online route  and social media. We just want them to be safer.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JONES:  The E.U. justice commissioner there with our Kristie Lu Stout.</p><p> Now, a military drill that was slammed by Pyongyang. We have exclusive  footage from Max Thunder, the joint exercise between the U.S. and South  Korea.</p><p> [08:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> JONES:  Welcome back. I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones in London. You are watching  \"News Stream\" and these are your world headlines.</p><p> China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience after Donald  Trump after Donald Trump pulled out to a planned meeting with his North  Korean counterpart.</p><p> Meanwhile, just moments ago, Donald Trump tweeted the following: Very good  news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will  soon see where it will leads. Hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and  peace. Only time and talent will tell. Trump reacting there to a statement  from the North Koreans, saying that they will keep a big and open mind.</p><p> People in Ireland are voting on a referendum that could overturn the  country's strict abortion law. They are deciding whether to repeal the  Eight Amendment which recognizes the right to life of the unborn child as  being equal to the mother. It is a repeal parliament is expected to pass  legislation allowing abortion early in pregnancy.</p><p> Canadian police are on the hunt for these two men who they say set off an  improvised explosive device in suburban Toronto. The explosion happened  inside an Indian restaurant. Fifteen people were wounded, three of them  critically. The suspect then fled the scene.</p><p> U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on rape charges by  police in New York. That is according to a CNN source. He turned himself in  at a police station a short time ago and will be facing court in the next  few hours. Weinstein has denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.</p><p> Now, Washington's decision to scrap the summit with Pyongyang is likely to  be felt most acutely in South Korea. The country just finished holding an  annual joint military drill with the U.S. CNN's Paula Hancocks was able to  film the exercise exclusively. The footage embargoed until the drill ended  on Friday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Loading missiles on an F- 16 fighter jet, ready for a mission against an imaginary threat, an  imaginary enemy. This is Max Thunder, an annual joint air force drill  between the U.S. and South Korea, the same military drills that North Korea  slammed 10 days ago as the turning point in warming relations with the  South and the U.S.</p><p>CNN was able to film the exercise exclusively, which had been embargoed  until the drill ended Friday.</p><p> DAVID SHOEMAKER, COMMANDER, 8TH FIGHTER WING:  While the situation in the  background has changed over the years as we've flown Max Thunder, the  exercise itself is still there for the same reason, and that is the  tactical level and operability learning to fight together as an alliance.</p><p> HANCOCKS:  Pyongyang canceled high level talks with South Korea because of  this drill, calling it, quote, an intentional military provocation. The  first of many recent bumps in the road to a historic summit between the  U.S. and North Korean leaders that U.S. President Donald Trump has just  canceled. But the mood is still far less tense than this time last year.</p><p> The situation on the Korean Peninsula right now really could not be more  different to how it was last year when this Max Thunder drills were last  held.</p><p> But for those involved in these military exercises, the pilots, the U.S.  Air Force, they say that the politics is irrelevant. The most important  thing despite that is to make sure that they are trained and ready for  anything.</p><p> Pyongyang's anger at these drills took Seoul and Washington by surprise. A  South Korean delegation who met with Kim Jong-un said that Kim said he  understood why joint drills had to take place.</p><p> South Korean president Moon Jae-in said in Washington this week he believe  the relations would be back on track once Max Thunder was over, according  to aides. But a lot has changed since then. It's unclear if this drill was  really the reason Pyongyang cooled its enthusiasm for talks with Mr. Trump  or a convenient excuse. But what is clear is that these types of drills  infuriate Pyongyang, year in, year out.</p><p> Paula Hancocks, CNN, Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> VAUGHAN JONES:  Negotiations are reaching boiling points on the Iran  nuclear deal as nations that remain committed to the agreement meet for the  first time since President Trump decided to pull the U.S. out of that  agreement.</p><p>CNN's Fred Pleitgen is live in Vienna, Austria for us right now. Fred, even  if they are all on the same page as far as the deal is concerned, time is  definitely running out, right, to keep it afloat in its current form?</p><p> FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, I think  you're absolutely right, Hannah. I think time is absolutely running out.  That is simply something that a senior Iranian official told us earlier  today.</p><p> [08:34:58]  The Iranians are saying they want especially the European  country to put together a package of measures to offset the United States  leaving the nuclear agreement.</p><p> That means that they not only want to have, for instance, the sanctions  relief that they had before. They want European companies to be able to  invest in Iran without having to fear retribution from the United States.  They want to be able to sell their oil, continue to sell their oil on  international market.</p><p> But in addition to that, they also want other measures to make sure that  they get the benefits that they would have gotten if the U.S. had stayed in  the agreement even after the U.S. moves out. The Iranians were saying they  believe that the nuclear agreement has what they call two pillars. One of  them is obviously their nuclear dismantlement, the large part of their  nuclear program.</p><p> And then in return, they said, they were promised economic incentives. They  say so far they have not gotten them and now the JCPOA is in trouble. They  say a11 of that has gotten even worse. So, that's one of the things that  led this particular Iranian official to say that he is not very confident  that the deal can be kept.</p><p> The negotiations here behind me have been going on for a while. There was a  Russian delegate who walked out a couple of minutes ago and he said, so  far, at least all sides are still talking. They are trying to find a way  forward.</p><p> So these things haven't completely fallen apart but there is no doubt that  it is going to be very, very difficult to keep the nuclear agreement intact  in light of the fact that the U.S. is out and is threatening European  companies especially that there might be sanctions if they deal with Iran  in the future, Hannah.</p><p> VAUGHAN JONES:  Yeah. One wonders (ph) what the U.S. is making of these  negotiations taking place across the Atlantic and it not being a part of  those negotiations.</p><p> PLEITGEN:  Well, the U.S. has essentially left the deal and so therefore  they wouldn't be part of these negotiations. I think that is something that  all sides that remain in the deal do agree on. On the other hand, of course  they are highly skeptical and critical of these negotiations still going  on.</p><p> The United States government has come out. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  has come out and said, look, the Europeans need to pull their businesses  out of Iran. He said they are willing to listen to European concerns.  However, the Americans have a very clear, very strict and hard line  position on this issue.</p><p> So, it is very difficult especially for the European nations who have so  much trade (ph) and were strong allies of the United States to try and see  this whole thing through and try to keep the deal intact.</p><p> It is something that they are trying at this point. But again, if you look  at the delegates, you speak to folks here on the ground, none of them seem  overly optimistic that that is something that can be done.</p><p> Certainly they do say it is something that is difficult even though all of  them are saying they do still remain committed to trying to save this deal  and to trying to keep the provisions of this deal in the future as well,  Hannah.</p><p> VAUGHAN JONES:  Fred Pleitgen live for us in Vienna, Austria where it is  the middle of the afternoon at the moment. Fred, thank you.</p><p> Still ahead on \"News Stream,\" why the collapse of the U.S.-North Korea  summit did not surprise everyone, especially those familiar with Donald  Trump's book, \"The Art of the Deal.\" Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> VAUGHAN JONES:  Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" President Trump's decision  to cancel his summit on June 12 with the North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un  may have taken some people -- many people by surprise, but not those who  have followed Mr. Trump throughout his career.</p><p> In fact, some say it is a classic mood straight out from the bestseller he  co-wrote, \"The Art of the Deal.\" CNN's Brian Todd has this report.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [08:40:00]  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:   Nobody should be anxious. We have to get it right.</p><p> BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump walks away from what could  have been the deal of a lifetime. A letter to his Excellency, Kim Jong-un,  terminating their planned summit, citing Kim's, quote, open hostility in a  recent North Korean statement.</p><p> A letter from Trump touting America's nuclear might, a letter that analysts  say is extraordinary for personal nature.</p><p> RYAN HASS, FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER:  It is unusual that the president would  use threats of nuclear weapons in communication with a foreign counterpart.  It is unusual that the president would use, I and you and such  personalization.</p><p> TODD:  But according to his biographers, not unusual for Donald Trump. They  say the build up to a summit, the teams, and then the walk back is classic  Trump, a tactic he used to build his real estate empire.</p><p> MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  The president's art of the deal  strategy has always been to first ask for the world and intend to settle  for half of it and also be able to stake any position out in a course of  negotiations. So the notion of walking away is something that he had always  advocated. He has said that you should never enter a negotiation wanting  something too much.</p><p> TODD:  For decades, Donald Trump has sold himself to potential business  associates and then to voters on his ability to strike deals with difficult  partners like Kim Jong-un.</p><p> TRUMP:  With deals, that is what I do is deals.</p><p> I make good deals. You know, it's a talent. It's a talent, you can't be a  politician.</p><p> TODD:  Now in his letter to Kim, Trump says he is pulling out because of  the quote, anger and open hostility in North Korea's most recent statement,  where they called Vice President Pence a political dummy. Trump biographer  Michael D'Antonio isn't buying that explanation.</p><p> D'ANTONIO:  This after all, it's a situation where Trump himself has been  insulted many times and he has traded barbs back. What we're really seeing  here is the president seizing an opportunity to get out of a situation  which I think he felt was not going his way.</p><p> TODD:  Another classic Trump move in deal breaking are taunt. Trump tells  Kim, quote, you talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so  massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.</p><p> D'ANTONIO:  The taunting in the president's letter is one of those mine is  bigger than yours moments.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you think Kim Jong-un might react?</p><p> HASS:  Well, I think it raises the likelihood that Kim Jong-un will react  by resuming the verbal taunts that were so evident last fall. And to pay  (ph) upon where things go from there, there is a higher risk that we could  see a return of testing, either missile testing or perhaps nuclear testing.</p><p> TODD:  President Trump and senior administration officials now say the door  is not closed to the idea of a summit at a later date. Korean analyst say  for Kim Jong-un, that is going to mean swallowing his ego which may not be  likely any time soon. Can Trump swallow his ego to do it? Trump biographer  Michael D'Antonio says it is possible if it means Trump will get what he  wants, the world's approval and possibly a Nobel peace prize.</p><p> Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> VAUGHAN JONES:  Finally, authorities in Hawaii are urging people to stay  away from areas where lava is oozing into the Pacific Ocean. You are  looking now at live pictures of the molten rocks spewing from a fissure.  United States geological survey scientist says two to three of volcano's  main lava channels have now merged to create two entry points into the  ocean.</p><p> When it hits the water, it sends hydrochloric acid and volcanic glass  particles into the air. We will continue here at CNN to bring you the  latest on this incredible but of course very dangerous natural disaster.</p><p> And that is \"News Stream.\" I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones live in London for you.  \"World Sport\" with Christina Macfarlane is coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [08:45:00]  (WORLD SPORT)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Welcome to \"News Stream.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump calls off the historic U.S.-North Korean summit but Pyongyang says it is still willing to meet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran nuclear deal in focus as E.U., Russian, Chinese, and Iranian officials discuss ways to keep the deal alive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein turns himself in to police in New York. Sources say he has been arrested on rape charges.</p><p>Welcome to the program. We begin with the situation on the Korean Peninsula. China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience after landmark talks on North Korea's nuclear program were abruptly called off. Donald Trump had agreed to meet Kim Jong-un in Singapore next month, but the U.S. president cancelled.</p><p>In a letter, he cited recent hostile comments from the North Korean regime as a reason for pulling out. Officials in Pyongyang say Kim Jong-un is ready to meet Mr. Trump at any time. The president says a meeting wouldn't be appropriate right now, but he left the door open to future talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I hope that Kim Jong-un will ultimately do what is right not only for himself but perhaps most importantly what's right for his people who are suffering greatly and needlessly. All of the Korean people, North and South, deserve to be able to live together in harmony, prosperity, and peace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES: Well the latest from both sides of this debate now, Joe Johns is in Washington for us. Matt Rivers is in Seoul, South Korea. Joe to you first, is the White House still hopeful, expecting a meeting at all or just washing its hands of Kim for the foreseeable?</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Hannah, it's pretty clear that the White House here has left the door open I think that you said at the very beginning. At the same time, they're being realistic about this and there is some sentiment that a return to maximum sanctions might be in order.</p><p>The problem with that of course is getting the international community to go along particularly some of the countries in the region such as China as well as South Korea. Those two countries, at least have been subject to entreaties, if you will, from North Korea during this period, which creates a question at least for some of the international partners about which of the two parties that were involved in this summit that went down were in fact holding the moral high ground, if you will.</p><p>In fact it was the President of the United States, it was the White House, the administration that pulled out of this very important summit and not North Korea so, a lot of thought going into this. The big question, of course, can they return to maximum sanctions? It can be difficult, simply because some of the countries that would have to go along might not.</p><p>JONES: Let's bring in Matt Rivers. Matt is standing by for us in Seoul, South Korea at the moment. Matt, I'm wondering if the North Koreans have responded yet to this letter, responded formally at least. I mean, we understand that they say they're still up for a summit at some point, but is there any sign of any regret perhaps for some of the rhetoric, the aggressive rhetoric news in recent days?</p><p>[08:05:01] MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Publicly, no. No signs of regret at least at this point, Hannah. What we did get was a statement from a high ranking official within North Korea's foreign ministry. And in that statement, it said in part, we reiterate to the U.S. that we are willing to sit face-to-face at any time and in any way.</p><p>And that is the only silver lining that many people here in South Korea are looking at here. That and also the willingness of the president of the United States to leave the door open for a future summit as well. Both sides, the U.S. and North Korea seemingly willing to leave the door open for a summit down the road.</p><p>And that's kind of been the only point of hope here in South Korea because today, frankly, has been a day disappointment here especially for South Korea's government, for President Moon Jae-in who put so much stock in this summit, served as a middle man between North Korea and the United States.</p><p>There is deep disappointment that this summit did not happen and so the only thing left at this point would be to hope that there is, well, that they can put a lot of stock in the relatively measured statements that we got both from the president of the U.S. as well as that statement from the North Korean foreign ministry.</p><p>JONES: Let's bring in Joe Johns again. Joe is still standing by for us in Washington. Joe, you were talking at the end of your last answer there about maximum pressure. What exactly does maximum pressure mean if that is going to be the policy that the U.S. adopts now as far as Pyongyang is concerned?</p><p>JOHNS: Well, it certainly were means among other things, more economic pressure on a country that has already worked its way through quite a bit of economic pressure. It also means attempting to get China back on board. Of course, as you know, China accounts for so much of North Korea's economy, if you will. The administration has also talked, obviously, as we heard, about keeping the military on high alert for anything that would suggest hostility.</p><p>This, of course, can be perceived in that region as a threat from Donald Trump and return, if you will, to some of the rhetoric that we heard earlier in the Trump administration, very strident rhetoric which was seen, I, think, around the world in many quarters as an escalation and bringing the world one step closer to some very risky business, if you will, Hannah.</p><p>JONES: All right, Joe, live for us in Washington. Matt also standing by in Seoul. My thanks to you both.</p><p>Well, just hours before Donald Trump's announcement on that summit, North Korea appeared to destroy tunnels and observation buildings at its nuclear test site and in fact, our Will Ripley was there and broke the news then to the North Koreans of President Trump's announcement. Will describes now the long ride that he took to get there and that awkward moment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We were on the way back from the nuclear test site at Punggye-ri here to Wonsan when the news broke overnight that President Trump has cancelled the upcoming summit in Singapore.</p><p>It was incredibly awkward and uncomfortable to be on the train with North Koreans after just witnessing the destruction of their nuclear test site at Punggye-ri, something they had hoped would lead to substantial progress in relations between the U.S. and North Korea. And instead the situation went downhill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Two, one.</p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY: I'm here at North Korea's nuclear test site at Punggye-ri, a place that foreign journalists have never been allowed before and we are here, the North Korean government says, to witness the destruction of this site. They say it will never be able to be used again.</p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY (voice-over): With each powerful explosion, the earth shakes. We travel around 15 hours to get here. First by bus through the coastal city of Wonsan.</p><p>Compartment seven, here we are.</p><p>Then, some 12 hours by train.</p><p>This is one of those moments where you blink and realize I'm having dinner on a train going through North Korea.</p><p>A luxury ride by North Korean standards.</p><p>They just came through and they closed all the blinds and told us that for the entire train ride, we can't film anything out the windows. We pull into Punggye-ri station, then begin the nearly two-hour drive to the test site. Once again, no filming along the way.</p><p>We passed through a number of what look like small farming villages. There was no sign of life, completely empty except for the handful of soldiers at the guard posts along the way.</p><p>We get a briefing from the deputy director of North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Institute.</p><p>[08:10:02] He won't tell us his name. Then, we're allowed to inspect the tunnels. North Korea says they could have easily conducted more nuclear tests here. They say two tunnels have never been used.</p><p>So they by rigging it with explosives and blowing it up that's a meaningful step towards denuclearization. No nuclear weapons experts at our small group, only journalists.</p><p>It's actually quite beautiful here, the North Koreans say that the ecosystem hasn't been damaged by all of these nuclear test for more than a decade. They say no radiation has seeped out. Journalists aren't allowed to carry radiation detectors ourselves. They were taken away at the airport so, we have to take their word for it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): The dismantling of the nuclear test grounds conducted with high level of transparency has clearly attested once again to the proactive and peace-loving efforts of the government of the DPRK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY: You really do get the sense that you're witnessing history here, which is why we're documenting every single building on this site because by the end o the day it will all be gone.</p><p>We hike to an observation post built just for us and watch Punggye-ri go up in smoke.</p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY: The official statement from North Korea's ministry of foreign affairs indicates that Pyongyang is still interested in a dialogue with Washington. They say they are ready to talk with President Trump at anytime. They say dialogue between the two countries is crucial to improve the situation on the Peninsula.</p><p>And they say that the nuclear test site destruction was, in their words, a meaningful transparent step towards denuclearization. A sign of goodwill ahead of any potential talks with the United States. Will Ripley, CNN, Wonsan, North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES: Will, thanks very much. Let's bring in Barbara Demick (inaudible) for us. Barbara is the former Beijing and Seoul bureau chief for the \"L.A. Times\" and she has written a book called North Korea titled, \"Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea.\" She joins us from New York via Skype. Barbara, great to have you on.</p><p>And with no summit in sight at the moment then, it seems that the U.S. policy is going to be applying maximum pressure on North Korea, the impact of which presumably trickle straight down and hurts the ordinary people in North Korea that you've written about.</p><p>BARBARA DEMICK, FORMER BEIJING AND SEOUL BUREAU CHIEF, L.A. TIMES: That's exactly right. And these -- we've had this discussion before, but sanctions tend to hurt the ordinary North Koreans who over the years have been very dependent on international food aid, medical aid, and you know, I've heard from a lot o4 people in the NGO community that they can't get in x-ray machines for TB patients, very difficult to get in medicines.</p><p>It really is unfortunate I would guess, had I been, you know, talking to people in North Korea that they were really hopeful there would have been a breakthrough and I think they're the ones who are most directly affected.</p><p>JONES: Yes, well, I mean the main players though in all of this of course, they force their geopolitical format. There's been a lot of talk about China in all of this. Let's ask you about that given your experience in the region. Some people said that China sidelined by not being involved in this summit were its go ahead not being at the table as well. Donald Trump seems to be almost blaming China as well for the fact that the summit hasn't happened. What are your thoughts on that?</p><p>DEMICK: I think China is in a very complicated role, you know, publicly they've cheered on the summit saying they're here to facilitate, but I think they were very fearful of being sidelined by the North Koreans and the U.S. I mean, there's a very delicate balance here and I think Beijing is fearful of a situation like you have in Vietnam where a communist country draws closer to the U.S. rather than to China.</p><p>And although it's rarely spoken by the main players in public, you know, the North Koreans are also fearful of China. You know, one of the reasons they've been developing this nuclear program is so that they don't need to rely on China for their security and you know, strangely enough, you know, I think the North Koreans when they said there is a deal that U.S. troops can stay on the peninsula, what they were saying, although they were never articulated, is that, you know, we're afraid of China too.</p><p>JONES: Right.</p><p>DEMICK: I don't think China wants, you know, a nuclear arms North Korea. They don't want to dangerous neighbor, but I don't think they really want a peace treat with the U.S. that doesn't involve them.</p><p>JONES: It does seem that both sides though are still leaving the possibility of some talks on the table at the moment. Can you foresee a situation when potentially we would have not just Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, but also have Moon Jae-in and also Xi Jinping as well so we have four-party talks instead of just the two?</p><p>[08:15:02] DEMICK: Well, you remember we've had, for many years six-party talks that's included Japan and Russia. I think we could return to a multi- party situation, but I know -- I think that, you know, there were so much momentum and energy going into this summit and everybody was so excited, and I think, you know, that the wind has been taken out of those sails and I'm not really hopeful over that big breakthrough. I think many of us are kind of disappointed.</p><p>JONES: While we wait to see. Barbara Demick, we appreciate your analysis. Thank you.</p><p>DEMICK: Thank you.</p><p>JONES: Now, the U.S. film producer, Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on sexual assault charges by police in New York. That is according to a CNN source. He did turn himself in to a police station a short time ago and will face court itself for the next few hours. The source has told CNN that Weinstein will be charged with raping one woman and forcing another to perform oral sex on him.</p><p>There has been a flood, of course, of accusations against the producer and they were the trigger for women around the world to come forward with accounts of sexual harassments and abuse at the hands of powerful men. Those pictures from not too long ago of Harvey Weinstein. Let's get the very latest then from New York. CNN's Brynn Gingras is there for us righ now. This remind us, Brynn, of the background to this case and of course the fact that Harvey Weinstein (inaudible) himself, while he has turned himself in, as far as I understand, denies all the accusations against him?</p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, he still is. And we're expecting to hear from his attorney likely after court proceedings later this morning, but yes, of course we know about how big, how global this case has gone. When that \"New Yorker\" article revealed some names of people who made strong accusations against Harvey Weinstein, I can tell you from a source that the NYPD began investigating immediately.</p><p>So this is a very dear investigation to the NYPD as they have been working on it for months, and today finally, the first criminal charges are going to be filed in the case. But I can tell you here it's a busy (inaudible) here in Tribeca in Manhattan. We have tons of media out here because inside that precinct house behind me is Harvey Weinstein. He is officially under arrest.</p><p>That means that he has taken a booking photo. That means he's been fingerprinted and soon he's going to head back out those doors and head right to court. And that's where he's going to face charges of a criminal sex act as well as rape and we're expecting his bond, Hannah, to be set at $2 million, Hannah.</p><p>JONES: And when we look ahead to any kind of future trial as well, this would obviously have a huge amount of attention from around the world, given the fact that he is so prominent in Hollywood as well. What kind of time frame are we looking at for a trial?</p><p>GINGRAS: You know, that's always up in the air, right? But here's the thing. Like I said, this is the first criminal charges to be file. We are expecting more to come. This was just the first. We know that there are investigations still happening in Los Angeles. We know investigations in London, and we also know that there's a federal probe here in New York City that's happening as well as a current grand jury has been convened and continues to listen to testimonies from at least four women in this case. So, we do expect more charges to be filed to both of these cases. So, it's a long way, but this is just the beginning it seems for Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>JONES: Brynn, thanks so much indeed. Brynn's live there for us in New York.</p><p>Now, Europe's new data privacy law is just a few hours old and Facebook and Google are already in trouble for allegedly trying to skirt the rules. More on that coming up.</p><p>[08:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES: Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" Europe's sweeping data protection regulation goes into effect this Friday. CNN has learned separate lawsuits have already been filed against Facebook, Google, WhatsApp and Instagram, alleging that the companies are failing to comply.</p><p>Testifying in front of E.U. leaders on Tuesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg insisted his company would follow the new rules. But out Samuel Burke now reports legal experts believe Facebook is already violating the new law.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Austrian lawyer, Max Schrems has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade. And today he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law called GDPR the day it came into force.</p><p>MAX SCHREMS, LAWYER: We were looking for big companies that really willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and trying to get away with it.</p><p>BURKE: Schrems who helped write the regulation says he's taking legal action because big tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p>SCHREMS: (Inaudible) this idea if we don't want this, we think it's stupid so we don't want to comply with it. And there are no obvious business interests. There are certain things you simply can do with data anymore that give a profit.</p><p>BURKE: The new law was supposed to stop companies from hovering up your sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent. According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL VEALE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY EXPERT, UNIVESITY OF LONDON: On your Facebook profile, you can pretend things like sexuality, religion or political beliefs, and if you put that on, you don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize content to every advertising and so on.</p><p>BURKE: There's only an \"I accept\" button.</p><p>VEALE: Exactly.</p><p>BURKE: There's not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p>VEALE: Exactly, you got to --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other websites too.</p><p>VEALE: Facebook can infer from the great amount of data it has about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send data to Facebook.</p><p>BURKE: As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making these inferences that they make about us?</p><p>VEALE: Yes. That law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without explicit consent.</p><p>BURKE: Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook. European data regulators can impose a fine of up to four percent of its global annual revenue. Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer said that company has, quote, introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete their information. The company also says it's building a new tool that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them, it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: We do expect to be fully compliant on May 25th.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: Lawyer Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent the kind of data scrapping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have engaged in.</p><p>SCHREMS: If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in this digitalized age. In the end, you as a customer have the possibility to use let's say Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.</p><p>BURKE: However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data regulations are already re-drawing the line between profit and privacies. Samuel Burke, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES: The new rules have very strict wording but what happens if there really are violations. Our Kristie Lu Stout asked Vera Jourova, the European justice (inaudible) if the E.U. is ready to enforce these new rules.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:25:00] VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN JUSTICE COMMISSIONER: Of course, we made it very serious that we will enforce the GDPR rules because they bring the necessary better protection for the citizens to have their privacy better protected. And that's why we count with the enforcement of the rules. We have a network of data protection authorities in all the member state and they will pay due attention to all possible breaches.</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM HOST: A question about Facebook because we know that Mark Zuckerberg was just in Brussel earlier this week. Did the European Union get the sense that Facebook is not only willing to comply with GDPR, but willing to self-regulate so that the E.U. won't find itself in a position to pass more laws to protect data privacy?</p><p>JOUROVA: Well, we heard the replies of Mr. Zuckerberg. He said that he can guarantee that Facebook will be fully compliant with the strict European rules. I have no reason not to believe him at this stage, but of course it will be under a very strict control, as I said, from (inaudible) to protection authorities and Facebook will belong to the companies where we will pay full attention to because the volume of data they are harvesting in the E.U., the data from Europeans is extremely big and that's why the risk is also rather big.</p><p>LU STOUT: OK, so far we've talked about GDPR and what it means for companies. Let's talk about consumers and a possible consumer backlash because the number of consumers out there who like data mining, who say that it allows them to have a very comfortable online experience, a seamless experience that is tailored just for them. How do you appeal to those digital users to embrace GDPR and what it represents?</p><p>JOUROVA: Well, that's a crucial thing that the people, as you say, the consumers understand that they have the rights fully in place. They have fully under their control with what's happening to their private data and that they should be more aware of the possibilities which GDPR gives them.</p><p>For instance, to give well informed consent to using of the private data but also to say no, we do not want to be in the system and for instance in Facebook. We do not want to discourage the people from using online route and social media. We just want them to be safer.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES: The E.U. justice commissioner there with our Kristie Lu Stout.</p><p>Now, a military drill that was slammed by Pyongyang. We have exclusive footage from Max Thunder, the joint exercise between the U.S. and South Korea.</p><p>[08:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES: Welcome back. I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones in London. You are watching \"News Stream\" and these are your world headlines.</p><p>China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience after Donald Trump after Donald Trump pulled out to a planned meeting with his North Korean counterpart.</p><p>Meanwhile, just moments ago, Donald Trump tweeted the following: Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will soon see where it will leads. Hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time and talent will tell. Trump reacting there to a statement from the North Koreans, saying that they will keep a big and open mind.</p><p>People in Ireland are voting on a referendum that could overturn the country's strict abortion law. They are deciding whether to repeal the Eight Amendment which recognizes the right to life of the unborn child as being equal to the mother. It is a repeal parliament is expected to pass legislation allowing abortion early in pregnancy.</p><p>Canadian police are on the hunt for these two men who they say set off an improvised explosive device in suburban Toronto. The explosion happened inside an Indian restaurant. Fifteen people were wounded, three of them critically. The suspect then fled the scene.</p><p>U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on rape charges by police in New York. That is according to a CNN source. He turned himself in at a police station a short time ago and will be facing court in the next few hours. Weinstein has denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.</p><p>Now, Washington's decision to scrap the summit with Pyongyang is likely to be felt most acutely in South Korea. The country just finished holding an annual joint military drill with the U.S. CNN's Paula Hancocks was able to film the exercise exclusively. The footage embargoed until the drill ended on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Loading missiles on an F- 16 fighter jet, ready for a mission against an imaginary threat, an imaginary enemy. This is Max Thunder, an annual joint air force drill between the U.S. and South Korea, the same military drills that North Korea slammed 10 days ago as the turning point in warming relations with the South and the U.S.</p><p>CNN was able to film the exercise exclusively, which had been embargoed until the drill ended Friday.</p><p>DAVID SHOEMAKER, COMMANDER, 8TH FIGHTER WING: While the situation in the background has changed over the years as we've flown Max Thunder, the exercise itself is still there for the same reason, and that is the tactical level and operability learning to fight together as an alliance.</p><p>HANCOCKS: Pyongyang canceled high level talks with South Korea because of this drill, calling it, quote, an intentional military provocation. The first of many recent bumps in the road to a historic summit between the U.S. and North Korean leaders that U.S. President Donald Trump has just canceled. But the mood is still far less tense than this time last year.</p><p>The situation on the Korean Peninsula right now really could not be more different to how it was last year when this Max Thunder drills were last held.</p><p>But for those involved in these military exercises, the pilots, the U.S. Air Force, they say that the politics is irrelevant. The most important thing despite that is to make sure that they are trained and ready for anything.</p><p>Pyongyang's anger at these drills took Seoul and Washington by surprise. A South Korean delegation who met with Kim Jong-un said that Kim said he understood why joint drills had to take place.</p><p>South Korean president Moon Jae-in said in Washington this week he believe the relations would be back on track once Max Thunder was over, according to aides. But a lot has changed since then. It's unclear if this drill was really the reason Pyongyang cooled its enthusiasm for talks with Mr. Trump or a convenient excuse. But what is clear is that these types of drills infuriate Pyongyang, year in, year out.</p><p>Paula Hancocks, CNN, Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES: Negotiations are reaching boiling points on the Iran nuclear deal as nations that remain committed to the agreement meet for the first time since President Trump decided to pull the U.S. out of that agreement.</p><p>CNN's Fred Pleitgen is live in Vienna, Austria for us right now. Fred, even if they are all on the same page as far as the deal is concerned, time is definitely running out, right, to keep it afloat in its current form?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, I think you're absolutely right, Hannah. I think time is absolutely running out. That is simply something that a senior Iranian official told us earlier today.</p><p>[08:34:58] The Iranians are saying they want especially the European country to put together a package of measures to offset the United States leaving the nuclear agreement.</p><p>That means that they not only want to have, for instance, the sanctions relief that they had before. They want European companies to be able to invest in Iran without having to fear retribution from the United States. They want to be able to sell their oil, continue to sell their oil on international market.</p><p>But in addition to that, they also want other measures to make sure that they get the benefits that they would have gotten if the U.S. had stayed in the agreement even after the U.S. moves out. The Iranians were saying they believe that the nuclear agreement has what they call two pillars. One of them is obviously their nuclear dismantlement, the large part of their nuclear program.</p><p>And then in return, they said, they were promised economic incentives. They say so far they have not gotten them and now the JCPOA is in trouble. They say a11 of that has gotten even worse. So, that's one of the things that led this particular Iranian official to say that he is not very confident that the deal can be kept.</p><p>The negotiations here behind me have been going on for a while. There was a Russian delegate who walked out a couple of minutes ago and he said, so far, at least all sides are still talking. They are trying to find a way forward.</p><p>So these things haven't completely fallen apart but there is no doubt that it is going to be very, very difficult to keep the nuclear agreement intact in light of the fact that the U.S. is out and is threatening European companies especially that there might be sanctions if they deal with Iran in the future, Hannah.</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES: Yeah. One wonders (ph) what the U.S. is making of these negotiations taking place across the Atlantic and it not being a part of those negotiations.</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, the U.S. has essentially left the deal and so therefore they wouldn't be part of these negotiations. I think that is something that all sides that remain in the deal do agree on. On the other hand, of course they are highly skeptical and critical of these negotiations still going on.</p><p>The United States government has come out. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has come out and said, look, the Europeans need to pull their businesses out of Iran. He said they are willing to listen to European concerns. However, the Americans have a very clear, very strict and hard line position on this issue.</p><p>So, it is very difficult especially for the European nations who have so much trade (ph) and were strong allies of the United States to try and see this whole thing through and try to keep the deal intact.</p><p>It is something that they are trying at this point. But again, if you look at the delegates, you speak to folks here on the ground, none of them seem overly optimistic that that is something that can be done.</p><p>Certainly they do say it is something that is difficult even though all of them are saying they do still remain committed to trying to save this deal and to trying to keep the provisions of this deal in the future as well, Hannah.</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES: Fred Pleitgen live for us in Vienna, Austria where it is the middle of the afternoon at the moment. Fred, thank you.</p><p>Still ahead on \"News Stream,\" why the collapse of the U.S.-North Korea summit did not surprise everyone, especially those familiar with Donald Trump's book, \"The Art of the Deal.\" Stay with us.</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES: Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" President Trump's decision to cancel his summit on June 12 with the North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un may have taken some people -- many people by surprise, but not those who have followed Mr. Trump throughout his career.</p><p>In fact, some say it is a classic mood straight out from the bestseller he co-wrote, \"The Art of the Deal.\" CNN's Brian Todd has this report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:40:00] DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Nobody should be anxious. We have to get it right.</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: President Trump walks away from what could have been the deal of a lifetime. A letter to his Excellency, Kim Jong-un, terminating their planned summit, citing Kim's, quote, open hostility in a recent North Korean statement.</p><p>A letter from Trump touting America's nuclear might, a letter that analysts say is extraordinary for personal nature.</p><p>RYAN HASS, FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER: It is unusual that the president would use threats of nuclear weapons in communication with a foreign counterpart. It is unusual that the president would use, I and you and such personalization.</p><p>TODD: But according to his biographers, not unusual for Donald Trump. They say the build up to a summit, the teams, and then the walk back is classic Trump, a tactic he used to build his real estate empire.</p><p>MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: The president's art of the deal strategy has always been to first ask for the world and intend to settle for half of it and also be able to stake any position out in a course of negotiations. So the notion of walking away is something that he had always advocated. He has said that you should never enter a negotiation wanting something too much.</p><p>TODD: For decades, Donald Trump has sold himself to potential business associates and then to voters on his ability to strike deals with difficult partners like Kim Jong-un.</p><p>TRUMP: With deals, that is what I do is deals.</p><p>I make good deals. You know, it's a talent. It's a talent, you can't be a politician.</p><p>TODD: Now in his letter to Kim, Trump says he is pulling out because of the quote, anger and open hostility in North Korea's most recent statement, where they called Vice President Pence a political dummy. Trump biographer Michael D'Antonio isn't buying that explanation.</p><p>D'ANTONIO: This after all, it's a situation where Trump himself has been insulted many times and he has traded barbs back. What we're really seeing here is the president seizing an opportunity to get out of a situation which I think he felt was not going his way.</p><p>TODD: Another classic Trump move in deal breaking are taunt. Trump tells Kim, quote, you talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.</p><p>D'ANTONIO: The taunting in the president's letter is one of those mine is bigger than yours moments.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you think Kim Jong-un might react?</p><p>HASS: Well, I think it raises the likelihood that Kim Jong-un will react by resuming the verbal taunts that were so evident last fall. And to pay (ph) upon where things go from there, there is a higher risk that we could see a return of testing, either missile testing or perhaps nuclear testing.</p><p>TODD: President Trump and senior administration officials now say the door is not closed to the idea of a summit at a later date. Korean analyst say for Kim Jong-un, that is going to mean swallowing his ego which may not be likely any time soon. Can Trump swallow his ego to do it? Trump biographer Michael D'Antonio says it is possible if it means Trump will get what he wants, the world's approval and possibly a Nobel peace prize.</p><p>Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES: Finally, authorities in Hawaii are urging people to stay away from areas where lava is oozing into the Pacific Ocean. You are looking now at live pictures of the molten rocks spewing from a fissure. United States geological survey scientist says two to three of volcano's main lava channels have now merged to create two entry points into the ocean.</p><p>When it hits the water, it sends hydrochloric acid and volcanic glass particles into the air. We will continue here at CNN to bring you the latest on this incredible but of course very dangerous natural disaster.</p><p>And that is \"News Stream.\" I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones live in London for you. \"World Sport\" with Christina Macfarlane is coming up next.</p><p>[08:45:00] (WORLD SPORT)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018052501cbk31</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SDJ-R951-DXH2-62CF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6027\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 25, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Welcome to \"News Stream.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump calls off the historic U.S.-North Korean summit but  Pyongyang says it is still willing to meet. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran nuclear deal in focus as E.U., Russian, Chinese, and Iranian officials  discuss ways to keep the deal alive. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein turns himself in to police in  New York. Sources say he has been arrested on rape charges.</p><p>Welcome to the program. We begin with the situation on the Korean  Peninsula. China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience  after landmark talks on North Korea's nuclear program were abruptly called  off. Donald Trump had agreed to meet Kim Jong-un in Singapore next month,  but the U.S. president cancelled. </p><p>In a letter, he cited recent hostile comments from the North Korean regime  as a reason for pulling out.  Officials in Pyongyang say Kim Jong-un is  ready to meet Mr. Trump at any time. The president says a meeting wouldn't  be appropriate right now, but he left the door open to future talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I hope that Kim Jong-un will  ultimately do what is right not only for himself but perhaps most  importantly what's right for his people who are suffering greatly and  needlessly. All of the Korean people, North and South, deserve to be able  to live together in harmony, prosperity, and peace. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES:  Well the latest from both sides of this debate now, Joe Johns is in  Washington for us. Matt Rivers is in Seoul, South Korea. Joe to you first,  is the White House still hopeful, expecting a meeting at all or just  washing its hands of Kim for the foreseeable? </p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hannah, it's pretty clear  that the White House here has left the door open I think that you said at  the very beginning. At the same time, they're being realistic about this  and there is some sentiment that a return to maximum sanctions might be in  order. </p><p>The problem with that of course is getting the international community to  go along particularly some of the countries in the region such as China as  well as South Korea. Those two countries, at least have been subject to  entreaties, if you will, from North Korea during this period, which creates  a question at least for some of the international partners about which of  the two parties that were involved in this summit that went down were in  fact holding the moral high ground, if you will. </p><p>In fact it was the President of the United States, it was the White House,  the administration that pulled out of this very important summit and not  North Korea so, a lot of thought going into this. The big question, of  course, can they return to maximum sanctions? It can be difficult, simply  because some of the countries that would have to go along might not. </p><p>JONES:  Let's bring in Matt Rivers. Matt is standing by for us in Seoul,  South Korea at the moment. Matt, I'm wondering if the North Koreans have  responded yet to this letter, responded formally at least. I mean, we  understand that they say they're still up for a summit at some point, but  is there any sign of any regret perhaps for some of the rhetoric, the  aggressive rhetoric news in recent days? </p><p>[08:05:01] MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Publicly, no. No  signs of regret at least at this point, Hannah. What we did get was a  statement from a high ranking official within North Korea's foreign  ministry. And in that statement, it said in part, we reiterate to the U.S.  that we are willing to sit face-to-face at any time and in any way. </p><p>And that is the only silver lining that many people here in South Korea are  looking at here. That and also the willingness of the president of the  United States to leave the door open for a future summit as well. Both  sides, the U.S. and North Korea seemingly willing to leave the door open  for a summit down the road. </p><p>And that's kind of been the only point of hope here in South Korea because  today, frankly, has been a day disappointment here especially for South  Korea's government, for President Moon Jae-in who put so much stock in this  summit, served as a middle man between North Korea and the United States. </p><p>There is deep disappointment that this summit did not happen and so the  only thing left at this point would be to hope that there is, well, that  they can put a lot of stock in the relatively measured statements that we  got both from the president of the U.S. as well as that statement from the  North Korean foreign ministry. </p><p>JONES:  Let's bring in Joe Johns again. Joe is still standing by for us in  Washington. Joe, you were talking at the end of your last answer there  about maximum pressure. What exactly does maximum pressure mean if that is  going to be the policy that the U.S. adopts now as far as Pyongyang is  concerned? </p><p>JOHNS:  Well, it certainly were means among other things, more economic  pressure on a country that has already worked its way through quite a bit  of economic pressure. It also means attempting to get China back on board.  Of course, as you know, China accounts for so much of North Korea's  economy, if you will. The administration has also talked, obviously, as we  heard, about keeping the military on high alert for anything that would  suggest hostility. </p><p>This, of course, can be perceived in that region as a threat from Donald  Trump and return, if you will, to some of the rhetoric that we heard  earlier in the Trump administration, very strident rhetoric which was seen,  I, think, around the world in many quarters as an escalation and bringing  the world one step closer to some very risky business, if you will, Hannah. </p><p>JONES:  All right, Joe, live for us in Washington. Matt also standing by in  Seoul. My thanks to you both. </p><p>Well, just hours before Donald Trump's announcement on that summit, North  Korea appeared to destroy tunnels and observation buildings at its nuclear  test site and in fact, our Will Ripley was there and broke the news then to  the North Koreans of President Trump's announcement. Will describes now the  long ride that he took to get there and that awkward moment. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We were on the way back from  the nuclear test site at Punggye-ri here to Wonsan when the news broke  overnight that President Trump has cancelled the upcoming summit in  Singapore. </p><p>It was incredibly awkward and uncomfortable to be on the train with North  Koreans after just witnessing the destruction of their nuclear test site at  Punggye-ri, something they had hoped would lead to substantial progress in  relations between the U.S. and North Korea. And instead the situation went  downhill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two, one.</p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY:  I'm here at North Korea's nuclear test site at Punggye-ri, a place  that foreign journalists have never been allowed before and we are here,  the North Korean government says, to witness the destruction of this site.  They say it will never be able to be used again. </p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY (voice-over):  With each powerful explosion, the earth shakes. We  travel around 15 hours to get here. First by bus through the coastal city  of Wonsan. </p><p>Compartment seven, here we are. </p><p>Then, some 12 hours by train.</p><p>This is one of those moments where you blink and realize I'm having dinner  on a train going through North Korea. </p><p>A luxury ride by North Korean standards. </p><p>They just came through and they closed all the blinds and told us that for  the entire train ride, we can't film anything out the windows. We pull into  Punggye-ri station, then begin the nearly two-hour drive to the test site.  Once again, no filming along the way. </p><p>We passed through a number of what look like small farming villages. There  was no sign of life, completely empty except for the handful of soldiers at  the guard posts along the way. </p><p>We get a briefing from the deputy director of North Korea's Nuclear Weapons  Institute. </p><p>[08:10:02] He won't tell us his name. Then, we're allowed to inspect the  tunnels. North Korea says they could have easily conducted more nuclear  tests here. They say two tunnels have never been used. </p><p>So they by rigging it with explosives and blowing it up that's a meaningful  step towards denuclearization. No nuclear weapons experts at our small  group, only journalists. </p><p>It's actually quite beautiful here, the North Koreans say that the  ecosystem hasn't been damaged by all of these nuclear test for more than a  decade. They say no radiation has seeped out. Journalists aren't allowed to  carry radiation detectors ourselves. They were taken away at the airport  so, we have to take their word for it. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation):  The dismantling of the nuclear  test grounds conducted with high level of transparency has clearly attested  once again to the proactive and peace-loving efforts of the government of  the DPRK. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY:  You really do get the sense that you're witnessing history here,  which is why we're documenting every single building on this site because  by the end o the day it will all be gone. </p><p>We hike to an observation post built just for us and watch Punggye-ri go up  in smoke.</p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY:  The official statement from North Korea's ministry of foreign  affairs indicates that Pyongyang is still interested in a dialogue with  Washington. They say they are ready to talk with President Trump at  anytime. They say dialogue between the two countries is crucial to improve  the situation on the Peninsula. </p><p>And they say that the nuclear test site destruction was, in their words, a  meaningful transparent step towards denuclearization. A sign of goodwill  ahead of any potential talks with the United States. Will Ripley, CNN,  Wonsan, North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  Will, thanks very much. Let's bring in Barbara Demick (inaudible)  for us. Barbara is the former Beijing and Seoul bureau chief for the \"L.A.  Times\" and she has written a book called North Korea titled, \"Nothing to  Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea.\" She joins us from New York via Skype.  Barbara, great to have you on. </p><p>And with no summit in sight at the moment then, it seems that the U.S.  policy is going to be applying maximum pressure on North Korea, the impact  of which presumably trickle straight down and hurts the ordinary people in  North Korea that you've written about. </p><p>BARBARA DEMICK, FORMER BEIJING AND SEOUL BUREAU CHIEF, L.A. TIMES:  That's  exactly right. And these -- we've had this discussion before, but sanctions  tend to hurt the ordinary North Koreans who over the years have been very  dependent on international food aid, medical aid, and you know, I've heard  from a lot o4 people in the NGO community that they can't get in x-ray  machines for TB patients, very difficult to get in medicines. </p><p>It really is unfortunate I would guess, had I been, you know, talking to  people in North Korea that they were really hopeful there would have been a  breakthrough and I think they're the ones who are most directly affected. </p><p>JONES:  Yes, well, I mean the main players though in all of this of course,  they force their geopolitical format. There's been a lot of talk about  China in all of this. Let's ask you about that given your experience in the  region. Some people said that China sidelined by not being involved in this  summit were its go ahead not being at the table as well. Donald Trump seems  to be almost blaming China as well for the fact that the summit hasn't  happened. What are your thoughts on that? </p><p>DEMICK:  I think China is in a very complicated role, you know, publicly  they've cheered on the summit saying they're here to facilitate, but I  think they were very fearful of being sidelined  by the North Koreans and  the U.S. I mean, there's a very delicate balance here and I think Beijing  is fearful of a situation like you have in Vietnam where a communist  country draws closer to the U.S. rather than to China.</p><p>And although it's rarely spoken by the main players in public, you know,  the North Koreans are also fearful of China. You know, one of the reasons  they've been developing this nuclear program is so that they don't need to  rely on China for their security and you know, strangely enough, you know,  I think the North Koreans when they said there is a deal that U.S. troops  can stay on the peninsula, what they were saying, although they were never  articulated, is that, you know, we're afraid of China too.</p><p>JONES:  Right.</p><p>DEMICK:  I don't think China wants, you know, a nuclear arms North Korea.  They don't want to dangerous neighbor, but I don't think they really want a  peace treat with the U.S. that doesn't involve them. </p><p>JONES:  It does seem that both sides though are still leaving the  possibility of some talks on the table at the moment. Can you foresee a  situation when potentially we would have not just Donald Trump and Kim  Jong-un, but also have Moon Jae-in and also Xi Jinping as well so we have  four-party talks instead of just the two? </p><p>[08:15:02] DEMICK:  Well, you remember we've had, for many years six-party  talks that's included Japan and Russia. I think we could return to a multi- party situation, but I know -- I think that, you know, there were so much  momentum and energy going into this summit and everybody was so excited,  and I think, you know, that the wind has been taken out of those sails and  I'm not really hopeful over that big breakthrough. I think many of us are  kind of disappointed.</p><p>JONES:  While we wait to see. Barbara Demick, we appreciate your analysis.  Thank you.</p><p>DEMICK:  Thank you.</p><p>JONES:  Now, the U.S. film producer, Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on  sexual assault charges by police in New York. That is according to a CNN  source. He did turn himself in to a police station a short time ago and  will face court itself for the next few hours. The source has told CNN that  Weinstein will be charged with raping one woman and forcing another to  perform oral sex on him.</p><p>There has been a flood, of course, of accusations against the producer and  they were the trigger for women around the world to come forward with  accounts of sexual harassments and abuse at the hands of powerful men.  Those pictures from not too long ago of Harvey Weinstein. Let's get the  very latest then from New York. CNN's Brynn Gingras is there for us righ  now. This remind us, Brynn, of the background to this case and of course  the fact that Harvey Weinstein (inaudible) himself, while he has turned  himself in, as far as I understand, denies all the accusations against him? </p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, he still is. And we're expecting  to hear from his attorney likely after court proceedings later this  morning, but yes, of course we know about how big, how global this case has  gone. When that \"New Yorker\" article revealed some names of people who made  strong accusations against Harvey Weinstein, I can tell you from a source  that the NYPD began investigating immediately. </p><p>So this is a very dear investigation to the NYPD as they have been working  on it for months, and today finally, the first criminal charges are going  to be filed in the case. But I can tell you here it's a busy (inaudible)  here in Tribeca in Manhattan. We have tons of media out here because inside  that precinct house behind me is Harvey Weinstein. He is officially under  arrest. </p><p>That means that he has taken a booking photo. That means he's been  fingerprinted and soon he's going to head back out those doors and head  right to court. And that's where he's going to face charges of a criminal  sex act as well as rape and we're expecting his bond, Hannah, to be set at  $2 million, Hannah.</p><p>JONES:  And when we look ahead to any kind of future trial as well, this  would obviously have a huge amount of attention from around the world,  given the fact that he is so prominent in Hollywood as well. What kind of  time frame are we looking at for a trial? </p><p>GINGRAS:  You know, that's always up in the air, right? But here's the  thing. Like I said, this is the first criminal charges to be file. We are  expecting more to come. This was just the first. We know that there are  investigations still happening in Los Angeles. We know investigations in  London, and we also know that there's a federal probe here in New York City  that's happening as well as a current grand jury has been convened and  continues to listen to testimonies from at least four women in this case.  So, we do expect more charges to be filed to both of these cases. So, it's  a long way, but this is just the beginning it seems for Harvey Weinstein. </p><p>JONES:  Brynn, thanks so much indeed. Brynn's live there for us in New  York. </p><p>Now, Europe's new data privacy law is just a few hours old and Facebook and  Google are already in trouble for allegedly trying to skirt the rules. More  on that coming up.</p><p>[08:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES:  Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" Europe's sweeping data protection  regulation goes into effect this Friday. CNN has learned separate lawsuits  have already been filed against Facebook, Google, WhatsApp and Instagram,  alleging that the companies are failing to comply. </p><p>Testifying in front of E.U. leaders on Tuesday, Facebook CEO Mark  Zuckerberg insisted his company would follow the new rules. But out Samuel  Burke now reports legal experts believe Facebook is already violating the  new law. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer,  Max Schrems has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for  nearly a decade. And today he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook  for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law called GDPR the  day it came into force.</p><p>MAX SCHREMS, LAWYER:  We were looking for big companies that really  willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and trying to get  away with it.</p><p>BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulation says he's taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p>SCHREMS:  (Inaudible) this idea if we don't want this, we think it's stupid  so we don't want to comply with it. And there are no obvious business  interests. There are certain things you simply can do with data anymore  that give a profit. </p><p>BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent. According to legal  experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL VEALE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY EXPERT, UNIVESITY OF LONDON:  On your  Facebook profile, you can pretend things like sexuality, religion or  political beliefs, and if you put that on, you don't have any choice but  for Facebook to use it to personalize content to every advertising and so  on.</p><p>BURKE:  There's only an \"I accept\" button. </p><p>VEALE:  Exactly. </p><p>BURKE:  There's not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p>VEALE:  Exactly, you got to --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your  profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites too. </p><p>VEALE:  Facebook can infer from the great amount of data it has about you  across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send  data to Facebook.</p><p>BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making  these inferences that they make about us?</p><p>VEALE:  Yes. That law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without  explicit consent.</p><p>BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook.  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to four percent of its  global annual revenue. Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could  face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer said that company  has, quote, introduced better tools for people to access, download and  delete their information. The company also says it's building a new tool  that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them,  it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE:  Lawyer Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent  the kind of data scrapping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have  engaged in. </p><p>SCHREMS:  If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in  this digitalized age. In the end, you as a customer have the possibility to  use let's say Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data. </p><p>BURKE:  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already re-drawing the line between profit and privacies.  Samuel Burke, CNN, London. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  The new rules have very strict wording but what happens if there  really are violations. Our Kristie Lu Stout asked Vera Jourova, the  European justice (inaudible) if the E.U. is ready to enforce these new  rules.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:25:00] VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN JUSTICE COMMISSIONER:  Of course, we made  it very serious that we will enforce the GDPR rules because they bring the  necessary better protection for the citizens to have their privacy better  protected. And that's why we count with the enforcement of the rules. We  have a network of data protection authorities in all the member state and  they will pay due attention to all possible breaches. </p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM HOST:  A question about Facebook because  we know that Mark Zuckerberg was just in Brussel earlier this week. Did the  European Union get the sense that Facebook is not only willing to comply  with GDPR, but willing to self-regulate so that the E.U. won't find itself  in a position to pass more laws to protect data privacy?</p><p>JOUROVA:  Well, we heard the replies of Mr. Zuckerberg. He said that he can  guarantee that Facebook will be fully compliant with the strict European  rules. I have no reason not to believe him at this stage, but of course it  will be under a very strict control, as I said, from (inaudible) to  protection authorities and Facebook will belong to the companies where we  will pay full attention to because the volume of data they are harvesting  in the E.U., the data from Europeans is extremely big and that's why the  risk is also rather big.</p><p>LU STOUT:  OK, so far we've talked about GDPR and what it means for  companies. Let's talk about consumers and a possible consumer backlash  because the number of consumers out there who like data mining, who say  that it allows them to have a very comfortable online experience, a  seamless experience that is tailored just for them. How do you appeal to  those digital users to embrace GDPR and what it represents?</p><p>JOUROVA:  Well, that's a crucial thing that the people, as you say, the  consumers understand that they have the rights fully in place. They have  fully under their control with what's happening to their private data and  that they should be more aware of the possibilities which GDPR gives them.  </p><p>For instance, to give well informed consent to using of the private data  but also to say no, we do not want to be in the system and for instance in  Facebook. We do not want to discourage the people from using online route  and social media. We just want them to be safer.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  The E.U. justice commissioner there with our Kristie Lu Stout.</p><p>Now, a military drill that was slammed by Pyongyang.

He turned himself in  at a police station a short time ago and will be facing court in the next  few hours. Weinstein has denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.</p><p>Now, Washington's decision to scrap the summit with Pyongyang is likely to  be felt most acutely in South Korea. The country just finished holding an  annual joint military drill with the U.S. CNN's Paula Hancocks was able to  film the exercise exclusively. The footage embargoed until the drill ended  on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Loading missiles on an F- 16 fighter jet, ready for a mission against an imaginary threat, an  imaginary enemy. This is Max Thunder, an annual joint air force drill  between the U.S. and South Korea, the same military drills that North Korea  slammed 10 days ago as the turning point in warming relations with the  South and the U.S.</p><p>CNN was able to film the exercise exclusively, which had been embargoed  until the drill ended Friday.</p><p>DAVID SHOEMAKER, COMMANDER, 8TH FIGHTER WING:  While the situation in the  background has changed over the years as we've flown Max Thunder, the  exercise itself is still there for the same reason, and that is the  tactical level and operability learning to fight together as an alliance.</p><p>HANCOCKS:  Pyongyang canceled high level talks with South Korea because of  this drill, calling it, quote, an intentional military provocation. The  first of many recent bumps in the road to a historic summit between the  U.S. and North Korean leaders that U.S. President Donald Trump has just  canceled. But the mood is still far less tense than this time last year.</p><p>The situation on the Korean Peninsula right now really could not be more  different to how it was last year when this Max Thunder drills were last  held.</p><p>But for those involved in these military exercises, the pilots, the U.S.  Air Force, they say that the politics is irrelevant. The most important  thing despite that is to make sure that they are trained and ready for  anything.</p><p>Pyongyang's anger at these drills took Seoul and Washington by surprise. A  South Korean delegation who met with Kim Jong-un said that Kim said he  understood why joint drills had to take place.</p><p>South Korean president Moon Jae-in said in Washington this week he believe  the relations would be back on track once Max Thunder was over, according  to aides. But a lot has changed since then. It's unclear if this drill was  really the reason Pyongyang cooled its enthusiasm for talks with Mr. Trump  or a convenient excuse. But what is clear is that these types of drills  infuriate Pyongyang, year in, year out.</p><p>Paula Hancocks, CNN, Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Negotiations are reaching boiling points on the Iran  nuclear deal as nations that remain committed to the agreement meet for the  first time since President Trump decided to pull the U.S. out of that  agreement.</p><p>CNN's Fred Pleitgen is live in Vienna, Austria for us right now. Fred, even  if they are all on the same page as far as the deal is concerned, time is  definitely running out, right, to keep it afloat in its current form?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, I think  you're absolutely right, Hannah. I think time is absolutely running out.  That is simply something that a senior Iranian official told us earlier  today.</p><p>[08:34:58]  The Iranians are saying they want especially the European  country to put together a package of measures to offset the United States  leaving the nuclear agreement.</p><p>That means that they not only want to have, for instance, the sanctions  relief that they had before. They want European companies to be able to  invest in Iran without having to fear retribution from the United States.  They want to be able to sell their oil, continue to sell their oil on  international market.</p><p>But in addition to that, they also want other measures to make sure that  they get the benefits that they would have gotten if the U.S. had stayed in  the agreement even after the U.S. moves out. The Iranians were saying they  believe that the nuclear agreement has what they call two pillars. One of  them is obviously their nuclear dismantlement, the large part of their  nuclear program.</p><p>And then in return, they said, they were promised economic incentives. They  say so far they have not gotten them and now the JCPOA is in trouble. They  say a11 of that has gotten even worse. So, that's one of the things that  led this particular Iranian official to say that he is not very confident  that the deal can be kept.</p><p>The negotiations here behind me have been going on for a while. There was a  Russian delegate who walked out a couple of minutes ago and he said, so  far, at least all sides are still talking. They are trying to find a way  forward.</p><p>So these things haven't completely fallen apart but there is no doubt that  it is going to be very, very difficult to keep the nuclear agreement intact  in light of the fact that the U.S. is out and is threatening European  companies especially that there might be sanctions if they deal with Iran  in the future, Hannah.</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Yeah. One wonders (ph) what the U.S. is making of these  negotiations taking place across the Atlantic and it not being a part of  those negotiations.</p><p>PLEITGEN:  Well, the U.S. has essentially left the deal and so therefore  they wouldn't be part of these negotiations. I think that is something that  all sides that remain in the deal do agree on. On the other hand, of course  they are highly skeptical and critical of these negotiations still going  on.</p><p>The United States government has come out. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  has come out and said, look, the Europeans need to pull their businesses  out of Iran. He said they are willing to listen to European concerns.  However, the Americans have a very clear, very strict and hard line  position on this issue.</p><p>So, it is very difficult especially for the European nations who have so  much trade (ph) and were strong allies of the United States to try and see  this whole thing through and try to keep the deal intact.</p><p>It is something that they are trying at this point. But again, if you look  at the delegates, you speak to folks here on the ground, none of them seem  overly optimistic that that is something that can be done.</p><p>Certainly they do say it is something that is difficult even though all of  them are saying they do still remain committed to trying to save this deal  and to trying to keep the provisions of this deal in the future as well,  Hannah.</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Fred Pleitgen live for us in Vienna, Austria where it is  the middle of the afternoon at the moment.

They  say the build up to a summit, the teams, and then the walk back is classic  Trump, a tactic he used to build his real estate empire.</p><p>MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  The president's art of the deal  strategy has always been to first ask for the world and intend to settle  for half of it and also be able to stake any position out in a course of  negotiations. So the notion of walking away is something that he had always  advocated. He has said that you should never enter a negotiation wanting  something too much.</p><p>TODD:  For decades, Donald Trump has sold himself to potential business  associates and then to voters on his ability to strike deals with difficult  partners like Kim Jong-un.</p><p>TRUMP:  With deals, that is what I do is deals.</p><p>I make good deals. You know, it's a talent. It's a talent, you can't be a  politician.</p><p>TODD:  Now in his letter to Kim, Trump says he is pulling out because of  the quote, anger and open hostility in North Korea's most recent statement,  where they called Vice President Pence a political dummy. Trump biographer  Michael D'Antonio isn't buying that explanation.</p><p>D'ANTONIO:  This after all, it's a situation where Trump himself has been  insulted many times and he has traded barbs back. What we're really seeing  here is the president seizing an opportunity to get out of a situation  which I think he felt was not going his way.</p><p>TODD:  Another classic Trump move in deal breaking are taunt. Trump tells  Kim, quote, you talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so  massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.</p><p>D'ANTONIO:  The taunting in the president's letter is one of those mine is  bigger than yours moments.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you think Kim Jong-un might react?</p><p>HASS:  Well, I think it raises the likelihood that Kim Jong-un will react  by resuming the verbal taunts that were so evident last fall. And to pay  (ph) upon where things go from there, there is a higher risk that we could  see a return of testing, either missile testing or perhaps nuclear testing.</p><p>TODD:  President Trump and senior administration officials now say the door  is not closed to the idea of a summit at a later date. Korean analyst say  for Kim Jong-un, that is going to mean swallowing his ego which may not be  likely any time soon. Can Trump swallow his ego to do it? Trump biographer  Michael D'Antonio says it is possible if it means Trump will get what he  wants, the world's approval and possibly a Nobel peace prize.</p><p>Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Finally, authorities in Hawaii are urging people to stay  away from areas where lava is oozing into the Pacific Ocean. You are  looking now at live pictures of the molten rocks spewing from a fissure.  United States geological survey scientist says two to three of volcano's  main lava channels have now merged to create two entry points into the  ocean.</p><p>When it hits the water, it sends hydrochloric acid and volcanic glass  particles into the air. We will continue here at CNN to bring you the  latest on this incredible but of course very dangerous natural disaster.</p><p>And that is \"News Stream.\" I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones live in London for you.  \"World Sport\" with Christina Macfarlane is coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[08:45:00]  (WORLD SPORT)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Welcome to \"News Stream.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump calls off the historic U.S.-North Korean summit but  Pyongyang says it is still willing to meet. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran nuclear deal in focus as E.U., Russian, Chinese, and Iranian officials  discuss ways to keep the deal alive. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein turns himself in to police in  New York. Sources say he has been arrested on rape charges.</p><p>Welcome to the program. We begin with the situation on the Korean  Peninsula. China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience  after landmark talks on North Korea's nuclear program were abruptly called  off. Donald Trump had agreed to meet Kim Jong-un in Singapore next month,  but the U.S. president cancelled. </p><p>In a letter, he cited recent hostile comments from the North Korean regime  as a reason for pulling out.  Officials in Pyongyang say Kim Jong-un is  ready to meet Mr. Trump at any time. The president says a meeting wouldn't  be appropriate right now, but he left the door open to future talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I hope that Kim Jong-un will  ultimately do what is right not only for himself but perhaps most  importantly what's right for his people who are suffering greatly and  needlessly. All of the Korean people, North and South, deserve to be able  to live together in harmony, prosperity, and peace. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES:  Well the latest from both sides of this debate now, Joe Johns is in  Washington for us. Matt Rivers is in Seoul, South Korea. Joe to you first,  is the White House still hopeful, expecting a meeting at all or just  washing its hands of Kim for the foreseeable? </p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hannah, it's pretty clear  that the White House here has left the door open I think that you said at  the very beginning. At the same time, they're being realistic about this  and there is some sentiment that a return to maximum sanctions might be in  order. </p><p>The problem with that of course is getting the international community to  go along particularly some of the countries in the region such as China as  well as South Korea. Those two countries, at least have been subject to  entreaties, if you will, from North Korea during this period, which creates  a question at least for some of the international partners about which of  the two parties that were involved in this summit that went down were in  fact holding the moral high ground, if you will. </p><p>In fact it was the President of the United States, it was the White House,  the administration that pulled out of this very important summit and not  North Korea so, a lot of thought going into this. The big question, of  course, can they return to maximum sanctions? It can be difficult, simply  because some of the countries that would have to go along might not. </p><p>JONES:  Let's bring in Matt Rivers. Matt is standing by for us in Seoul,  South Korea at the moment. Matt, I'm wondering if the North Koreans have  responded yet to this letter, responded formally at least. I mean, we  understand that they say they're still up for a summit at some point, but  is there any sign of any regret perhaps for some of the rhetoric, the  aggressive rhetoric news in recent days? </p><p>[08:05:01] MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Publicly, no. No  signs of regret at least at this point, Hannah. What we did get was a  statement from a high ranking official within North Korea's foreign  ministry. And in that statement, it said in part, we reiterate to the U.S.  that we are willing to sit face-to-face at any time and in any way. </p><p>And that is the only silver lining that many people here in South Korea are  looking at here. That and also the willingness of the president of the  United States to leave the door open for a future summit as well. Both  sides, the U.S. and North Korea seemingly willing to leave the door open  for a summit down the road. </p><p>And that's kind of been the only point of hope here in South Korea because  today, frankly, has been a day disappointment here especially for South  Korea's government, for President Moon Jae-in who put so much stock in this  summit, served as a middle man between North Korea and the United States. </p><p>There is deep disappointment that this summit did not happen and so the  only thing left at this point would be to hope that there is, well, that  they can put a lot of stock in the relatively measured statements that we  got both from the president of the U.S. as well as that statement from the  North Korean foreign ministry. </p><p>JONES:  Let's bring in Joe Johns again. Joe is still standing by for us in  Washington. Joe, you were talking at the end of your last answer there  about maximum pressure. What exactly does maximum pressure mean if that is  going to be the policy that the U.S. adopts now as far as Pyongyang is  concerned? </p><p>JOHNS:  Well, it certainly were means among other things, more economic  pressure on a country that has already worked its way through quite a bit  of economic pressure. It also means attempting to get China back on board.  Of course, as you know, China accounts for so much of North Korea's  economy, if you will. The administration has also talked, obviously, as we  heard, about keeping the military on high alert for anything that would  suggest hostility. </p><p>This, of course, can be perceived in that region as a threat from Donald  Trump and return, if you will, to some of the rhetoric that we heard  earlier in the Trump administration, very strident rhetoric which was seen,  I, think, around the world in many quarters as an escalation and bringing  the world one step closer to some very risky business, if you will, Hannah. </p><p>JONES:  All right, Joe, live for us in Washington. Matt also standing by in  Seoul. My thanks to you both. </p><p>Well, just hours before Donald Trump's announcement on that summit, North  Korea appeared to destroy tunnels and observation buildings at its nuclear  test site and in fact, our Will Ripley was there and broke the news then to  the North Koreans of President Trump's announcement. Will describes now the  long ride that he took to get there and that awkward moment. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We were on the way back from  the nuclear test site at Punggye-ri here to Wonsan when the news broke  overnight that President Trump has cancelled the upcoming summit in  Singapore. </p><p>It was incredibly awkward and uncomfortable to be on the train with North  Koreans after just witnessing the destruction of their nuclear test site at  Punggye-ri, something they had hoped would lead to substantial progress in  relations between the U.S. and North Korea. And instead the situation went  downhill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two, one.</p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY:  I'm here at North Korea's nuclear test site at Punggye-ri, a place  that foreign journalists have never been allowed before and we are here,  the North Korean government says, to witness the destruction of this site.  They say it will never be able to be used again. </p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY (voice-over):  With each powerful explosion, the earth shakes. We  travel around 15 hours to get here. First by bus through the coastal city  of Wonsan. </p><p>Compartment seven, here we are. </p><p>Then, some 12 hours by train.</p><p>This is one of those moments where you blink and realize I'm having dinner  on a train going through North Korea. </p><p>A luxury ride by North Korean standards. </p><p>They just came through and they closed all the blinds and told us that for  the entire train ride, we can't film anything out the windows. We pull into  Punggye-ri station, then begin the nearly two-hour drive to the test site.  Once again, no filming along the way. </p><p>We passed through a number of what look like small farming villages. There  was no sign of life, completely empty except for the handful of soldiers at  the guard posts along the way. </p><p>We get a briefing from the deputy director of North Korea's Nuclear Weapons  Institute. </p><p>[08:10:02] He won't tell us his name. Then, we're allowed to inspect the  tunnels. North Korea says they could have easily conducted more nuclear  tests here. They say two tunnels have never been used. </p><p>So they by rigging it with explosives and blowing it up that's a meaningful  step towards denuclearization. No nuclear weapons experts at our small  group, only journalists. </p><p>It's actually quite beautiful here, the North Koreans say that the  ecosystem hasn't been damaged by all of these nuclear test for more than a  decade. They say no radiation has seeped out. Journalists aren't allowed to  carry radiation detectors ourselves.

A sign of goodwill  ahead of any potential talks with the United States. Will Ripley, CNN,  Wonsan, North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  Will, thanks very much. Let's bring in Barbara Demick (inaudible)  for us. Barbara is the former Beijing and Seoul bureau chief for the \"L.A.  Times\" and she has written a book called North Korea titled, \"Nothing to  Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea.\" She joins us from New York via Skype.  Barbara, great to have you on. </p><p>And with no summit in sight at the moment then, it seems that the U.S.  policy is going to be applying maximum pressure on North Korea, the impact  of which presumably trickle straight down and hurts the ordinary people in  North Korea that you've written about. </p><p>BARBARA DEMICK, FORMER BEIJING AND SEOUL BUREAU CHIEF, L.A. TIMES:  That's  exactly right. And these -- we've had this discussion before, but sanctions  tend to hurt the ordinary North Koreans who over the years have been very  dependent on international food aid, medical aid, and you know, I've heard  from a lot o4 people in the NGO community that they can't get in x-ray  machines for TB patients, very difficult to get in medicines. </p><p>It really is unfortunate I would guess, had I been, you know, talking to  people in North Korea that they were really hopeful there would have been a  breakthrough and I think they're the ones who are most directly affected. </p><p>JONES:  Yes, well, I mean the main players though in all of this of course,  they force their geopolitical format. There's been a lot of talk about  China in all of this. Let's ask you about that given your experience in the  region. Some people said that China sidelined by not being involved in this  summit were its go ahead not being at the table as well. Donald Trump seems  to be almost blaming China as well for the fact that the summit hasn't  happened. What are your thoughts on that? </p><p>DEMICK:  I think China is in a very complicated role, you know, publicly  they've cheered on the summit saying they're here to facilitate, but I  think they were very fearful of being sidelined  by the North Koreans and  the U.S. I mean, there's a very delicate balance here and I think Beijing  is fearful of a situation like you have in Vietnam where a communist  country draws closer to the U.S. rather than to China.</p><p>And although it's rarely spoken by the main players in public, you know,  the North Koreans are also fearful of China. You know, one of the reasons  they've been developing this nuclear program is so that they don't need to  rely on China for their security and you know, strangely enough, you know,  I think the North Koreans when they said there is a deal that U.S. troops  can stay on the peninsula, what they were saying, although they were never  articulated, is that, you know, we're afraid of China too.</p><p>JONES:  Right.</p><p>DEMICK:  I don't think China wants, you know, a nuclear arms North Korea.  They don't want to dangerous neighbor, but I don't think they really want a  peace treat with the U.S. that doesn't involve them. </p><p>JONES:  It does seem that both sides though are still leaving the  possibility of some talks on the table at the moment. Can you foresee a  situation when potentially we would have not just Donald Trump and Kim  Jong-un, but also have Moon Jae-in and also Xi Jinping as well so we have  four-party talks instead of just the two? </p><p>[08:15:02] DEMICK:  Well, you remember we've had, for many years six-party  talks that's included Japan and Russia. I think we could return to a multi- party situation, but I know -- I think that, you know, there were so much  momentum and energy going into this summit and everybody was so excited,  and I think, you know, that the wind has been taken out of those sails and  I'm not really hopeful over that big breakthrough. I think many of us are  kind of disappointed.</p><p>JONES:  While we wait to see. Barbara Demick, we appreciate your analysis.  Thank you.</p><p>DEMICK:  Thank you.</p><p>JONES:  Now, the U.S. film producer, Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on  sexual assault charges by police in New York. That is according to a CNN  source. He did turn himself in to a police station a short time ago and  will face court itself for the next few hours. The source has told CNN that  Weinstein will be charged with raping one woman and forcing another to  perform oral sex on him.</p><p>There has been a flood, of course, of accusations against the producer and  they were the trigger for women around the world to come forward with  accounts of sexual harassments and abuse at the hands of powerful men.  Those pictures from not too long ago of Harvey Weinstein. Let's get the  very latest then from New York. CNN's Brynn Gingras is there for us righ  now. This remind us, Brynn, of the background to this case and of course  the fact that Harvey Weinstein (inaudible) himself, while he has turned  himself in, as far as I understand, denies all the accusations against him? </p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, he still is. And we're expecting  to hear from his attorney likely after court proceedings later this  morning, but yes, of course we know about how big, how global this case has  gone. When that \"New Yorker\" article revealed some names of people who made  strong accusations against Harvey Weinstein, I can tell you from a source  that the NYPD began investigating immediately. </p><p>So this is a very dear investigation to the NYPD as they have been working  on it for months, and today finally, the first criminal charges are going  to be filed in the case. But I can tell you here it's a busy (inaudible)  here in Tribeca in Manhattan. We have tons of media out here because inside  that precinct house behind me is Harvey Weinstein. He is officially under  arrest. </p><p>That means that he has taken a booking photo. That means he's been  fingerprinted and soon he's going to head back out those doors and head  right to court. And that's where he's going to face charges of a criminal  sex act as well as rape and we're expecting his bond, Hannah, to be set at  $2 million, Hannah.</p><p>JONES:  And when we look ahead to any kind of future trial as well, this  would obviously have a huge amount of attention from around the world,  given the fact that he is so prominent in Hollywood as well. What kind of  time frame are we looking at for a trial? </p><p>GINGRAS:  You know, that's always up in the air, right? But here's the  thing. Like I said, this is the first criminal charges to be file. We are  expecting more to come. This was just the first. We know that there are  investigations still happening in Los Angeles. We know investigations in  London, and we also know that there's a federal probe here in New York City  that's happening as well as a current grand jury has been convened and  continues to listen to testimonies from at least four women in this case.  So, we do expect more charges to be filed to both of these cases. So, it's  a long way, but this is just the beginning it seems for Harvey Weinstein. </p><p>JONES:  Brynn, thanks so much indeed. Brynn's live there for us in New  York. </p><p>Now, Europe's new data privacy law is just a few hours old and Facebook and  Google are already in trouble for allegedly trying to skirt the rules. More  on that coming up.</p><p>[08:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES:  Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" Europe's sweeping data protection  regulation goes into effect this Friday. CNN has learned separate lawsuits  have already been filed against Facebook, Google, WhatsApp and Instagram,  alleging that the companies are failing to comply. </p><p>Testifying in front of E.U. leaders on Tuesday, Facebook CEO Mark  Zuckerberg insisted his company would follow the new rules. But out Samuel  Burke now reports legal experts believe Facebook is already violating the  new law. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer,  Max Schrems has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for  nearly a decade. And today he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook  for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law called GDPR the  day it came into force.</p><p>MAX SCHREMS, LAWYER:  We were looking for big companies that really  willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and trying to get  away with it.</p><p>BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulation says he's taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p>SCHREMS:  (Inaudible) this idea if we don't want this, we think it's stupid  so we don't want to comply with it. And there are no obvious business  interests. There are certain things you simply can do with data anymore  that give a profit. </p><p>BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent. According to legal  experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL VEALE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY EXPERT, UNIVESITY OF LONDON:  On your  Facebook profile, you can pretend things like sexuality, religion or  political beliefs, and if you put that on, you don't have any choice but  for Facebook to use it to personalize content to every advertising and so  on.</p><p>BURKE:  There's only an \"I accept\" button. </p><p>VEALE:  Exactly. </p><p>BURKE:  There's not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p>VEALE:  Exactly, you got to --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your  profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites too. </p><p>VEALE:  Facebook can infer from the great amount of data it has about you  across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send  data to Facebook.</p><p>BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making  these inferences that they make about us?</p><p>VEALE:  Yes. That law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without  explicit consent.</p><p>BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook.  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to four percent of its  global annual revenue. Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could  face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer said that company  has, quote, introduced better tools for people to access, download and  delete their information. The company also says it's building a new tool  that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them,  it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE:  Lawyer Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent  the kind of data scrapping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have  engaged in. </p><p>SCHREMS:  If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in  this digitalized age. In the end, you as a customer have the possibility to  use let's say Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data. </p><p>BURKE:  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already re-drawing the line between profit and privacies.  Samuel Burke, CNN, London. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  The new rules have very strict wording but what happens if there  really are violations. Our Kristie Lu Stout asked Vera Jourova, the  European justice (inaudible) if the E.U. is ready to enforce these new  rules.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:25:00] VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN JUSTICE COMMISSIONER:  Of course, we made  it very serious that we will enforce the GDPR rules because they bring the  necessary better protection for the citizens to have their privacy better  protected. And that's why we count with the enforcement of the rules. We  have a network of data protection authorities in all the member state and  they will pay due attention to all possible breaches. </p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM HOST:  A question about Facebook because  we know that Mark Zuckerberg was just in Brussel earlier this week. Did the  European Union get the sense that Facebook is not only willing to comply  with GDPR, but willing to self-regulate so that the E.U. won't find itself  in a position to pass more laws to protect data privacy?</p><p>JOUROVA:  Well, we heard the replies of Mr. Zuckerberg. He said that he can  guarantee that Facebook will be fully compliant with the strict European  rules. I have no reason not to believe him at this stage, but of course it  will be under a very strict control, as I said, from (inaudible) to  protection authorities and Facebook will belong to the companies where we  will pay full attention to because the volume of data they are harvesting  in the E.U., the data from Europeans is extremely big and that's why the  risk is also rather big.</p><p>LU STOUT:  OK, so far we've talked about GDPR and what it means for  companies. Let's talk about consumers and a possible consumer backlash  because the number of consumers out there who like data mining, who say  that it allows them to have a very comfortable online experience, a  seamless experience that is tailored just for them. How do you appeal to  those digital users to embrace GDPR and what it represents?</p><p>JOUROVA:  Well, that's a crucial thing that the people, as you say, the  consumers understand that they have the rights fully in place. They have  fully under their control with what's happening to their private data and  that they should be more aware of the possibilities which GDPR gives them.  </p><p>For instance, to give well informed consent to using of the private data  but also to say no, we do not want to be in the system and for instance in  Facebook. We do not want to discourage the people from using online route  and social media. We just want them to be safer.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  The E.U. justice commissioner there with our Kristie Lu Stout.</p><p>Now, a military drill that was slammed by Pyongyang. We have exclusive  footage from Max Thunder, the joint exercise between the U.S. and South  Korea.</p><p>[08:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES:  Welcome back. I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones in London. You are watching  \"News Stream\" and these are your world headlines.</p><p>China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience after Donald  Trump after Donald Trump pulled out to a planned meeting with his North  Korean counterpart.</p><p>Meanwhile, just moments ago, Donald Trump tweeted the following: Very good  news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will  soon see where it will leads. Hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and  peace. Only time and talent will tell. Trump reacting there to a statement  from the North Koreans, saying that they will keep a big and open mind.</p><p>People in Ireland are voting on a referendum that could overturn the  country's strict abortion law. They are deciding whether to repeal the  Eight Amendment which recognizes the right to life of the unborn child as  being equal to the mother. It is a repeal parliament is expected to pass  legislation allowing abortion early in pregnancy.</p><p>Canadian police are on the hunt for these two men who they say set off an  improvised explosive device in suburban Toronto. The explosion happened  inside an Indian restaurant. Fifteen people were wounded, three of them  critically. The suspect then fled the scene.</p><p>U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on rape charges by  police in New York. That is according to a CNN source. He turned himself in  at a police station a short time ago and will be facing court in the next  few hours. Weinstein has denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.</p><p>Now, Washington's decision to scrap the summit with Pyongyang is likely to  be felt most acutely in South Korea. The country just finished holding an  annual joint military drill with the U.S. CNN's Paula Hancocks was able to  film the exercise exclusively. The footage embargoed until the drill ended  on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Loading missiles on an F- 16 fighter jet, ready for a mission against an imaginary threat, an  imaginary enemy. This is Max Thunder, an annual joint air force drill  between the U.S. and South Korea, the same military drills that North Korea  slammed 10 days ago as the turning point in warming relations with the  South and the U.S.</p><p>CNN was able to film the exercise exclusively, which had been embargoed  until the drill ended Friday.</p><p>DAVID SHOEMAKER, COMMANDER, 8TH FIGHTER WING:  While the situation in the  background has changed over the years as we've flown Max Thunder, the  exercise itself is still there for the same reason, and that is the  tactical level and operability learning to fight together as an alliance.</p><p>HANCOCKS:  Pyongyang canceled high level talks with South Korea because of  this drill, calling it, quote, an intentional military provocation. The  first of many recent bumps in the road to a historic summit between the  U.S. and North Korean leaders that U.S. President Donald Trump has just  canceled. But the mood is still far less tense than this time last year.</p><p>The situation on the Korean Peninsula right now really could not be more  different to how it was last year when this Max Thunder drills were last  held.</p><p>But for those involved in these military exercises, the pilots, the U.S.  Air Force, they say that the politics is irrelevant. The most important  thing despite that is to make sure that they are trained and ready for  anything.</p><p>Pyongyang's anger at these drills took Seoul and Washington by surprise. A  South Korean delegation who met with Kim Jong-un said that Kim said he  understood why joint drills had to take place.</p><p>South Korean president Moon Jae-in said in Washington this week he believe  the relations would be back on track once Max Thunder was over, according  to aides. But a lot has changed since then. It's unclear if this drill was  really the reason Pyongyang cooled its enthusiasm for talks with Mr. Trump  or a convenient excuse. But what is clear is that these types of drills  infuriate Pyongyang, year in, year out.</p><p>Paula Hancocks, CNN, Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Negotiations are reaching boiling points on the Iran  nuclear deal as nations that remain committed to the agreement meet for the  first time since President Trump decided to pull the U.S. out of that  agreement.</p><p>CNN's Fred Pleitgen is live in Vienna, Austria for us right now. Fred, even  if they are all on the same page as far as the deal is concerned, time is  definitely running out, right, to keep it afloat in its current form?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, I think  you're absolutely right, Hannah. I think time is absolutely running out.  That is simply something that a senior Iranian official told us earlier  today.</p><p>[08:34:58]  The Iranians are saying they want especially the European  country to put together a package of measures to offset the United States  leaving the nuclear agreement.</p><p>That means that they not only want to have, for instance, the sanctions  relief that they had before. They want European companies to be able to  invest in Iran without having to fear retribution from the United States.  They want to be able to sell their oil, continue to sell their oil on  international market.</p><p>But in addition to that, they also want other measures to make sure that  they get the benefits that they would have gotten if the U.S. had stayed in  the agreement even after the U.S. moves out. The Iranians were saying they  believe that the nuclear agreement has what they call two pillars. One of  them is obviously their nuclear dismantlement, the large part of their  nuclear program.</p><p>And then in return, they said, they were promised economic incentives. They  say so far they have not gotten them and now the JCPOA is in trouble. They  say a11 of that has gotten even worse. So, that's one of the things that  led this particular Iranian official to say that he is not very confident  that the deal can be kept.</p><p>The negotiations here behind me have been going on for a while. There was a  Russian delegate who walked out a couple of minutes ago and he said, so  far, at least all sides are still talking. They are trying to find a way  forward.</p><p>So these things haven't completely fallen apart but there is no doubt that  it is going to be very, very difficult to keep the nuclear agreement intact  in light of the fact that the U.S. is out and is threatening European  companies especially that there might be sanctions if they deal with Iran  in the future, Hannah.</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Yeah. One wonders (ph) what the U.S. is making of these  negotiations taking place across the Atlantic and it not being a part of  those negotiations.</p><p>PLEITGEN:  Well, the U.S. has essentially left the deal and so therefore  they wouldn't be part of these negotiations. I think that is something that  all sides that remain in the deal do agree on. On the other hand, of course  they are highly skeptical and critical of these negotiations still going  on.</p><p>The United States government has come out. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  has come out and said, look, the Europeans need to pull their businesses  out of Iran. He said they are willing to listen to European concerns.  However, the Americans have a very clear, very strict and hard line  position on this issue.</p><p>So, it is very difficult especially for the European nations who have so  much trade (ph) and were strong allies of the United States to try and see  this whole thing through and try to keep the deal intact.</p><p>It is something that they are trying at this point. But again, if you look  at the delegates, you speak to folks here on the ground, none of them seem  overly optimistic that that is something that can be done.</p><p>Certainly they do say it is something that is difficult even though all of  them are saying they do still remain committed to trying to save this deal  and to trying to keep the provisions of this deal in the future as well,  Hannah.</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Fred Pleitgen live for us in Vienna, Austria where it is  the middle of the afternoon at the moment. Fred, thank you.</p><p>Still ahead on \"News Stream,\" why the collapse of the U.S.-North Korea  summit did not surprise everyone, especially those familiar with Donald  Trump's book, \"The Art of the Deal.\" Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" President Trump's decision  to cancel his summit on June 12 with the North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un  may have taken some people -- many people by surprise, but not those who  have followed Mr. Trump throughout his career.</p><p>In fact, some say it is a classic mood straight out from the bestseller he  co-wrote, \"The Art of the Deal.\" CNN's Brian Todd has this report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:40:00]  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:   Nobody should be anxious. We have to get it right.</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump walks away from what could  have been the deal of a lifetime. A letter to his Excellency, Kim Jong-un,  terminating their planned summit, citing Kim's, quote, open hostility in a  recent North Korean statement.</p><p>A letter from Trump touting America's nuclear might, a letter that analysts  say is extraordinary for personal nature.</p><p>RYAN HASS, FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER:  It is unusual that the president would  use threats of nuclear weapons in communication with a foreign counterpart.  It is unusual that the president would use, I and you and such  personalization.</p><p>TODD:  But according to his biographers, not unusual for Donald Trump. They  say the build up to a summit, the teams, and then the walk back is classic  Trump, a tactic he used to build his real estate empire.</p><p>MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  The president's art of the deal  strategy has always been to first ask for the world and intend to settle  for half of it and also be able to stake any position out in a course of  negotiations. So the notion of walking away is something that he had always  advocated. He has said that you should never enter a negotiation wanting  something too much.</p><p>TODD:  For decades, Donald Trump has sold himself to potential business  associates and then to voters on his ability to strike deals with difficult  partners like Kim Jong-un.</p><p>TRUMP:  With deals, that is what I do is deals.</p><p>I make good deals. You know, it's a talent. It's a talent, you can't be a  politician.</p><p>TODD:  Now in his letter to Kim, Trump says he is pulling out because of  the quote, anger and open hostility in North Korea's most recent statement,  where they called Vice President Pence a political dummy. Trump biographer  Michael D'Antonio isn't buying that explanation.</p><p>D'ANTONIO:  This after all, it's a situation where Trump himself has been  insulted many times and he has traded barbs back. What we're really seeing  here is the president seizing an opportunity to get out of a situation  which I think he felt was not going his way.</p><p>TODD:  Another classic Trump move in deal breaking are taunt. Trump tells  Kim, quote, you talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so  massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.</p><p>D'ANTONIO:  The taunting in the president's letter is one of those mine is  bigger than yours moments.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you think Kim Jong-un might react?</p><p>HASS:  Well, I think it raises the likelihood that Kim Jong-un will react  by resuming the verbal taunts that were so evident last fall. And to pay  (ph) upon where things go from there, there is a higher risk that we could  see a return of testing, either missile testing or perhaps nuclear testing.</p><p>TODD:  President Trump and senior administration officials now say the door  is not closed to the idea of a summit at a later date. Korean analyst say  for Kim Jong-un, that is going to mean swallowing his ego which may not be  likely any time soon. Can Trump swallow his ego to do it? Trump biographer  Michael D'Antonio says it is possible if it means Trump will get what he  wants, the world's approval and possibly a Nobel peace prize.</p><p>Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Finally, authorities in Hawaii are urging people to stay  away from areas where lava is oozing into the Pacific Ocean.

Welcome to \"News Stream.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> President Trump calls off the historic U.S.-North Korean summit but  Pyongyang says it is still willing to meet. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran nuclear deal in focus as E.U., Russian, Chinese, and Iranian officials  discuss ways to keep the deal alive. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Plus, disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein turns himself in to police in  New York. Sources say he has been arrested on rape charges.</p><p> Welcome to the program. We begin with the situation on the Korean  Peninsula. China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience  after landmark talks on North Korea's nuclear program were abruptly called  off. Donald Trump had agreed to meet Kim Jong-un in Singapore next month,  but the U.S. president cancelled. </p><p> In a letter, he cited recent hostile comments from the North Korean regime  as a reason for pulling out.  Officials in Pyongyang say Kim Jong-un is  ready to meet Mr. Trump at any time. The president says a meeting wouldn't  be appropriate right now, but he left the door open to future talks.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I hope that Kim Jong-un will  ultimately do what is right not only for himself but perhaps most  importantly what's right for his people who are suffering greatly and  needlessly. All of the Korean people, North and South, deserve to be able  to live together in harmony, prosperity, and peace. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JONES:  Well the latest from both sides of this debate now, Joe Johns is in  Washington for us. Matt Rivers is in Seoul, South Korea. Joe to you first,  is the White House still hopeful, expecting a meeting at all or just  washing its hands of Kim for the foreseeable? </p><p> JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hannah, it's pretty clear  that the White House here has left the door open I think that you said at  the very beginning. At the same time, they're being realistic about this  and there is some sentiment that a return to maximum sanctions might be in  order. </p><p> The problem with that of course is getting the international community to  go along particularly some of the countries in the region such as China as  well as South Korea. Those two countries, at least have been subject to  entreaties, if you will, from North Korea during this period, which creates  a question at least for some of the international partners about which of  the two parties that were involved in this summit that went down were in  fact holding the moral high ground, if you will. </p><p> In fact it was the President of the United States, it was the White House,  the administration that pulled out of this very important summit and not  North Korea so, a lot of thought going into this. The big question, of  course, can they return to maximum sanctions? It can be difficult, simply  because some of the countries that would have to go along might not. </p><p> JONES:  Let's bring in Matt Rivers. Matt is standing by for us in Seoul,  South Korea at the moment. Matt, I'm wondering if the North Koreans have  responded yet to this letter, responded formally at least. I mean, we  understand that they say they're still up for a summit at some point, but  is there any sign of any regret perhaps for some of the rhetoric, the  aggressive rhetoric news in recent days? </p><p> [08:05:01] MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Publicly, no. No  signs of regret at least at this point, Hannah. What we did get was a  statement from a high ranking official within North Korea's foreign  ministry. And in that statement, it said in part, we reiterate to the U.S.  that we are willing to sit face-to-face at any time and in any way. </p><p> And that is the only silver lining that many people here in South Korea are  looking at here. That and also the willingness of the president of the  United States to leave the door open for a future summit as well. Both  sides, the U.S. and North Korea seemingly willing to leave the door open  for a summit down the road. </p><p> And that's kind of been the only point of hope here in South Korea because  today, frankly, has been a day disappointment here especially for South  Korea's government, for President Moon Jae-in who put so much stock in this  summit, served as a middle man between North Korea and the United States. </p><p> There is deep disappointment that this summit did not happen and so the  only thing left at this point would be to hope that there is, well, that  they can put a lot of stock in the relatively measured statements that we  got both from the president of the U.S. as well as that statement from the  North Korean foreign ministry. </p><p> JONES:  Let's bring in Joe Johns again. Joe is still standing by for us in  Washington. Joe, you were talking at the end of your last answer there  about maximum pressure. What exactly does maximum pressure mean if that is  going to be the policy that the U.S. adopts now as far as Pyongyang is  concerned? </p><p> JOHNS:  Well, it certainly were means among other things, more economic  pressure on a country that has already worked its way through quite a bit  of economic pressure. It also means attempting to get China back on board.  Of course, as you know, China accounts for so much of North Korea's  economy, if you will. The administration has also talked, obviously, as we  heard, about keeping the military on high alert for anything that would  suggest hostility. </p><p> This, of course, can be perceived in that region as a threat from Donald  Trump and return, if you will, to some of the rhetoric that we heard  earlier in the Trump administration, very strident rhetoric which was seen,  I, think, around the world in many quarters as an escalation and bringing  the world one step closer to some very risky business, if you will, Hannah. </p><p> JONES:  All right, Joe, live for us in Washington. Matt also standing by in  Seoul. My thanks to you both. </p><p> Well, just hours before Donald Trump's announcement on that summit, North  Korea appeared to destroy tunnels and observation buildings at its nuclear  test site and in fact, our Will Ripley was there and broke the news then to  the North Koreans of President Trump's announcement. Will describes now the  long ride that he took to get there and that awkward moment. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We were on the way back from  the nuclear test site at Punggye-ri here to Wonsan when the news broke  overnight that President Trump has cancelled the upcoming summit in  Singapore. </p><p> It was incredibly awkward and uncomfortable to be on the train with North  Koreans after just witnessing the destruction of their nuclear test site at  Punggye-ri, something they had hoped would lead to substantial progress in  relations between the U.S. and North Korea. And instead the situation went  downhill.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two, one.</p><p> (EXPLOSION)</p><p> RIPLEY:  I'm here at North Korea's nuclear test site at Punggye-ri, a place  that foreign journalists have never been allowed before and we are here,  the North Korean government says, to witness the destruction of this site.  They say it will never be able to be used again. </p><p> (EXPLOSION)</p><p> RIPLEY (voice-over):  With each powerful explosion, the earth shakes. We  travel around 15 hours to get here. First by bus through the coastal city  of Wonsan. </p><p> Compartment seven, here we are. </p><p> Then, some 12 hours by train.</p><p> This is one of those moments where you blink and realize I'm having dinner  on a train going through North Korea. </p><p> A luxury ride by North Korean standards. </p><p> They just came through and they closed all the blinds and told us that for  the entire train ride, we can't film anything out the windows. We pull into  Punggye-ri station, then begin the nearly two-hour drive to the test site.  Once again, no filming along the way. </p><p> We passed through a number of what look like small farming villages. There  was no sign of life, completely empty except for the handful of soldiers at  the guard posts along the way. </p><p> We get a briefing from the deputy director of North Korea's Nuclear Weapons  Institute. </p><p> [08:10:02] He won't tell us his name. Then, we're allowed to inspect the  tunnels. North Korea says they could have easily conducted more nuclear  tests here. They say two tunnels have never been used. </p><p> So they by rigging it with explosives and blowing it up that's a meaningful  step towards denuclearization. No nuclear weapons experts at our small  group, only journalists. </p><p> It's actually quite beautiful here, the North Koreans say that the  ecosystem hasn't been damaged by all of these nuclear test for more than a  decade. They say no radiation has seeped out. Journalists aren't allowed to  carry radiation detectors ourselves. They were taken away at the airport  so, we have to take their word for it. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation):  The dismantling of the nuclear  test grounds conducted with high level of transparency has clearly attested  once again to the proactive and peace-loving efforts of the government of  the DPRK. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RIPLEY:  You really do get the sense that you're witnessing history here,  which is why we're documenting every single building on this site because  by the end o the day it will all be gone. </p><p> We hike to an observation post built just for us and watch Punggye-ri go up  in smoke.</p><p> (EXPLOSION)</p><p> RIPLEY:  The official statement from North Korea's ministry of foreign  affairs indicates that Pyongyang is still interested in a dialogue with  Washington. They say they are ready to talk with President Trump at  anytime. They say dialogue between the two countries is crucial to improve  the situation on the Peninsula. </p><p> And they say that the nuclear test site destruction was, in their words, a  meaningful transparent step towards denuclearization. A sign of goodwill  ahead of any potential talks with the United States. Will Ripley, CNN,  Wonsan, North Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JONES:  Will, thanks very much. Let's bring in Barbara Demick (inaudible)  for us. Barbara is the former Beijing and Seoul bureau chief for the \"L.A.  Times\" and she has written a book called North Korea titled, \"Nothing to  Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea.\" She joins us from New York via Skype.  Barbara, great to have you on. </p><p> And with no summit in sight at the moment then, it seems that the U.S.  policy is going to be applying maximum pressure on North Korea, the impact  of which presumably trickle straight down and hurts the ordinary people in  North Korea that you've written about. </p><p> BARBARA DEMICK, FORMER BEIJING AND SEOUL BUREAU CHIEF, L.A. TIMES:  That's  exactly right. And these -- we've had this discussion before, but sanctions  tend to hurt the ordinary North Koreans who over the years have been very  dependent on international food aid, medical aid, and you know, I've heard  from a lot o4 people in the NGO community that they can't get in x-ray  machines for TB patients, very difficult to get in medicines. </p><p> It really is unfortunate I would guess, had I been, you know, talking to  people in North Korea that they were really hopeful there would have been a  breakthrough and I think they're the ones who are most directly affected. </p><p> JONES:  Yes, well, I mean the main players though in all of this of course,  they force their geopolitical format. There's been a lot of talk about  China in all of this. Let's ask you about that given your experience in the  region. Some people said that China sidelined by not being involved in this  summit were its go ahead not being at the table as well. Donald Trump seems  to be almost blaming China as well for the fact that the summit hasn't  happened. What are your thoughts on that? </p><p> DEMICK:  I think China is in a very complicated role, you know, publicly  they've cheered on the summit saying they're here to facilitate, but I  think they were very fearful of being sidelined  by the North Koreans and  the U.S. I mean, there's a very delicate balance here and I think Beijing  is fearful of a situation like you have in Vietnam where a communist  country draws closer to the U.S. rather than to China.</p><p> And although it's rarely spoken by the main players in public, you know,  the North Koreans are also fearful of China. You know, one of the reasons  they've been developing this nuclear program is so that they don't need to  rely on China for their security and you know, strangely enough, you know,  I think the North Koreans when they said there is a deal that U.S. troops  can stay on the peninsula, what they were saying, although they were never  articulated, is that, you know, we're afraid of China too.</p><p> JONES:  Right.</p><p> DEMICK:  I don't think China wants, you know, a nuclear arms North Korea.  They don't want to dangerous neighbor, but I don't think they really want a  peace treat with the U.S. that doesn't involve them. </p><p> JONES:  It does seem that both sides though are still leaving the  possibility of some talks on the table at the moment. Can you foresee a  situation when potentially we would have not just Donald Trump and Kim  Jong-un, but also have Moon Jae-in and also Xi Jinping as well so we have  four-party talks instead of just the two? </p><p> [08:15:02] DEMICK:  Well, you remember we've had, for many years six-party  talks that's included Japan and Russia. I think we could return to a multi- party situation, but I know -- I think that, you know, there were so much  momentum and energy going into this summit and everybody was so excited,  and I think, you know, that the wind has been taken out of those sails and  I'm not really hopeful over that big breakthrough. I think many of us are  kind of disappointed.</p><p> JONES:  While we wait to see. Barbara Demick, we appreciate your analysis.  Thank you.</p><p> DEMICK:  Thank you.</p><p> JONES:  Now, the U.S. film producer, Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on  sexual assault charges by police in New York. That is according to a CNN  source. He did turn himself in to a police station a short time ago and  will face court itself for the next few hours. The source has told CNN that  Weinstein will be charged with raping one woman and forcing another to  perform oral sex on him.</p><p> There has been a flood, of course, of accusations against the producer and  they were the trigger for women around the world to come forward with  accounts of sexual harassments and abuse at the hands of powerful men.  Those pictures from not too long ago of Harvey Weinstein. Let's get the  very latest then from New York. CNN's Brynn Gingras is there for us righ  now. This remind us, Brynn, of the background to this case and of course  the fact that Harvey Weinstein (inaudible) himself, while he has turned  himself in, as far as I understand, denies all the accusations against him? </p><p> BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, he still is. And we're expecting  to hear from his attorney likely after court proceedings later this  morning, but yes, of course we know about how big, how global this case has  gone. When that \"New Yorker\" article revealed some names of people who made  strong accusations against Harvey Weinstein, I can tell you from a source  that the NYPD began investigating immediately. </p><p> So this is a very dear investigation to the NYPD as they have been working  on it for months, and today finally, the first criminal charges are going  to be filed in the case. But I can tell you here it's a busy (inaudible)  here in Tribeca in Manhattan. We have tons of media out here because inside  that precinct house behind me is Harvey Weinstein. He is officially under  arrest. </p><p> That means that he has taken a booking photo. That means he's been  fingerprinted and soon he's going to head back out those doors and head  right to court. And that's where he's going to face charges of a criminal  sex act as well as rape and we're expecting his bond, Hannah, to be set at  $2 million, Hannah.</p><p> JONES:  And when we look ahead to any kind of future trial as well, this  would obviously have a huge amount of attention from around the world,  given the fact that he is so prominent in Hollywood as well. What kind of  time frame are we looking at for a trial? </p><p> GINGRAS:  You know, that's always up in the air, right? But here's the  thing. Like I said, this is the first criminal charges to be file. We are  expecting more to come. This was just the first. We know that there are  investigations still happening in Los Angeles. We know investigations in  London, and we also know that there's a federal probe here in New York City  that's happening as well as a current grand jury has been convened and  continues to listen to testimonies from at least four women in this case.  So, we do expect more charges to be filed to both of these cases. So, it's  a long way, but this is just the beginning it seems for Harvey Weinstein. </p><p> JONES:  Brynn, thanks so much indeed. Brynn's live there for us in New  York. </p><p> Now, Europe's new data privacy law is just a few hours old and Facebook and  Google are already in trouble for allegedly trying to skirt the rules. More  on that coming up.</p><p> [08:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> JONES:  Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" Europe's sweeping data protection  regulation goes into effect this Friday. CNN has learned separate lawsuits  have already been filed against Facebook, Google, WhatsApp and Instagram,  alleging that the companies are failing to comply. </p><p> Testifying in front of E.U. leaders on Tuesday, Facebook CEO Mark  Zuckerberg insisted his company would follow the new rules. But out Samuel  Burke now reports legal experts believe Facebook is already violating the  new law. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer,  Max Schrems has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for  nearly a decade. And today he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook  for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law called GDPR the  day it came into force.</p><p> MAX SCHREMS, LAWYER:  We were looking for big companies that really  willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and trying to get  away with it.</p><p> BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulation says he's taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p> SCHREMS:  (Inaudible) this idea if we don't want this, we think it's stupid  so we don't want to comply with it. And there are no obvious business  interests. There are certain things you simply can do with data anymore  that give a profit. </p><p> BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent. According to legal  experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MICHAEL VEALE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY EXPERT, UNIVESITY OF LONDON:  On your  Facebook profile, you can pretend things like sexuality, religion or  political beliefs, and if you put that on, you don't have any choice but  for Facebook to use it to personalize content to every advertising and so  on.</p><p> BURKE:  There's only an \"I accept\" button. </p><p> VEALE:  Exactly. </p><p> BURKE:  There's not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p> VEALE:  Exactly, you got to --</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your  profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites too. </p><p> VEALE:  Facebook can infer from the great amount of data it has about you  across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send  data to Facebook.</p><p> BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making  these inferences that they make about us?</p><p> VEALE:  Yes. That law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without  explicit consent.</p><p> BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook.  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to four percent of its  global annual revenue. Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could  face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p> In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer said that company  has, quote, introduced better tools for people to access, download and  delete their information. The company also says it's building a new tool  that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them,  it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BURKE:  Lawyer Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent  the kind of data scrapping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have  engaged in. </p><p> SCHREMS:  If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in  this digitalized age. In the end, you as a customer have the possibility to  use let's say Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data. </p><p> BURKE:  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already re-drawing the line between profit and privacies.  Samuel Burke, CNN, London. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JONES:  The new rules have very strict wording but what happens if there  really are violations. Our Kristie Lu Stout asked Vera Jourova, the  European justice (inaudible) if the E.U. is ready to enforce these new  rules.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [08:25:00] VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN JUSTICE COMMISSIONER:  Of course, we made  it very serious that we will enforce the GDPR rules because they bring the  necessary better protection for the citizens to have their privacy better  protected. And that's why we count with the enforcement of the rules. We  have a network of data protection authorities in all the member state and  they will pay due attention to all possible breaches. </p><p> KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM HOST:  A question about Facebook because  we know that Mark Zuckerberg was just in Brussel earlier this week. Did the  European Union get the sense that Facebook is not only willing to comply  with GDPR, but willing to self-regulate so that the E.U. won't find itself  in a position to pass more laws to protect data privacy?</p><p> JOUROVA:  Well, we heard the replies of Mr. Zuckerberg. He said that he can  guarantee that Facebook will be fully compliant with the strict European  rules. I have no reason not to believe him at this stage, but of course it  will be under a very strict control, as I said, from (inaudible) to  protection authorities and Facebook will belong to the companies where we  will pay full attention to because the volume of data they are harvesting  in the E.U., the data from Europeans is extremely big and that's why the  risk is also rather big.</p><p> LU STOUT:  OK, so far we've talked about GDPR and what it means for  companies. Let's talk about consumers and a possible consumer backlash  because the number of consumers out there who like data mining, who say  that it allows them to have a very comfortable online experience, a  seamless experience that is tailored just for them. How do you appeal to  those digital users to embrace GDPR and what it represents?</p><p> JOUROVA:  Well, that's a crucial thing that the people, as you say, the  consumers understand that they have the rights fully in place. They have  fully under their control with what's happening to their private data and  that they should be more aware of the possibilities which GDPR gives them.  </p><p> For instance, to give well informed consent to using of the private data  but also to say no, we do not want to be in the system and for instance in  Facebook. We do not want to discourage the people from using online route  and social media. We just want them to be safer.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> JONES:  The E.U. justice commissioner there with our Kristie Lu Stout.</p><p> Now, a military drill that was slammed by Pyongyang. We have exclusive  footage from Max Thunder, the joint exercise between the U.S. and South  Korea.</p><p> [08:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> JONES:  Welcome back. I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones in London. You are watching  \"News Stream\" and these are your world headlines.</p><p> China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience after Donald  Trump after Donald Trump pulled out to a planned meeting with his North  Korean counterpart.</p><p> Meanwhile, just moments ago, Donald Trump tweeted the following: Very good  news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will  soon see where it will leads. Hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and  peace. Only time and talent will tell. Trump reacting there to a statement  from the North Koreans, saying that they will keep a big and open mind.</p><p> People in Ireland are voting on a referendum that could overturn the  country's strict abortion law. They are deciding whether to repeal the  Eight Amendment which recognizes the right to life of the unborn child as  being equal to the mother. It is a repeal parliament is expected to pass  legislation allowing abortion early in pregnancy.</p><p> Canadian police are on the hunt for these two men who they say set off an  improvised explosive device in suburban Toronto. The explosion happened  inside an Indian restaurant. Fifteen people were wounded, three of them  critically. The suspect then fled the scene.</p><p>U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on rape charges by  police in New York. That is according to a CNN source. He turned himself in  at a police station a short time ago and will be facing court in the next  few hours. Weinstein has denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.</p><p> Now, Washington's decision to scrap the summit with Pyongyang is likely to  be felt most acutely in South Korea. The country just finished holding an  annual joint military drill with the U.S. CNN's Paula Hancocks was able to  film the exercise exclusively. The footage embargoed until the drill ended  on Friday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Loading missiles on an F- 16 fighter jet, ready for a mission against an imaginary threat, an  imaginary enemy. This is Max Thunder, an annual joint air force drill  between the U.S. and South Korea, the same military drills that North Korea  slammed 10 days ago as the turning point in warming relations with the  South and the U.S.</p><p> CNN was able to film the exercise exclusively, which had been embargoed  until the drill ended Friday.</p><p> DAVID SHOEMAKER, COMMANDER, 8TH FIGHTER WING:  While the situation in the  background has changed over the years as we've flown Max Thunder, the  exercise itself is still there for the same reason, and that is the  tactical level and operability learning to fight together as an alliance.</p><p> HANCOCKS:  Pyongyang canceled high level talks with South Korea because of  this drill, calling it, quote, an intentional military provocation. The  first of many recent bumps in the road to a historic summit between the  U.S. and North Korean leaders that U.S. President Donald Trump has just  canceled. But the mood is still far less tense than this time last year.</p><p> The situation on the Korean Peninsula right now really could not be more  different to how it was last year when this Max Thunder drills were last  held.</p><p> But for those involved in these military exercises, the pilots, the U.S.  Air Force, they say that the politics is irrelevant. The most important  thing despite that is to make sure that they are trained and ready for  anything.</p><p> Pyongyang's anger at these drills took Seoul and Washington by surprise. A  South Korean delegation who met with Kim Jong-un said that Kim said he  understood why joint drills had to take place.</p><p> South Korean president Moon Jae-in said in Washington this week he believe  the relations would be back on track once Max Thunder was over, according  to aides. But a lot has changed since then. It's unclear if this drill was  really the reason Pyongyang cooled its enthusiasm for talks with Mr. Trump  or a convenient excuse. But what is clear is that these types of drills  infuriate Pyongyang, year in, year out.</p><p> Paula Hancocks, CNN, Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> VAUGHAN JONES:  Negotiations are reaching boiling points on the Iran  nuclear deal as nations that remain committed to the agreement meet for the  first time since President Trump decided to pull the U.S. out of that  agreement.</p><p> CNN's Fred Pleitgen is live in Vienna, Austria for us right now. Fred, even  if they are all on the same page as far as the deal is concerned, time is  definitely running out, right, to keep it afloat in its current form?</p><p> FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, I think  you're absolutely right, Hannah. I think time is absolutely running out.  That is simply something that a senior Iranian official told us earlier  today.</p><p> [08:34:58]  The Iranians are saying they want especially the European  country to put together a package of measures to offset the United States  leaving the nuclear agreement.</p><p> That means that they not only want to have, for instance, the sanctions  relief that they had before. They want European companies to be able to  invest in Iran without having to fear retribution from the United States.  They want to be able to sell their oil, continue to sell their oil on  international market.</p><p> But in addition to that, they also want other measures to make sure that  they get the benefits that they would have gotten if the U.S. had stayed in  the agreement even after the U.S. moves out. The Iranians were saying they  believe that the nuclear agreement has what they call two pillars. One of  them is obviously their nuclear dismantlement, the large part of their  nuclear program.</p><p> And then in return, they said, they were promised economic incentives. They  say so far they have not gotten them and now the JCPOA is in trouble. They  say a11 of that has gotten even worse. So, that's one of the things that  led this particular Iranian official to say that he is not very confident  that the deal can be kept.</p><p> The negotiations here behind me have been going on for a while. There was a  Russian delegate who walked out a couple of minutes ago and he said, so  far, at least all sides are still talking. They are trying to find a way  forward.</p><p> So these things haven't completely fallen apart but there is no doubt that  it is going to be very, very difficult to keep the nuclear agreement intact  in light of the fact that the U.S. is out and is threatening European  companies especially that there might be sanctions if they deal with Iran  in the future, Hannah.</p><p> VAUGHAN JONES:  Yeah. One wonders (ph) what the U.S. is making of these  negotiations taking place across the Atlantic and it not being a part of  those negotiations.</p><p> PLEITGEN:  Well, the U.S. has essentially left the deal and so therefore  they wouldn't be part of these negotiations. I think that is something that  all sides that remain in the deal do agree on. On the other hand, of course  they are highly skeptical and critical of these negotiations still going  on.</p><p> The United States government has come out. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  has come out and said, look, the Europeans need to pull their businesses  out of Iran. He said they are willing to listen to European concerns.  However, the Americans have a very clear, very strict and hard line  position on this issue.</p><p> So, it is very difficult especially for the European nations who have so  much trade (ph) and were strong allies of the United States to try and see  this whole thing through and try to keep the deal intact.</p><p> It is something that they are trying at this point. But again, if you look  at the delegates, you speak to folks here on the ground, none of them seem  overly optimistic that that is something that can be done.</p><p> Certainly they do say it is something that is difficult even though all of  them are saying they do still remain committed to trying to save this deal  and to trying to keep the provisions of this deal in the future as well,  Hannah.</p><p> VAUGHAN JONES:  Fred Pleitgen live for us in Vienna, Austria where it is  the middle of the afternoon at the moment. Fred, thank you.</p><p> Still ahead on \"News Stream,\" why the collapse of the U.S.-North Korea  summit did not surprise everyone, especially those familiar with Donald  Trump's book, \"The Art of the Deal.\" Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> VAUGHAN JONES:  Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" President Trump's decision  to cancel his summit on June 12 with the North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un  may have taken some people -- many people by surprise, but not those who  have followed Mr. Trump throughout his career.</p><p> In fact, some say it is a classic mood straight out from the bestseller he  co-wrote, \"The Art of the Deal.\" CNN's Brian Todd has this report.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [08:40:00]  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:   Nobody should be anxious. We have to get it right.</p><p> BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump walks away from what could  have been the deal of a lifetime. A letter to his Excellency, Kim Jong-un,  terminating their planned summit, citing Kim's, quote, open hostility in a  recent North Korean statement.</p><p> A letter from Trump touting America's nuclear might, a letter that analysts  say is extraordinary for personal nature.</p><p> RYAN HASS, FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER:  It is unusual that the president would  use threats of nuclear weapons in communication with a foreign counterpart.  It is unusual that the president would use, I and you and such  personalization.</p><p> TODD:  But according to his biographers, not unusual for Donald Trump. They  say the build up to a summit, the teams, and then the walk back is classic  Trump, a tactic he used to build his real estate empire.</p><p> MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  The president's art of the deal  strategy has always been to first ask for the world and intend to settle  for half of it and also be able to stake any position out in a course of  negotiations. So the notion of walking away is something that he had always  advocated. He has said that you should never enter a negotiation wanting  something too much.</p><p> TODD:  For decades, Donald Trump has sold himself to potential business  associates and then to voters on his ability to strike deals with difficult  partners like Kim Jong-un.</p><p> TRUMP:  With deals, that is what I do is deals.</p><p> I make good deals. You know, it's a talent. It's a talent, you can't be a  politician.</p><p> TODD:  Now in his letter to Kim, Trump says he is pulling out because of  the quote, anger and open hostility in North Korea's most recent statement,  where they called Vice President Pence a political dummy. Trump biographer  Michael D'Antonio isn't buying that explanation.</p><p> D'ANTONIO:  This after all, it's a situation where Trump himself has been  insulted many times and he has traded barbs back. What we're really seeing  here is the president seizing an opportunity to get out of a situation  which I think he felt was not going his way.</p><p> TODD:  Another classic Trump move in deal breaking are taunt. Trump tells  Kim, quote, you talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so  massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.</p><p> D'ANTONIO:  The taunting in the president's letter is one of those mine is  bigger than yours moments.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you think Kim Jong-un might react?</p><p> HASS:  Well, I think it raises the likelihood that Kim Jong-un will react  by resuming the verbal taunts that were so evident last fall. And to pay  (ph) upon where things go from there, there is a higher risk that we could  see a return of testing, either missile testing or perhaps nuclear testing.</p><p> TODD:  President Trump and senior administration officials now say the door  is not closed to the idea of a summit at a later date. Korean analyst say  for Kim Jong-un, that is going to mean swallowing his ego which may not be  likely any time soon. Can Trump swallow his ego to do it? Trump biographer  Michael D'Antonio says it is possible if it means Trump will get what he  wants, the world's approval and possibly a Nobel peace prize.</p><p> Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> VAUGHAN JONES:  Finally, authorities in Hawaii are urging people to stay  away from areas where lava is oozing into the Pacific Ocean. You are  looking now at live pictures of the molten rocks spewing from a fissure.  United States geological survey scientist says two to three of volcano's  main lava channels have now merged to create two entry points into the  ocean.</p><p> When it hits the water, it sends hydrochloric acid and volcanic glass  particles into the air. We will continue here at CNN to bring you the  latest on this incredible but of course very dangerous natural disaster.</p><p> And that is \"News Stream.\" I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones live in London for you.  \"World Sport\" with Christina Macfarlane is coming up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [08:45:00]  (WORLD SPORT)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Welcome to \"News Stream.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump calls off the historic U.S.-North Korean summit but  Pyongyang says it is still willing to meet. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran nuclear deal in focus as E.U., Russian, Chinese, and Iranian officials  discuss ways to keep the deal alive. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein turns himself in to police in  New York. Sources say he has been arrested on rape charges.</p><p>Welcome to the program. We begin with the situation on the Korean  Peninsula. China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience  after landmark talks on North Korea's nuclear program were abruptly called  off. Donald Trump had agreed to meet Kim Jong-un in Singapore next month,  but the U.S. president cancelled. </p><p>In a letter, he cited recent hostile comments from the North Korean regime  as a reason for pulling out.  Officials in Pyongyang say Kim Jong-un is  ready to meet Mr. Trump at any time. The president says a meeting wouldn't  be appropriate right now, but he left the door open to future talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I hope that Kim Jong-un will  ultimately do what is right not only for himself but perhaps most  importantly what's right for his people who are suffering greatly and  needlessly. All of the Korean people, North and South, deserve to be able  to live together in harmony, prosperity, and peace. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES:  Well the latest from both sides of this debate now, Joe Johns is in  Washington for us. Matt Rivers is in Seoul, South Korea. Joe to you first,  is the White House still hopeful, expecting a meeting at all or just  washing its hands of Kim for the foreseeable? </p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hannah, it's pretty clear  that the White House here has left the door open I think that you said at  the very beginning. At the same time, they're being realistic about this  and there is some sentiment that a return to maximum sanctions might be in  order. </p><p>The problem with that of course is getting the international community to  go along particularly some of the countries in the region such as China as  well as South Korea. Those two countries, at least have been subject to  entreaties, if you will, from North Korea during this period, which creates  a question at least for some of the international partners about which of  the two parties that were involved in this summit that went down were in  fact holding the moral high ground, if you will. </p><p>In fact it was the President of the United States, it was the White House,  the administration that pulled out of this very important summit and not  North Korea so, a lot of thought going into this. The big question, of  course, can they return to maximum sanctions? It can be difficult, simply  because some of the countries that would have to go along might not. </p><p>JONES:  Let's bring in Matt Rivers. Matt is standing by for us in Seoul,  South Korea at the moment. Matt, I'm wondering if the North Koreans have  responded yet to this letter, responded formally at least. I mean, we  understand that they say they're still up for a summit at some point, but  is there any sign of any regret perhaps for some of the rhetoric, the  aggressive rhetoric news in recent days? </p><p>[08:05:01] MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Publicly, no. No  signs of regret at least at this point, Hannah. What we did get was a  statement from a high ranking official within North Korea's foreign  ministry. And in that statement, it said in part, we reiterate to the U.S.  that we are willing to sit face-to-face at any time and in any way. </p><p>And that is the only silver lining that many people here in South Korea are  looking at here. That and also the willingness of the president of the  United States to leave the door open for a future summit as well. Both  sides, the U.S. and North Korea seemingly willing to leave the door open  for a summit down the road. </p><p>And that's kind of been the only point of hope here in South Korea because  today, frankly, has been a day disappointment here especially for South  Korea's government, for President Moon Jae-in who put so much stock in this  summit, served as a middle man between North Korea and the United States. </p><p>There is deep disappointment that this summit did not happen and so the  only thing left at this point would be to hope that there is, well, that  they can put a lot of stock in the relatively measured statements that we  got both from the president of the U.S. as well as that statement from the  North Korean foreign ministry. </p><p>JONES:  Let's bring in Joe Johns again. Joe is still standing by for us in  Washington. Joe, you were talking at the end of your last answer there  about maximum pressure. What exactly does maximum pressure mean if that is  going to be the policy that the U.S. adopts now as far as Pyongyang is  concerned? </p><p>JOHNS:  Well, it certainly were means among other things, more economic  pressure on a country that has already worked its way through quite a bit  of economic pressure. It also means attempting to get China back on board.  Of course, as you know, China accounts for so much of North Korea's  economy, if you will. The administration has also talked, obviously, as we  heard, about keeping the military on high alert for anything that would  suggest hostility. </p><p>This, of course, can be perceived in that region as a threat from Donald  Trump and return, if you will, to some of the rhetoric that we heard  earlier in the Trump administration, very strident rhetoric which was seen,  I, think, around the world in many quarters as an escalation and bringing  the world one step closer to some very risky business, if you will, Hannah. </p><p>JONES:  All right, Joe, live for us in Washington. Matt also standing by in  Seoul. My thanks to you both. </p><p>Well, just hours before Donald Trump's announcement on that summit, North  Korea appeared to destroy tunnels and observation buildings at its nuclear  test site and in fact, our Will Ripley was there and broke the news then to  the North Koreans of President Trump's announcement. Will describes now the  long ride that he took to get there and that awkward moment. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We were on the way back from  the nuclear test site at Punggye-ri here to Wonsan when the news broke  overnight that President Trump has cancelled the upcoming summit in  Singapore. </p><p>It was incredibly awkward and uncomfortable to be on the train with North  Koreans after just witnessing the destruction of their nuclear test site at  Punggye-ri, something they had hoped would lead to substantial progress in  relations between the U.S. and North Korea. And instead the situation went  downhill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two, one.</p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY:  I'm here at North Korea's nuclear test site at Punggye-ri, a place  that foreign journalists have never been allowed before and we are here,  the North Korean government says, to witness the destruction of this site.  They say it will never be able to be used again. </p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY (voice-over):  With each powerful explosion, the earth shakes. We  travel around 15 hours to get here. First by bus through the coastal city  of Wonsan. </p><p>Compartment seven, here we are. </p><p>Then, some 12 hours by train.</p><p>This is one of those moments where you blink and realize I'm having dinner  on a train going through North Korea. </p><p>A luxury ride by North Korean standards. </p><p>They just came through and they closed all the blinds and told us that for  the entire train ride, we can't film anything out the windows. We pull into  Punggye-ri station, then begin the nearly two-hour drive to the test site.  Once again, no filming along the way. </p><p>We passed through a number of what look like small farming villages. There  was no sign of life, completely empty except for the handful of soldiers at  the guard posts along the way. </p><p>We get a briefing from the deputy director of North Korea's Nuclear Weapons  Institute. </p><p>[08:10:02] He won't tell us his name. Then, we're allowed to inspect the  tunnels. North Korea says they could have easily conducted more nuclear  tests here. They say two tunnels have never been used. </p><p>So they by rigging it with explosives and blowing it up that's a meaningful  step towards denuclearization. No nuclear weapons experts at our small  group, only journalists. </p><p>It's actually quite beautiful here, the North Koreans say that the  ecosystem hasn't been damaged by all of these nuclear test for more than a  decade. They say no radiation has seeped out. Journalists aren't allowed to  carry radiation detectors ourselves. They were taken away at the airport  so, we have to take their word for it. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation):  The dismantling of the nuclear  test grounds conducted with high level of transparency has clearly attested  once again to the proactive and peace-loving efforts of the government of  the DPRK. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY:  You really do get the sense that you're witnessing history here,  which is why we're documenting every single building on this site because  by the end o the day it will all be gone. </p><p>We hike to an observation post built just for us and watch Punggye-ri go up  in smoke.</p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY:  The official statement from North Korea's ministry of foreign  affairs indicates that Pyongyang is still interested in a dialogue with  Washington. They say they are ready to talk with President Trump at  anytime. They say dialogue between the two countries is crucial to improve  the situation on the Peninsula. </p><p>And they say that the nuclear test site destruction was, in their words, a  meaningful transparent step towards denuclearization. A sign of goodwill  ahead of any potential talks with the United States. Will Ripley, CNN,  Wonsan, North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  Will, thanks very much. Let's bring in Barbara Demick (inaudible)  for us. Barbara is the former Beijing and Seoul bureau chief for the \"L.A.  Times\" and she has written a book called North Korea titled, \"Nothing to  Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea.\" She joins us from New York via Skype.  Barbara, great to have you on. </p><p>And with no summit in sight at the moment then, it seems that the U.S.  policy is going to be applying maximum pressure on North Korea, the impact  of which presumably trickle straight down and hurts the ordinary people in  North Korea that you've written about. </p><p>BARBARA DEMICK, FORMER BEIJING AND SEOUL BUREAU CHIEF, L.A. TIMES:  That's  exactly right. And these -- we've had this discussion before, but sanctions  tend to hurt the ordinary North Koreans who over the years have been very  dependent on international food aid, medical aid, and you know, I've heard  from a lot o4 people in the NGO community that they can't get in x-ray  machines for TB patients, very difficult to get in medicines. </p><p>It really is unfortunate I would guess, had I been, you know, talking to  people in North Korea that they were really hopeful there would have been a  breakthrough and I think they're the ones who are most directly affected. </p><p>JONES:  Yes, well, I mean the main players though in all of this of course,  they force their geopolitical format. There's been a lot of talk about  China in all of this. Let's ask you about that given your experience in the  region. Some people said that China sidelined by not being involved in this  summit were its go ahead not being at the table as well. Donald Trump seems  to be almost blaming China as well for the fact that the summit hasn't  happened. What are your thoughts on that? </p><p>DEMICK:  I think China is in a very complicated role, you know, publicly  they've cheered on the summit saying they're here to facilitate, but I  think they were very fearful of being sidelined  by the North Koreans and  the U.S. I mean, there's a very delicate balance here and I think Beijing  is fearful of a situation like you have in Vietnam where a communist  country draws closer to the U.S. rather than to China.</p><p>And although it's rarely spoken by the main players in public, you know,  the North Koreans are also fearful of China. You know, one of the reasons  they've been developing this nuclear program is so that they don't need to  rely on China for their security and you know, strangely enough, you know,  I think the North Koreans when they said there is a deal that U.S. troops  can stay on the peninsula, what they were saying, although they were never  articulated, is that, you know, we're afraid of China too.</p><p>JONES:  Right.</p><p>DEMICK:  I don't think China wants, you know, a nuclear arms North Korea.  They don't want to dangerous neighbor, but I don't think they really want a  peace treat with the U.S. that doesn't involve them. </p><p>JONES:  It does seem that both sides though are still leaving the  possibility of some talks on the table at the moment. Can you foresee a  situation when potentially we would have not just Donald Trump and Kim  Jong-un, but also have Moon Jae-in and also Xi Jinping as well so we have  four-party talks instead of just the two? </p><p>[08:15:02] DEMICK:  Well, you remember we've had, for many years six-party  talks that's included Japan and Russia. I think we could return to a multi- party situation, but I know -- I think that, you know, there were so much  momentum and energy going into this summit and everybody was so excited,  and I think, you know, that the wind has been taken out of those sails and  I'm not really hopeful over that big breakthrough. I think many of us are  kind of disappointed.</p><p>JONES:  While we wait to see. Barbara Demick, we appreciate your analysis.  Thank you.</p><p>DEMICK:  Thank you.</p><p>JONES:  Now, the U.S. film producer, Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on  sexual assault charges by police in New York. That is according to a CNN  source. He did turn himself in to a police station a short time ago and  will face court itself for the next few hours. The source has told CNN that  Weinstein will be charged with raping one woman and forcing another to  perform oral sex on him.</p><p>There has been a flood, of course, of accusations against the producer and  they were the trigger for women around the world to come forward with  accounts of sexual harassments and abuse at the hands of powerful men.  Those pictures from not too long ago of Harvey Weinstein. Let's get the  very latest then from New York. CNN's Brynn Gingras is there for us righ  now. This remind us, Brynn, of the background to this case and of course  the fact that Harvey Weinstein (inaudible) himself, while he has turned  himself in, as far as I understand, denies all the accusations against him? </p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, he still is. And we're expecting  to hear from his attorney likely after court proceedings later this  morning, but yes, of course we know about how big, how global this case has  gone. When that \"New Yorker\" article revealed some names of people who made  strong accusations against Harvey Weinstein, I can tell you from a source  that the NYPD began investigating immediately. </p><p>So this is a very dear investigation to the NYPD as they have been working  on it for months, and today finally, the first criminal charges are going  to be filed in the case. But I can tell you here it's a busy (inaudible)  here in Tribeca in Manhattan. We have tons of media out here because inside  that precinct house behind me is Harvey Weinstein. He is officially under  arrest. </p><p>That means that he has taken a booking photo. That means he's been  fingerprinted and soon he's going to head back out those doors and head  right to court. And that's where he's going to face charges of a criminal  sex act as well as rape and we're expecting his bond, Hannah, to be set at  $2 million, Hannah.</p><p>JONES:  And when we look ahead to any kind of future trial as well, this  would obviously have a huge amount of attention from around the world,  given the fact that he is so prominent in Hollywood as well. What kind of  time frame are we looking at for a trial? </p><p>GINGRAS:  You know, that's always up in the air, right? But here's the  thing. Like I said, this is the first criminal charges to be file. We are  expecting more to come. This was just the first. We know that there are  investigations still happening in Los Angeles. We know investigations in  London, and we also know that there's a federal probe here in New York City  that's happening as well as a current grand jury has been convened and  continues to listen to testimonies from at least four women in this case.  So, we do expect more charges to be filed to both of these cases. So, it's  a long way, but this is just the beginning it seems for Harvey Weinstein. </p><p>JONES:  Brynn, thanks so much indeed. Brynn's live there for us in New  York. </p><p>Now, Europe's new data privacy law is just a few hours old and Facebook and  Google are already in trouble for allegedly trying to skirt the rules. More  on that coming up.</p><p>[08:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES:  Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" Europe's sweeping data protection  regulation goes into effect this Friday. CNN has learned separate lawsuits  have already been filed against Facebook, Google, WhatsApp and Instagram,  alleging that the companies are failing to comply. </p><p>Testifying in front of E.U. leaders on Tuesday, Facebook CEO Mark  Zuckerberg insisted his company would follow the new rules. But out Samuel  Burke now reports legal experts believe Facebook is already violating the  new law. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer,  Max Schrems has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for  nearly a decade. And today he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook  for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law called GDPR the  day it came into force.</p><p>MAX SCHREMS, LAWYER:  We were looking for big companies that really  willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and trying to get  away with it.</p><p>BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulation says he's taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p>SCHREMS:  (Inaudible) this idea if we don't want this, we think it's stupid  so we don't want to comply with it. And there are no obvious business  interests. There are certain things you simply can do with data anymore  that give a profit. </p><p>BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent. According to legal  experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL VEALE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY EXPERT, UNIVESITY OF LONDON:  On your  Facebook profile, you can pretend things like sexuality, religion or  political beliefs, and if you put that on, you don't have any choice but  for Facebook to use it to personalize content to every advertising and so  on.</p><p>BURKE:  There's only an \"I accept\" button. </p><p>VEALE:  Exactly. </p><p>BURKE:  There's not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p>VEALE:  Exactly, you got to --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your  profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites too. </p><p>VEALE:  Facebook can infer from the great amount of data it has about you  across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send  data to Facebook.</p><p>BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making  these inferences that they make about us?</p><p>VEALE:  Yes. That law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without  explicit consent.</p><p>BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook.  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to four percent of its  global annual revenue. Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could  face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer said that company  has, quote, introduced better tools for people to access, download and  delete their information. The company also says it's building a new tool  that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them,  it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE:  Lawyer Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent  the kind of data scrapping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have  engaged in. </p><p>SCHREMS:  If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in  this digitalized age. In the end, you as a customer have the possibility to  use let's say Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data. </p><p>BURKE:  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already re-drawing the line between profit and privacies.  Samuel Burke, CNN, London. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  The new rules have very strict wording but what happens if there  really are violations. Our Kristie Lu Stout asked Vera Jourova, the  European justice (inaudible) if the E.U. is ready to enforce these new  rules.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:25:00] VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN JUSTICE COMMISSIONER:  Of course, we made  it very serious that we will enforce the GDPR rules because they bring the  necessary better protection for the citizens to have their privacy better  protected. And that's why we count with the enforcement of the rules. We  have a network of data protection authorities in all the member state and  they will pay due attention to all possible breaches. </p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM HOST:  A question about Facebook because  we know that Mark Zuckerberg was just in Brussel earlier this week. Did the  European Union get the sense that Facebook is not only willing to comply  with GDPR, but willing to self-regulate so that the E.U. won't find itself  in a position to pass more laws to protect data privacy?</p><p>JOUROVA:  Well, we heard the replies of Mr. Zuckerberg. He said that he can  guarantee that Facebook will be fully compliant with the strict European  rules. I have no reason not to believe him at this stage, but of course it  will be under a very strict control, as I said, from (inaudible) to  protection authorities and Facebook will belong to the companies where we  will pay full attention to because the volume of data they are harvesting  in the E.U., the data from Europeans is extremely big and that's why the  risk is also rather big.</p><p>LU STOUT:  OK, so far we've talked about GDPR and what it means for  companies. Let's talk about consumers and a possible consumer backlash  because the number of consumers out there who like data mining, who say  that it allows them to have a very comfortable online experience, a  seamless experience that is tailored just for them. How do you appeal to  those digital users to embrace GDPR and what it represents?</p><p>JOUROVA:  Well, that's a crucial thing that the people, as you say, the  consumers understand that they have the rights fully in place. They have  fully under their control with what's happening to their private data and  that they should be more aware of the possibilities which GDPR gives them.  </p><p>For instance, to give well informed consent to using of the private data  but also to say no, we do not want to be in the system and for instance in  Facebook. We do not want to discourage the people from using online route  and social media. We just want them to be safer.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  The E.U. justice commissioner there with our Kristie Lu Stout.</p><p>Now, a military drill that was slammed by Pyongyang. We have exclusive  footage from Max Thunder, the joint exercise between the U.S. and South  Korea.</p><p>[08:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES:  Welcome back. I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones in London. You are watching  \"News Stream\" and these are your world headlines.</p><p>China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience after Donald  Trump after Donald Trump pulled out to a planned meeting with his North  Korean counterpart.</p><p>Meanwhile, just moments ago, Donald Trump tweeted the following: Very good  news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will  soon see where it will leads. Hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and  peace. Only time and talent will tell. Trump reacting there to a statement  from the North Koreans, saying that they will keep a big and open mind.</p><p>People in Ireland are voting on a referendum that could overturn the  country's strict abortion law. They are deciding whether to repeal the  Eight Amendment which recognizes the right to life of the unborn child as  being equal to the mother. It is a repeal parliament is expected to pass  legislation allowing abortion early in pregnancy.</p><p>Canadian police are on the hunt for these two men who they say set off an  improvised explosive device in suburban Toronto. The explosion happened  inside an Indian restaurant. Fifteen people were wounded, three of them  critically. The suspect then fled the scene.</p><p>U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on rape charges by  police in New York. That is according to a CNN source. He turned himself in  at a police station a short time ago and will be facing court in the next  few hours. Weinstein has denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.</p><p>Now, Washington's decision to scrap the summit with Pyongyang is likely to  be felt most acutely in South Korea. The country just finished holding an  annual joint military drill with the U.S. CNN's Paula Hancocks was able to  film the exercise exclusively. The footage embargoed until the drill ended  on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Loading missiles on an F- 16 fighter jet, ready for a mission against an imaginary threat, an  imaginary enemy. This is Max Thunder, an annual joint air force drill  between the U.S. and South Korea, the same military drills that North Korea  slammed 10 days ago as the turning point in warming relations with the  South and the U.S.</p><p>CNN was able to film the exercise exclusively, which had been embargoed  until the drill ended Friday.</p><p>DAVID SHOEMAKER, COMMANDER, 8TH FIGHTER WING:  While the situation in the  background has changed over the years as we've flown Max Thunder, the  exercise itself is still there for the same reason, and that is the  tactical level and operability learning to fight together as an alliance.</p><p>HANCOCKS:  Pyongyang canceled high level talks with South Korea because of  this drill, calling it, quote, an intentional military provocation. The  first of many recent bumps in the road to a historic summit between the  U.S. and North Korean leaders that U.S. President Donald Trump has just  canceled. But the mood is still far less tense than this time last year.</p><p>The situation on the Korean Peninsula right now really could not be more  different to how it was last year when this Max Thunder drills were last  held.</p><p>But for those involved in these military exercises, the pilots, the U.S.  Air Force, they say that the politics is irrelevant. The most important  thing despite that is to make sure that they are trained and ready for  anything.</p><p>Pyongyang's anger at these drills took Seoul and Washington by surprise. A  South Korean delegation who met with Kim Jong-un said that Kim said he  understood why joint drills had to take place.</p><p>South Korean president Moon Jae-in said in Washington this week he believe  the relations would be back on track once Max Thunder was over, according  to aides. But a lot has changed since then. It's unclear if this drill was  really the reason Pyongyang cooled its enthusiasm for talks with Mr. Trump  or a convenient excuse. But what is clear is that these types of drills  infuriate Pyongyang, year in, year out.</p><p>Paula Hancocks, CNN, Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Negotiations are reaching boiling points on the Iran  nuclear deal as nations that remain committed to the agreement meet for the  first time since President Trump decided to pull the U.S. out of that  agreement.</p><p>CNN's Fred Pleitgen is live in Vienna, Austria for us right now. Fred, even  if they are all on the same page as far as the deal is concerned, time is  definitely running out, right, to keep it afloat in its current form?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, I think  you're absolutely right, Hannah. I think time is absolutely running out.  That is simply something that a senior Iranian official told us earlier  today.</p><p>[08:34:58]  The Iranians are saying they want especially the European  country to put together a package of measures to offset the United States  leaving the nuclear agreement.</p><p>That means that they not only want to have, for instance, the sanctions  relief that they had before. They want European companies to be able to  invest in Iran without having to fear retribution from the United States.  They want to be able to sell their oil, continue to sell their oil on  international market.</p><p>But in addition to that, they also want other measures to make sure that  they get the benefits that they would have gotten if the U.S. had stayed in  the agreement even after the U.S. moves out. The Iranians were saying they  believe that the nuclear agreement has what they call two pillars. One of  them is obviously their nuclear dismantlement, the large part of their  nuclear program.</p><p>And then in return, they said, they were promised economic incentives. They  say so far they have not gotten them and now the JCPOA is in trouble. They  say a11 of that has gotten even worse. So, that's one of the things that  led this particular Iranian official to say that he is not very confident  that the deal can be kept.</p><p>The negotiations here behind me have been going on for a while. There was a  Russian delegate who walked out a couple of minutes ago and he said, so  far, at least all sides are still talking. They are trying to find a way  forward.</p><p>So these things haven't completely fallen apart but there is no doubt that  it is going to be very, very difficult to keep the nuclear agreement intact  in light of the fact that the U.S. is out and is threatening European  companies especially that there might be sanctions if they deal with Iran  in the future, Hannah.</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Yeah. One wonders (ph) what the U.S. is making of these  negotiations taking place across the Atlantic and it not being a part of  those negotiations.</p><p>PLEITGEN:  Well, the U.S. has essentially left the deal and so therefore  they wouldn't be part of these negotiations. I think that is something that  all sides that remain in the deal do agree on. On the other hand, of course  they are highly skeptical and critical of these negotiations still going  on.</p><p>The United States government has come out. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  has come out and said, look, the Europeans need to pull their businesses  out of Iran. He said they are willing to listen to European concerns.  However, the Americans have a very clear, very strict and hard line  position on this issue.</p><p>So, it is very difficult especially for the European nations who have so  much trade (ph) and were strong allies of the United States to try and see  this whole thing through and try to keep the deal intact.</p><p>It is something that they are trying at this point. But again, if you look  at the delegates, you speak to folks here on the ground, none of them seem  overly optimistic that that is something that can be done.</p><p>Certainly they do say it is something that is difficult even though all of  them are saying they do still remain committed to trying to save this deal  and to trying to keep the provisions of this deal in the future as well,  Hannah.</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Fred Pleitgen live for us in Vienna, Austria where it is  the middle of the afternoon at the moment. Fred, thank you.</p><p>Still ahead on \"News Stream,\" why the collapse of the U.S.-North Korea  summit did not surprise everyone, especially those familiar with Donald  Trump's book, \"The Art of the Deal.\" Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" President Trump's decision  to cancel his summit on June 12 with the North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un  may have taken some people -- many people by surprise, but not those who  have followed Mr. Trump throughout his career.</p><p>In fact, some say it is a classic mood straight out from the bestseller he  co-wrote, \"The Art of the Deal.\" CNN's Brian Todd has this report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:40:00]  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:   Nobody should be anxious. We have to get it right.</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump walks away from what could  have been the deal of a lifetime. A letter to his Excellency, Kim Jong-un,  terminating their planned summit, citing Kim's, quote, open hostility in a  recent North Korean statement.</p><p>A letter from Trump touting America's nuclear might, a letter that analysts  say is extraordinary for personal nature.</p><p>RYAN HASS, FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER:  It is unusual that the president would  use threats of nuclear weapons in communication with a foreign counterpart.  It is unusual that the president would use, I and you and such  personalization.</p><p>TODD:  But according to his biographers, not unusual for Donald Trump. They  say the build up to a summit, the teams, and then the walk back is classic  Trump, a tactic he used to build his real estate empire.</p><p>MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  The president's art of the deal  strategy has always been to first ask for the world and intend to settle  for half of it and also be able to stake any position out in a course of  negotiations. So the notion of walking away is something that he had always  advocated. He has said that you should never enter a negotiation wanting  something too much.</p><p>TODD:  For decades, Donald Trump has sold himself to potential business  associates and then to voters on his ability to strike deals with difficult  partners like Kim Jong-un.</p><p>TRUMP:  With deals, that is what I do is deals.</p><p>I make good deals. You know, it's a talent. It's a talent, you can't be a  politician.</p><p>TODD:  Now in his letter to Kim, Trump says he is pulling out because of  the quote, anger and open hostility in North Korea's most recent statement,  where they called Vice President Pence a political dummy. Trump biographer  Michael D'Antonio isn't buying that explanation.</p><p>D'ANTONIO:  This after all, it's a situation where Trump himself has been  insulted many times and he has traded barbs back. What we're really seeing  here is the president seizing an opportunity to get out of a situation  which I think he felt was not going his way.</p><p>TODD:  Another classic Trump move in deal breaking are taunt. Trump tells  Kim, quote, you talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so  massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.</p><p>D'ANTONIO:  The taunting in the president's letter is one of those mine is  bigger than yours moments.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you think Kim Jong-un might react?</p><p>HASS:  Well, I think it raises the likelihood that Kim Jong-un will react  by resuming the verbal taunts that were so evident last fall. And to pay  (ph) upon where things go from there, there is a higher risk that we could  see a return of testing, either missile testing or perhaps nuclear testing.</p><p>TODD:  President Trump and senior administration officials now say the door  is not closed to the idea of a summit at a later date. Korean analyst say  for Kim Jong-un, that is going to mean swallowing his ego which may not be  likely any time soon. Can Trump swallow his ego to do it? Trump biographer  Michael D'Antonio says it is possible if it means Trump will get what he  wants, the world's approval and possibly a Nobel peace prize.</p><p>Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Finally, authorities in Hawaii are urging people to stay  away from areas where lava is oozing into the Pacific Ocean. You are  looking now at live pictures of the molten rocks spewing from a fissure.  United States geological survey scientist says two to three of volcano's  main lava channels have now merged to create two entry points into the  ocean.</p><p>When it hits the water, it sends hydrochloric acid and volcanic glass  particles into the air. We will continue here at CNN to bring you the  latest on this incredible but of course very dangerous natural disaster.</p><p>And that is \"News Stream.\" I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones live in London for you.  \"World Sport\" with Christina Macfarlane is coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[08:45:00]  (WORLD SPORT)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Welcome to \"News Stream.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump calls off the historic U.S.-North Korean summit but  Pyongyang says it is still willing to meet. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Iran nuclear deal in focus as E.U., Russian, Chinese, and Iranian officials  discuss ways to keep the deal alive. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein turns himself in to police in  New York. Sources say he has been arrested on rape charges.</p><p>Welcome to the program. We begin with the situation on the Korean  Peninsula. China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience  after landmark talks on North Korea's nuclear program were abruptly called  off. Donald Trump had agreed to meet Kim Jong-un in Singapore next month,  but the U.S. president cancelled. </p><p>In a letter, he cited recent hostile comments from the North Korean regime  as a reason for pulling out.  Officials in Pyongyang say Kim Jong-un is  ready to meet Mr. Trump at any time. The president says a meeting wouldn't  be appropriate right now, but he left the door open to future talks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I hope that Kim Jong-un will  ultimately do what is right not only for himself but perhaps most  importantly what's right for his people who are suffering greatly and  needlessly. All of the Korean people, North and South, deserve to be able  to live together in harmony, prosperity, and peace. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JONES:  Well the latest from both sides of this debate now, Joe Johns is in  Washington for us. Matt Rivers is in Seoul, South Korea. Joe to you first,  is the White House still hopeful, expecting a meeting at all or just  washing its hands of Kim for the foreseeable? </p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hannah, it's pretty clear  that the White House here has left the door open I think that you said at  the very beginning. At the same time, they're being realistic about this  and there is some sentiment that a return to maximum sanctions might be in  order. </p><p>The problem with that of course is getting the international community to  go along particularly some of the countries in the region such as China as  well as South Korea. Those two countries, at least have been subject to  entreaties, if you will, from North Korea during this period, which creates  a question at least for some of the international partners about which of  the two parties that were involved in this summit that went down were in  fact holding the moral high ground, if you will. </p><p>In fact it was the President of the United States, it was the White House,  the administration that pulled out of this very important summit and not  North Korea so, a lot of thought going into this. The big question, of  course, can they return to maximum sanctions? It can be difficult, simply  because some of the countries that would have to go along might not. </p><p>JONES:  Let's bring in Matt Rivers. Matt is standing by for us in Seoul,  South Korea at the moment. Matt, I'm wondering if the North Koreans have  responded yet to this letter, responded formally at least. I mean, we  understand that they say they're still up for a summit at some point, but  is there any sign of any regret perhaps for some of the rhetoric, the  aggressive rhetoric news in recent days? </p><p>[08:05:01] MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Publicly, no. No  signs of regret at least at this point, Hannah. What we did get was a  statement from a high ranking official within North Korea's foreign  ministry. And in that statement, it said in part, we reiterate to the U.S.  that we are willing to sit face-to-face at any time and in any way. </p><p>And that is the only silver lining that many people here in South Korea are  looking at here. That and also the willingness of the president of the  United States to leave the door open for a future summit as well. Both  sides, the U.S. and North Korea seemingly willing to leave the door open  for a summit down the road. </p><p>And that's kind of been the only point of hope here in South Korea because  today, frankly, has been a day disappointment here especially for South  Korea's government, for President Moon Jae-in who put so much stock in this  summit, served as a middle man between North Korea and the United States. </p><p>There is deep disappointment that this summit did not happen and so the  only thing left at this point would be to hope that there is, well, that  they can put a lot of stock in the relatively measured statements that we  got both from the president of the U.S. as well as that statement from the  North Korean foreign ministry. </p><p>JONES:  Let's bring in Joe Johns again. Joe is still standing by for us in  Washington. Joe, you were talking at the end of your last answer there  about maximum pressure. What exactly does maximum pressure mean if that is  going to be the policy that the U.S. adopts now as far as Pyongyang is  concerned? </p><p>JOHNS:  Well, it certainly were means among other things, more economic  pressure on a country that has already worked its way through quite a bit  of economic pressure. It also means attempting to get China back on board.  Of course, as you know, China accounts for so much of North Korea's  economy, if you will. The administration has also talked, obviously, as we  heard, about keeping the military on high alert for anything that would  suggest hostility. </p><p>This, of course, can be perceived in that region as a threat from Donald  Trump and return, if you will, to some of the rhetoric that we heard  earlier in the Trump administration, very strident rhetoric which was seen,  I, think, around the world in many quarters as an escalation and bringing  the world one step closer to some very risky business, if you will, Hannah. </p><p>JONES:  All right, Joe, live for us in Washington. Matt also standing by in  Seoul. My thanks to you both. </p><p>Well, just hours before Donald Trump's announcement on that summit, North  Korea appeared to destroy tunnels and observation buildings at its nuclear  test site and in fact, our Will Ripley was there and broke the news then to  the North Koreans of President Trump's announcement. Will describes now the  long ride that he took to get there and that awkward moment. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  We were on the way back from  the nuclear test site at Punggye-ri here to Wonsan when the news broke  overnight that President Trump has cancelled the upcoming summit in  Singapore. </p><p>It was incredibly awkward and uncomfortable to be on the train with North  Koreans after just witnessing the destruction of their nuclear test site at  Punggye-ri, something they had hoped would lead to substantial progress in  relations between the U.S. and North Korea. And instead the situation went  downhill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Two, one.</p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY:  I'm here at North Korea's nuclear test site at Punggye-ri, a place  that foreign journalists have never been allowed before and we are here,  the North Korean government says, to witness the destruction of this site.  They say it will never be able to be used again. </p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY (voice-over):  With each powerful explosion, the earth shakes. We  travel around 15 hours to get here. First by bus through the coastal city  of Wonsan. </p><p>Compartment seven, here we are. </p><p>Then, some 12 hours by train.</p><p>This is one of those moments where you blink and realize I'm having dinner  on a train going through North Korea. </p><p>A luxury ride by North Korean standards. </p><p>They just came through and they closed all the blinds and told us that for  the entire train ride, we can't film anything out the windows. We pull into  Punggye-ri station, then begin the nearly two-hour drive to the test site.  Once again, no filming along the way. </p><p>We passed through a number of what look like small farming villages. There  was no sign of life, completely empty except for the handful of soldiers at  the guard posts along the way. </p><p>We get a briefing from the deputy director of North Korea's Nuclear Weapons  Institute. </p><p>[08:10:02] He won't tell us his name. Then, we're allowed to inspect the  tunnels. North Korea says they could have easily conducted more nuclear  tests here. They say two tunnels have never been used. </p><p>So they by rigging it with explosives and blowing it up that's a meaningful  step towards denuclearization. No nuclear weapons experts at our small  group, only journalists. </p><p>It's actually quite beautiful here, the North Koreans say that the  ecosystem hasn't been damaged by all of these nuclear test for more than a  decade. They say no radiation has seeped out. Journalists aren't allowed to  carry radiation detectors ourselves. They were taken away at the airport  so, we have to take their word for it. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation):  The dismantling of the nuclear  test grounds conducted with high level of transparency has clearly attested  once again to the proactive and peace-loving efforts of the government of  the DPRK. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RIPLEY:  You really do get the sense that you're witnessing history here,  which is why we're documenting every single building on this site because  by the end o the day it will all be gone. </p><p>We hike to an observation post built just for us and watch Punggye-ri go up  in smoke.</p><p>(EXPLOSION)</p><p>RIPLEY:  The official statement from North Korea's ministry of foreign  affairs indicates that Pyongyang is still interested in a dialogue with  Washington. They say they are ready to talk with President Trump at  anytime. They say dialogue between the two countries is crucial to improve  the situation on the Peninsula. </p><p>And they say that the nuclear test site destruction was, in their words, a  meaningful transparent step towards denuclearization. A sign of goodwill  ahead of any potential talks with the United States. Will Ripley, CNN,  Wonsan, North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  Will, thanks very much. Let's bring in Barbara Demick (inaudible)  for us. Barbara is the former Beijing and Seoul bureau chief for the \"L.A.  Times\" and she has written a book called North Korea titled, \"Nothing to  Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea.\" She joins us from New York via Skype.  Barbara, great to have you on. </p><p>And with no summit in sight at the moment then, it seems that the U.S.  policy is going to be applying maximum pressure on North Korea, the impact  of which presumably trickle straight down and hurts the ordinary people in  North Korea that you've written about. </p><p>BARBARA DEMICK, FORMER BEIJING AND SEOUL BUREAU CHIEF, L.A. TIMES:  That's  exactly right. And these -- we've had this discussion before, but sanctions  tend to hurt the ordinary North Koreans who over the years have been very  dependent on international food aid, medical aid, and you know, I've heard  from a lot o4 people in the NGO community that they can't get in x-ray  machines for TB patients, very difficult to get in medicines. </p><p>It really is unfortunate I would guess, had I been, you know, talking to  people in North Korea that they were really hopeful there would have been a  breakthrough and I think they're the ones who are most directly affected. </p><p>JONES:  Yes, well, I mean the main players though in all of this of course,  they force their geopolitical format. There's been a lot of talk about  China in all of this. Let's ask you about that given your experience in the  region. Some people said that China sidelined by not being involved in this  summit were its go ahead not being at the table as well. Donald Trump seems  to be almost blaming China as well for the fact that the summit hasn't  happened. What are your thoughts on that? </p><p>DEMICK:  I think China is in a very complicated role, you know, publicly  they've cheered on the summit saying they're here to facilitate, but I  think they were very fearful of being sidelined  by the North Koreans and  the U.S. I mean, there's a very delicate balance here and I think Beijing  is fearful of a situation like you have in Vietnam where a communist  country draws closer to the U.S. rather than to China.</p><p>And although it's rarely spoken by the main players in public, you know,  the North Koreans are also fearful of China. You know, one of the reasons  they've been developing this nuclear program is so that they don't need to  rely on China for their security and you know, strangely enough, you know,  I think the North Koreans when they said there is a deal that U.S. troops  can stay on the peninsula, what they were saying, although they were never  articulated, is that, you know, we're afraid of China too.</p><p>JONES:  Right.</p><p>DEMICK:  I don't think China wants, you know, a nuclear arms North Korea.  They don't want to dangerous neighbor, but I don't think they really want a  peace treat with the U.S. that doesn't involve them. </p><p>JONES:  It does seem that both sides though are still leaving the  possibility of some talks on the table at the moment. Can you foresee a  situation when potentially we would have not just Donald Trump and Kim  Jong-un, but also have Moon Jae-in and also Xi Jinping as well so we have  four-party talks instead of just the two? </p><p>[08:15:02] DEMICK:  Well, you remember we've had, for many years six-party  talks that's included Japan and Russia. I think we could return to a multi- party situation, but I know -- I think that, you know, there were so much  momentum and energy going into this summit and everybody was so excited,  and I think, you know, that the wind has been taken out of those sails and  I'm not really hopeful over that big breakthrough. I think many of us are  kind of disappointed.</p><p>JONES:  While we wait to see. Barbara Demick, we appreciate your analysis.  Thank you.</p><p>DEMICK:  Thank you.</p><p>JONES:  Now, the U.S. film producer, Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on  sexual assault charges by police in New York. That is according to a CNN  source. He did turn himself in to a police station a short time ago and  will face court itself for the next few hours. The source has told CNN that  Weinstein will be charged with raping one woman and forcing another to  perform oral sex on him.</p><p>There has been a flood, of course, of accusations against the producer and  they were the trigger for women around the world to come forward with  accounts of sexual harassments and abuse at the hands of powerful men.  Those pictures from not too long ago of Harvey Weinstein. Let's get the  very latest then from New York. CNN's Brynn Gingras is there for us righ  now. This remind us, Brynn, of the background to this case and of course  the fact that Harvey Weinstein (inaudible) himself, while he has turned  himself in, as far as I understand, denies all the accusations against him? </p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, he still is. And we're expecting  to hear from his attorney likely after court proceedings later this  morning, but yes, of course we know about how big, how global this case has  gone. When that \"New Yorker\" article revealed some names of people who made  strong accusations against Harvey Weinstein, I can tell you from a source  that the NYPD began investigating immediately. </p><p>So this is a very dear investigation to the NYPD as they have been working  on it for months, and today finally, the first criminal charges are going  to be filed in the case. But I can tell you here it's a busy (inaudible)  here in Tribeca in Manhattan. We have tons of media out here because inside  that precinct house behind me is Harvey Weinstein. He is officially under  arrest. </p><p>That means that he has taken a booking photo. That means he's been  fingerprinted and soon he's going to head back out those doors and head  right to court. And that's where he's going to face charges of a criminal  sex act as well as rape and we're expecting his bond, Hannah, to be set at  $2 million, Hannah.</p><p>JONES:  And when we look ahead to any kind of future trial as well, this  would obviously have a huge amount of attention from around the world,  given the fact that he is so prominent in Hollywood as well. What kind of  time frame are we looking at for a trial? </p><p>GINGRAS:  You know, that's always up in the air, right? But here's the  thing. Like I said, this is the first criminal charges to be file. We are  expecting more to come. This was just the first. We know that there are  investigations still happening in Los Angeles. We know investigations in  London, and we also know that there's a federal probe here in New York City  that's happening as well as a current grand jury has been convened and  continues to listen to testimonies from at least four women in this case.  So, we do expect more charges to be filed to both of these cases. So, it's  a long way, but this is just the beginning it seems for Harvey Weinstein. </p><p>JONES:  Brynn, thanks so much indeed. Brynn's live there for us in New  York. </p><p>Now, Europe's new data privacy law is just a few hours old and Facebook and  Google are already in trouble for allegedly trying to skirt the rules. More  on that coming up.</p><p>[08:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES:  Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" Europe's sweeping data protection  regulation goes into effect this Friday. CNN has learned separate lawsuits  have already been filed against Facebook, Google, WhatsApp and Instagram,  alleging that the companies are failing to comply. </p><p>Testifying in front of E.U. leaders on Tuesday, Facebook CEO Mark  Zuckerberg insisted his company would follow the new rules. But out Samuel  Burke now reports legal experts believe Facebook is already violating the  new law. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer,  Max Schrems has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for  nearly a decade. And today he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook  for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law called GDPR the  day it came into force.</p><p>MAX SCHREMS, LAWYER:  We were looking for big companies that really  willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and trying to get  away with it.</p><p>BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulation says he's taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p>SCHREMS:  (Inaudible) this idea if we don't want this, we think it's stupid  so we don't want to comply with it. And there are no obvious business  interests. There are certain things you simply can do with data anymore  that give a profit. </p><p>BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent. According to legal  experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL VEALE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY EXPERT, UNIVESITY OF LONDON:  On your  Facebook profile, you can pretend things like sexuality, religion or  political beliefs, and if you put that on, you don't have any choice but  for Facebook to use it to personalize content to every advertising and so  on.</p><p>BURKE:  There's only an \"I accept\" button. </p><p>VEALE:  Exactly. </p><p>BURKE:  There's not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p>VEALE:  Exactly, you got to --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your  profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites too. </p><p>VEALE:  Facebook can infer from the great amount of data it has about you  across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send  data to Facebook.</p><p>BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making  these inferences that they make about us?</p><p>VEALE:  Yes. That law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without  explicit consent.</p><p>BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook.  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to four percent of its  global annual revenue. Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could  face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer said that company  has, quote, introduced better tools for people to access, download and  delete their information. The company also says it's building a new tool  that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them,  it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE:  Lawyer Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent  the kind of data scrapping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have  engaged in. </p><p>SCHREMS:  If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in  this digitalized age. In the end, you as a customer have the possibility to  use let's say Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data. </p><p>BURKE:  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already re-drawing the line between profit and privacies.  Samuel Burke, CNN, London. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JONES:  The new rules have very strict wording but what happens if there  really are violations. Our Kristie Lu Stout asked Vera Jourova, the  European justice (inaudible) if the E.U. is ready to enforce these new  rules.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:25:00] VERA JOUROVA, EUROPEAN JUSTICE COMMISSIONER:  Of course, we made  it very serious that we will enforce the GDPR rules because they bring the  necessary better protection for the citizens to have their privacy better  protected. And that's why we count with the enforcement of the rules. We  have a network of data protection authorities in all the member state and  they will pay due attention to all possible breaches. </p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM HOST:  A question about Facebook because  we know that Mark Zuckerberg was just in Brussel earlier this week. Did the  European Union get the sense that Facebook is not only willing to comply  with GDPR, but willing to self-regulate so that the E.U. won't find itself  in a position to pass more laws to protect data privacy?</p><p>JOUROVA:  Well, we heard the replies of Mr. Zuckerberg. He said that he can  guarantee that Facebook will be fully compliant with the strict European  rules. I have no reason not to believe him at this stage, but of course it  will be under a very strict control, as I said, from (inaudible) to  protection authorities and Facebook will belong to the companies where we  will pay full attention to because the volume of data they are harvesting  in the E.U., the data from Europeans is extremely big and that's why the  risk is also rather big.</p><p>LU STOUT:  OK, so far we've talked about GDPR and what it means for  companies. Let's talk about consumers and a possible consumer backlash  because the number of consumers out there who like data mining, who say  that it allows them to have a very comfortable online experience, a  seamless experience that is tailored just for them. How do you appeal to  those digital users to embrace GDPR and what it represents?</p><p>JOUROVA:  Well, that's a crucial thing that the people, as you say, the  consumers understand that they have the rights fully in place. They have  fully under their control with what's happening to their private data and  that they should be more aware of the possibilities which GDPR gives them.  </p><p>For instance, to give well informed consent to using of the private data  but also to say no, we do not want to be in the system and for instance in  Facebook. We do not want to discourage the people from using online route  and social media.

We have exclusive  footage from Max Thunder, the joint exercise between the U.S. and South  Korea.</p><p>[08:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JONES:  Welcome back. I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones in London. You are watching  \"News Stream\" and these are your world headlines.</p><p>China is calling on Washington and Pyongyang to show patience after Donald  Trump after Donald Trump pulled out to a planned meeting with his North  Korean counterpart.</p><p>Meanwhile, just moments ago, Donald Trump tweeted the following: Very good  news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will  soon see where it will leads. Hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and  peace. Only time and talent will tell. Trump reacting there to a statement  from the North Koreans, saying that they will keep a big and open mind.</p><p>People in Ireland are voting on a referendum that could overturn the  country's strict abortion law. They are deciding whether to repeal the  Eight Amendment which recognizes the right to life of the unborn child as  being equal to the mother. It is a repeal parliament is expected to pass  legislation allowing abortion early in pregnancy.</p><p>Canadian police are on the hunt for these two men who they say set off an  improvised explosive device in suburban Toronto. The explosion happened  inside an Indian restaurant. Fifteen people were wounded, three of them  critically. The suspect then fled the scene.</p><p>U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein has been arrested on rape charges by  police in New York. That is according to a CNN source. He turned himself in  at a police station a short time ago and will be facing court in the next  few hours. Weinstein has denied allegations of nonconsensual sex.</p><p>Now, Washington's decision to scrap the summit with Pyongyang is likely to  be felt most acutely in South Korea. The country just finished holding an  annual joint military drill with the U.S. CNN's Paula Hancocks was able to  film the exercise exclusively. The footage embargoed until the drill ended  on Friday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Loading missiles on an F- 16 fighter jet, ready for a mission against an imaginary threat, an  imaginary enemy. This is Max Thunder, an annual joint air force drill  between the U.S. and South Korea, the same military drills that North Korea  slammed 10 days ago as the turning point in warming relations with the  South and the U.S.</p><p>CNN was able to film the exercise exclusively, which had been embargoed  until the drill ended Friday.</p><p>DAVID SHOEMAKER, COMMANDER, 8TH FIGHTER WING:  While the situation in the  background has changed over the years as we've flown Max Thunder, the  exercise itself is still there for the same reason, and that is the  tactical level and operability learning to fight together as an alliance.</p><p>HANCOCKS:  Pyongyang canceled high level talks with South Korea because of  this drill, calling it, quote, an intentional military provocation. The  first of many recent bumps in the road to a historic summit between the  U.S. and North Korean leaders that U.S. President Donald Trump has just  canceled. But the mood is still far less tense than this time last year.</p><p>The situation on the Korean Peninsula right now really could not be more  different to how it was last year when this Max Thunder drills were last  held.</p><p>But for those involved in these military exercises, the pilots, the U.S.  Air Force, they say that the politics is irrelevant. The most important  thing despite that is to make sure that they are trained and ready for  anything.</p><p>Pyongyang's anger at these drills took Seoul and Washington by surprise. A  South Korean delegation who met with Kim Jong-un said that Kim said he  understood why joint drills had to take place.</p><p>South Korean president Moon Jae-in said in Washington this week he believe  the relations would be back on track once Max Thunder was over, according  to aides. But a lot has changed since then. It's unclear if this drill was  really the reason Pyongyang cooled its enthusiasm for talks with Mr. Trump  or a convenient excuse. But what is clear is that these types of drills  infuriate Pyongyang, year in, year out.</p><p>Paula Hancocks, CNN, Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Negotiations are reaching boiling points on the Iran  nuclear deal as nations that remain committed to the agreement meet for the  first time since President Trump decided to pull the U.S. out of that  agreement.</p><p>CNN's Fred Pleitgen is live in Vienna, Austria for us right now. Fred, even  if they are all on the same page as far as the deal is concerned, time is  definitely running out, right, to keep it afloat in its current form?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, I think  you're absolutely right, Hannah. I think time is absolutely running out.  That is simply something that a senior Iranian official told us earlier  today.</p><p>[08:34:58]  The Iranians are saying they want especially the European  country to put together a package of measures to offset the United States  leaving the nuclear agreement.</p><p>That means that they not only want to have, for instance, the sanctions  relief that they had before. They want European companies to be able to  invest in Iran without having to fear retribution from the United States.  They want to be able to sell their oil, continue to sell their oil on  international market.</p><p>But in addition to that, they also want other measures to make sure that  they get the benefits that they would have gotten if the U.S. had stayed in  the agreement even after the U.S. moves out. The Iranians were saying they  believe that the nuclear agreement has what they call two pillars. One of  them is obviously their nuclear dismantlement, the large part of their  nuclear program.</p><p>And then in return, they said, they were promised economic incentives. They  say so far they have not gotten them and now the JCPOA is in trouble. They  say a11 of that has gotten even worse. So, that's one of the things that  led this particular Iranian official to say that he is not very confident  that the deal can be kept.</p><p>The negotiations here behind me have been going on for a while. There was a  Russian delegate who walked out a couple of minutes ago and he said, so  far, at least all sides are still talking. They are trying to find a way  forward.</p><p>So these things haven't completely fallen apart but there is no doubt that  it is going to be very, very difficult to keep the nuclear agreement intact  in light of the fact that the U.S. is out and is threatening European  companies especially that there might be sanctions if they deal with Iran  in the future, Hannah.</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Yeah. One wonders (ph) what the U.S. is making of these  negotiations taking place across the Atlantic and it not being a part of  those negotiations.</p><p>PLEITGEN:  Well, the U.S. has essentially left the deal and so therefore  they wouldn't be part of these negotiations. I think that is something that  all sides that remain in the deal do agree on. On the other hand, of course  they are highly skeptical and critical of these negotiations still going  on.</p><p>The United States government has come out. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  has come out and said, look, the Europeans need to pull their businesses  out of Iran. He said they are willing to listen to European concerns.  However, the Americans have a very clear, very strict and hard line  position on this issue.</p><p>So, it is very difficult especially for the European nations who have so  much trade (ph) and were strong allies of the United States to try and see  this whole thing through and try to keep the deal intact.</p><p>It is something that they are trying at this point. But again, if you look  at the delegates, you speak to folks here on the ground, none of them seem  overly optimistic that that is something that can be done.</p><p>Certainly they do say it is something that is difficult even though all of  them are saying they do still remain committed to trying to save this deal  and to trying to keep the provisions of this deal in the future as well,  Hannah.</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Fred Pleitgen live for us in Vienna, Austria where it is  the middle of the afternoon at the moment. Fred, thank you.</p><p>Still ahead on \"News Stream,\" why the collapse of the U.S.-North Korea  summit did not surprise everyone, especially those familiar with Donald  Trump's book, \"The Art of the Deal.\" Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Welcome back to \"News Stream.\" President Trump's decision  to cancel his summit on June 12 with the North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un  may have taken some people -- many people by surprise, but not those who  have followed Mr. Trump throughout his career.</p><p>In fact, some say it is a classic mood straight out from the bestseller he  co-wrote, \"The Art of the Deal.\" CNN's Brian Todd has this report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:40:00]  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:   Nobody should be anxious. We have to get it right.</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  President Trump walks away from what could  have been the deal of a lifetime. A letter to his Excellency, Kim Jong-un,  terminating their planned summit, citing Kim's, quote, open hostility in a  recent North Korean statement.</p><p>A letter from Trump touting America's nuclear might, a letter that analysts  say is extraordinary for personal nature.</p><p>RYAN HASS, FOREIGN SERVICE OFFICER:  It is unusual that the president would  use threats of nuclear weapons in communication with a foreign counterpart.  It is unusual that the president would use, I and you and such  personalization.</p><p>TODD:  But according to his biographers, not unusual for Donald Trump. They  say the build up to a summit, the teams, and then the walk back is classic  Trump, a tactic he used to build his real estate empire.</p><p>MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR:  The president's art of the deal  strategy has always been to first ask for the world and intend to settle  for half of it and also be able to stake any position out in a course of  negotiations. So the notion of walking away is something that he had always  advocated. He has said that you should never enter a negotiation wanting  something too much.</p><p>TODD:  For decades, Donald Trump has sold himself to potential business  associates and then to voters on his ability to strike deals with difficult  partners like Kim Jong-un.</p><p>TRUMP:  With deals, that is what I do is deals.</p><p>I make good deals. You know, it's a talent. It's a talent, you can't be a  politician.</p><p>TODD:  Now in his letter to Kim, Trump says he is pulling out because of  the quote, anger and open hostility in North Korea's most recent statement,  where they called Vice President Pence a political dummy. Trump biographer  Michael D'Antonio isn't buying that explanation.</p><p>D'ANTONIO:  This after all, it's a situation where Trump himself has been  insulted many times and he has traded barbs back. What we're really seeing  here is the president seizing an opportunity to get out of a situation  which I think he felt was not going his way.</p><p>TODD:  Another classic Trump move in deal breaking are taunt. Trump tells  Kim, quote, you talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so  massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used.</p><p>D'ANTONIO:  The taunting in the president's letter is one of those mine is  bigger than yours moments.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  How do you think Kim Jong-un might react?</p><p>HASS:  Well, I think it raises the likelihood that Kim Jong-un will react  by resuming the verbal taunts that were so evident last fall. And to pay  (ph) upon where things go from there, there is a higher risk that we could  see a return of testing, either missile testing or perhaps nuclear testing.</p><p>TODD:  President Trump and senior administration officials now say the door  is not closed to the idea of a summit at a later date. Korean analyst say  for Kim Jong-un, that is going to mean swallowing his ego which may not be  likely any time soon. Can Trump swallow his ego to do it? Trump biographer  Michael D'Antonio says it is possible if it means Trump will get what he  wants, the world's approval and possibly a Nobel peace prize.</p><p>Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUGHAN JONES:  Finally, authorities in Hawaii are urging people to stay  away from areas where lava is oozing into the Pacific Ocean. You are  looking now at live pictures of the molten rocks spewing from a fissure.  United States geological survey scientist says two to three of volcano's  main lava channels have now merged to create two entry points into the  ocean.</p><p>When it hits the water, it sends hydrochloric acid and volcanic glass  particles into the air. We will continue here at CNN to bring you the  latest on this incredible but of course very dangerous natural disaster.</p><p>And that is \"News Stream.\" I'm Hannah Vaughan Jones live in London for you.  \"World Sport\" with Christina Macfarlane is coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[08:45:00]  (WORLD SPORT)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

The 6.4-magnitude quake has killed at least 16 people and left many more homeless.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT (voice-over): Moments after the quake struck, hikers scrambled to get down the mountain with clouds of dust rising from landslides all around. There are more than 800 people including many foreign tourists hiking on Mount Rinjani at the time. Rescuers set off on Monday morning to help find hundreds of people still trapped.</p><p>Elsewhere, Indonesian president Joko Widodo visits survivors to hand out emergency supplies and promised more aid.</p><p>JOKO WIDODO, PRESIDENT OF INDONESIA (through translator): As for Rinjani, the search and rescue agency, disaster mitigating agency and the military are working together. Hopefully it will be over soon.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice-over): Around a thousand buildings were damaged including many people's homes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): We are sleeping here at the side of the road because our house collapsed in the quake so my family and I have to sleep here. There are other villages sleeping at other locations around here too. We are afraid of aftershocks.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice-over): The earthquake was centered 50 kilometers northeast of the city of Mataram, and at a relatively shallow depth of 7 kilometers, it was felt on the neighboring island of Bali. Many homes here are not built to withstand strong tremors and rescuers have to be careful of aftershocks while searching the rubble.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Many houses collapsed in the quake as a 6.4-magnitude earthquake is relatively strong. In addition, the epicenter is very close to the northern area of the island. The third reason is that the houses structures are not firm enough like in reinforced steel bars and a solid foundation.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice-over): People often feel earthquakes in Indonesia. It is in the Ring of Fire region of heightened seismic and volcanic activity, but this quake was stronger than usual and happened while many people were sleeping. The Indonesian Red Cross are helping to treat the injured and along with the police and volunteers, are searching for those still missing.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: All right, we'll continue to monitor the situation and the rescue operations there on top of the volcano on Lombok Island in Indonesia.</p><p>Now to the western United States where more than a dozen wildfires are taking lives and consuming property in California. Now, the biggest called the Carr Fire is happening in Shasta County, that is in the northern part of the state. It doubled in size over the weekend turning the sky a terrifying orange. It has been burning for a week now and it is still only 17 percent contained. It is blamed for four to six deaths reported across the state.</p><p>These fires have created unimaginable tragedy for some of those families. Our Dan Simon is in Redding, California, again, that is near the Carr Fire. He joins us live, and Dan, these fires have taken so much and quite recently you spoke to man who lost his wife as well as his two great- grandchildren. What did he share with you?</p><p>DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well hi, Kristie. This is one of the most difficult conversations I have ever had with somebody. This is a 76-year- old man who is broken after losing the most important people in his life. I can tell you that this gentleman, Ed Bledsoe and his wife Melody, they were taking care of their two great-grandchildren. They had raised them since birth.</p><p>On Thursday night at around 7:00, Ed left the house. He just left the house for a short time, about 15 minutes. He wanted to go run an errand and then he received a frantic phone call that the flames had approached his house. Now inside, were his wife and his two grandkids and I will let Ed pick up the story from here. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[08:05:02UNIDENTIFIED MALE: ED BELDSOE, SURVIVOR: I talked to Junior (ph) on the phone until he died. He just kept saying, \"Grandpa, you should come get me.\" He said, \"Come and get me. The fire is coming in the backdoor. Come on grandpa.\" I said, I'm not down the road.</p><p>He said, \"Come and get us. And he said I love you grandpa. Grandma says I love you grandpa and then Junior (ph) says I love you. Come and get us. Come and get us. I said, I'm on my way. My wife was the greatest woman in the world and my grandkids was excellent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMON: The phone actually cut off in the middle of the conversation as he was trying to get back to the home, but when he got close he saw that police had put up blockades and just could not get to the house. As you imagine, Kristie, he feels a tremendous sense of guilt over what happened. In the meantime, as far as the overall fire is concerned I can tell you that crews did make some progress over the weekend.</p><p>You mentioned the containment number, now up to 18 percent. That is quite an improvement. Just 24 hours ago, it was at five percent. This is some of the damage you can see behind me. This is the Redding Estates neighborhood. So much destruction, 874 structures have been destroyed.</p><p>But back to Ed for a second, just such a tragedy and he says he never received any kind of evacuation order. Nobody told him that he should leave and that just goes to show you how fast that fire engulfed the community, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Such heartbreaking loss and devastation caused by this fire. This fire is that it's extremely dangerous and fast-moving. So, when thousands of residents are living in this area and they need to flee these fast moving fires, what more is needed to help them get out in time?</p><p>SIMON: Well, nobody expects a police officer to come banging on your door telling you that you only have minutes to leave, but in this case, Kristie, residents really were caught off guard. This started as just sort of a small brush fire a week ago. Nobody really thought it was going to spread. It just stayed like that for several days and then on Thursday, the winds really kicked up and all of a sudden this fire just exploded. And some people likened it to a tornado, but a tornado that had flames, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Sadly, residents caught off guard there because of the Carr Fire there in Redding, California. Dan Simon reporting for us live. Thank you very much indeed and take care. Now, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers is at the weather center. Of course, he's been monitoring what's been happening there in California and across the state. And as you know, Chad, it's these conditions, hot, dry, windy weather across the state making it very difficult for the firefighters. Is this going to improve anytime soon?</p><p>CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Improve yes but by one or two degrees and maybe a little bit more humidity, but the wind doesn't die down today and it's that wind that fans the flames that moves the flames around. What we had here in Redding was an urban wildland interface, people building their homes as close to the forest as they can because that's the most beautiful part of the town.</p><p>Well, the forest burned and then burned into the town itself that's why so many structures were lost. Typically, if we have a wildland fire, there's one or two homes and the firefighters can take care of those homes, protect them, but there were so many homes involved at the same time it was impossible to get there. This fire now is a third of the size of the city of Rome, the entire city of Rome.</p><p>We're talking now -- we're talking many, many hectares. We're talking square kilometers, 200 to 300 square kilometers. It's hard to get a number because the fire keeps growing. So we are still going to have the wind today. The wind is still going to push the fires along. The wind may help a little bit when it comes to air quality. There is so much smoke here in the California Valley it is unhealthy to breathe that air.</p><p>Now, eventually that wind will shift directions, maybe blow the fire in a different direction but that's also a problem where the firefighters are stationed. You don't want the wind to blow back on them. You want the fire to blow away from them so we're still going to see the increased risk of any breathing problems you have out there today.</p><p>Temperatures are going to be right around 40s. Winds are going to be gusty. Some of these fires can make their own wind. When the air goes up so quickly because the air is hot, because it's heated by the flames, then all of a sudden the air has to rush back in because the air is gone. You make a low pressure center right below the fire, right at the fire, and all of a sudden the wind blow back in and you create your own problems.</p><p>No real threat of any or help of any real rain. This is just a dry area. This is a dry part of the season and many because we had a drought for so long, many of these trees are dead and they burn very, very quickly.</p><p>LU STOUT: Chad Myers reporting the Carr Fire taking blaze in Redding, California now the size of the city of Rome and it could very well get larger. Chad Myers, thank you so much and take care.</p><p>Zimbabwe is heading to the polls for the first time since the end of Robert Mugabe's rule.</p><p>[08:10:03UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The former president of the country for some 37 years until he was ousted last November. But his fall from grace did not prevent a dramatic last-minute intervention as he undermined his own former party, ZANU PF on Sunday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT MUGABE, FORMER ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT: When this system ceases to be that of freedom, that democratic and becomes unconstitutional decisions are taken on the basis of who is my friend, who is my relative.</p><p>(EDN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Mugabe's successor, President Mnangagwa is among more than ng more than 20 contenders for the top job with perhaps the most prominent competition coming from opposition leader, Nelson Chamisa. For more, let's go straight to Farai Sevenzo in the capital of Harare, and Farai, let's first talk about Robert Mugabe. He has intervened in this race with his comments undermining his own former party. How is it going down with voters there?</p><p>FARAI SEVENZO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, we saw several tweets on social media and of Mr. Mugabe going to vote. It's unclear the way he voted. He usually votes in Highfield, an area I come from. But people around him were cheering him on, but it was almost a comedic kind of approach (ph), you know, because of the comments he made yesterday afternoon at Sunday.</p><p>With that controversion (ph), he set himself apart from the party that he founded, the party that he led (inaudible) for over 37 years and simply say that he cannot trust the people with (inaudible) so much and that he would rather of the 22 candidates left, he would rather choose Mr. Chamisa. But that is also the kind of person Mr. Chamisa himself likes and of course that set off a chain of events with the government and Mr. Mnangagwa.</p><p>Mr. Mnangagwa himself releasing his own video saying, well, look, the opposition is in bed with the man who was a dictator for so long. Now, none of this is really credible where you look under the skin because Mr. Mnangagwa was -- Mr. Robert Mugabe's (inaudible) for over 50 years.</p><p>And you know that old expression, there really is no true permanent friends in politics. There is just permanent interest. And it seems right now, Mr. Mugabe having been ignored for so long, he's real permanent interest is to try and cozy up to this young upstart on Nelson Chamisa, 40 years-old, who is today the only competition of a 75-year-old incumbent Emmerson Mnangagwa, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: So, where does the ZANU PF stand now? I mean, this was the party of liberation in Zimbabwe. Are enough people there in the country now willing to turn their back on ZANU PF?</p><p>SEVENZO: You know, this is being called a very tightly contested election. People -- local past are putting them neck and neck. But then when you look at the kind of crowds (inaudible) was out on the last day of campaigning in the capital Harare, there was a sea of red in Zimbabwe Square. Many more I would wager and they wear the national (inaudible).</p><p>Now, that doesn't mean that these numbers are going to translate into a victory, but certainly there is a mode of passion for an opposition that has been denied power for so long. They last tasted it in 2009 when the late Morgan Tsvangirai became prime minister of a national unity government.</p><p>So, at the moment we know that the figures don't look and apparently in the face of it, to be favoring the incumbent president but this is a tricky, tricky road to go and we have about five days or so before the results are checking in. But at the moment, people are voting. We've been out to polling station. We saw a school with six polling stations, people looking for their names in the voter's register.</p><p>And there are all kinds of complaints as well from the opposition that the urban voters are being turned away. There is no real proof of that and of course, they have the courts to turn to should they be very unhappy with the final result, Kristie, but it's going to be a very interesting week.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, absolutely. Farai Sevenzo reporting live from Harare, watching this election very closely. It could be a fresh start for Zimbabwe. Farai, thank you.</p><p>Now, in Cambodia, the ruling party there is cleaning a landslide election victory but critics they are calling it a sham. Prime Minister Hun Sen, seen here voting, is expected to win another term after more than 30 years in power. He says turn out was 80 percent and is Cambodian People's Party who says it won more than 100 out of 125 seats in parliament. The human rights groups are condemning Sunday's vote.</p><p>The deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, Phil Robertson, notes that the main opposition party was banned.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHIL ROPBERTSON, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, HUMAN RIGHST WATCH ASIA DIVISION: Well, unfortunately, the prognostication that democracy in Cambodia has died is correct.</p><p>[08:15:00] This has been by far and away the least democratic election since the U.N. came in here in 1993. We are seeing a situation where an opposition party was completely dissolved prior to the elections. People were not able to vote on some party that they wanted. The government here is now predicting that they will win all the seats, all 125 assembly seats.</p><p>Now, since it is starting to approach the old Soviet Union type election, you know, where they win 99 percent of the votes post, you know, it's really become a joke. This is a mockery of democracy rather than upholding the democratic principles.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Phil Robertson now bans (ph) Cambodia National Rescue Party leadership called on the international community to do more than simply condemn Sunday's result. You're watching \"News Stream,\" and up next, President Trump gets personal, ramping up the rhetoric in a new attack on Robert Mueller. We'll tell you what he is saying now.</p><p>Also ahead, the British Parliament sets it sight in tackling fake news. I was hoping to stop the spread of disinformation by trying to regulate social media. Well, that and more after the break.</p><p>LU STOUT: We are coming to you live from Hong Kong. Welcome back. This is \"News Stream.\" Now, Italy's far right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has triggered a storm in the Italian media by appearing to quote at least fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Salvini who also serves as interior minister tweeted an article on Sunday compiling criticisms against him.</p><p>The caption did quote, \"So many enemies, so much honor.\" The words echoed those popularized by Mussolini who said, \"Many enemies, much honor.\" Salvini tweeted the quote on July 29th, incidentally, Mussolini's birthday.</p><p>President Donald Trump is expected to take questions from reporters during a joint news conference with Italy's prime minister later on Monday. Now, one question that is certain to come up, what was behind that weekend twitter rant against Robert Mueller. Abby Philip has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation inching closer and closer to Trump's inner circle, the president ramping up his attacks against the probe and directly targeting Mueller by name. In a series of tweets, the president accusing Mueller of having conflicts of interest including an alleged contentious business relationship with Mr. Trump.</p><p>The White House did not respond to CNN's request for information, but ethics experts from the Justice Department determined last year that Mueller's assignment is appropriate. President Trump's latest criticism coming days after sources told CNN that the president's former lawyer Michael Cohen is prepared to tell Mueller that then candidates Trump knew in advance and approved the Trump Tower meeting with Russians promising dirt on Hillary Clinton months before the 2016 election.</p><p>[08:20:07] The president has repeatedly denied that he had any knowledge of the meeting. Cohen also authorizing the release of a recording of a conversation with Mr. Trump discussing a potential payment to a Playboy model who claims she had an affair with him, something the president denies.</p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER ATTORNEY OF PRESSIDENT TRUMP: I need to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David --</p><p>PHILLIP (voice-over): President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, telling CBS the tapes of 183 Cohen conversations exist, but that only one captures the conversation with the president.</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, TTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP: There are 12 others maybe 11 or 12 others out of the 183 in which the president is discussed at any length by Cohen mostly with reporters, all clearly corroborating what the president has said in detail on many of those tweets. So, these are tapes I want you to read, I want you to hear.</p><p>PHILLIP (voice-over): Giuliani continuing to assail Cohen's character.</p><p>GIULIANI: The man is a pathological manipulator, liar --</p><p>PHILLIP (voice-over): Despite repeatedly praising him.</p><p>GIULIANI: He doesn't have any incriminating evidence about the president or himself. The man is an honest, honorable lawyer.</p><p>PHILLIP (voice-over): President Trump also taking to twitter to again threaten the government shutdown if Congress does not fund his border wall and change the nation's immigration laws. The threat coming after the president met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan last week to talk about government funding. After that meeting, both leaders downplaying the possibility of a shutdown.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So you're not worried about a government shutdown --</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: No, that's not going to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHILLIP (on-camera): And later today, President Trump is going to host the Italian prime minister here at the White House. They'll have a press conference and also a photo-op that we call a pool spray, that's a venue that reporters often use to ask the president questions. But just last week, the White House tried to retaliate against a CNN reporter for asking questions in that exact venue. So we will see what President Trump does on that today, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Abby Phillip there. Now, by now, we have all heard President Trump blast the Russia probe as a hoax or phony, something that sounds a lot like his reason (ph), the media so that probably made things a little bit awkward when he came face-to-face with the head of another favorite target, the \"New York Times.\"</p><p>Mr. Trump revealed on Sunday that he recently met with the paper's publisher, A.G. Sulzberger. And while Sulzberger confirmed their chat, that seems to be all that the tea man (ph) are agreeing on. Now, President Trump tweeted that they spent much time talking about the vast amounts of fake news being put up by the media and how that fake news is morphed into the phrase \"enemy of the people,\" adding (inaudible)!.</p><p>But in this statement, Sulzberger said this, \"I told him that although the phrase fake news is untrue and harmful, I am far more concerned about his labeling journalists the enemy of the people. I've warned that this inflammatory language is contributing to a rise in threats against journalists and will lead to violence.\"</p><p>Sulzberger, he also added that the White House suggested or requested the meeting and asked that it remain off the record. But after President Trump tweeted about it, \"The Times\" decided to go ahead and release Sulzberger's notes. Fake news is also a threat to democracy in the U.K. Now, that is according to a grim new warning from members of British Parliament. It's all out in a new report.</p><p>A committee has been investigating the spread of disinformation and the claims that it has disturbing evidence of hacking and voter suppression used in political campaigns as early as 2010. Now, it is calling for greater regulation of social media. That investigation began after the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal. And Samuel Burke has been following all this from the very start. He joins us live from London, and Samuel, good to se you. Walk us through this report and exactly how are British MPs raising the alarm on disinformation and fake news.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Kristie, the U.K. Parliament wants to go after Facebook financially and legally. Europe has long had a lot of bark, now that bite is starting to sink in.</p><p>(voice-over): It's a blueprint for regulation sure to reverberate across Silicon Valley. This 89-page report released Sunday by a British parliamentary committee. The report called on companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to face financial and legal liability when they fail to police fake news on their platforms.</p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE MP: We have to create this sense of liability for them to say that if you don't proactively look for or monitor harmful content and I think they are to classify the real hard fake news, real lies being spread during election and harmful content, if you don't act to identify that and the sources of it, then you could be liable for that information having been spread. And I think if we introduce that liability into law, we'll see them take it more seriously.</p><p>[08:25:01] BURKE: The committee recommended new taxes on social media companies and stiff fines when they promote political ads that lacked transparency.</p><p>COLLINS: The tech companies are saying themselves they want to give more transparency. What we could do is write it into our laws.</p><p>BURKE: If adopted, the recommendations would radically change the way tech companies are treated in the U.K., less like passive platforms and more like publishers.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACBOOK: I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation.</p><p>BURKE: But British lawmakers said they weren't satisfied with the efforts by social media companies to regulate themselves.</p><p>COLLINS: What they do is they pre-empt regulation. They don't like being regulated. So, if they think to the threat of regulation is real, they will try and design their own way of solving the problem.</p><p>BURKE: The committee which has been working closely with members of the U.S. Congress also proposed measures to combat election interference. And it slams Facebook in particular for failing to fully investigate how and if Russia uses its platform to influence voters. In a statement to CNN, Facebook said, \"The committee has raised some important issues. We share the goal of ensuring that political advertising is fair and transparent and that electoral rule changes are needed. We will work closely with the U.K. government as we develop these new transparency tools.\"</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN ANCHOR: The chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, is $16 billion poorer than when woke up this morning.</p><p>BURKE: Last week, the stock prices of Facebook and Twitter each fell almost 20 percent after both company said they were spending heavily to combat misinformation and cleanup fake accounts on their platforms.</p><p>COLLINS: When you look to the near future and this problem is probably going to get worse. Using virtual reality, augmented reality techniques, you can already creates fake speech given by someone in a place they never were to an audience they never met and pass it ff as real and share that online.</p><p>Now, we're going to need the help of the tech companies to stop that sort of information spreading. Otherwise, that could have a real outcome on elections in the future.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): Big tech's willingness to help out will surely be tested now that regulation is growing closer to becoming law.</p><p>(on-camera): Kristie, one point I can't emphasize enough that this U.K. parliamentary committee has been working closely with the U.S. Congress, not something that we always see. And now, we've just obtained document showing that Sen. Mark Warner, who is the vice chair of the intelligence committee in the United States, has been circulating a blueprint that would also look at regulating social media in the U.S.</p><p>So, if I can just put up on the screen some of the points that he's talking about, it sounds very familiar. It is somewhat similar to what the U.K. is looking at, but also federal funding for media literacy program so people can distinguish between a CNN going after the fact than fake news on Facebook.</p><p>Increased identifiers for authentic accounts -- maybe that little blue symbol isn't enough. Maybe something bigger so people know this is a legitimate CNN account, not somebody trying to be an imposter for our real news and to make platforms legally liable for defamation claims. So you can see lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic looking to put regulation in. Now, whether they actually do that still, we have to wait and see.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, wait and see but the support raising the alarm and raising the chances of regulation indeed happening to the world of social media. Samuel Burke reporting live for us. Thank you so much. Take care.</p><p>Now, here on \"News Stream,\" we have more ahead, in fact, we're going to be looking into one of the biggest mysteries of modern aviation. Exactly what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370? But the official report, it offers few answers. You're going to get a live update on the latest findings. Keep it here.</p><p>[08:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM SHOW HOST: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching \"News Stream\" and these are your world headlines.</p><p>A landmark presidential vote is underway in Zimbabwe. It is the first election since Robert Mugabe's 37-year rule came to an end last November. Here you will see incumbent President Emmerson Mnangagwa voting early in the day. Now, he is facing more than 20 contenders for the tough job including MDC leader Nelson Chamisa.</p><p>Firefighters in California, they say that they are making some progress against a deadly wildfire. The Carr Fire filled by shifting winds as well as dry weather, it doubled in size over the weekend. But officials say it is now nearly one-fifth contained. More than a dozen fires burning across the state are blamed for at least six deaths.</p><p>A rescue operation is underway in Indonesia. At least 700 people are trapped around Mount Rinjani. A 6.4 magnitude quake hit Lombok Island on Sunday, killing at least 16 people and leaving many others homeless.</p><p>Now joining me on the line is Andreanne Tampubolon, staff of Disaster Management Division, Indonesia Red Cross National Headquarters. She is there on the island of Lombok where this is all taking place. She joins us now.</p><p>Andreanne, thank you for joining us here in the program. We know that hundreds of people are still missing including hikers who remain trapped on the volcano. When will rescue teams be able to reach them?</p><p>ANDREANNE TAMPUBOLON, STAFF, DISASTER MANAGEMENT DIVISION, INDONESIA RED CROSS NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS (via telephone): (INAUDIBLE) based on information that the search is underway, conducted by the national army together with search and rescue national body.</p><p>LU STOUT: OK. I know at the Red Cross, you are focusing on providing aid for the survivors across Lombok. Let's talk about that. We know that thousands of people have been affected by this earthquake. How are they getting access to basic necessities like clean water, food, and shelter?</p><p>TAMPUBOLON (via telephone): OK. So what we are doing, we distribute the necessities like ready-to-eat food to the location. They are quite scattered (ph). The location is quite scattered (ph) (INAUDIBLE) so that is why it is important for us to get the (INAUDIBLE) accordingly (ph).</p><p>LU STOUT: OK. Andreanne Tampubolon of the Red Cross joining us live in Lombok, thank you so much for joining us in the program. Best of luck to you and your team as you assist the survivors in the aftermath of Sunday's earthquake there.</p><p>Now, Malaysia has released its long-awaited report into the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. A four-year search was called off earlier this year. And the report, it offers no clear cause for the plane's vanishing, but it does not rule out outside intervention.</p><p>Now, CNN'S Will Ripley is in Hong Kong. He has more on the story and will join us now. Will, four years later, finally this 400-page final report is out and still no clear answers, no closure for the families?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We counted, Kristie. It has been 1606 days since March 8, 2014 when MH370 disappeared. I remember that period of time very well. I know you do, too. It was my first assignment for CNN, and I remember hearing those families at the airport in Kuala Lumpur sobbing and moaning on a daily basis as they left this government press conferences.</p><p>They felt that they were not only not getting answers, but that they were being blocked from the truth, that the government in Malaysia was hiding something from them.</p><p>And so now you have this 495-page report. This is the government's effort to be fully transparent. And it lists every fact that the Malaysian government says they have obtained over the last four plus years about the disappearance of the airliner. But inside that huge report, there are no answers about what happened.</p><p>They know that 27 pieces of debris have washed ashore up the east coast of Africa as far north as Tanzania, as far as south as South Africa, but only three pieces, three wing fragments have actually been verified 100 percent is coming from the missing plane.</p><p>[08:35:03] You know, they detailed the search efforts, the 230,000 square kilometers that were searched first by the Australian government, later by a private U.S. company. They claim it was using the latest technology. The search efforts turned up nothing. They looked at the background extensively of the pilot, of the first officer.</p><p>They didn't find anything that seem to indicate proof that they had motivation to turn that plane around and fly it on a presumed course somewhere in the Southern Indian Ocean where the plane is believed to be sitting even though the searches of the best known areas or the best estimated guess o0f where the plane went down turned up nothing.</p><p>They looked to the backgrounds of all the passengers, 227 passengers, 12 crew members. There has been nothing that has given them any clue. So for the family members of the pilot and the first officer that had to live with this cloud hanging over them of suspicion, you know, the investigators have said, look, is it possible somebody broke into the cockpit? Sure.</p><p>Is it possible that there was a catastrophic equipment failure in the plane and that they were in a heroic effort trying to turn it around? Yes, it's possible. Is it possible it was something more sinister criminal act? Yes.</p><p>And so families are left here more than four years later, right where they were in those early months after the disappearance, waking up every morning now for 1606 days, wondering exactly what happened and not knowing.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yeah. So, no clear cause yet on what caused this plane to disappear. The mystery continues. Will Ripley reporting live, thank you.</p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\" Still to come right here on the program, no background checks, no regulations, and a lot problems. 3D-printed hand guns are set to hit the United States and if they could work, what could this mean? We will investigate that, next.</p><p>LU STOUT: Coming to you live from Hong Kong at the start of a new week, welcome back. This is \"News Stream.\"</p><p>In the United States, blueprints for printable guns are set to be released on the web this week. The designs mean that anyone can print a gun from home if they have a 3D printer. But is this technical innovation or an unnecessary threat? Athena Jones has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ATHENA JONES, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It could be the dawn of a new era in gun manufacturing. Starting as soon as Wednesday, people will be able to use 3D printers to make their own weapons and weapon parts. No background check required.</p><p>This after the government settled a lawsuit last month with the nonprofit group Defense Distributed that will allow the posting of 3D printable gun plans online, a move that is triggering a debate about public safety and national security.</p><p>The group's founder, Cody Wilson, has built a website so people will be able to download plans for a handgun he dubs the \"Liberator\" as well as digital files for a complete Beretta M9 handgun and other firearms.</p><p>Wilson's legal battle began after he posted handgun blueprints online in 2013, waiting to a demand from the State Department to take them down because they could violate a law regulating the export of defense material services and technical data like blueprints. Wilson explained his goal in a 2013 interview.</p><p>CODY WILSON, FOUNDER, DEFENSE DISTRIBUTED: Bring guns one as exercise and experimentalism. Can you print a gun? But really, for me, it is important. It is like a symbolic political statement.</p><p>JONES: He described the future in which people could access unregulated guns.</p><p>[08:40:02] WILSON: In the future, people will be able to make guns for themselves. That was already true. But now it has been been demonstrated in yet another technology.</p><p>JONES: The June 29 settlement will also allow Wilson's site to post online plans for an AR-15 lower receiver, a key component of the gun. Gun control advocates fear these firearms made almost entirely of plastic would be untraceable and impossible to regulate.</p><p>The co-president of the Brady Campaign To Prevent Gun Violence says these hard to detect guns would be a national security threat, making it easier for terrorists and people who can't pass criminal background checks to get their hands on the dangerous weapons, adding, \"I think everybody in America ought to be terrified about that.\"</p><p>But experts like Lawrence Keane, senior vice president for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearm industry's trade association, say 3D-printed guns would have to include metal components to function and because federal law requires it.</p><p>LAWRENCE KEANE, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION: Federal law since the mid-1980s under the Undetectable Firearms Act requires certain (ph) amount of metal so they are not undetectable (INAUDIBLE) undetected (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>JONES: Even with those metal component, the guns would not work well.</p><p>KEANE: The truth is, they don't. Many times, they fail after a single shot being fired. They break. They are not very durable and they really don't work.</p><p>JONES: He said the sort of high-end printer that will be needed to make it a gun cost as much as the quarter of a million dollars and the resulting weapons unreliability means the country is unlikely to see a rush of people trying to print their own guns. New York Senator Chuck Schumer expressed similar concerns back in 2013.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D), NEW YORK: Felon, a terrorist, can make a gun in the comfort of their home not even leaving their home and do terrible damage with it. And so the question is, what we do about it?</p><p>JONES: Last week, he demanded the State Department and the Department of Justice reverse the decision or postpone finalizing it. And so that if they don't, he would use emergency congressional actions to block those gun websites.</p><p>SCHUMER: We are here to sound the alarm. We are here to plead with the administration not to allow these type of websites to go forward with their plan on August 1st. And we are here to say we will pass legislation if such a website is allowed.</p><p>JONES: Athena Jones, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Finally, it was the biggest story in years of the Korean Peninsula, so it's only fitting that one of South Korea's hottest stars is offering his take on it.</p><p>K-pop megastar \"Big Bang\" tackles the summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in the video for the song called \"Where Are You From?\" It has already received more than 2.5 million viewers on YouTube since its release last week.</p><p>That's \"News Stream.\" I'm Kristie Lu Stout.

And what are companies doing with all that personal information once they get their hands on it.</p><p>There are now several investigations into Facebook over the use of its user data after a whistleblower said that Cambridge Analytica used the information from 50 million Facebook users to try to influence voters during the U.S. presidential election.</p><p>It says it didn't do that, but the U.S. and the U.K. are also investigating that data firm. Now, Cambridge Analytica is data and communications company. It has offices all of the world, in London, Washington, New York, Sao Paulo, even Kuala Lumpur. The company says they can change audience behavior by analyzing data, achieving greater influence for its business and political customers. High-profile clients include Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and the Ben Carson campaign.</p><p>So let's get the very latest now, and the fallow up for Facebook, and all of these investigations. Isa Soares joins us live from London. And, Isa, first the British investigations into Facebook, and Cambridge Analytica, what's the latest?</p><p>ISA SOARES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Kristie. Pressure is without a doubt mounting in both sides of the Atlantic and here in the U.K. Pressure is mounting on Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Their office is just behind me to answer questions -- critical questions that you pointed out there is how exactly will they require, was consent given from those 50 million Facebook users?</p><p>And crucially how exactly -- what exactly did they do with that data if they indeed got it from third party as we have been told, as the whistleblower had say, well, in the last 24 hours or so, the Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins, a well-known MP has called on Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica to face parliamentary questions again and inquiry.</p><p>He has faced about a month or so ago when he said to the committee that he never used data to -- he denied using, working with, or having any sort of Facebook data. They also want Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook to appear for questioning to all these questions they have regarding that 50 million data.</p><p>While this is all happening, Kristie, the company is also been hit with emergency data seizure order, and we know that a warrant is expected to be issued today for authorities to see some of the hard drives and some of the data here to really ascertain exactly what was going on.</p><p>This is a dramatic turn of events. Of course for Cambridge Analytica, a company who boasted of course about standing behind Donald Trump on winning the crucial 2016 election.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: I first met the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, nine days before the U.S. presidential election in 2016. And I'm confident that he can get inside the mind of American voters by predicting, and then attempting to alter their behavior.</p><p>ALEXANDER NIX, CEO, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: I think it is extremely robust, and proven to be so time and again.</p><p>SOARES: His data helped this man win, U.S. President Donald Trump, who paid multimillion dollars for them to work their magic. But behind their winning method is more than just data crunching. It's a massive data grab, so says their former contractor now turned whistleblower Chris Wiley.</p><p>CHRIS WILEY, FORMER CONTRACTOR, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA: We spent almost $1 million doing this. It wasn't some tiny pilot project, it was that the core of what Cambridge Analytica became. It allowed us to move into the hearts and minds of American voters in a way that have never been done.</p><p>SOARES: And this is what Wiley says they did. Cambridge Analytica received data from a third-party, Professor Alexander Kogan, based at University of Cambridge who was able to gather data on tens of millions of Americans through Facebook. And then using or survey placed on Facebook, they asked users to take a personality test.</p><p>The answers grew people under personality types. They combined it with voter history, what they buy, where they shop, and what they want on T.V. And that enabled them to predict the personality of every adult in the United States, and then target them with specific political ads.</p><p>[08:05:03] But it goes further, by opting into these Facebook surveys, each user was actually giving not just the data, but many of their Facebook friends.</p><p>WILEY: He was a grossly, unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness.</p><p>SOARES: Speaking to the U.K. parliament committee on data protection of fake news back in February, Cambridge Analytica denied they've violated Facebook's terms.</p><p>NIX: We do not work with Facebook data, and we do not have Facebook data. We do use Facebook as a platform to advertise, as do all brands and many -- most agencies, or all agencies, I should say, and we use Facebook as a means to gather data.</p><p>SOARES: The attention now turns to Facebook and how it reportedly allowed the data breach on this scale.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As I have said from the beginning...</p><p>SOARES: And more importantly, how it was used to reach and influence voters ahead of the 2016 presidential election. In a statement, Facebook said the claim that this is the data breach is completely false, and that those involved certified they had destroyed the data.</p><p>Meanwhile, it says it's suspending the accounts of Chris Wiley, Cambridge Analytica, as well as Professor Alexander Kogan, who did not respond to our request for comment, if anything is shining the light of the dark art of political advertising.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SOARES: And in the last hour or so, Kristie, we've heard from Cambridge Analytica who were basically told CNN that they've never used Facebook data in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Cambridge Analytica's response there. It is under scrutiny as is Facebook. And a bigger question about, should there be more regulation. Is this scandal going to push not just Facebook, but Google, Twitter and others big tech names into the regulatory spotlight?</p><p>SOARES: Without a doubt. And I'm sure would have heard what happened in the last 24 hours, its expose that was shown. Yesterday, Channel 4 News -- another expose that is expected to be shown today again on Channel 4 News. And then this expose, undercover reporter posing as a potential Sri Lankan client, Kristie, who wanted the services of Cambridge Analytica in upcoming elections, and over series of meetings with senior executives at Cambridge Analytica, including its CEO Alexander Nix.</p><p>The company -- the company, Cambridge Analytica, went on to offer an array of dirty tricks there that they can play in order to swing the elections, in order to bring votes, everything from honey trap sending beautiful Ukrainian girls they said to operate such (ph) things.</p><p>Also they said offering bribery to discredit politicians and said they could send someone, a property expert to offer money in exchange for land. They could film that, and use that against politicians.</p><p>But what is really interesting in what they said, they didn't work in the subject of fake news. But they did say and I am quoting it here, it doesn't have to be true, it just has to be believed.</p><p>So, the idea of creating and promoting fake news, and at the very crop of the Modus Operandi it seems from this expose last night is this idea that you really just have to play into people's hopes, and exploit their hopes, as well, as their fears. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The two fundamental human drivers when it comes to taking information on board effectively are hopes and fears, and many of those are unspoken and even unconscious -- you didn't know that was a fear until you saw something that just evoked that reaction from you.</p><p>And our job is to get -- is to drop the bucket further down the well than anybody else to understand what are those really deep-seated underlying fears, concerns. It's no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it's all about emotion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOARES: Well, Cambridge Analytica, Kristie, has sent CNN a statement really rejecting all the allegations on that Channel 4 report. It went on to say that the report is edited.</p><p>They say the words are scripted into grossly misrepresent the nature of the conversations that really took place. They say that theyir executives -- and I am quoting here, entertained series of ludicrous, hypothetical scenarios.</p><p>Now, its CEO Alexander Nix said he is aware of how it looks, but simply not the case. When the reporter that was posing as Sri Lankan client, turned the conversion to entrapment and corruption, the executives -- and I am quoting, left with great concerns and did meet -- did not meet with him again. Now, Nix went on to add and this is what he said.</p><p>[08:10:00] I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone, or engage in an entrapment, bribes, or so-called honey traps, and does not use untrue material for any purpose.</p><p>I should've recognized where the prospective client was taking that conversation, and ended the relationship soon, Kristie, and there seems to be more of expose -- further expose later on today, looking at Cambridge Analytica, and its ties to the U.S. President Donald Trump. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: It is an incredible expose just this murky world or manipulating our hopes and fears on social media platforms like Facebook. Isa Soares reporting live for us. Thank you so much and take care.</p><p>A former contractor for Cambridge Analytica blew the whistle on the company, you saw on that report, and he described how the firm used Facebook data to target voters in the 2016 presidential election. Allegations that the company denies saying it never use that information. He told CNN, Cambridge Analytica tested Donald Trump's talking points for his presidential campaign even before Mr. Trump announced he was running.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILEY: Knowing the research that I was working on at the time, we were looking at, you know, things like draining the swamp. We were looking at imagery of walls, and how people engage with that -- with that concept.</p><p>We were looking at, you know, suspicions about the deep state. We were looking at all kinds of things that at the time, you know, in 2014 when it sounded slightly fringe or crazy for any political candidate to go on, but what we're finding were, you know, cohort of Americans who really responded to some of those things.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right.</p><p>WILEY: And this all got fed back to Steve Bannon, you know. And then, right after I left, Cambridge Analytica started meeting with Corey Lewandowski who later became Trump's campaign manager at the Trump Organization in New York, before Trump even announced that he was going to run.</p><p>So for some reason you got Cambridge Analytica who was working for Ted Cruz at the time going to the Trump organization in New York, meeting with Corey Lewandowski for some reason before Trump has even announced.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Chris Wiley there. And this is just the latest accusation to hit Facebook over how influential it is. Wired Magazine did recently in- depth report on how the conversation on fake news during the 2016 presidential election was a wake-up call for Facebook. And Editor-in-Chief Nick Thompson described the atmosphere inside the company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK THOMPSON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, WIRED: The picture we got from all the people we talked to was that a company that just wasn't prepared for what happened. They kind of coast it along for most of their existence believing that what's good for Facebook is what's good for the world.</p><p>And then suddenly, that belief was kind of crushed as they saw what happened during the American election, they saw Russian manipulation, and they saw use the platforms being out of control in certain ways.</p><p>But what we also learned while e working on it is that there is a very real sense that Facebook is now taking this seriously in taking steps in the right direction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: This recent scrutiny over Facebook's ability to protect user data centered shares plummeting on Monday. The company closed down nearly 7 percent, wiping some $37 billion off its value. This is the company's biggest drop in four years, and there could be a further fall later on Tuesday.</p><p>Now, 23 Russian diplomats are beginning an exodus. They are leaving Britain, and they are returning to Russia. The British Prime Minister Theresa May expelled them last week in response to the use of a Russian nerve agent on British soil. Russia and British tensions are rising in the wake of the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury earlier this month.</p><p>Now for more, Melissa Bell is in Salisbury. She joins us now live. And, Melissa, let's first talk about the investigation -- the OPCW is now involved. What does it bring to the table?</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it is going to bring out once it reports, once it has looked at these samples credibility to Putin's claim because in the time being, we have London's analysis of these samples that were collected here in the center of Salisbury with all the various places that the Skripals visited on March 4th, the day that they were found poisoned here in the town center.</p><p>But it was essential that these representatives of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons get access. Now, we're told that that investigation is going to take some time.</p><p>They arrived here at Porton Down, just outside Salisbury, that specialist, military facility where the samples are stored, they then get to take the samples onto labs of their choosing in order independently to verify the substance involved.</p><p>But that process, Kristie, is going to take at least two weeks and possibly longer. So we're going to have to wait some time to get the result of that investigation.</p><p>The parallel investigation that's going on of course is the one that's being led by the British authorities, that criminal investigation into precisely how the poison was administered to the Skripals, and that we are being by police is an investigation that could take perhaps not weeks, but months.</p><p>[08:15:02] So even as we wait for these two investigations to conclude, we're already seeing, in a very physical way today, the whole diplomatic fallout of these now, which has, of course, escalated over the course of last week.</p><p>It was last Wednesday that Theresa May announced the expulsion of these 23 Russian diplomats. They have now begun their journey back to Moscow, Kristie, on buses that have left the embassy -- the Russian embassy in London.</p><p>Twenty-three diplomats, but of course with their families, we're hearing that's about 80 people, and Russian news agency TASS is saying that a special Aeroflot plane is going to be taking them back to Moscow.</p><p>LU STOUT: Melissa Bell reporting live from Salisbury, thank you.</p><p>Now, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has voluntarily turned himself into police for questioning. A French Court Official says it is part of the inquiry to his 2007 election campaign which allegedly received funds from former Libyan Dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Mr. Sarkozy has previously denied receiving illicit funds describing the allegations as in his words, grotesque.</p><p>The U.S. has announced major military drills to South Korea and they will begin soon. But does it risk antagonizing the North, ahead of those proposed talks that could prove crucial? We'll get the latest from Seoul.</p><p>And fighting words, the Chinese President promises to take on his country's enemies. We got that coming up.</p><p>LU STOUT: Coming to you live from Hong Kong. Welcome back, this is News Stream.</p><p>Now, the U.S. State of Texas is on edge after a fifth explosion rocked a FedEx facility just hours ago. Officials say a package reportedly containing nails and shrapnel exploded outside of San Antonio.</p><p>The FBI tells CNN, they suspect it is connected to four other bombings in the Austin area this month. Police believe a serial bomber is behind these attacks that have killed two people.</p><p>The first three devices were concealed in packages, and left on people's doorsteps, but the fourth was left on a residential street, and exploded when it was triggered by a tripwire. Austin's Police Chief says that attack shows a higher level of skill by the bomb maker.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHIEF BRIAN MANLEY, AUSTIN, TEXAS, POLICE DEPARTMENT: We do believe that it is the same person based on the components that are comprising these explosive devices across all four that we've had so far. So we do believe that this is the same person or persons that are involved in these.</p><p>And using the tripwire on this one, the first three felt as if they were targeting a specific residence, and possibly a specific person the way this fourth device was placed in a neighborhood, and left with a tripwire to really injure the person who randomly came across.</p><p>[08:20:05] It was very different than the ones that targeted in the first three.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Hundreds of federal and local investigators are working the case. And so far, there is no word on a motive for these bombings.</p><p>The U.S. has announced major military drills to South Korea are due to begin just weeks before those potential talks between Donald Trump and North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un. The annual military operation is to start April 1st, involving about 300,000 troops.</p><p>North Korea has long considered the exercises to be a provocation. So, what effect could they have on those all-important talks between the leaders?</p><p>Well, CNN's David McKenzie is in Seoul for us. He joins us now live. And, David, the drills, why are they back on, and what impact could they have on those potential talks?</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kristie, I think if they cancel the drills entirely, it would've send a certain message that the Americans and South Koreans are not going to interscend (ph) at the stage.</p><p>But if you look at the subtle and some not-so-subtle signs, it appears that they are going to be, at least according to the South Koreans, shorter than usual.</p><p>They will still involve thousands of troops of course, and combine these war games on the ground, and the virtual games as well, sort of scenario planning.</p><p>But it does seem like they're trying to underpay them this year as compared to what they would have in years past. So it's worth remembering the South Korean National Security Advisor saying -- or the equivalent of that position saying that Kim Jong-un said he believes that these were just regular drills, and you can understand them.</p><p>That's a huge turnaround from years past when he would say that they are provocation and launched missiles during the same period. So it seems everyone's trying to downplay this. And the real focus is the diplomacy which they are hoping to happen in the next few months. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Everyone was trying to downplay this. Is this because of anticipated reaction from Pyongyang, and what will that be?</p><p>MCKENZIE: Well, yes. That is because they would anticipated they went very big on it, and gave it a lot of publicity, and exposure, and invited a journalist to witness this, and report on it directly that it might provoke Kim Jong-un to turn his back on these possible talks.</p><p>But it does show, as I already described, that they are trying to ease off perhaps on the symbolism of these. There were already delayed because of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, and there is also those general charm offensive going from South Korea.</p><p>They are sending at least 160 people, and many of them top pop stars, K-pop stars heading to Pyongyang late this month, and early into next month for at least two concerts.</p><p>So that's kind of soft power pop propaganda one might say over the South Koreans and it's just another step towards kind of softening the mood ahead of that all important meeting between Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un, and later with President Trump and Kim Jong-un that is proposed for May. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Interesting. The soft power and hard power on display into those anticipated talks. David McKenzie reporting live from Seoul, thank you.</p><p>Tensions on the Korean Peninsula were not the focus for China's President on Tuesday. But Xi Jinping, he had a tough message. In a major speech, he called for China to take its position in the world, and he warned China's enemies would face a bloodied battle. Matt Rivers has more from Beijing.</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kristie, if the majority of Xi Jinping's first term was all about laying the groundwork for his ascension to new heights then the last six months or so has really been all about taking concrete steps to both formalize and institutionalize his complete dominance over the Chinese political system.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RIVERS: A confident President Xi Jinping takes center stage at the closing ceremony of the annual session of China's Rubber-Stamp Parliament. The National People's Congress, days earlier, had removed presidential term limits from the country's constitution paving the way for Xi to stay in power likely for as long as he wants.</p><p>Now the undisputed paramount ruler of nearly 1.4 billion people, Xi speaks in familiar terms on the ruling Communist Party's absolute control over the country with his nationalistic message on Taiwan, attracting the loudest applause.</p><p>XI JINPING, CHINA'S PRESIDENT (through a translator): All acts and tricks to split the motherland are doomed to fail.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>JINPING (through a translator): Every inch of our great motherland's territory cannot be separated from China.</p><p>RIVERS: It could also be a message to U.S. President Donald Trump who just signed a bill into law that encourages more U.S. government visits to Taiwan, a self-governed island that Beijing regard as a break away province.</p><p>An amid increasing tensions between Washington and Beijing over trade, and America's growing suspicion over China's global ambitions, Mr. Xi brushes off such concerns.</p><p>[08:25:09] JINPING (through a translator): We will insist on taking a path of peaceful development. And China's development won't pose a threat to any other countries. Only people who are used to threatening others will find everyone else threatening.</p><p>But this year's Chinese parliament session has been all about Xi, and his further consolidation of power, and how he plans to use it. Pollution, financial risk, and corruption are among his top priorities.</p><p>And just in the past few days, Xi launched a massive reorganization of government agencies, and created a super agency dedicated to fighting corruption, and strategy that critics say he has used in the past to clear the party of potential rivals.</p><p>Xi's potential path towards lifelong one-man rule seems to have begun last October, and his name was enshrined in the party's constitution.</p><p>Now with a propaganda blitz building a personality cult around him, and removal of term limits, President Xi appears determined to realize his vision of, quote, national rejuvenation.</p><p>JINPING (through a translator): Our goal is by mid-century, we will build our country into a prosperous, powerful, democratic, civilized, harmonious, and beautiful modern socialist nation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RIVERS: And, Kristie, the consistent line from Xi's supporters is that a strong leader like the President is needed during tumultuous times, but critics would immediately counter that by saying that that is just an excuse for the rise of a new dictatorship here in China, one with major consequences for the rest of the world. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Matt Rivers there reporting from Beijing.</p><p>Now, in India, handmade textiles have a long and rich history. Ornate fabrics are popular in the courts of kings and rulers, and for centuries religious worship found expression through sacred cloths. Destination India visits the city of Varanasi to explore the complex craft of self- weaving.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The city of Varanasi has a sense of timelessness. I will call the city of Varanasi, Banaras because that is how the local call us. And then, one thing that is unique at Banaras, it's their sense of time, in the city, in the people, in the way we make our craft.</p><p>Banaras is known for the hand-made crafts. And the reason for that also happens to be there on the crossroad of the big trade routes in India. Various fabric, various traditions came here, and people here adapted themselves.</p><p>We are on the north part of Banaras, and this is where the magic of the Banaras textile happens. And people are predominantly Muslim and they produced the finest fabrics of the Banaras in this region.</p><p>The final stage of the weaving where the yarn is stretched and is checked, and after this, the wrappers (ph) roll onto a beam, so we are checking each thread (ph). It is the last stage before the wool (ph) goes in the loom.</p><p>In Banaras, majority of the looms are pit loom, one of the reasons for this (inaudible) humidity. When it becomes very dry, then the yarn becomes very difficult to handle. Then there are different techniques of weaving, one would be embroidery technique, and the other is a throwing technique, where you throw from end to end of the salvage of the fabric, you throw the web (ph).</p><p>I think the key factor in fine weaving is that the weaver has to have to patience. It's very meditative practice, because firstly, you are not looking at the front of the fabric, you are looking at the front of the fabric.</p><p>So you will never know how the front is happening (ph). And you are weaving in such a slow speed at those handlooms. So to be a weaver is to be good at meditations.</p><p>The most important thing we have to remember is from the moment we are born to the moment we die, we interact with the fabric. We are always in constant contact with a piece of fabric. That is the importance of the fabric in our life.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: You are watching News Stream. And still to come, the personal information of 50 million Facebook users exploited for campaign politics. And now, lawmakers are demanding answers.</p><p>[08:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM SHOW HOST: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching \"News Stream\" and these are your world headlines.</p><p>The U.K. government is seeking a warrant to conduct an on-site investigation of Cambridge Analytica, a company that provides data analysis during elections. The company denies it used information from 50 million Facebook users to try to influence the U.S. presidential election. Facebook is also under fire over failing to protect user data.</p><p>Twenty-three expelled Russian diplomats are leaving the U.K. today. This video shows them leaving the Russian Embassy in London on their way to the airport. This happened a short time ago. Britain announced the expulsion after the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in England. The Kremlin denies it was behind the attack.</p><p>The world's last northern male white rhino has died due to age-related complications. The beloved 45-year-old Sudan is survived by his daughter and granddaughter. Scientists hope his genetic material can be used with the two remaining females to continue the species.</p><p>Let's return to our top story. Allegations that Facebook is not protecting its users' private information are raising deep concerns by U.S. lawmakers. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden sent a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Wyden accuses Cambridge Analytica of using Facebook to, quote, weaponize detailed psychological profiles against tens of millions of Americans.</p><p>Wyden is also asking Facebook to answer a list of questions by April the 13th and they include the following: How many incidents during the past 10 years is Facebook aware of in which third parties collected or processed user data in violation of Facebook's Platform Policies?</p><p>Wyden then asked Zuckerberg to describe each incident, the number of users whose information was collected and misused, and what steps Facebook took to remedy the violation?</p><p>Regarding the data downloaded, he also asked this: Has Facebook make any attempt to identify the 50 million users affected and inform those users that their information was collected and misused? And if not, why not?</p><p>Let's get the very latest now from CNN's Samuel Burke. He joins us now live from Miami, Florida. Samuel, good to see you. Thank you for joining us. A number of investigations happening. We got the update from London with Isa Soares top of the hour, but stateside, what is the latest on the investigation in the U.S. into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY NEWS CORRESPONDENT: What's really interesting here, Kristie, is kind of the contrast that we are seeing between the United States and the United Kingdom, a contrast that is not surprising at all.</p><p>[08:35:06] You're talking about multiple politicians here in the U.S. calling for all different types of inquiry, hearing, testimony from Mark Zuckerberg. Nobody is speaking with one voice.</p><p>This is what often happens with technology problems here in the United States. You got the Judiciary Committee saying one thing. You have the House Intelligence Committee issuing another statement.</p><p>But if you contrast that with what's happening in the United Kingdom right now, Cambridge Analytica had said we'll submit ourselves to a forensic audit digitally by Facebook. Facebook goes in to do that.</p><p>And then you have a body dedicated to just this type of issue in the United Kingdom say no, no, no, we deal with data, we would like to get a warrant and go in and do that.</p><p>What you see here is the major contrast between Europe and the United States in how we deal with data, really showing itself now, and we'll have to see if those bodies that exist in Europe will do a good job of going forward and possibly a better job than here in the United States where you don't have that single voice, that single government agency looking after data and trying to chase data in this case.</p><p>LU STOUT: Let's talk about the fallout. We have been seeing the fallout from Washington D.C. American lawmakers pushing back. The fallout on the market shares and Facebook plummeting overnight. What about the fallout among users of Facebook? I understand you have been monitoring a certain hashtag that is gaining momentum.</p><p>BURKE: Yes, there are a couple of hashtags out there. \"Delete Facebook\" is one of those hashtags. If we just put up a chart from a group called \"Keyhole,\" they basically look at hashtags and track them. You can see an incredible spike there.</p><p>I want to be clear, we are only talking about a few hundred people using that hashtag, but the comparison is very stark. You look in the days before, not many people. Now all of a sudden, you take that hashtag and then you connect it with the stock pricing, you realize investors are very nervous, Kristie.</p><p>Facebook has to be very nervous. We have heard from people within the company that say this is a PR nightmare. It makes me think back to Uber and some of the sexual harassment allegations, problems people had that caused the hashtag \"Delete Uber\" to trend on Twitter.</p><p>People said it didn't really have any effect. Later on, we saw data that showed that it actually did have a major effect. This is what striving the stock price down. This is why Mark Zuckerberg lost $5 billion in his network. We are not talking about cast, we are talking about stock price, but it has to give the company jitters.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, Facebook under fire because of crisis of trust. Samuel Burke, reporting live for us. Thank you so much, Samuel. Take care.</p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\" still ahead, we are going to meet a young innovator who is working to give prosthetic limbs a human touch. Tomorrow's hero is next.</p><p>LU STOUT: There is breaking news from St. Mary's County, the U.S. state of Maryland. The school district there just released a statement saying that there is a school shooting. A school shooting taking place at Great Mills High School that is about two hours outside of Washington D.C. The school is currently on locked down. Officials say the event is contained. The sheriff's office is on the scene.</p><p>[08:40:00] It is not clear, the number of casualties, if there are any. Now, the school district says that there will be more information to follow and of course we will offer that to you right here on CNN.</p><p>Over the next two weeks, CNN is telling the stories of young scientists, entrepreneurs, and inventors in a new special series. Their inspiring innovations will surely make a difference in improving our environment, health, and communities.</p><p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta introduces us to one of tomorrow's heroes. He is trying to make sci-fi a reality when it comes to prosthetic limbs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Human skin keeps the body warm when it's cold and cool when it's hot. It's one of the most vital organs in our body. But when you lose a limb like an arm, for example, you also lose all of its sensory features, right? But perhaps not anymore. After our tomorrow's hero Benjamin Tee's discovery, prosthetic limbs may soon be able to experience that real human touch.</p><p>BENJAMIN TEE, SCIENTIST AND INNOVATOR: My name is Benjamin Tee. I'm from Singapore and I'm 35 years old. And I am a scientist and innovator in the field of electronic skins.</p><p>Electronic skin is really a recreation of some of the amazing capabilities that human skin offers us. Basically it is a substrate that can sense the environment really well just like your skin and the whole idea is to be able to advance robotics and provide them with the sense of touch. It allows us to be so dexterous and creative.</p><p>When I was a kid at about seven years, I was really inspired when I watched the \"Star Wars\" trilogy. They had a robotic assistant inspect Luke Skywalker's hand that he lost in a fight. And the hand had complete sensation. When a robot pokes it, he is able to react. This is something that today's prosthetic hand is unable to achieve.</p><p>We talked to patients and people that have unfortunately lost their hands or even their legs. When they use a normal prosthetic, they are unable to feel and this really affects their daily activities.</p><p>I spent a decade actually thinking about this problem. At first, it is not so easy. I started in 2008. People are just starting to think about how we can solve this problem, and we have to work at very new materials. We have to develop new materials.</p><p>The greatest challenge is, can we create artificial regional skin? We have multiple brainstorming sessions to see how we can achieve that.</p><p>I really think we are very close. We have now developed platform technology that can enable sensors to rebuilt on any skill (ph) you want. So it could be over the entire body of a robot or it could be as small as in the area of your fingertip.</p><p>We try always (ph) to change scientific -- science fiction to scientific reality. Quite frankly, kudos to the science fiction writers. They have done an excellent job of envisioning our future. But we are the ones putting how to make that a reality.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: I like them. High-five at the end there.

Official state visit, the French President is on his way to the White House, but is the there any chance Macron and Trump will see eye to eye Iran, or climate change? And beautiful girls wanted, Chinese firms are facing criticism over job postings that discriminate against women.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LU STOUT: South Korea is making final preparations for Friday's historic summit with the North. And Donald Trump is positioning himself ahead of his own talks of Kim Jong-un. The Wall Street Journal reports that Mr. Trump is going to ask the North Korean leader to act quickly to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. Otherwise Mr. Trump will reportedly say sanctions won't be lifted.</p><p>And meanwhile, President Trump is hosting an official state visit, his first since taking office. Hours from now, he will welcome French President Emmanuel Macron to Washington later in the week to hold meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel as he decides whether or not to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>But on the Korean Peninsula right now, the President of South Korea Moon Jae-in is laying the groundwork for his upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un. It happens on Friday inside the demilitarized zone.</p><p>And to create a more peaceful environment, South Korea says it is turning off its loudspeakers that have been blasting propaganda, and K-pop across the border.</p><p>Let's bring in Ivan Watson, and he joins us now live from Seoul. And, Ivan, what about these loudspeakers at the DMZ, how significant is it that Seoul decided to press mute on this loud, endless blast of K-pop and propaganda?</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kristie, I think it's another example of both sides making these gestures of goodwill, and that's how the defense ministry here explained it. They said that this was to help, you know, create a good environment going into the summit, which is going to take place on Friday.</p><p>We're now in the home stretch where both Koreas are preparing for what could be an historic meeting. The first ever between South Korea's President Moon Jae-in, and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.</p><p>So there quite literally going to be holding rehearsals for the next three days in that Panmunjom compound along the demilitarized zone where the final meeting will take place on Friday between these two leaders.</p><p>And turning off those loudspeakers is another indication of that goodwill. The South Korean government has been overjoyed with the decision by North Korea over the weekend to suspend nuclear tests, and long-range missile launches.</p><p>Take a listen to this excerpt from a statement that the South Korean Foreign Ministry -- Foreign Minister made, which was released on social media. Just take a listen to hear the tone coming from right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KANG KYUNG-WHA, SOUTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER: President Moon Jae-in of the South will greet Chairman Kim Jong-un of the North for a day-long meeting in the south side of the Truce Village of Panmunjom.</p><p>It will be the first time in the 70 years of division of the Peninsula for the top leader of the North to set foot south of the Military Demarcation Line, and it is the only third summit between the two sides, the first in 2000, and the second in 2007.</p><p>Further more, a first ever summit meeting between the United States and North Korea is also in the making. These are truly historic events that could bring about a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula which has been the ardent dream of the Korean people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATSON: And President Moon Jae-in of South Korea said that, quote, we stand at the crossroads of denuclearization. So there's a great deal of optimism going into this week, certainly on the part of his administration. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, ahead of those big historic talks on Friday, a lot of groundwork be made as well as these gestures of goodwill. Ivan Watson reporting live from Seoul, thank you. Now let's take you live to London.</p><p>The Duchess of Cambridge has been admitted to St. Mary's Hospital there in the early stages of labor. With more details, we are joined now by our Max Foster. And, Max, you are right outside the hospital, describe the scene because you must be seeing just the media frenzy, as well as fans of the royal family.</p><p>MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, I can. I should probably tell you first, the baby has been born, and it's a boy. And he was born an -- one hour. I saw -- I got Kate Williams here, our Royal Commentator.</p><p>The baby weighing eight pounds and seven ounces, the Duke of Cambridge is there, and just really from the statement here, the family is being informed.</p><p>[08:05:04] This is unexpected, but we did know what the sex (ph) was.</p><p>KATE WILLIAMS, CNN ROYAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, very happy news. And there was a suspicion it was going to be a boy, because Prince William let it slip. He said maybe they will call it Jack or Jackie.</p><p>So we have the suspicion that maybe he though it was. But of course, they didn't know -- we heard they didn't know. So this is a thrilling news, and very exciting. We have been waiting for days. The fans have been here, expecting the baby. And now here we are. And there is a prince.</p><p>FOSTER: Now the speculation is about the name, of course, and all sorts of names bouncing around. I'm not going to go through them. These are all completely made up because the couple hasn't revealed their details. But what do you got?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think Albert (ph) for the front line, and I think that would be marvelous. The Queen's father's first name was Albert, Bertie, and he became George when he came to the throne. So I think that would be a beautiful tribute.</p><p>I think Arthur -- the great King Arthur, I think that's a very beautiful tribute as well. So let's see. But the royals will choose a very traditional name. So we do not expect to see anything particularly wild. But you'll never know. Prince Max could be a big one.</p><p>FOSTER: I think Prince Max will be perfect, not British enough probably. We know expects the formal announcement to be made. There will a notice placed in the front of Buckingham Palace on this easel, which has been around for however long. But this is a tradition that goes along with greeting.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, the tradition will be, it is (Inaudible). Now, the announcement signed by the staff who assisted the Duchess with the birth, they will take -- they will final announce goes to the Buckingham Palace, the (Inaudible) the announcement of the baby's sex, and the baby's birth weight, which we know it's a boy, and it eight pounds and seven ounces. But we don't know the name, and that's going to be announced probably for another couple of days.</p><p>FOSTER: And then we will have the big reveal as well. And the steps behind me, quite famous steps, that's all being prepared as we speak. In terms of the process of events, we do expect them to come out today, because Kate has spoken about how she doesn't like causing all of this destruction at the hospital. Actually, that sure is a little bit destruction.</p><p>There certainly is some. It is largely caused by us. The world media are very much present, and it does cause huge amount of problems. The emergency service center is just around the corner, so we do cause some problems, don't we? But in terms of the appearance, it will be today shortly gone.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, we're expecting to see today, so with Prince George, the Middletons first came to visit, and we then saw -- after that we saw Price George coming out.</p><p>I think what everyone wants, is a shot of all five of them. They want -- they want Prince William to go away, bring back the little price, so we will have the whole world...</p><p>FOSTER: They are outnumbered now.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They are outnumbered, that will be a shock, and the world media will be thrilled to see, not just the three of them, but the little prince and princess, as well, because do next see George, not very secretly. So it will be marvelous moment that we see all of them.</p><p>FOSTER: And (Inaudible) presumably, so they've got to be dragged out of school for the big announcement as well. You can hear the cheering down there.</p><p>There are royal fans down the end, screaming for them, so as the media here. I mean, mainly media here, isn't it? In terms of what this means for succession, this will be fifth in line, so Harry goes down a notch.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Harry goes down a notch, this will be fifth in line. And of course, when George himself has his children, this baby will be pushed down again. But it is very important -- children sometimes (Inaudible) is the child.</p><p>Sometimes it happens, but certainly this baby will be -- when George comes to the throne, the assistant royal, the back-up royal will take the royals into the next generation.</p><p>FOSTER: OK. Thank you very much, Kate. There you have it, it's a boy. Back to the studio.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, the Duchess of Cambridge is now a mother of three. It's a boy, very happy news indeed. Max Foster reporting live from just outside the hospital, thank you. We'll talk to you again, soon.</p><p>Now, once seen as political outsiders, they are now to the most vocal players on either side of the Atlantic. Just hours for now, French President Emmanuel Macron will arrive in Washington to meet with Donald Trump.</p><p>The first time American leader has hosted a state visit since he took power. Melissa Bell joins us now. She has more from Paris. And, Melissa, can President Macron somehow sway Donald Trump on key issues, climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal?</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, that will be an extremely test, Kristie. Over the course of the next three days to see precisely how far or not Emmanuel Macron manage to persuade Donald Trump. Do remember that famous handshake that marked the beginning of their friendship?</p><p>Well, I sense, this state visit, the first of Donald Trump's presidency is a result of an extraordinary relationship. It is rebuilt top over the course of the last year.</p><p>Just years since they first met, which combines that one to sort of manly squaring up with each other with two very different presidents that might decide that divide, but also, some genuine affection.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: The strikes may have been carefully coordinated, but the route that followed was anything but, after the French President claimed to be driving U.S. policy in Syria.</p><p>[08:10:04] EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE (through a translator): Ten days ago President Trump said the U.S.' is going to disengage from Syria. We convinced them. We convinced them that it was necessary to stay.</p><p>BELL: It took less than five hours for the White House to respond denying that its policy had change. A squaring off between two presidents that begun nearly a year ago with the grip that was more arm wrestle than handshake.</p><p>Last May, two ideologically different political new comers side each other up for the first time. The policy clash came only weeks later over climate change when President Donald Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Accord.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.</p><p>BELL: Emmanuel Macron responded turning Trump's campaign slogan against him.</p><p>MACRON: Make our planet great again.</p><p>BELL: But the sizing up, and political differences, then gave way interline to an unexpected truce. In Paris, the two presidents meet, and it appears actually liked each other.</p><p>TRUMP: Oh, I really have a feeling that you're going to have a very, very peaceful, and beautiful Paris, and I'm coming back. You better do a good job, please. Otherwise, you're going to make me look very bad.</p><p>MACRON: And you're always welcome.</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you.</p><p>BELL: Progress they said had been made on a number of issues even it seemed on climate change.</p><p>TRUMP: We discussed a lot of different topics, and we briefly head on the Paris Accord, and we'll see what happens.</p><p>BELL: After the pompons circumstance of the best D-Day parade, and more exchanges between the two presidents, it was time to say goodbye which they did with more warmth than anyone had imagined possible, warmth that has now translated into the first state visit of Donald Trump's presidency.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BELL: Well, it will be (Inaudible), Kristie, over the course of the next few days in Washington will be dismantled, that Emmanuel Macron was adopted as the new leader of Europe.</p><p>Will he manage to shift the American President's decision on that key issue, which at least they have said is theirs for the Iran nuclear deal. Will he managed to convince his American counterpart within the necessity of staying in, the important date, the crucial date is May 1st.</p><p>That is when Donald Trump will have to agree once again to waive sanctions against Iran, on the basis of that deal or not, whether or not Emmanuel Macron manages to change his mind on what appears to be his decision not to waive them or not will be the key test of his strength.</p><p>Also, the British leaders -- European counterparts in thinking to make progress towards the American president's view by giving him assurances about the future of Iran's nuclear capability, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Melissa Bell live in Paris for us, thank you. You are watching News Stream, and still to come, the hunt is on for the gunman who killed four people at a restaurant in Nashville. And police warned he is still armed and dangerous.</p><p>[08:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT: Look at that reflection. Coming to you live from Hong Kong, welcome back. This is News Stream. Now a massive manhunt is underway in the U.S. state of Tennessee after a gunman opened fire at a restaurant.</p><p>It happens Sunday morning at a Waffle House just outside of Nashville, in the town of Antioch. Four people were killed. The suspect 29-year-old Travis Reinking has been added to Tennessee's 10 most wanted list.</p><p>And police believe he is still armed and dangerous. Now CNN's Nick Valencia joins me now live from Antioch. And, Nick, again, the shooter -- he is still out there. He remains at large, and we'll learning more about him, including the previous arrest. What can you tell us?</p><p>NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, he is not a stranger to law enforcement. Back in 2017, he was arrested for going into a restricted area near the White House.</p><p>He is alleged to have told authorities that he had a meeting, or wanted to meet with President Trump, and as a sovereign citizen, he has a right to inspect the ground.</p><p>He was taken into custody, also in 2016, he is alleged to have had a delusional episode during what he told first responders that he believed that Taylor Swift, the pop musician was stalking him.</p><p>It was after that 2017 arrest, though, Kristie, that the FBI recommended that he had his weapons taken away from him, in his own state of Illinois. It is believed that that alleged shooting that happened, he use one of those guns that was allegedly taken away from him.</p><p>His father was supposed to keep those guns away from his son, that clearly did not happen. Overnight though, we are learning from authorities that Travis Reinking is still on the run, and so far there have been no credible sightings of him. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: And people there are also hailing a hero, a customer in Waffle House, who rushed the gunman, managed to take his rifle away, tells more about this hero.</p><p>VALENCIA: Well, James Shaw Jr. addressed the media yesterday, and he said he is not the hero. He doesn't like to be referred to that, but a lot of people here including the local first responders are saying that he is.</p><p>It was during the shooting that he was trapped behind a swivel door, and he said he made the split-second decision that he was going to fight for his life.</p><p>He somehow gathered momentum to burst to that swivel door, took down the gunman, and in that scuffle, he was able to seize that AR-15 style rifle, grabbing it actually, burning his hand in the process, and tossing that weapon behind the counter.</p><p>It's then that Travis Reinking, the alleged shooter went on his way, and fled the scene. James Shaw Jr. has also, if he hasn't done enough already, he started a GoFundMe account for the victims of the shooting. Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: What a wonderful gesture. Nick Valencia reporting live from Antioch, thank you so much, and take care. President of Nicaragua said that he is canceling a wildly, and popular pension reform plan.</p><p>Protests against the plan cuts to pensions have caused violence, and looting in the country. In fact, at least 25 people were reported killed in clashes between protesters and security forces.</p><p>Turning now to Russia, and there are lingered questions there over the suspicious death of investigative reporter. Maxim Borodin, he fell from the fifth floor balcony of his apartment, and his colleagues are raising doubts about the official account of his death.</p><p>CNN's International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson, visited the scene, and he joins me now with more. And, Nic, Russian police, they may say, no foul play. But what did Borodin's friends, and colleagues, and family members tell you?</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: It's doesn't add up -- the accounts don't add up here. He fell from the balcony 11 days ago. The police took him away from the scene, and he died three days later in hospital, most people around his apartment absolutely too afraid it seems to talk to journalists like us as we showed up there.</p><p>One person did however tell us that no police, despite coming to pick up his body, and take him away, no police officers came to any of the neighbors in that apartment building, and there would've been many of them to ask if they saw anything suspicious, which doesn't really indicate that there is a full-fledged investigation underway.</p><p>And that still seems to be the situation. The company -- the media company that he worked for has now had the media site blocked from our Russian search engines.</p><p>So their content is now not available, or is just not being seen by so many people. They've asked questions about this, and as they understand it, this is something that is being done officially, that somebody officially sanctioned this.</p><p>The Interior Ministry, however, echo what the police say. The police say no foul play. The Interior Ministry said his apartment was locked from the inside, therefore they believe it was most likely that no one else was involved.</p><p>[08:20:00] A friend of his that we talked to said this was a young man who was doing well professionally. This is what his boss told us as well. And he wasn't a suicidal type. There was no reason that they knew about that he would want to commit suicide, and I think the other factor in this equation.</p><p>They're figure out precisely what happens the night before he fell. The night before he fell, he had called a friend, and said get me a lawyer, my apartment is being surrounded by security personnel. A few hours later, he messaged that same friend, and said, just stand down, everything seems to be OK.</p><p>But there are so many unanswered the questions here, and a lot of those -- because the police aren't asking the questions, you'd expect during an investigation, and so we put a chill on the situation for Russian journalists.</p><p>There were several people we spoke to who initially said yes, you can come and meet those interviewers, we'll talk about it, back to last minute. I think it would indicate a level of fear, connected to this right now, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: And you are saying that there is a chilling effect among journalists in Russia because Borodin set his part of a pattern, just deadly incidents involving people who report, or go public on sensitive issues.</p><p>ROBERTSON: Yes, I mean he's not the first journalist to have fall, and believe it or not, from the fifth floor apartment. There was a journalist 10 years ago in Moscow who was a military correspondence, and when working on a sensitive subject, fell from his balcony, unexplained circumstances his friends at that time said this doesn't seem like suicide.</p><p>But that was the official accounting of it, and there another case of an entrepreneur just a few months ago, died in custody -- in police custody. He was accused of embezzling money, but as often a narrative that emerges in Russia when people are conspiring against you with a false narrative that he apparently died of suicide in jail.</p><p>Yet, that was the official report, yet just recently, another investigation showed that he had signs of torture, that he have been beaten, that he had electrical shock marks inside his mouth.</p><p>So there's certainly a willingness among some people in Russia to understand and believe that what the state says about questionable deaths, often doesn't add up. You may never get to the truth, but it does have that chilling effect that you feel as a citizen of Russia.</p><p>But if you speak out, something might happen to you. And that was our experience in Yekaterinburg. There were people who have said we'll talk to you, and then change their minds at the last minute, and that one can only believe that's because of the fear surrounding the situation.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, the chilling that kills investigative journalism, and requires just, you know, questions being able to get answer. Nic Robertson reporting for us in a very important story. Thank you so much, Nic, and can take care.</p><p>After days of delays, chemical weapons inspectors are finally evaluating samples from Douma, and say that they will decide whether they need to return there again.</p><p>On Saturday, inspectors visited one site from April 7th suspected chlorine and Sarin attack. The U.S., U.K., and France blames Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime for the assault, and the U.S. says Russia may have tampered with the site.</p><p>On Sunday, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said his country has sent experts of its own to Douma, and found no trace of chemical weapons.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is stepping up his warnings that Iran's military presence in the Syrian Civil War is dangerous not just for Syria, but for stability of the entire Middle East. Of course, that includes Israel, Iran's longtime adversary. Here is Oren Liebermann.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Seven years into Syria's civil war, one subplot is emerging. When an Iranian drone entered Israeli airspace in February, it marked the beginning of a new phase between Israel and Iran, two rivals vying fore regional positioning.</p><p>Israel shot down the drone, and struck the controlling base, losing an F-16 fighter jet to Syrian air defenses in the process. The exchange made one thing clear, Israel and Iran are drawing closer.</p><p>A battle that used to be carried out through proxies, Israel fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon has been replaced by near-direct confrontation. A recent air strike in the Syrian T4 military base, a strike pinned on Israel killed seven Iranian nationals. Iran has vowed to respond.</p><p>HOSSEIN SALAMI, REVOLUTIONARY GUARD COMMUNICATOR (through a translator): Listen, and be aware. Any war that might happen, rest assure, will bring about your disappearance. The smallest goal is your existence, and there's no smaller objective than that.</p><p>You can't handle the domino effect of occupation when you're citizens, and soldiers escape. You have no escape route apart from falling into the sea.</p><p>[08:25:00] LIEBERMANN: U.S.-led air strikes a few days later made a statement, the West wouldn't stand for Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons.</p><p>Despite Israeli leaders hailing (ph) strikes, security expert Amiram Levin says that's not how President Donald Trump's message was received.</p><p>AMIRAM LEVIN, SECURITY EXPERT: The strike was too weak, and the effect was almost nothing. In other words he told Russia, he told Assad, he told the Iranians, you can continue with your policy in Syria. You can continue to kill children, to kill innocent people as long as you don't do it with chemical weapons.</p><p>LIEBERMANN: Israel views with growing alarm, Iran's presence in Syria. The country's leaders reiterating Israel's position, it will not allow Iran to establish a military presence to Israel's north. In Syria's fog of war, Israel sees a chance to act.</p><p>AVIGDOR LIEBERMAN, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through a translator): I know one thing for certain, we will not allow the Iranians to base themselves in Syria, and there will be a price for that. We have no other choice. To agree to an Iranian presence in Syria is agreeing to the fact that the Iranians will put a noose around our necks.</p><p>LIEBERMANN: Syria is a fractured country, but even in its shifting sands, Iran and Israel have drawn their red lines. Analysts say the rivalry has entered a new phase -- countries more willing to confront each other, even directly. What was for so long a war of words, and covert actions risks moving closer to open confrontation. Oren Liebermann, CNN, Jerusalem.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: You are watching News Stream.

The report highlighting sexism in parts of China's booming tech industry.</p><p>LU STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong, you're watching News Stream, and these are your world headlines. The Duchess of Cambridge has given birth to a baby boy at St. Mary's Hospital in London.</p><p>In a statement released to the media, the Duchess and the baby are both doing well. The boy, whose name hasn't been revealed just yet is fifth in line to the throne, a short time ago, we heard this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (Inaudible)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: There are a lot of royal fans out there. Now, working level talks have been going on at the Korean Demilitarized Zone as final preparations are made for this week's historic meeting between Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in. In an apparent gesture of goodwill, South Korea has turned off loud speakers ahead blasting propaganda to the North.</p><p>The death toll following a suicide bombing attack in Kabul has risen to 57 people including at least five children. Afghanistan Interior Ministry says the bomber was on foot when he detonated his explosive device near a voter registration center. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p><p>Some of China's biggest tech companies are promising change after review of job ads exposed widespread gender discrimination. The report is being called 'Only Men Need Apply.' My colleague Matt Rivers has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Kristie, this is a pretty exhaustive report from Human Rights Watch and it lays out in further detail what I can tell you is a pretty general acknowledgment amongst women that I've spoken with in China that they often face severe sexism when applying for jobs.</p><p>The rights group looked at more than 36,000 job ads over five years and the report lists a whole bunch of different examples including the fact that one in five ads for China's 2018 National Civil Service called for men only or men-preferred and that many job applications for example as a salesperson called for females of a certain height, weight, and to be aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>But there is the more visual stuff and several big tech companies in China were called out. Take for example Alibaba, a massive tech company. Look at this recruitment video the company put out in 2016.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (UNTRANSLATED).</p><p>RIVERS (voice over): Another internet giant, Tencent, posted an article in 2016 quoting a male employee saying, quote, the reason I joined Tencent originated from a primal impulse. It was mainly because the ladies at human resources and that interviewed me were very pretty.</p><p>Both companies responded. Tencent said in part that the case is, quote, clearly do not reflect our values and that it had investigated the incident and is taking actions to make sure they won't happen again. Alibaba said it would, quote, conduct stricter reviews of the recruiting advertisements.</p><p>The company also said that almost half of its employees are women and, quote, women leaders account for one-third of our management positions.</p><p>CNN also asked China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security for comment but did not hear back.</p><p>(on camera): It is worth noting that the government officially bans gender discrimination in hiring and discriminatory content in advertising but the fact is that this stuff remains quite common, and Kristie, I've actually seen this kind of thing close up.</p><p>A very close female friend of mine was just telling me the other day about how she was applying for a job in the communications firm and the company required her to submit a picture of herself along with her resume as if how she looked could have some impact as to whether she gets the jobs.</p><p>So you spent enough time in China and you do hear those kinds of stories pretty often and this report I think definitely highlights that involving qualitative in a quantitative way. Kristie?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, you do hear those stories very often and the stories must end.

Ahead, the U.K. health secretary sounds off on social media companies at how their platforms are affecting children.</p><p>[08:35:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT: All right, coming to you live from Hong Kong, welcome back. This is \"News Stream.\" Now, this just in to CNN. The (INAUDIBLE) prime minister of Armenia has resigned. Protesters have been rallying over fears that the government is becoming authoritarian and that Serzh Sargsyan has been ruling for too long.</p><p>Sargsyan released a statement saying, the street movement is against my tenure. I am fulfilling your demand. Media reports say hundreds of demonstrators have been detained.</p><p>Now, let's go back to London for the breaking news story from earlier this hour. It is indeed a baby boy for the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton and with more details, we are joined now by Max Foster in London.</p><p>Max, it is a boy but still so many questions. What is going to be the name of the boy? When will the couple, the mother and father now of three, going to be making their appearance and how is Kate doing?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MAX FOSTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, the couple is doing well. That is what the statement from the palace said. The baby weighs 8 pounds, 7 ounces, so he is pretty healthy. The royal family has been informed and Prince William was there during the birth. They are in the building behind me.</p><p>It is about two and a half hours ago that the baby was born. The fact that the announcement has been made suggests that things are going as planned. If that is the case, we do expect them to appear on the steps behind us where the town crier was earlier as a family of five.</p><p>So the next thing, we will see the announcement over at Buckingham Palace, the formal announcement on an easel in paper form, if you like, and then we hope to see George and Charlotte perhaps arrive here to meet their new younger brother.</p><p>If not, we hope to see them altogether as family of five as I say on the steps. Huge amount media gathered here to capture that moment in royal history.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Very happy news. Congratulations to the ever expanding royal family. Max Foster on the story for us. Max, thank you.</p><p>Now, the British health secretary is issuing a stark warning to tech giants, focusing on protecting children online before it's too late.</p><p>In an open letter that was published over the weekend (INAUDIBLE), Jeremy Hunt said this, quote, I worry that a whole generation is being exposed to the emotional side effects of social media prematurely. And I worry that excessive reliance on social media is being normalized with parents being met with the unenviable choice of allowing children to use platforms they are just too young to cope with.</p><p>Let's bring in Samuel Burke. He joins us now from London. Samuel, just the other day, we were talking about YouTube and kids. Now, we have Jeremy Hunt slamming Google and others about failing to protect kids online. Tell us more about what Jeremy Hunt is saying.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hunt is going afer almost every big tech social media company that you can think of. He divided this into three important categories to him.</p><p>Number one, age verification. Number two, tools that can be used to limit the amount of time that children spend on a device or on a social network. And number three, anti-bullying tools like word detection that may be only bullies would use to go after other children.</p><p>And what the secretary is saying here is that basically he's heard a lot of platitudes in these tech companies. They've all come together and they said that they will work with him and he admits that there's been some progress but nothing tangible.</p><p>And what he's threatening here, what is most concerning for investors is legislation. He says he's not taking that off the table. So if the tech companies don't come forward and do something, that he and other secretaries will have to take it into their own hands and push for some type of legislation.</p><p>Two issues here. Number one, Kristie, the U.K. has a history of saying they're going to do things to tech companies whether it's terrorism- related, privacy-related or dealing with children and don't always follow through on their threats.</p><p>[08:40:02] The other issue here is the fact that so many of these tech companies have said they're going to do something, don't follow through, and then managed to come back and get the politicians on their side again. So we see this never ending cycle going on.</p><p>I just want to show you what Facebook is saying in response to this because they were one of the companies directly called out by Mr. Hunt. So if we can just put up the screen what they're saying in response, quote, we continue to invest heavily in developing tools for parents and age appropriate products to meet this challenge, and we look forward to continuing to work with our child safety partners and government to make progress in this area.</p><p>Google also said they want to keep on working with the government to do something here and that they have a program called \"Family Link.\" I think what's so interesting here is a lot of this does come down to age verification, Kristie, and what I've heard from so many advertisers and analysts, they want to make sure that the clients that they have are real people</p><p>Actually, there is a financial incentive here for Facebook and the others to verify the people that are using their platforms, whether they are 32 or whether they are 12, that when they know they are human beings, not bots, not Russian troll farms. And with that information, they can verify whether it is a child or the parents of a child. So there are incentives here both from the government and from the financial side to try and make this happen.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, there are incentives, but as you mentioned just a minute ago, that politicians in the U.K. tend to do a lot of posturing. They like to talk tough for the sake of talking tough. Tech companies, they promised to make changes but not necessarily follow through on the changes.</p><p>But this is a little bit different, because this is the year of Cambridge Analytica, this is the year of Facebook under pressure, Mark Zuckerberg going to Capitol Hill, do you feel that we are finally reaching a point, a moment of reckoning for the social media giants?</p><p>BURKE: If you would have asked me that question before Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before Congress, Kristie, I probably would have said yes. But during his testimony, you saw stock price go way back up for the company because people around the world were watching and realize that so many of the legislators at least in United States didn't know much of what they were talking about.</p><p>You had one senator asking, if you don't charge people, how do you make money? Well, Mark Zuckerberg answered the way most of us know but apparently not all the senators, that they have ads, point being that if they don't get the basics, how are they going to regulate this?</p><p>So often we see that the law just can't keep up with the technology so there are a lot of investors who say even if these governments around the world wanted to do something and took action, we are not even sure that they could take the right action or really clear what they are doing and how they will do it.</p><p>So now I think my answer might move a little toward no than from yes before the Zuckerberg testimony.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, the needle is always moving, right? Samuel Burke reporting live for us. Thank you so much. We will talk again soon.</p><p>And that is \"News Stream.\" I'm Kristie Lu Stout.

It has also fuelled xenophobic attacks against migrants in South Africa and been the driving force behind U.S. policy to forcibly separate families seeking safety. Meanwhile, it has contributed to the increasing criminalisation of those helping refugees in Europe.</p><p>Instead of addressing real problems like inequality, corruption, unemployment and economic hardship, political leaders on every continent are using minority groups as scapegoats for social and economic ills, spreading fake news about them and inciting discrimination, hostility and violence against them.</p><p>Social media platforms have allowed these hateful views to flourish largely unchecked. However, such hatred has galvanised activists the world over. Fighting for our human rights has never seemed more important.</p><p>The climate emergency</p><p>This decade is likely to be the hottest on record - another alarming sign of the climate emergency which is one of the greatest threats to human rights of our age.</p><p>Millions of people are already suffering from the catastrophic effects of climate change - from prolonged drought in Africa to devastating tropical storms across South-east Asia and the Caribbean, and heatwaves that have set record temperatures in Europe.Climate change threatens to exacerbate inequalities between developed and developing countries; between different ethnicities and classes; between genders, generations and communities - with the most disadvantaged groups hardest hit. It is already having harmful impacts on our rights to life, health, food, water, housing and livelihoods.</p><p>All the science suggests that extreme weather will only get worse, unless governments take urgent action to slash carbon emissions within the shortest possible timeframe, through a transition that protects the human rights of disadvantaged groups. However, virtually all governments are failing to put in place effective plans, and there is still resistance from some of the biggest emitters; notably the USA, which under President Trump has started the process to formally exit from the Paris Agreement.</p><p>More than ever, we need to stand together to hold our political leaders to account. The Fridays for Future movement, started in 2018 by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg and her colleagues, shows us that change is possible. We cannot afford to fail.</p><p>Violence against women</p><p>The struggle to protect women and girls, and others from all forms of gender-based violence, was as hard-fought as ever. Sexual violence continued to be used as a weapon of war, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where in one case out of many, more than 300 people were raped in four days by armed men in Walikale, North Kivu. Amnesty International also documented the horrific impact of rape in other conflict zones such as Iraq, Somalia, Darfur, Nigeria and South Sudan.</p><p>In many places, the very people meant to keep society safe are the ones attacking women and girls. In Mexico, women reported torture and other forms of violence such as electric shocks to the genitals, groping of breasts and rape with objects - during arrest and interrogation by police and armed forces as part of the country's 'war on drugs'. Homicide rates for women have risen sharply throughout the decade, with Mexican authorities failing to take effective action to solve gender-based violence.</p><p>In a breakthrough, the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers adopted the landmark Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence - which Amnesty International was involved in drafting - on 7 April 2011. Recently, Sweden and Greece became some of the few European countries who changed their laws to recognise that sex without consent is rape.</p><p>One of the most iconic online movements of the decade, #MeToo, brought millions of women together to stand up to sexual violence, harassment and assault. #MeToo has spurred change everywhere from Hollywood studios to remote villages in Nepal and northern Nigeria.</p><p>Sexual and reproductive rights</p><p>Although some 50 countries have changed their laws to allow greater access to abortion over the last 25 years, sexual and reproductive rights remain contested. One thing that unites all successful campaigns to reform abortion laws has been the bravery of women who speak out and demand the right to decide what happens to their own bodies.</p><p>Reproductive rights have come under threat elsewhere. Attempts to further restrict access to abortion sparked nationwide protests in Poland. Near-total bans or laws further restricting access to abortion have been introduced in several US states. President Trump's reinstatement of the 'global gag' rule, which blocks US federal international funding for NGOs that provide abortion counselling or referrals, or that advocate for decriminalising abortion, was a massive blow to women's rights globally. So were the US administration's attempts to remove references to 'sexual and reproductive health' from high-level UN policy documents endorsed by Members States,</p><p>From Ireland to South Korea, activists have helped dispel the stigma and secrecy surrounding abortion by sharing their stories. In Argentina and Poland, over a million women have marched to demand that their voices be heard. In the last year alone, legal abortion services opened up in Ireland and is on its way to becoming a reality in Northern Ireland too, after years of campaigning by groups, including Amnesty International. There was more good news in Argentina, where president-elect Alberto Fern\\xE1ndez promised he would move to legalise abortion after taking office in December 2019.</p><p>LGBTI rights</p><p>No doubt the LGBTI rights movement is more visible than ever before, but progress has been mixed in the past decade. In many countries, LGBTI people are still harassed in the streets, beaten up, arrested and sometimes killed simply because of who they are or who they love.</p><p>Consensual same-sex sexual activity is a crime in 70 countries, and the death penalty is imposed as a punishment in a number of countries, including in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen. Sometimes, hostility directed at LGBTI people is stoked by their own governments. In Chechnya for example, a state-sponsored campaign led to the abduction, torture and even killing of people believed to be gay or lesbian</p><p>There have been a few momentous steps taken this past year. A landmark ruling in India decriminalised consensual same-sex relations, marking a critical milestone in the three-decades-old struggle by LGBTI activists and their allies in India. Taiwan became the first in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage after passing a historic law on 17 May 2019. And Pakistan passed one of the most progressive legislations in the world on transgender rights, becoming the first Asian country and one of the few in the world to legally recognise self-perceived gender identity.</p><p>But for many LGBTI people around the globe who have been persecuted, maimed, killed, shamed, set on fire, refused entry into hospitals, shunned, raped and marginalised, there is still a long way to go. Governments must ensure that their rights are protected, and that discrimination on the grounds of real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity is abolished.</p><p>Big Tech and data privacy</p><p>The decade took an Orwellian turn with the rise of Big Tech companies, such as Facebook and Google harvesting and monetising our personal data, and the consequent omnipresent surveillance of billions of people posing a systemic threat to our human rights.While, at the beginning of the decade, we were all lulled into a false sense of security, believing we were simply sharing photos with a few friends, it became increasingly clear that our shared information could be exploited as both a weapon of influence and a means of spreading dangerous disinformation and online abuse. A decade later, the so-called 'influence industry' in the form of social media platforms, internet search engines, data brokers and tech companies analysing our personal data and trading in predictions about people's interests, characteristics, and ultimately behaviour for marketing and advertising, has become one of the biggest and most sinister societal threats of our time.</p><p>We now live in a world where insidious control of our digital lives has far-reaching consequences that go even beyond our privacy - disinformation and information manipulation is a continual battleground, with serious implications on our freedom of opinion, expression and thought. In polls, huge numbers of individuals say they are worried about the influence Big Tech has on their lives, concerned both about data revealing too much about them, and about data being used by state authorities to target them.</p><p>It took time for the human rights risks posed by Big Tech to become clear, partly because civil society and tech companies have traditionally worked together to keep the Internet free from state meddling, and by extension from regulation. A classic example is the defence of end-to-end encryption. This work is important. But by seeing the human rights threat as stemming from government surveillance and censorship, we have somehow failed to fully realise the magnitude of the threat caused by Big Tech's ubiquitous presence.</p><p>As we move into a new decade, it will be governments' responsibility to take action to protect us from corporate human rights abuses, including enforcing robust data protection laws and effective regulation of Big Tech, in line with international human rights law.</p><p>Source: Amnesty International</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

But either way, newly empowered patients will increasingly demand modern standards of care, higher quality, and better speed and affordability.     </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what? New attitudes, new business models, new hurdles and new entrants ready to take health care to the next level: it makes for a daunting prospect for medtechs and other commercial players who want to continue shaping the direction of the health care industry. But do they really have a choice?     </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Much to the routine consternation of the medical technology industry, health care has been famously slow at reinventing itself and leveraging the digital technology revolution of the 21st century. A lot of health care remains rooted in the last century, as other, albeit largely privately financed industry sectors, have sailed past it in terms of embracing innovation.</p><p>But matters are now changing in health care too, which, although behind the game, is now making promises about the radically different shape of health care to come in the decade to 2030. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/companies/198600591\">Philips Healthcare</url>, one of the standard-bearers of IT-assisted health care, has leveraged its Intensive Ambulatory Care (IAC) telehealth program, built upon a population management software platform, to care for patients with complex conditions at home, which reduces hospital admissions. The group believes that digitally enabled health systems will by the end of the next decade be making full use of virtual reality and AI, offering networked care and prioritizing patient experience quality. Individuals, in turn, will have adopted proactive approaches to updating their data.</p><p>At the other end of the medtech scale, UK orthopedic company Corin Orthopaedics Holdings Ltd., which has recently undergone a change of ownership, has developed its own value-based business model centered around IT-assisted personalized delivery of hips and knee implants. Recently acquired by Permira, its strategy as explained recently to In Vivo is to meet the competition head on by focusing on information about the patient to enable personalized surgery and/or rehab, for better outcomes and decreased costs.\u00a0(<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//IV005141//\">\"Wright Place Wright Time Ortho Specialists Focus Is Paying Off\" \"In Vivo\"</url>)</p><p>Philips and Corin are just two examples of how the tide is finally turning, even if the changes are largely led by industry. Nonetheless, governments and policymakers are making efforts to catch up. Last month, UK prime minister Theresa May issued several future-oriented \"grand challenges\" to the wider national industrial ecosystem, two of which were health and well-being-related: transforming the prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of cancer, diabetes, heart disease and dementia by 2030, using data, AI and innovation; and ensuring an extra five healthy, independent years of life by 2035, in the healthy ageing grand challenge. Cynics might say that if Brexit-beset Britain is on the case, then the health care world must finally be in motion.</p><p>But more proof of this comes from Deloitte LLP, which released a report, The Future Awakens - Life Science and Health Care Predictions to 2022, in late 2017. The messages and predictions contained in the report, outlined below, have recently been gaining air time at medtech industry fora in Europe, including, most recently, Europe Medtec (Stuttgart, Germany) and Medtech Innovation (Coventry, UK).</p><p>Global health care expenditure is expected to reach $8.7 trillion by 2020</p><p>Some statements and predictions in the report might sound overly confident, Deloitte acknowledges, but the trends will nonetheless be seen regionally at least, or maybe even down at individual hospital level. That was the rider given by Mark Steedman, a manager at Deloitte's Center for Health Solutions, as he addressed Europe Medtec attendees in Stuttgart last month. </p><p>Karen Taylor, Deloitte's Center for Health Solutions research director and the report's author, echoed the sentiment a week later. Detailing the report's six life science and health care trend predictions for MedTech Innovation delegates, Taylor issued the proviso that they represented an optimistic view and perhaps not all of the initiatives would be fully realized within the five years. \"But the evidence today does inspire confidence, because things are happening, and not just in little silos,\" she tells In Vivo. \"It's not too far away in the imagination,\" she contends.</p><p>So the direction of travel is set, and the journey speed is increasing, in spite of the fact that the cost of health care funding is still not matching the average 4.2% rise per year in global health care expenditure, which will reach $8.7 trillion by 2020. Pharma spending alone will rise by 5% per year in the five years to 2022 - twice the rate of the previous five years. </p><p>Diagnostic And Digital Tech To The Fore</p><p>As for medtech, the global market is primed to reach $529 billion in 2022, with sales of in vitro diagnostics set to total over $67 billion by 2020. Funding for IVDs remains behind the curve, in spite of its central role in treatment decisions. In Europe's largest IVD market, Germany, spending by the sickness funds on lab services and diagnostics was 2.91% of total spending in 2016, its lowest for six years, the German Diagnostics Industry Association (VDGH) said last month. And while the sickness fund spend has increased by 71% over that period, spending on IVDs alone has risen by just 61%.</p><p>That is surely the wrong path. In fact, diagnostic medicine is one of the two principal domains for the future of health technologies (along with digital), according to Sir John Bell GBE, Regius Chair of Medicine at the University of Oxford (UK) and author of the UK's report, Life Sciences Industrial Strategy. There will be huge opportunities is that space because if a diagnostic isn't targeted and precise, the therapy won't work, he believes. The market for precision medicine is expected to reach $87 billion by 2023, says Deloitte.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Six Of The Best For 2022 </p><p>Moving forward to 2022, Deloitte's predictions from 2017 are having effects on health care delivery in the following ways: </p><p>                                  Individuals are more in control of managing their own health in 2022. This is largely down to expanded knowledge generally and to genetic profiling in particular by the \"genome generation,\" which is, by now, very involved in its own health care. People visiting physicians in 2022 are more aware of their conditions and more active in preventing and managing them, ready to spend time and money to stay healthy. They interact better with health care practitioners (HCPs), but they are also more demanding, keen to be proactive and preemptive. Monitoring alone is often not enough for the category of patients that Deloitte calls the \"quantified self.\" </p><p>Evidence of this is seen in the proliferation of self-care and monitoring apps, like OurPath with its initial focus on weight loss and diabetes prevention. (<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//MT121495//\">\"Test Beds Digital Hubs And Innovation Tariffs Top the News At UKs NHS Expo\" \"Medtech Insight\"</url>)\u00a0Providing scientific evidence to coach people through a weight loss program, including advising on sleep patterns and eating habits, is delivered over a six-week program. The app originator struck partnerships with large pharma companies and National Health Service (NHS) England based on its ability to reduce the progression from prediabetes to clinical disease. Saving money is one of its main goals. </p><p>Biosensing wearables have become fairly commonplace in 2022, and individuals are being encouraged to use the data derived to further improve prevention. Older people have become better adopters of connected devices and virtual assistants, meaning this demographic is now monitored and better cared for at home. Similarly, the growing confidence in telemedicine in 2022 has meant that patients are opting for it even for an initial consultation. People in remote areas are benefiting from programs such as SENDoc, a multinational northern European initiative to evaluate the use of wearable sensor systems to support independent living in rural, ageing communities. </p><p>Incentives are being offered for good health care behavior, via gamification and other initiatives. The system is benefiting from policymakers' more active roles in ensuring the ecosystem is ready. In May 2018, Scotland issued a new national Digital Health and Care Strategy to better seize the opportunities offered by digital and ensure that data science becomes mainstream in health and social care. This measure aims to reshape and equip services for the future, while further empowering users.</p><p>Such actions are welcomed, for although individuals have taken on a lot more responsibility to make the system work, led by go-ahead countries such as the Netherlands, there has been a disconnect in that health care systems have not helped as much as they should in terms of funding, Steedman tells In Vivo.</p><p>On a macro level, environmental planners are routinely incorporating health into all planning and development ideas leading to \"smart cities.\" </p><p>                                  Digital technologies are delivering patient-centric care. Digital technologies have transformed the culture in health care, and \"smart health care\" is delivering more patient-centric, effective care.\u00a0Clinical roles are being optimized and staff are using cognitive technologies to deliver seamless integrated care designed around patient needs. The vision is for robotic process automation (RPA) and AI to coordinate internal clinical workflows, allowing nursing and other staff more time to provide care.</p><p>\"That is the goal that we are hoping for 2022,\" says Steedman. The importance of robotics and AI was not identified so acutely in Deloitte's 2014 report, Future Awakens, which predicted the scenario in 2020. There has been a major shift there.</p><p>Back-office functions and supply chain activities are increasingly automated in 2022, and clinical decision-making is being enabled by centralized digital command centers. This is certainly happening in pockets of activity. One example is the Mercy Virtual Care Center in Missouri (<url normalizedValue=\"http://invivo.pharmaintelligence.informa.com//IV005305//\">\"Digital And Connected Care Are Pushing On An Open Door But Is Medtech Ready\" \"In Vivo\"</url>). It opened in 2015, covering some 40 hospitals in seven neighboring states. It has no beds, and no inpatients, but has 300 staff onsite and another 300 offsite who monitor patients virtually by telehealth. In 2017, the center was able to treat some 1,300 ICU patients in their own homes, saving $50 million. Average patient stay length in the satellite hospitals has been cut by one third.\u00a0 </p><p>Steedman believes that we will see a lot more telehealth and these types of monitoring technologies, proving that patient don't necessarily need to be in a hospital to be treated. </p><p>Patients are increasingly taking digital control of their data. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.patientsknowbest.com/\">Patients Know Best</url>\u00a0is a reference system that allows patients to control all of their data. They can see their full medical record and share it with health care professionals wherever and whenever needed. They can also add their own data, and are currently able to transfer data from over 100 wearables and devices. A number of different devices and wearables can also link into the record.</p><p>The rise of the electronic health/medical record (EHR/EMR) has fueled the notion of the paperless hospital, which has caused quite a stir but also some over-heightened expectations, including in the UK, Steedman observes. That, plus the use of smartphones and tablets by nursing staff, will make a huge difference, in time, in terms of accurate and early diagnosis of obesity and depression and other conditions with the help of customized questions and ability to make treatment decisions.</p><p>                                  Medtech and pharma innovation processes are becoming industrialized. Automated processes have accelerated pathways for regulatory compliance, reimbursement and supply chain activities, which means a certain redeployment of staff in pre-automation manual roles. Market access is quicker and more predictable, in what Steedman calls the fourth industrial revolution, which has unfolded as advanced cognitive technologies have improved core processes.</p><p>Product launch preparations have been standardized and predicative analytics is being used for market research, to improve the consistency and impact of product launches. Standardization and consolidation are the core of the first of three phases in the industrialization of health care, says Deloitte. The next stage is automation, leading to high-frequency output based on quality and structured data, and the third is utilizing machine learning and AI to increase the pace and productivity of these processes further. </p><p>Companies are operating more like software organizations, focused on managing and analyzing data to create value.\u00a0 The industrialization process also factors in with new technologies such as blockchain, to enable safe data linkages. Steedman comments that the goal of embedding privacy and security in technologies is solution agnostic, so whether blockchain is the answer is still up for debate. But the expectations around security of data have risen exponentially, in the wake of high-profile stories about the wrongful use of personally identifiable information. National blockchain contracts are emerging (Dubai and Estonia), but it may be in this instance a case of waiting to see the evidence of outcomes before it takes off.</p><p>A key benefit of industrialization is the reduced time needed to set up contracts, with improved transparency, simplified processes and enhanced stakeholder collaboration cutting the time needed from up to eight weeks to between one and 10 days, making the \"contract in a day\" an attainable goal.</p><p>                                  AI and RWE are really unlocking the value of data. Data are set to \"be the new health care currency.\" In the past, systems generated a lot of data without necessarily capturing the information well. The next challenge is to utilize the captured data, and that is what Deloitte wants to see happen in the coming years to 2022. </p><p>The pace and adoption of technology has increased markedly during the past three years alone, as witness the deluge of health apps (260,000 were made available by publishers in 2016) and pharma moving toward a patient-centric approach. </p><p>Turning real-world evidence into real-world data and using that data to make impactful changes to the health care and life science industries will be really transformative. As the cost of health care is rising, the challenge is to utilize data and the IoT to reduce cost - deploy automation more, speed up processes and use data in ways that haven't been instituted before. The Google subsidiary DeepMind is trying to create ways to make patient data safe. It has conducted much work on AI and is trialing NHS projects. It is now aiming to develop world-leading standards on encryption.</p><p>Another example given by Steedman is the Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, which is utilizing data to understand individuals' genetic makeup, and using the knowledge to target specific diseases, understand individual susceptibilities and be able to address them both in the future. </p><p>                                  Evidence of future possibilities is already emerging. Exponential advances in life-extending and precision therapies are already improving outcomes. The past year has seen the launch of CAR-T cell therapies. They are in their infancy, but will be transformative, with CAR-T technologies likely to play in a market of $10 billion in the next 10 to 15 years. Whether this technology can be extended to solid tumors or other types of cancer is another matter, but in terms of where we were a year ago, it's pretty exciting, says Steedman. </p><p>The US, again, has proved that it is ready to put programs around these developing technologies. The 21st Century Cures Act set aside funding for cancer, brain, precision and regenerative medicine, and provided for regulatory change too. The aim of such programs is to address conditions like dementia, which affects 50 million people globally, but which has been without a drug breakthrough in 15 years - that was when the US FDA last approved one. \"That's going to be a big push. Whether pharma can create a dementia drug will be the proof of whether the future of health care comes true or not,\" Steedman contends.</p><p>                                  New entrants in health care. These are disrupting health care and the blurring the boundaries between the different stakeholders in the health care and life sciences industries. This is already happening. In 2017, the Amazon-JP Morgan-Berkshire Hathaway combination was one of the year's biggest talking points, and yet few people still know what this combination is going to do. \"But they have the potential, the power and the expertise to apply what they do in their own industries and apply them to health to really disrupt what's going on now,\" says Steedman.</p><p>We are seeing all the big tech giants getting involved in health, whether conservatively or broader scale, but Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, and the like, are laying the ground for a revolution in health care by 2022. Health-centric devices such as the Apple Watch, and that group's ResearchKit, which is already producing medical insights and discoveries; and its personal care service (CareKit) are proof that the disruptors are putting a lot of investment into what they think will take health care to the next level.</p><p>Global Trends</p><p>Across all the six predictions, Deloitte sees three key enablers that will make the vision of 2022 become a reality.

The government's move - one of the first by the new Conservative administration - comes after it received over 2,000 responses from, amongst others, the voluntary sector, think tanks, and leading technology companies under the umbrella of the Internet Association. Since then, some of the more draconian proposals appear to have been tempered and there are tentative indications that the government may have accepted freedom of speech concerns. However, there is so far little sign that the response will address some of the more fundamental issues with the proposals identified by commentators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aspiring to make the UK the world's safest place to be online, the proposals are aimed at a multitude of social ills; from widely understood scourges, such as terrorist content and child sexual exploitation material, to less clearly defined phenomena, such as cyber-bullying, trolling and intimidation. The government is committed to tackling such problems by imposing a duty of care on organisations facilitating the sharing of user-generated content online, encompassing tech giants, social media companies, public discussion forums and even retailers inviting online product reviews.</p><p>Regulating the amount of an individual's screen time risks seeming both arbitrary and Orwellian. For some critics, the government's enthusiasm for algorithmic methods of tackling online harms, though well-intentioned, has drawbacks.</p><p>Michael Drury and Julian Hayes </p><p>Partners at BCL Solicitors LLP</p><p>Such entities would be obliged to take reasonable steps to keep their users safe and prevent others from coming to harm as a direct consequence of activity on their services. The duty would be underpinned by legally enforceable codes issued - initially at least - by the communications regulator, Ofcom. The proposals include senior management liability and substantial financial penalties for breaches linked to annual turnover or the volume of illegal material online. Overseas companies would be obliged to appoint a UK-based director to facilitate enforcement action, with a levy on tech companies under discussion to fund the additional costs of regulation.</p><p>Foreshadowed by the prime minister in a speech to the UN General Assembly in September 2019, and confirmed in the Queen's Speech last December, the UK proposals are part of a world-wide shift towards greater regulation of the online sphere. High profile tragedies such as the Christchurch mosque shootings in 2019, online threats to national security and democracy, and a perceived lack of accountability by dominant tech giants are driving this trend, generating a disparate patchwork of national strategies to counter online harms.</p><p>These include Australia's legislation against sharing abhorrent violent material, India's proposals to impose liability on social media companies and internet service providers (ISPs) for hosting unlawful content, and Singapore's protection from online falsehoods law which prohibits the online dissemination of lies which would diminish confidence in the government. In Europe, too, plans are underway to unveil an EU-wide Digital Services Act imposing mandatory take down notices for illegal content and disinformation, enforced by a new regulator armed with investigatory, corrective and fining powers. The EU proposals have led to intensive lobbying in Brussels by Big Tech companies but the need for greater regulation is now all but accepted.</p><p>Controversial though some of these overseas measures have been, they arguably represent an assertion of governmental control on the online space, something which had been de facto ceded to platform providers themselves, obliging them to assume an expensive oversight role over uploads to their platforms which they may have been unwilling or ill-equipped to take on.</p><p>When first published, the UK proposals were both eye-catching in their approach and eye-watering in the punitive measures they contained, with the power to order ISPs to block websites and apps from use in the UK in the worst cases. The government's imminent response is believed to drop such extreme measures. The White Paper also caused alarm at the potential threat to freedom of speech, with fears that anxious platform providers would overzealously filter content to avoid fines for causing vaguely-defined online harms. In his UN speech about emerging technologies last September, however, Boris Johnson implicitly acknowledged this concern, highlighting the need to find the right balance between freedom and control, to avoid censorship, repression and control, and to uphold freedom of opinion and expression.</p><p>It remains to be seen how the UK government will address other fundamental issues raised about its approach to online harms. For example, commentators have suggested that, when much of what we view on social media is dictated by unforeseen algorithms monitoring our behaviour, an alternative approach to tackling online harms might be to clarify and regulate their use by Big Tech organisations.</p><p>The precise definition of some of the harm's within the scope of the proposals remains problematic. What constitutes disinformation and what counts as excessive screen time, both harms within the government's sights? Regulating the amount of an individual's screen time risks seeming both arbitrary and Orwellian. For some critics, the government's enthusiasm for algorithmic methods of tackling online harms, though well-intentioned, has drawbacks, imposing prohibitive costs on smaller start-up tech companies and promoting an unrealistic expectation of security such that, when online harms nevertheless occur, the media will demand even stricter controls. Arguably, that leads to a vicious cycle of ever greater protective surveillance which ultimately undermines the freedoms and way of life which the measures were designed to protect.</p><p>Notwithstanding such misgivings, with the government's parliamentary majority and the backing of the Opposition, the draft legislation is is certain to pass into law, marking a further step towards the end of the era of online self-regulation.</p><p>Michael Drury and Julian Hayes are partners at London-based BCL Solicitors LLP Source: Euronews </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2345017404</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2S-T0H1-DY0W-41NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1061\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Office of Communications-UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Johnson, Boris</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom--UK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Singapore</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Product reviews</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Censorship</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet service providers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social networks</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>User generated content</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Speeches</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bullying</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Screen time</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 926130</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The government's move - one of the first by the new Conservative administration - comes after it received over 2,000 responses from, amongst others, the voluntary sector, think tanks, and leading technology companies under the umbrella of the Internet Association. Since then, some of the more draconian proposals appear to have been tempered and there are tentative indications that the government may have accepted freedom of speech concerns. However, there is so far little sign that the response will address some of the more fundamental issues with the proposals identified by commentators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aspiring to make the UK the world's safest place to be online, the proposals are aimed at a multitude of social ills; from widely understood scourges, such as terrorist content and child sexual exploitation material, to less clearly defined phenomena, such as cyber-bullying, trolling and intimidation. The government is committed to tackling such problems by imposing a duty of care on organisations facilitating the sharing of user-generated content online, encompassing tech giants, social media companies, public discussion forums and even retailers inviting online product reviews.</p><p>Regulating the amount of an individual's screen time risks seeming both arbitrary and Orwellian. For some critics, the government's enthusiasm for algorithmic methods of tackling online harms, though well-intentioned, has drawbacks.</p><p>Michael Drury and Julian Hayes</p><p>Partners at BCL Solicitors LLP</p><p>Such entities would be obliged to take reasonable steps to keep their users safe and prevent others from coming to harm as a direct consequence of activity on their services. The duty would be underpinned by legally enforceable codes issued - initially at least - by the communications regulator, Ofcom. The proposals include senior management liability and substantial financial penalties for breaches linked to annual turnover or the volume of illegal material online. Overseas companies would be obliged to appoint a UK-based director to facilitate enforcement action, with a levy on tech companies under discussion to fund the additional costs of regulation.</p><p>Foreshadowed by the prime minister in a speech to the UN General Assembly in September 2019, and confirmed in the Queen's Speech last December, the UK proposals are part of a world-wide shift towards greater regulation of the online sphere. High profile tragedies such as the Christchurch mosque shootings in 2019, online threats to national security and democracy, and a perceived lack of accountability by dominant tech giants are driving this trend, generating a disparate patchwork of national strategies to counter online harms.</p><p>These include Australia's legislation against sharing abhorrent violent material, India's proposals to impose liability on social media companies and internet service providers (ISPs) for hosting unlawful content, and Singapore's protection from online falsehoods law which prohibits the online dissemination of lies which would diminish confidence in the government. In Europe, too, plans are underway to unveil an EU-wide Digital Services Act imposing mandatory take down notices for illegal content and disinformation, enforced by a new regulator armed with investigatory, corrective and fining powers. The EU proposals have led to intensive lobbying in Brussels by Big Tech companies but the need for greater regulation is now all but accepted.</p><p>Controversial though some of these overseas measures have been, they arguably represent an assertion of governmental control on the online space, something which had been de facto ceded to platform providers themselves, obliging them to assume an expensive oversight role over uploads to their platforms which they may have been unwilling or ill-equipped to take on.</p><p>When first published, the UK proposals were both eye-catching in their approach and eye-watering in the punitive measures they contained, with the power to order ISPs to block websites and apps from use in the UK in the worst cases. The government's imminent response is believed to drop such extreme measures. The White Paper also caused alarm at the potential threat to freedom of speech, with fears that anxious platform providers would overzealously filter content to avoid fines for causing vaguely-defined online harms. In his UN speech about emerging technologies last September, however, Boris Johnson implicitly acknowledged this concern, highlighting the need to find the right balance between freedom and control, to avoid censorship, repression and control, and to uphold freedom of opinion and expression.</p><p>It remains to be seen how the UK government will address other fundamental issues raised about its approach to online harms. For example, commentators have suggested that, when much of what we view on social media is dictated by unforeseen algorithms monitoring our behaviour, an alternative approach to tackling online harms might be to clarify and regulate their use by Big Tech organisations.</p><p>The precise definition of some of the harm's within the scope of the proposals remains problematic. What constitutes disinformation and what counts as excessive screen time, both harms within the government's sights? Regulating the amount of an individual's screen time risks seeming both arbitrary and Orwellian. For some critics, the government's enthusiasm for algorithmic methods of tackling online harms, though well-intentioned, has drawbacks, imposing prohibitive costs on smaller start-up tech companies and promoting an unrealistic expectation of security such that, when online harms nevertheless occur, the media will demand even stricter controls. Arguably, that leads to a vicious cycle of ever greater protective surveillance which ultimately undermines the freedoms and way of life which the measures were designed to protect.</p><p>Notwithstanding such misgivings, with the government's parliamentary majority and the backing of the Opposition, the draft legislation is is certain to pass into law, marking a further step towards the end of the era of online self-regulation.</p><p>Michael Drury and Julian Hayes are partners at London-based BCL Solicitors LLP Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2N-KP21-DXMS-83BW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1059\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Infections have almost doubled in the last week to 2,500. Over 2000 cases are active infections, with 87 people dying from the virus and 400 having now recovered. Movement is permitted providing face masks are worn. Several businesses including restaurants, viewing centres and places of worship will remain closed. Gatherings of more than 20 remain banned. Yet the easing of restrictions has drawn sharp criticism. This weekend, the head of the Nigerian Medical Association said: \"The easing of the lockdown even in phases is very premature,\" and could portend a \"frightening scenario\". Many African countries including Nigeria, swiftly adopted restrictive lockdowns, travel bans and other measures to curb Covid-19, far earlier than in many other parts of the world. Yet a worsening economy, and stretched security services, have diminished the limit of Nigeria's ability to withstand the effects that the lockdown has wrought. The government has provided support to only a small fraction of millions most affected. During the lockdown, the number of testing laboratories have significantly improved to 18 from four two months ago. But low levels of testing in Nigeria have only slowly risen, with 17,500 tests administered in total. Heightening fears further are hundreds of additional deaths in Kano, Nigeria's second largest city, which have now been confirmed as linked to Covid-19. </p><p>Local media reports of residents fleeing Kano despite a ban on inter-state travel have heightened concerns that a potential epicentre is not secure.

There are four countries where we see no substantial changes in the last 14 days - Poland, Romania, Sweden, and the UK. All the others we really see this substantial decrease.\"Ammon said that lockdowns in Europe have reduced the overall transmission of coronavirus by 45% compared with 8 April. \"As of Saturday it appears the initial wave of transmission has passed its peak,\" she said.Ammon sounded cautious about the rollout of masks to the public as a way of controlling the spread given the lack of evidence for their utility. \"Wearing a face mask should always be seen as an additional tool to hand-washing and social distancing measures,\" she said. Ammon added that there was a risk that masks would give citizens a \"false sense of security\".She said: This is a marathon not a sprint. People's expectations about the pandemic situation, duration, effect it'll continue to have on their lives for the foreseeable future needs to be managed.

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with secretary of state Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.10.38am BSTThe French prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe will present more details of the government's deconfinement or end of lockdown plan as well as the bill extending the \"state of health emergency\" until 24 July, to the S\u00e9nat, the upper house of parliament, on Monday afternoon. The government is hoping for a quick passage through the house and on to the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale tomorrow where the debate is likely to be more heated, but where Emmanuel Macron's centrist government has a large majority.France's health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran warned at the weekend that the date for the end of lockdown of 11 May is not set in stone and if there is no significant continuation of the drop in the spread of the virus, the date would be put back.However, the figures are continuing to look encouraging and the curve is still heading downwards, so France will almost certainly end the lockdown in a week. But the return to more normal life will be \"progressive\" and will largely depend on where the virus is still circulating and how hospital intensive care units are coping.A map, updated every day, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/05/coronavirus-live-news-who-and-five-eyes-reject-chinese-lab-theory-as-global-deaths-pass-250000\">has been published</url> dividing the country's departments into \"red\", \"orange\" and \"green\", indicating which areas may still face some lockdown regulations. The orange departments will be declared red or green when a definitive map is published on Thursday. In any case, the French have been told not to make journeys of more than 100km without good professional or major family reasons after 11 May for the foreseeable future.One of Macron's main objectives in ending the lockdown is to reopen the country's schools, but this is proving problematic. Nursery and primary schools will reopen classes on Tuesday, but with a maximum of between 10 and 15 pupils. The two lower years of secondary schools, will return the following Monday.In Paris, City Hall estimates only 10% of nursery and primary school pupils will be able to return on Tuesday. The opening of classes is hampered because the city will almost certainly remain \"red\" on the coronavirus map and many city school buildings make it impossible to impose social distancing on youngsters.

The classification is made based on number of active coronavirus cases, the doubling rate of cases, and the level of testing and surveillance in the area. In urban red zones that are not marked as containment zones - which are areas sealed off due to coronavirus cases - private offices can open at 33% capacity. Construction activity can also resume, as long as workers reside on site. Manufacturing of essential goods and IT hardware is permitted. E-commerce activities are only allowed for essential goods, while standalone shops are able to open. In rural red zones, all agricultural, construction and industrial activity is permitted.

Acknowledging that every death is one too many, he says: \"In terms of the deaths... we're at the lowest level predicted, and we might not even hit that.\" Then he appears to lay out his re-election strategy, pretty much in dot-point form:1. Get rid of the virus 2. Get the country back to work \"quickly and safely\" 3. Economically, he says quarter three will be a \"transition\" quarter, improved in quarter 4, and then a \"great year\" next year. It's six months exactly until the US election will be held (3 November), and he is asked about whether he will hold election rallies: \"Everyone wants the rallies... but I don't think you can a rally with an empty stadium,\" he says, adding that he hopes he will be able to to them in the last couple of months.

We are all playing a complicated game of chess or poker...but it's not checkers, I'll tell you that.\" \"Tariffs at a minimum are the greatest negotiating tool,\" he says. He then attacks the World Health Organization for their involvement in managing the virus. He says the WHO missed \"every call\" on the virus. He's also strongly targeting China: \"Don't forget China tried to blame it first on some of our soldiers. Then they tried to blame it on Europe.\" Asked if the virus came from a lab, by intent or by accident, he says: \"I think they made a horrible mistake and they didn't want to admit it. \"My opinion is they made a mistake, they tried to cover it... they couldn't put out the fire. They stopped people going into China but didn't stop people going around the world. \"They knew they had a problem. I think they were embarrassed about the problem,\" Trump says. Will this affect his relationship with President Xi? He's reluctant to blame Xi directly. \"I did a great trade deal with him. I'm not going to say anything.

He indicates the US intelligence community will release a report on the virus on Monday. He's now being asked about what measures are being taken to protect nursing homes: \"The nursing home issue is ground zero\" \"What we're doing is legislation immediately about how many people can be in (visit)... it's the one thing about this disease that everyone has learned... is that it's so contagious.\" He reminds viewers that nursing homes are a matter for states.

After more than a month of being cooped up at the White House, Trump returned from a weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and participated in a virtual town hall, hosted Sunday night by Fox News Channel, from inside the Lincoln Memorial. He pushed for an economic reopening, one his advisers believe will be essential for his reelection chances this November. \"We have to get it back open safely but as quickly as possible,\" Trump said. Though the administration's handling of the pandemic, particularly its ability to conduct widespread testing, has come under fierce scrutiny, the president defended the response and said the nation was ready to begin reopening. \"I'll tell you one thing. We did the right thing and I really believe we saved a million and a half lives,\" the president said. But he also broke with the assessment of his senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, saying it was \"too soon to say if the federal government was overseeing a success story.\" Trump's impatience also flashed. While noting that states would go at their own pace in returning to normal, with ones harder hit by the coronavirus going slower, he said of some states, \"frankly I think aren't going fast enough\" and singled out Virginia, which has a Democratic governor and legislature. And he urged the nation's schools and universities to return to classes this fall. 12.52am BSTThis is the setting for Tump's Fox News town hall, by the way: I'm sorry, what?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/05/coronavirus-live-news-who-and-five-eyes-reject-chinese-lab-theory-as-global-deaths-pass-250000\">pic.twitter.com/dKvjfG8SMq</url> - Kevin M.

He's criticising the Democrat's response to the pandemic, implying it would suit their political purposes if the virus outcome was worse. He talks about hydroxychloroquine, reminding viewers that he doesn't own shares in the company that produces it: \"We don't lose anything with hydroxy.... people aren't dying from it.\" He's asked why he didn't act earlier on the virus, and says his intelligence was that \"on January 23 I was told there could be a virus coming but it was of no real import,\" and then reminds viewers he stopped flights from China early.

Head over there for live developments in the pandemic worldwide: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is taking the lead in pressing a hard line against Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. Pompeo, in an interview Sunday on ABC, said there was \"enormous evidence\" that the new coronavirus came out of a Wuhan lab - not a wet market, as most scientists suggest. \"Remember, China has a history of infecting the world and they have a history of running substandard laboratories,\" he said. Pressed in the interview, Pompeo, formerly the CIA chief, walked back his statement that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was \"man-made,\" an idea explicitly rejected by US intelligence. Chinese state media on Monday responded with harsh commentary, denouncing his remarks as \"insane\" and saying, \"Evil Pompeo is wantonly spewing poison and spreading lies.\" Pompeo has also joined Trump in attacking the World Health Organization, which said Monday it had no evidence that the virus came out of a laboratory. The World Health Organization said Monday that Washington had provided no evidence to support \"speculative\" claims by the US president that the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab, AFP reports. \"We have not received any data or specific evidence from the United States government relating to the purported origin of the virus - so from our perspective, this remains speculative,\" WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual briefing. Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat. But US President Donald Trump, increasingly critical of China's management of the first outbreak, claims to have proof it started in a Wuhan laboratory. And US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said \"enormous evidence\" backed up that claim, which China has vehemently denied. \"Like any evidence-based organisation, we would be very willing to receive any information that purports to the origin of the virus,\" Ryan said, stressing that this was \"a very important piece of public health information for future control. \"If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared, but it is difficult for the WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that regard,\" he added. Confirmed global death toll exceeds 250,000. According to research by both the Reuters news agency and Johns Hopkins University, at least a quarter of a million people are now known to have died as a result of the pandemic. Globally, 3,062 new deaths and 61,923 new were cases recorded over the past 24 hours, taking total cases to 3.58m. Experts worry the available data is underplaying the true impact of the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins researchers put the known death toll at 250,687. Germany set to ease restrictions - report. Germany's state premiers will agree on further measures to ease restrictions during a telephone call with the chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, Reuters reports, citing two people familiar with the preparations. French hospital discovers Covid-19 case from December. The hospital retested old samples from pneumonia patients and discovered that it treated a man who had Covid-19 as early as 27 December, nearly a month before the French government confirmed its first cases. Italy's death toll far higher than reported. Statistics bureau ISTAT said its analysis showed an extra 11,600 deaths were unaccounted for, and it was reasonable to assume these people either died of Covid-19 without being tested or that the extra stress on the health system due to the epidemic meant they died of other causes they were not treated for. World leaders pledge $8bn to fight coronavirus. At a video-conference summit hosted by the European Union, Japan pledged more than $800m while Germany offered (EURO)525m. Italy and Spain each said they would provide more than (EURO)100m. Austrian unemployment at all-time high. The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the number of unemployed Austrians to historically high levels, with a year-on-year rise of almost 60%. Carnival to resume cruises in August. Carnival Cruise Line has announced plans to resume operations at the beginning of August despite dozens of deaths on cruise ships during the Covid-19 pandemic and investigations into the industry's possible role in spreading the disease around the globe. Plane carrying aid supplies crashes in Somalia. The accident, involving an African Express Airways plane, killed seven people on board, a security official said. US supreme court hears arguments by teleconference for first time. In a break from tradition caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the nine justices participated remotely via a dial-in format, while the audio feed was broadcast live. In the UK, a review will analyse how factors such as ethnicity, obesity and gender can affect people's vulnerability to coronavirus, health leaders have said. Public Health England (PHE) said thousands of health records of people who have had Covid-19 will be examined to establish more \"robust\" data on what can have an impact on the number of cases and health outcomes for different groups within the population. The review aims to better understand how factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, age, gender and obesity could impact on how people are affected by coronavirus, PHE added. The review is intended to provide \"insight\" into emerging evidence the virus is having a disproportionate effect on different groups. It follows reports that deaths among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are disproportionately high. Hello, Helen Sullivan with you now and for the next few hours. Get in touch any time on Twitter @helenrsullivan. According to research by both the Reuters news agency and Johns Hopkins University, at least a quarter of a million people are now known to have died as a result of the pandemic. North America and European countries account for most of the new deaths and cases reported in recent days but numbers are rising from smaller bases in Latin America, Africa and Russia, Reuters reports. Globally, 3,062 new deaths and 61,923 new were cases recorded over the past 24 hours, taking total cases to 3.58m. Experts worry the available data is underplaying the true impact of the pandemic. The Johns Hopkins researchers put the known death toll at 250,687. Their figures, which are based on official and media reports, have been subject to small fluctuations in the past. Workers in the UK may refuse to turn up or stage walk-outs unless the government helps guarantee their safety, trade unions have warned amid anger over guidance designed to ease the lockdown. As ministers prepare to urge the country back to return to work, Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart write that Labour has joined a string of trade unions in criticising draft guidelines for being vague, inadequate and putting staff at risk because employers can choose how closely to follow them. They warned that vulnerable people such as pregnant women, those with underlying conditions such as cancer, asthma and diabetes, and over-70s could be forced to work without enough protections. Italians were allowed out as the toughest quarantine measures were lifted throughout the country after almost two months on 4 May. About 4m people returned to work as the prime minister Giuseppe Conte appealed to the public in a Facebook post on Sunday night to \"act responsibly\". Germany's state premiers will agree on further measures to ease restrictions during a telephone call with the chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, Reuters reports citing two people familiar with the preparations. The state premiers are expected to give the green light for large shops to reopen, probably from 11 May, Reuters says. The states will also agree to reopen schools for all grades step-by-step, though most children will only be allowed to go to class in rotating shifts, not on daily basis, the sources said. Tim Bray, a top engineer and vice-president at Amazon, is resigning \"in dismay\" over the company's firing of employee activists who criticised working conditions amid the pandemic. Bray's resignation comes as Amazon faces increased scrutiny and employee activism surrounding its internal response to coronavirus. Amazon workers on Friday participated in a nationwide sick-out to protest working conditions and inadequate safety protections. In the UK, the virus' devastating spread among care homes has led to a growing number of families seeking legal advice about bringing their relatives home, Amelia Hill and Diane Taylor write. One law firm said it had received at least 10 calls a week from families wanting to overturn guidance that prevents them from withdrawing their loved ones. Advice lines said they had also seen a small but growing number of calls from those experiencing what one lawyer called a new \"fear factor ... the fear that coronavirus will sweep through the care home and everyone will die\". Paraguay has become one of the first Latin American countries to start relaxing its lockdown, Will Costa writes from Asunci\u00f3n. The landlocked nation, which has reported some of the lowest numbers of cases in the region with 396 cases and 10 deaths, has launched a four-phase plan under which some public freedoms and economic activities will gradually be reintroduced over a period extending until early July. Under the measures introduced on Monday, people working in sectors such as construction, hairdressing and law will return to work. Paraguayans will also be allowed to leave their homes once a day to exercise. The country's president Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez claimed the low number of cases are due to citizens' good behaviour and the strict early measures taken by his government - restrictions began to be implemented after the confirmation of just the second case of infection on 10 March. Paraguay must keep moving while following the hygiene protocols and using our intelligence to take responsibility for the quarantine so that we can keep the curve flattened. The health minister Julio Mazzoleni said further relaxations and a potential return to stricter measures would depend upon developments over the coming weeks. A row has erupted among scientists over a new report into the use of face masks by the general public as an approach to managing the spread of Covid-19 in the community. The report from a multidisciplinary group convened by the Royal Society called Delve - Data Evaluation and Learning for Viral Epidemics - has weighed up the evidence and come out in favour of the public wearing face masks, including homemade cloth coverings, in a bid to tackle Covid-19. The report notes: Our analysis suggests that their use could reduce onward transmission by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic wearers if widely used in situations where physical distancing is not possible or predictable, contrasting to the standard use of masks for the protection of wearers. If correctly used on this basis, face masks, including homemade cloth masks, can contribute to reducing viral transmission. There have been 4,075 new cases and 263 deaths over the last 24 hours in Brazil, the country's health ministry has said. Brazil has now registered 105,222 confirmed cases and 7,288 deaths. New cases increased roughly 4% from the previous day, and deaths rose roughly 3.7%. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1,152,372 cases in total, and said the number of deaths has risen to 67,456. Over the weekend, the CDC updated its case count to 1,122,486 and said 65,735 people had died across the country, but that the numbers were preliminary and had not been confirmed by individual states. The figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. Kigali traders have resumed work as Rwanda partially lifted the strict lockdown measures adopted six weeks ago. Businesses in the capital were flooded with customers hurrying to finish their shopping before an 8pm (CAT) curfew, AFP reported. Rwanda imposed a shutdown on 22 March, closing non-essential shops, shuttering schools, suspending public transport and banning all \"unnecessary travel\" outside the home. The measures have had a heavy economic impact in the poor east African country. Jane Mutoni, a waitress at a small restaurant in Kigali, said two of her male colleagues were let go. We are now two waitresses. It has been really good to return to work because we had no other source of income. In the markets, only half the shops were allowed to reopen. Hair salons in particular have benefited from the easing of restrictions, although measures have been taken to prevent them from becoming overcrowded. John Sibomana, a Kigali hairdresser, said: We are going back to work slowly. Usually we are eight people working as a team here. But today we work in shifts at only three at a time to respect the social distancing. After three hours, a colleague will replace me. We don't earn much, but it is still better than staying at home. The government is using the pandemic to transfer key public health duties from the NH S and other state bodies to the private sector without proper scrutiny, critics are warning. Doctors, campaign groups, academics and MPs raised the concerns about a \"power grab\" after it emerged on Monday that Serco was in pole position to win a deal to supply 15,000 call-handlers for the government's tracking and tracing operation. They said the health secretary Matt Hancock has accelerated the dismantling of state healthcare and that the duty to keep the public safe is being outsourced to the private sector, Juliette Garside and Rupert Neate write: In photographs together and with their families, the five men smile, or hold their loved ones close. All 50 or older, their friendships ranged over decades, their passions running from philanthropy to cycling, their duties from activism to business. A little over two weeks ago, they were pillars of the Pakistani community in the small pocket of Birmingham in which they all lived, with 41 grandchildren between them. Now they are all dead, victims of coronavirus. There must be equal access for developing countries to medicine to combat the pandemic, the Indonesian president Joko Widodo has said. We need to fight for just and timely access to affordable Covid-19 medicine and vaccine. Debt relief and debt repayment obligations from official creditors (for developing countries) need be rediverted into financing the handling of Covid-19. He attended a virtual summit held by 39 heads of states that are part of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a cold war-era bloc that was established in 1961 and declared itself non-partisan to any major powers.

Former Chelsea attacker Salomon Kalou has been suspended by German club Hertha Berlin after posting a video showing him breaking coronavirus social distancing rules by shaking hands with teammates. The Facebook video of Kalou, 34, greeting Hertha players and club employees with handshakes was condemned by the German league, which has put in place stringent hygiene measures as it attempts to secure the political green light to restart its interrupted season. \"The pictures of Salomon Kalou from the Hertha dressing room are absolutely unacceptable,\" the German Football League (DFL) said in a statement. Hertha said they had suspended the 34-year-old Ivory Coast international \"with immediate effect\". Kalou, who won the Premier League with the Blues in 2010, apologised for his actions and said he should have known better because of his involvement in health projects in his homeland. \"I am sorry if my behaviour has given the impression that I do not take corona seriously. I would like to apologise for this,\" he said. \"The opposite is true, because I am particularly concerned about the people in Africa, because the medical care there is by far not as good as in Germany. I did not really think about it.\" The Bundesliga, which is aiming to restart its season from 16 May, said mass testing of players and backroom staff had produced 10 positive results. Coronavirus funding pledges must require any vaccine to be patent-free, campaigners have said. Reacting to reports that today's Coronavirus Global Response Summit has raised $8bn for the research and development of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, Heidi Chow, of Global Justice Now said: We welcome the funding that has been pledged today and the commitment of the hosts to make any Covid-19 vaccine available, accessible and affordable to all. But what is not clear is how the hosts of today's summit intend to achieve the aim of universal access. Recent history tells us that it will not happen by default. She went on to say that participants of the summit should take concrete action and attach certain conditions to any funding pledged, specifying that any publicly funded Covid-19 vaccines and treatments are patent-free Ruling out pharmaceutical monopolies will not only prevent corporate profiteering but will also enable mass production at a scale that will be required by global demand. The challenge of our time is not just to develop a vaccine but to also take the bold steps needed to ensure new Covid-19 vaccines and treatments are affordable for all countries and free to the public. Auction house Christie's will hold a sale to help raise money for The Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR) Covid-19 fund after the pandemic forced the cancellation of the charity's famous Cannes Film Festival gala. Leading collectors and artists have donated several contemporary artworks, some of which have never been seen before, Christie's and amfAR said in a statement. \"The two organizations are joining forces to bridge the gap in fundraising and use it as an opportunity to address the new and urgent threat of Covid-19,\" they said. A date for the auction has not yet been announced but it is set to coincide with Christie's New York spring sales, which are scheduled for the week of 22 June. The announcement comes after amfAR said it was expanding its research efforts into the global push to find effective treatments for the disease caused by the coronavirus. The World Health Organization has stressed that contact-tracing apps and other technology cannot replace old-fashioned \"boots-on-the-ground\" surveillance measures as many countries begin easing lockdowns imposed to curb the coronavirus. \"We are very, very keen to stress that IT tools do not replace the basic public health workforce that is going to be needed to trace, test, isolate and quarantine,\" the WHO's top emergencies expert, Mike Ryan, told journalists at an online briefing in Geneva. He stressed the need for \"shoe-leather epidemiology\" and praised the success of places like South Korea and Singapore for their strategy. Many countries are easing lockdown restrictions to resurrect economies and contact-tracing apps are expected to play a role in helping identify new cases and contain clusters. The number of people who have died after contracting coronavirus in France increased by 306 to 25,201 on Monday, the sharpest rate of increase in four days, government data showed. On Sunday, only 135 new deaths were reported, but on Sundays the data reporting from nursing homes is often delayed, leading to a catch-up during the week. In a statement, the health ministry said the number of people in intensive care units fell to 3,696 from 3,819 on Sunday, down for a 26th consecutive day. The number of people in hospital with coronavirus also fell again to 25,548 from 258,815, continuing an uninterrupted fall for almost three weeks. European Union lawmakers said the coronavirus pandemic should not soften the bloc's long-term climate goals, although some called for a \"beefed up\" fund to help coal-dependent regions move towards a greener economy. Europe is facing a recession and governments are pumping out cash to keep economies afloat, but the EU's executive Commission has pledged not to roll back its climate ambitions. The EU will use its Green Deal, a policy package centred around a target to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, to drive the bloc's economic recovery from the pandemic, Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said. EU lawmakers doubled down on the 2050 target on Monday, in a debate over the bloc's planned (EURO)7.5bn euro ($8.2bn) Just Transition Fund to help high-carbon regions shift away from fossil fuels. Alexandr Vondra, the Czech lawmaker guiding parliament's talks on the fund, had suggested the pandemic could require the 2050 climate goal to be delayed. The virus has had a \"profound impact\" on Europe's economy, Vondra - who represents a country not enthusiastic about the climate targets and asking for more financial support for the transition - said in a draft proposal for parliament's position on the fund. \"It may therefore be necessary to revise or postpone the date of achievement of the climate neutrality objective,\" the proposal said. However, the push for a delay found no supporters when parliament's environment committee discussed it on Monday. Lawmakers from the three biggest political groups in parliament - which make up 432 of the total 705 EU lawmakers - spoke out in favour of keeping the 2050 goal. Hungarian lawmaker Sandor Ronai said: I understand that some would like to delay this goal due to the economic challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. But, in my view, the pandemic provides a unique opportunity to transform and rebuild our economies based on the European Green Deal. Some supported Vondra's call for the fund to be significantly larger, given EU climate targets will cost coal-reliant countries such as Poland hundreds of billions of euros. Mexican medical staff treating Covid-19 patients will be housed in the country's former presidential palace - a luxurious abode, in which the austere president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador refuses to live. Staff from three Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) hospitals will be offered temporary residence in the mansion known as Los Pinos, which was turned into a cultural centre after L\u00f3pez Obrador (commonly called Amlo) took office in late 2018. Amlo and his family now live in an apartment in the National Palace in central Mexico City. IMSS director Zoe Robledo said 58 physicians and nurses would start staying at Los Pinos on Monday, though the mansion could house up to 100 people. Robledo added that a survey of IMSS staff showed 86% of respondents wanting to temporarily reside somewhere other than home to avoid long commutes and possibly spreading Covid-19 to family members. Medical staff in Mexico report being accosted, having bleach thrown on them and having to remove their uniforms after leaving work as some in the population erroneously see doctors and nurses as carrying Covid-19. The decision to house staff in Los Pinos prompted cheers and jeers on social media - with critics panning the plan as \"populist\" and pointing out that many unoccupied luxury hotels in the same area of Mexico City would work better for housing staff. Mexico has reported 23,471 Covid-19 cases and 2,154 deaths as of 3 May. Its rate of testing, however, ranks among the lowest in Latin America with just 0.51 tests per 100,000 people. Turkey will start easing coronavirus containment measures as of Monday, president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, lifting intercity travel restriction in seven provinces and easing a curfew imposed for senior and youth citizens after weeks. The country has around 130,000 confirmed cases, the highest total outside Western Europe, the United States and Russia. Ankara has rolled out measures to contain the outbreak, but Erdogan said Turkey would start easing them in May, June and July as the virus spread began slowing over the past two weeks. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Erdogan said senior and youth citizens will be allowed outside for four hours for one day a week starting this weekend and that travel restrictions would be lifted for seven cities, excluding Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. He said shopping malls, barber shops and some stores will be allowed to open on 11 May as long as they abide by normalisation rules, adding that universities would return to their academic calendar as of 15 June. But Erdogan warned that the government would impose much harsher measures if the normalisation plan is not followed. As Canada's Yukon territory braces for coronavirus, residents have been asked keep one caribou's length apart from each another. (For those not familiar with the dimensions of the reindeer, that's roughly equivalent to two husky lengths or eight loaves of sourdough bread.) The light-hearted advice is part of a viral public health awareness campaign that seeks to inform residents and pay homage to the region's cultural history. The guidelines from Yukon's department of health also advised residents that keeping the distance four ravens - the official bird of the territory - will help prevent transmission of the virus. Because of its geographic isolation and low population density, the Yukon territory has only recorded 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but has put measures in place to limit travellers at its borders with British Columbia and Alaska, where tourists often arrive. Carnival Cruise Line has announced plans to resume operations at the beginning of August despite dozens of deaths on cruise ships during the Covid-19 pandemic and investigations into the industry's possible role in spreading the disease around the planet. In a statement on Monday, the operator said eight cruise ships would resume operations from 1 August, sailing from Galveston, Texas, and Miami and Port Canaveral in Florida, once a no-sail order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had expired. The CDC has issued repeated warnings that cruise travel has spread the coronavirus outbreak around the world and on Friday, the US Congress announced an investigation of Carnival Cruise Line's parent company - Carnival Corporation - over why it did not act sooner to protect passengers and staff. Dozens of people have died and more than 1,500 confirmed Covid-19 infections have been recorded in connection with Carnival's ships, which saw major outbreaks on the Diamond Princess, the Zaandam and the Ruby Princess. Studies in Britain show that most people who have had Covid-19 develop antibodies, England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said, but it was too early to say whether this gave them immunity. At a daily news conference, Van-Tam said: The overwhelming majority of people so far called back who've had definite Covid-19 infection have got antibodies in their blood stream. By and large the signal is that people get antibodies. The next question is, do those antibodies protect you from further infections? And we just haven't had this disease around... for long enough to know the answers to that with any surety. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, added that the government was in discussions with Swiss pharmaceutical firm Roche over antibody testing. Finland will lift some coronavirus restrictions, allowing restaurants to reopen and public services including libraries and sports facilities to start operating again from 1 June, the government has said. A ban on public meetings will be relaxed from a maximum of 10 people to 50 people from 1 June but emergency powers will be kept in place, it said. Essential travel to countries in the Schengen area will be allowed from 14 May, interior minister Maria Ohisalo said. Last week, the government decided to reopen schools from 13 May. The head of the World Health Organization has urged the world to unite to defeat the new coronavirus. WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a virtual briefing in Geneva: This virus will be with us for a long time and we must come together to develop and share the tools to defeat it. We will prevail through national unity and global solidarity. He also praised pledges of $8bn from world leaders for the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. This week, the WHO will launch its updated strategic preparedness and response plan, which will provide an update of its funding needs in order to support the international and national plans to fight the virus, Tedros said. Apple and Google have said they would ban the use of location tracking in apps that use a new contact tracing system the two are building to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Apple and Google, whose operating systems power 99% of smartphones, said last month they would work together to create a system for notifying people who have been near others who have tested positive for Covid-19. Both companies said that privacy and preventing governments from using the system to compile data on citizens was a primary goal. The system uses Bluetooth signals from phones to detect encounters and does not use or store GPS location data. But the developers of coronavirus-related apps in several US states told Reuters last month that it was vital that they be allowed to use GPS location data in conjunction with the new contact tracing system in order to track how outbreaks move and identify hotspots. Tanzania has suspended the head of its national health laboratory in charge of testing for the coronavirus and ordered an investigation, a day after president John Magufuli questioned the tests' accuracy, Reuters reports. Magufuli said on Sunday the imported test kits were faulty as they had returned positive results on a goat and a pawpaw - among several non-human samples submitted for testing, with technicians left deliberately unaware of their origins. He did not say where the kits had been imported from or why the authorities had been suspicious of the results. Catherine Sungura, acting head of communications at the ministry of health, said in a statement on Monday the director of the laboratory and its quality assurance manager had been immediately suspended \"to pave way for the investigation\". Sungura said a 10-person committee had been formed to investigate the laboratory's operations, including its process of collecting and testing samples. On Sunday, Magufuli also fired the head of the government medical stores department, which is in charge of distributing medical supplies and equipment to government hospitals, but gave no reason. As of Monday, Tanzania had recorded 480 cases of Covid-19 and 18 deaths, according to a Reuters tally based on government and World Health Organization data. Bulgaria will not extend a state of emergency past its 13 May expiry date but some coronavirus restrictions will remain in force for two more months, finance minister Vladislav Goranov has said. Bulgaria, which declared a state of emergency on 13 March, has so far confirmed 1,652 cases of the illness and 78 deaths. France might allow religious services to resume before the end of the month if a gradual easing of lockdown rules from 11 May did not result in the rate of coronavirus infections increasing, prime minister Edouard Philippe has said. The government had indicated religious ceremonies would be banned until 2 June at the earliest, but Philippe told the Senate this might be advanced by four days. He said: Many faiths have made proposals to reconcile how their meetings are held with social distancing rules I know the May 29 - June 1 period is for several faiths an important date on the religious calendar. The Christian holy day of Pentecost, celebrated 50 days after Easter Sunday, falls on 1 June. A week earlier, and before the government has said it might allow religious festivities, Muslims mark Eid, the end of the holy month of Ramadan. Britain needs new cases of Covid-19 to fall further, England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, has said, even as data indicates that the peak of the coronavirus outbreak has passed. \"It's now very clear in the data that we are past the peak,\" Van-Tam said at a daily news conference. \"New cases need to come down further... we have to get cases lower.\" The British government has set five tests that need to be met before it will start easing a lockdown that has been in place since 23 March. One of the five tests is that there has to be reliable data showing that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board. Follow all the latest updates from today's daily press conference over on our UK live blog. A plane carrying aid supplies has crashed in Somalia's southern Bay region, killing seven people on board, a security official said. State-run Somalia News Agency said the plane belonged to African Express Airways and was ferrying supplies for use in the fight against coronavirus. It said there were six crew members on board. \"An African (Express) Airways plane from Mogadishu flew to Baidoa and then continued its flight to Bardale town where it crashed,\" the news agency said on its website. \"The plane crashed near Bardale airport. It was carrying medicine to prevent Covid-19. It is not clear why it crashed.\" The world economy may have dramatically dipped and the price of oil crashed, but one commodity is seeing an unprecedented boom: the face mask. Samanth Subramanian explores the newly distorted marketplace for masks and the lengths some will go to get them in the latest episode of our Today in Focus podcast. France's prime minister has stood by a plan for lifting the country's coronavirus lockdown next week, despite concerns the government is moving too fast to reopen schools, as well as doubts over the availability of face masks. The French are due to emerge on 11 May from a lockdown that began in mid-March to combat the virus, and in a strategy different to other European countries, some schools are set to reopen. The prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said to senators while laying out his government's strategy: This confinement was necessary to meet the emergency, but its social and economic cost is colossal. We're at a decisive moment, we cannot remain in confinement. Economic life must resume imperatively and quickly. But officials have drawn fire from critics who say the country is not ready to cope with the strict social distancing and other protective measures that will be required after 11 May to avoid a flare-up of the epidemic, which has already killed nearly 25,000 people in France. New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, has outlined a phased reopening of business activity in the state hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, starting with select retailers, wholesale suppliers and the construction and manufacturing industries. Cuomo, speaking at a daily briefing, did not put specific dates to the outline, which envisions allowing finance, insurance, retail, administrative support and real estate businesses to restart in a second phase of reopening. Syrian president Bashar al-Assad has warned that the country could face a \"real catastrophe\" if coronavirus cases spike and overwhelm health services. The current low level of infections did not mean Syria had gone out of the \"circle of danger\", Assad said in an address to the government committee that oversees measures to curb the pandemic. \"These figures could suddenly spike in a few days or few weeks and we would see in front of us real catastrophe,\" he said. World leaders promised $8bn on Monday for the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said at the end of a pledging event that she chaired. In the space of just few hours we have collectively pledged (EURO)7.4bn euros ($8.07bn) for vaccine, diagnostics and treatment. This will help kick-start unprecedented global cooperation. Britain's Covid-19 death toll has risen by 288 to 28,734, according to figures announced by health secretary Matt Hancock. The increase was the smallest since late March, Hancock said, adding that he expected it to rise in coming days as the numbers tended to be lower over the weekend. Coronavirus deaths in Italy climbed by 195 on Monday, up from 174 the day before, the Civil Protection Agency said, but the daily tally of new infections declined to 1,221 from 1,389 on Sunday. Italy's daily death toll in recent weeks has always fallen on Sundays and risen the following day, while the underlying trend has been steadily declining since a peak above 900 daily fatalities around the end of March. The total death toll now stands at 29,079 the agency said, the second highest in the world after the United States. The number of confirmed cases amounts to 211,938. Italy's true death toll from the disease is much higher than is reported in the daily bulletins, the national statistics agency said in an analysis of mortalities from all causes released on Monday. There were 1,479 people in intensive care on Monday against 1,501 the day before, maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 82,879 were declared recovered against 81,654 on Sunday. US senators returned to Washington for the first time in nearly six weeks on Monday, amid concerns that their legislative sessions could put lawmakers and staff at risk of contracting Covid-19. The Senate was due to reconvene to address partisan differences over the next step in legislation to combat the pandemic and to scrutinize a series of nominations for senior government posts put forward by president Donald Trump. Democrats and Republicans are at odds over the contents of any new coronavirus legislation. Democrats want up to $1tn to help state and local governments weather the brunt of the pandemic. Republicans are demanding liability protections for businesses, which Democrats oppose, as a condition for moving forward on any bill. The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said Trump is looking at ways to stimulate travel and wants tax changes for business entertainment expenses to get people to go back to restaurants. With Washington still under a stay-at-home order, lawmakers have been advised by the congressional physician to wear masks, maintain a distance of six feet (2 metres) and limit the number of staff on Capitol Hill. The first real test of the recommendations will come at 5.30pm (ET), when senators are due for a roll call vote on Robert Feitel's nomination to be inspector general of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, called the Republican-led Senate back into session, saying lawmakers would join American workers in essential sectors of the economy to address \"critical business\" on several fronts. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives chose instead to remain in recess this week because of potential health risks. With some Democratic lawmakers warning that the Senate's return could risk spreading the virus, the Trump administration last week offered Congress 1,000 coronavirus tests. McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi turned down the offer over the weekend, a decision that came under fire on Monday. \"By Congress not wanting the special 5-minute testing apparatus, they are saying that they are not 'essential',\" Trump wrote in a tweet. There were feelings of relief and trepidation as people in Italy returned to the streets after almost two months indoors under a strict lockdown. Rina Sondhi, who lives in the Umbrian town of Orvieto, said: I literally haven't been out of the house. The biggest shock for me was the fresh air. Today I feel liberated, but with caution - that's the important thing, we can have the freedom but we must be really careful. An estimated 4 million people returned to work on Monday as part of what the Italian government called the second phase of the country's coronavirus emergency, with the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, appealing to the public in a Facebook post on Sunday night to \"act responsibly\". Trenord, the company that manages train services in Lombardy, Italy's industrial hub and the region worst affected by the outbreak, said the commuter flow in the morning rush-hour was about 30% of pre-outbreak levels. Usually buzzing with activity in the morning, people wearing face masks queued outside bars in Orvieto as they waited for their espresso. \"This is a great step even if we have to remain cautious - it gives you something else to smile about,\" said Slavik Cebanu. Jaskaran Singh, who works in Caff\u00e8 Barrique, said: \"We are happy to be able to open even if things are still restricted, and to see some movement. I just hope everything goes well.\" Although the infection rate has been steadily falling, fear of the virus lingers. Valentina Santanicchio, a chef whose restaurant in Orvieto, Capitano del Popolo, has been providing home deliveries, said: In some ways, I'm more afraid than when we closed, as a lot will now depend on people managing the moment in a responsible way. The Czech government has agreed to lift a ban on international bus and train travel from 11 May, a member of the government said. The measure was put in place on 14 March in an effort to control the spread of Covid-19. Yemen has reported two new coronavirus infections in Hadhramout, the national emergency coronavirus committee said on Monday, raising the number of diagnosed infections in the war-town country to 12, with two deaths. The province of Hadhramout was where Yemen recorded its first case of Covid-19 on 10 April. The United Nations says it fears the coronavirus could be spreading undetected among an acutely malnourished population with inadequate testing capabilities. A French hospital has retested old samples from pneumonia patients and discovered that it treated a man who had Covid-19 as early as 27 December, nearly a month before the French government confirmed its first cases. Yves Cohen, head of resuscitation at the Avicenne and Jean Verdier hospitals in the northern suburbs of Paris, told BFM TV that scientists had retested samples from 24 patients treated in December and January who tested negative for the flu. \"Of the 24, we had one who was positive for Covid-19 on December 27,\" he told the news channel on Sunday. Each sample was retested several times to ensure there were no errors, he added. France, which has seen almost 25,000 people die from the virus since 1 March, confirmed its first three Covid-19 cases on 24 January, including two patients in Paris and another in the southwestern city of Bordeaux. Cohen said it was too early to know if the patient whose 27 December test was Covid-19 positive is France's \"patient zero\". Knowing who was the first is critical to understanding how the virus spread. Cohen said the patient had survived and that an investigation to trace the first contamination has been carried out. He said: He was sick for 15 days and infected his two children, but not his wife, who works in a supermarket. He was amazed, he didn't understand how he had been infected. We put the puzzle together and he had not made any trips. The only contact that he had was with his wife. The man's wife worked alongside a sushi stand, close to colleagues of Chinese origin, Cohen said. It was not clear whether those colleagues had travelled to China, and the local health authority should investigate, he said. \"We're wondering whether she was asymptomatic,\" he said. \"He may be the 'patient zero', but perhaps there are others in other regions.\" So far 6.3 million workers in Britain have been furloughed, with \u00a38bn ($9.9bn) claimed from the government to sustain their wages during the coronavirus lockdown, tax authorities said on Monday. HM Revenue and Customs said on Twitter that 800,000 employers had furloughed their staff, citing figures up to midnight on Sunday. The major Canadian province of Quebec, among the worst hit by the coronavirus, started gradually restarting its economy on Monday, while prime minister Justin Trudeau maintained his cautious stance. Quebec is allowing stores with an outside entrance for customers to reopen but this does not apply to Montreal, Canada's second largest city, where retail establishments must wait until 11 May. Although Quebec makes up 24% of the Canadian population, it accounts for 54% of the cases and 60% of the deaths. Canada has so far reported 60,000 positive diagnoses and 3,800 deaths. Trudeau and senior medical health officials have repeatedly stressed any reopening efforts must be carried out carefully to head off a second wave of the virus. The provinces have a large amount of control over their economies and healthcare systems, and Trudeau has so far not offered any criticism. \"If a province started to reopen and sadly saw an explosion in new cases, it would be up to that province to react. And I know the inhabitants of that province would certainly stress that they wanted to see a different approach,\" he told reporters on Sunday. Trudeau appeared uncertain when asked by public broadcaster Radio Canada whether he would allow his children to go back to school if he lived in Quebec. He paused for a couple of seconds before replying \"I don't know\", while noting schools in Ontario - the most populous of Canada's 10 provinces - were not going to reopen soon. The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the number of unemployed Austrians to historically high levels, according to official figures released on Monday, with a year-on-year rise of almost 60%. The blow to the economy dealt by the virus - and the lockdown brought in to combat it - means 571,477 people are out of work, Austria's AMS employment service said. This compares with 361,202 people at the end of April 2019, an annual rise of 58%. The AMS said the rise since mid-March this year was \"an extreme rise in inactivity linked to coronavirus\". The unemployment rate, which in Austria is calculated to include those in training, stood at 12.8% at the end of April, up from 8.1% in February. AMS said in a statement that \"all sectors, all regions and all age groups\" had been affected by the slowdown. There are now 10 times more jobseekers than vacancies, which are themselves down a third year-on-year. The hardest hit industries are hotels and restaurants, which have seen a 130% rise in unemployment, and construction, where the figure is 98%. The mountainous Tyrol region, where the vital ski season had to be ended early, had a 10% increase. Austria moved into a lockdown to restrict the virus's spread relatively early in mid-March, and is in the process of progressively lifting restrictions on movement. As of Monday, the country of 8.8 million people had recorded 15,538 infections and 600 deaths. Italy's coronavirus death toll is much higher than reported, statistics bureau ISTAT said on Monday, in an analysis pointing to thousands of fatalities that have never been officially attributed to Covid-19. In its first report of the epidemic's impact on Italy's mortality rate, covering 86% of the population, ISTAT said that from 21 February, when the first Covid-19 deaths occurred, until 31 March, nationwide deaths were up 39% compared with the average of the previous five years. Of the 25,354 \"excess deaths\", Covid-19 was registered by the Civil Protection Agency as the official cause for 13,710, leaving around 11,600 deaths unaccounted for. These occurred overwhelmingly in the northern part of Italy most heavily hit by the virus. The statistics bureau said it was reasonable to assume these people either died of Covid-19 without being tested or that the extra stress on the health system due to the epidemic meant they died of other causes they were not treated for. Officially, up to 3 May, the Civil Protection Agency recorded 28,884 coronavirus deaths, the second highest toll in the world after the United States. The tally only includes people who tested positive. The agency compiles data from the regions on deaths of people who tested positive for the virus and issues them in a bulletin at 6pm every day. ISTAT's report, drawn up with Italy's National Health Institute, confirmed the massive concentration of the epidemic in the country's northern regions, where the vast majority of unreported deaths have also taken place. In the northern region of Lombardy, which includes the financial capital Milan and has been most ravaged by the disease, deaths were up 186% in March from 2015-2019. Looking at individual cities, the worst-hit was Bergamo, near Milan, where deaths were up 568% in March compared with the 2015-2019 average. The nearby cities of Cremona and Lodi saw increases of 391% and 370% respectively. In Milan they rose 93%. In Rome, Italy's most populous city, which has been relatively lightly hit by Covid-19, overall fatalities were down 9% from the previous five years. The Sicilian capital Palermo also posted a 9% decline. Chemicals manufacturer INEOS said it has built two hand sanitiser plants in the United States in response to greater demand amid the novel coronavirus outbreak. The plants are in Arkansas and Pennsylvania and they will each produce one million bottles of hand sanitiser a month. The sanitiser will be given to hospitals across the United States for free. The firm has already opened four similar facilities in Europe. The number of coronavirus cases in Chile has exceeded 20,000, the health ministry said on Monday. Paula Daza, the health ministry subsecretary, said there were now 20,643 confirmed cases, 980 more than the previous day, and 10 new deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 270. Belarus will hold a military parade this week to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany, its president has said, despite having one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Europe. Alexander Lukashenko said in televised remarks that he did not want to cancel the parade in part because people \"would say we were scared\". Russia and other former Soviet countries have cancelled this week's commemoration to slow the spread of the virus. Last month, more than 10,000 Russian soldiers who took part in rehearsals were quarantined. Belarus has almost 17,500 confirmed cases of coronavirus, giving it one of Europe's highest per capita infection rates. Lukashenko, president since 1994, has publicly said the danger from the disease was exaggerated and avoided instituting physical distancing guidelines. It is a mystery that has left doctors questioning the basic tenets of biology: Covid-19 patients who are talking and apparently not in distress, but who have oxygen levels low enough to typically cause unconsciousness or even death. The phenomenon, known by some as \"happy hypoxia\" (some prefer the term \"silent\") is raising questions about exactly how the virus attacks the lungs and whether there could be more effective ways of treating such patients. A healthy person would be expected to have an oxygen saturation of at least 95%. But doctors are reporting patients attending A&amp;E with oxygen percentage levels in the 80s or 70s, with some drastic cases below 50%. Dr Jonathan Bannard-Smith, a consultant in critical care and anaesthesia at Manchester Royal Infirmary, said: It's intriguing to see so many people coming in, quite how hypoxic they are. We're seeing oxygen saturations that are very low and they're unaware of that. We wouldn't usually see this phenomenon in influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. It's very much more profound and an example of very abnormal physiology going on before our eyes. In a break from tradition caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the US Supreme Court for the first time heard arguments in a case by teleconference. The case was a trademark dispute involving popular hotel reservation website Booking.com - and even typically silent Justice Clarence Thomas asked questions. The nine justices kicked off a scheduled hour of arguments in the case, not in a courtroom but by participating remotely using a dial-in format. Emphasising the unique nature of the proceedings, Thomas, a conservative justice who almost never asks questions during arguments, queried government lawyer Erica Ross about her arguments on behalf of the US Patent and Trademark Office seeking to prevent Booking.com from trademarking the site's name. The justices over the next two weeks are set to conduct arguments in 10 cases by teleconference, taking it in turns to ask questions in order of seniority. In another first, the court is providing a live audio feed, making these the first arguments that the public can hear live. Cable TV network C-SPAN said it plans to broadcast that feed in all the cases. The biggest cases to be considered by teleconference are three that focus on the question of whether president Donald Trump can keep his financial records, including tax returns, secret. Those cases will be argued on 12 May. The US president, Donald Trump, is planning executive orders to increase the production of medical products and energy components in the country, the White House said on Monday. Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, told Fox News in an interview that an order would soon require federal agencies to purchase US-made medical products, saying the Covid-19 outbreak had exposed the nation's reliance on China. The country's power grid is also at risk because components come from overseas, he said. Bangladesh authorities said on Monday they will gradually open up more factories, as well as farms and logistics operations, as they try to diminish the economic impact of a coronavirus lockdown which they extended to 16 May. Shopping malls were given permission to reopen with shorter than usual hours. The move followed a decision last week to reopen more than 2,000 garment factories that supply global brands, after a month-long shutdown. Much of the rest of the economy remains offline. The official tally of confirmed Covid-19 cases rose by 688 to surpass 10,000, the health ministry said. Some experts are concerned that the real number of cases could be higher in a country of more than 160 million people where many have only limited access to healthcare. The death toll rose to 182 from 177. Prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, has told government officials that schools and colleges may have to remain closed until September if the situation does not improve. Kuwaiti authorities dispersed a \"riot\" by Egyptian workers who demonstrated on Monday to demand repatriation amid the coronavirus crisis, state media said. Such protests are rare in the tightly controlled Gulf countries, where there is a large population of foreign workers. Security forces intervened to halt \"riots and chaos\" at a housing area for foreign workers, detaining an unspecified number of people, according to the official Kuwait News Agency (KUNA). On Sunday, KUNA quoted the Egyptian ambassador to Kuwait, Tareq al-Qooni, as saying that Egyptians at a camp for immigration offenders will be repatriated starting \"this week\". \"The first flights will be for women and children who are kept in special housing units,\" Qooni reportedly said. Kuwait has said it will allow expatriates in violation of residency laws to leave the Gulf country without paying fines or for plane tickets. Millions of foreigners across the wealthy Gulf nations face uncertainty amid the coronavirus crisis, with many workers sick and countless others unemployed, unpaid and at the mercy of unscrupulous employers. Kuwait has so far recorded more than 5,000 infections, including 40 deaths. One of Brazil's most celebrated composers and lyricists has died at the age of 73 after contracting Covid-19. Aldir Blanc, whose mastery of the Portuguese language made him a legend of 20th-century Brazilian music, had been in hospital in Rio de Janeiro since 10 April and died in the early hours of Monday. He is one of more than 7,000 Brazilians killed by the pandemic so far. \"The poet is dead. What a sad day, Brazil,\" the journalist Fl\u00e1via Oliveira wrote on Twitter as tributes from fans poured in. \"All that remains for us is to weep and to honour,\" tweeted the composer Arnaldo Antunes. Blanc leaves a vast body of work including classic songs such as O b\u00eabado e a equilibrista and O mestre-sala dos mares. Many of his best-known compositions became famous in the voice of the legendary singer Elis Regina. Scores of sheep crossed empty streets in Samsun, northern Turkey, as people stayed indoors over the weekend during the coronavirus lockdown. Videos shared on social media show the animals following a shepherd along empty roads in the city, with some stopping occasionally to graze on grass verges. Participants have started enrolling in a study to find out the infection rate of Covid-19 in children and their families in the United States. The government-funded study, which will be conducted completely remotely, looks to determine how many children infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, develop symptoms of the disease. The study also looks to determine whether there are differences in the rates of infection between children who have asthma or other allergic conditions, and children who do not. \"One interesting feature of this novel coronavirus pandemic is that very few children have become sick with Covid-19 compared to adults,\" said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Fauci said the study will determine if this is because children are resistant to the infection, or because they are infected but do not develop symptoms. The study will enroll 6,000 people from 2,000 families already participating in NIH-funded pediatric research studies in 11 cities. Spain will pledge (EURO)125m ($136.58m) to developing a global response to the coronavirus pandemic, prime minister Pedro Sanchez has said. Speaking at a virtual pledging conference today, Sanchez said Spain would contribute (EURO)50m to the Global Vaccine Alliance and (EURO)75m to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. The funds add to the (EURO)500m pledged by France and (EURO)525m pledged by Germany. A street artist called Msale has taken it upon himself to create giant murals bringing public health messages directly to the overcrowded Mathare slum in Nairobi. With half a million people living in such 'a squeezed area' social distancing is quite impossible to achieve, says Msale, so he is providing information for people on how to keep safe from Covid-19 in the 'simplest, clearest' way he knows Hearings in the US extradition case against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will resume in September after being postponed from later this month because of the coronavirus outbreak, a London court said on Monday. Reuters reports from a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday where it was agreed that September would be the most convenient date for the hearings to resume, although an exact date and an appropriate venue was yet to be decided, a spokesman said. Assange is wanted by US authorities to stand trial for conspiring to hack government computers and espionage. His extradition case began in February for a week before being adjourned until May 18 for another three weeks of arguments. Last week, Judge Vanessa Baraitser said it would not be possible for it to recommence this month because of strict restrictions on gatherings to curb the spread of coronavirus. A phased easing of a five-week lockdown on Abuja, Lagos and Ogun State in Nigeria has begun today, even as a rise in new cases of Covid-19 across Nigeria continues to accelerate. Infections have almost doubled in the last week to 2,500. Over 2000 cases are active infections, with 87 people dying from the virus and 400 having now recovered. Movement is permitted providing face masks are worn. Several businesses including restaurants, viewing centres and places of worship will remain closed. Gatherings of more than 20 remain banned. Yet the easing of restrictions has drawn sharp criticism. This weekend, the head of the Nigerian Medical Association said: \"The easing of the lockdown even in phases is very premature,\" and could portend a \"frightening scenario\". Many African countries including Nigeria, swiftly adopted restrictive lockdowns, travel bans and other measures to curb Covid-19, far earlier than in many other parts of the world. Yet a worsening economy, and stretched security services, have diminished the limit of Nigeria's ability to withstand the effects that the lockdown has wrought. The government has provided support to only a small fraction of millions most affected. During the lockdown, the number of testing laboratories have significantly improved to 18 from four two months ago. But low levels of testing in Nigeria have only slowly risen, with 17,500 tests administered in total. Heightening fears further are hundreds of additional deaths in Kano, Nigeria's second largest city, which have now been confirmed as linked to Covid-19. Local media reports of residents fleeing Kano despite a ban on inter-state travel have heightened concerns that a potential epicentre is not secure. A two-week lockdown was imposed on Kano by President Buhari but the state governor has since declared that the measures would be suspended on Monday and Thursday this week to help residents during Ramadan. The European Union pledged (EURO)1bn ($1.09bn) on Monday for the global search for vaccines and treatment for the novel coronavirus, the European commission president Ursula von der Leyen told a pledging conference, Reuters reports. Norway pledged to give $1bn to support the distribution worldwide of any vaccine developed against Covid-19 as well as for vaccines against other diseases, prime minister Erna Solberg said on Monday. Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday Germany would contribute (EURO)525m ($573.51m) to a global fund-raising push to search for vaccines and for a treatment for coronavirus. England reported 204 new coronavirus hospital deaths, the lowest daily increase since 30 March. The new hospital deaths bring the total figure of confirmed deaths in hospitals to 21,384. Scotland reported five new coronavirus deaths, taking the total to 1,576. She said there are 99 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms in Scotland, no change from yesterday. Wales reported 14 new coronavirus deaths, taking total to 997. Downing Street has published the names of the more than 50 scientists who sit on its Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies to discuss coronavirus, after criticism of the secrecy surrounding the group and the Guardian's revelation that the No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings had attended meetings of the group. The list of names was made available on the government's website, showing that around half of the experts come from universities and another half are made up of government chief scientific advisers, public health officials or NHS senior staff. Cummings is not listed as a member even though he attended meetings and made interjections, according to those present. The scientists include university professors such as Wendy Barclay, Ian Boyd, John Edmunds, Sir Jeremy Farrar, Neil Ferguson, Julia Gog, Peter Horby, Dame Theresa Marteau, Graham Medley, Andrew Morris, Cath Noakes, Michael Parker, Venki Ramakrishnan, Andrew Rambaut, Brooke Rogers, James Rubin, Calum Semple, Sir David Spieglhalter, Russell Viner, Mark Woolhouse and Lucy Yardley. Two participants refused to be named. Membership lists of several other advisory groups were also published. Migrant labourers in Indian cities whose incomes have plummeted as a result of anti-coronavirus lockdown measures have been told that they will have to pay to board special trains taking them back to their homes in the countryside. The decision has prompted derision in India, where most labourers live off what they earn in a day and have been surviving on state handouts. \"At first I thought it was a joke,\" said Badal Raj, a carpenter from Patna who lives in a shelter in Delhi. \"We have to pay? My last few rupees went on recharging my phone so I could speak to my children. Where am I going to get the money for the fare?\" Since the lockdown was imposed on 25 March, an estimated 10 million labourers have been trapped in the company of strangers in cities across India, with no work or income and a long way from the comfort of home and family. With public transport shut down, many labourers walked hundreds of miles to their homes in a massive reverse migration. Those who remained have been sequestered in government shelters. Mass deaths in a northern Nigerian state were caused by coronavirus, authorities said after a preliminary investigation into the phenomenon. Gravediggers in the state of Kano have reported burying dozens of corpses per day, in what the authorities had called \"mysterious deaths\". But a local Covid-19 team, after carrying out door-to-door investigations and interviewing bereaved relatives, said coronavirus was most likely to blame. \"With the preliminary report, most of the deaths recorded of recent, and tests carried out, indicated that coronavirus is the cause,\" the team leader, Nasiru Sani Gwarzo, told reporters. The final report will be published in the coming days, but residents needed to face the \"serious issue at hand\", he said. He warned the pandemic had \"scaled to the level of community transmission\". Kano, with around 12 million people, is the second most populous state in Nigeria. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control on Friday said the number of recorded infections across Kano rose to 219, up from 77 at the start of the week. Kano has in recent days seen a spate of high-profile deaths including academics, bureaucrats, businessmen and traditional leaders. The state has the capacity to carry out just 88 tests per day, which should rise to 300 this week. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, with a headcount of around 200 million people, has 2,500 recorded cases of coronavirus and 87 deaths, according to official figures. A lockdown on Nigeria's largest city Lagos and the capital Abuja was to ease on Monday. Restrictions in Kano remain in force, although the authorities eased the measures for six hours on Monday to enable people to shop and replenish dwindling supplies. Hundreds of South African health workers were given a century-old tuberculosis vaccine on Monday in a trial to see whether the venerable formula can protect against coronavirus. Devised at France's legendary Pasteur Institute 100 years ago, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is one of the world's oldest and most trusted immunisations. \"We vaccinated the first participant this morning,\" Duncan McDonald, head of business development and marketing at a clinical research organisation called TASK, told AFP. Trials started at Tygerberg hospital in Cape Town, where BCG booster shots were administered to 250 health care workers, while another 250 received a dummy formula, or placebo. \"There are observations that this BCG vaccine does something to the immune system that we don't really understand,\" TASK founder professor, Andreas Diacon, said. Children immunised with BCG tend to suffer less from respiratory illnesses, including asthma, he said. \"It makes the immune system cope better with respiratory retract infections,\" said Diacon. \"No one actually really understands why it works.\" Diacon and his team want to determine whether BCG could have an effect on coronavirus by reducing the risk of infection or easing symptoms. \"If you can reduce the (Covid-19) symptoms just a little, you will probably get people to survive this better or not even have to go to hospital or not even becoming ill,\" said Diacon. The plan is to ramp up the trials to up to 3,000 health care workers in Cape Town. Participants will be observed for at least a year. Similar BCG clinical trials are being conducted in the Netherlands, Australia and France. Millions of people were allowed to return to work in Italy on Monday as Europe's longest lockdown started to ease. Italy, the first European country hit by the pandemic and a nation with one of the world's highest death tolls, started stirring after its two-month shutdown. In all, 4.4 million Italians were able to return to work, and restrictions on movement eased. Traffic in downtown Rome picked up, construction sites and manufacturing operations resumed, parks reopened and flower vendors returned to the Campo dei Fiori market for the first time since 11 March. Its something that brings happiness and joy, and people have been missing that these days, vendor Stefano Fulvi said. He doesn't expect to break even anytime soon, but you have to take the risk at some point, he said. Mourners in the country are able to attend funerals, but services are limited to 15 people and there is still no word on when Masses will resume. Restaurants scrubbed their floors in preparation for take-out service, but sit-down service is several weeks away. Southern Italy braced for the return of students and workers who were trapped in the hard-hit north when the lockdown took effect. Some regional governors said they would require anyone arriving home to go into quarantine for two weeks. Its a new page that we must write together, with trust and responsibility, remier Giuseppe Conte said in a message to Italians. The Pulitzer prizes in journalism and the arts will be announced on Monday after being postponed by the coronavirus outbreak. The initial Pulitzer ceremony, which was scheduled for 20 April, was pushed back to give Pulitzer board members who were busy covering the pandemic more time to evaluate the finalists. The awards luncheon that is traditionally held at Columbia University in May will be postponed as well. Details of a fall celebration will be announced at a later date, the Pulitzer board said. The Pulitzer prizes in journalism were first awarded in 1917 and are considered the field's most prestigious honour in the US. Germany, which is part of Europe's open-border Schengen area, will extend its border checks until 15 May, a spokesman for the interior ministry has said. The measure is in line with the European commission, he added. \"Of course, we are guided by the European spirit not to act unilaterally or in an uncoordinated way.\" Numerous Schengen countries have imposed emergency border checks in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus. A street artist called Msale has created giant murals bringing public health messages directly to the overcrowded Mathare slum in Nairobi, Kenya. With half a million people living in such \"a squeezed area\" social distancing is quite impossible to achieve, says Msale, so he is providing information for people on how to keep safe in the \"simplest, clearest\" way he knows. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands rose by 199 on Monday to 40,770, with 26 new deaths, health authorities said. Total deaths in the country rose to 5,082, the Netherlands Institute for Health (RIVM) said in its daily update. The RIVM cautioned that it only reports confirmed cases and deaths, and actual numbers are higher. Zimbabwe is headed for a health and economic catastrophe from the coronavirus pandemic because its debt arrears mean it cannot access foreign lenders, the finance minister warned in a letter to the IMF. Mthuli Ncube said in the letter dated 2 April and seen by Reuters on Monday that Zimbabwe needed to start talks and normalise ties with foreign creditors to clear its decades-old arrears and unblock urgently-needed funding. \"The Zimbabwean authorities propose a high-level dialogue on mitigating the economic and social downfall from the Covid-19 pandemic through transformative arrears clearance... short of which the country will suffer a health and economic catastrophe,\" Ncube said in the letter. It was sent to the IMF and copied to the World Bank, African Development Bank, European Investment Bank and the chair of the Paris Club of sovereign creditors. The IMF declined to comment on the leaked letter. An official in the agency, who declined to be identified, confirmed the letter had been received. Lenders like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank stopped lending to Zimbabwe in 1999 after the country defaulted on its debt repayments. That has led the government to resort to domestic borrowing and money-printing to finance the budget deficit, pushing inflation to 676.39% in March year-on-year, one of the highest in the world. Before the coronavirus outbreak, Zimbabwe was grappling with its worst economic crisis in a decade, marked by shortages of foreign exchange, medicines and electricity as frustration over president Emmerson Mnangagwa's government grows. Zimbabwe has reported just 34 coronavirus cases and four deaths. Yet the economic effects of its lockdown have been ruinous. More than half of Zimbabwe's 15 million people already needed food aid after a drought in 2019, according to the government and aid agencies, which shrank the economy by 6%. The president last week promised a $720m stimulus package for distressed companies, but did not say where the money would come from. \"Cumulatively, Zimbabwe's economy could contract by between 15% and 20% during 2019 and 2020. This is a massive contraction with very serious social consequences,\" Ncube said in the letter. \"Zimbabwe desperately needs international support,\" Ncube said, adding that the pandemic could lead to loss of lives and \"raise poverty to levels not seen in recent times\". China's southern Guangdong province has launched a raft of anti-discrimination policies targeting businesses and venues after a heavy-handed crackdown on the African community sparked international outrage last month. Authorities in the provincial capital Guangzhou had started mass testing its African community shortly after a cluster of Covid-19 cases was found in a neighbourhood with a large migrant population, and a wave of reports about discrimination and xenophobia followed. The new anti-racism rules, announced at the weekend, came after many Africans in Guangzhou said they had been forcibly evicted by police from their accommodation, refused service at shops and restaurants, and were subject to mass coronavirus testing and arbitrary quarantines. Now, businesses and residential compounds \"must implement non-discriminatory service ... treat all Chinese and foreigners in Guangdong equally, and firmly oppose any racist or discriminatory speech and behaviour,\" according to a Sunday report by the state-run China News Service. The new policies appeared to address some of the concerns raised by the African community, banning public spaces from setting tighter entry requirements for certain nationalities and promising to punish buses and taxis who refuse foreign passengers. They also ban landlords from cancelling housing contracts or increasing rent without explanation. However, the measures do not outline any specific punishments. A total of 111 African nationals in Guangzhou have tested positive for Covid-19, including 19 imported cases, officials announced on 11 April. The vast majority of imported cases in Guangdong province involved returning Chinese nationals. McDonald's China was among the businesses who came under fire. It apologised after a branch in Guangzhou displayed a sign banning black people from entry, prompting online outrage. Two US biotech companies have identified a drug candidate for treating Covid-19 and plan to begin human testing by the end of the year, the companies said on Monday. Vir Biotechnology Inc and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc said the therapy candidate makes use of RNA interference (RNAi) technology that targets and \"silences\" specific genetic material, blocking the production of deadly proteins that cause diseases. Is air pollution making the coronavirus pandemic even more deadly? My colleague, environment editor Damian Carrington, has written a comprehensive summary of the research into whether air pollution is turbo-charging the coronavirus pandemic. He writes: Researchers caution that plausibility is far from proof, and correlation does not necessarily mean causation, as many other factors may be important. But these initial findings do raise cause for concern - and may play a crucial role in helping us understand and combat the spread of the pandemic. More than 10 times as many people in Germany have probably been infected with the coronavirus than the number of confirmed cases, researchers from the University of Bonn have concluded from a field trial in one of the worst hit towns. The preliminary study results, which have yet to be peer reviewed for publication in a scientific journal, serve as a reminder of the dangers of infection by unidentified carriers of the virus, some of whom show no symptoms, the researchers said. The readings come as Germany took further steps on Monday to ease restrictions, with museums, hairdressers, churches and more car factories reopening under strict conditions. About 1.8 million people living in Germany must have been infected, more than 10 times the number of about 160,000 confirmed cases so far, the team led by medical researchers Hendrik Streeck and Gunther Hartmann concluded. \"The results can help to further improve the models to calculate how the virus spreads. So far the underlying data has been relatively weak,\" Hartmann said in a statement. The team analysed blood and nasal swabs from a random sample of 919 people living in a town in the municipality of Heinsberg on the Dutch border, which had among the highest death tolls in Germany. To arrive at their estimate, the researchers put the town's number of known deaths from Covid-19 relative to the larger estimate of local people with a prior infection - as indicated by antibody blood test readings - and applied the rate of 0.37% to country-wide deaths. They also found that about one in five of those infected showed no symptoms. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has revived calls for a European tax on digital businesses, saying the coronavirus crisis made such levies more pertinent than ever. Nearly 140 countries are negotiating the first major rewriting of international tax rules in more than a generation, to take better account of the rise of big tech companies that often book profit in low-tax countries. However, the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak has left finance ministries more focused on saving their economies than overhauling outdated tax rules, making a deadline of the end of the year to wrap up the talks look increasingly stretched. Le Maire had said before the crisis that if the talks organised by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) fail, then the European Union should create its own digital tax. Le Maire said in a Linkedin Live event: This crisis shows that those who are making out the best are the digital giants, simply because they are able to keep their businesses going and yet they are the ones that are the least taxed. My digital tax proposal is more relevant than ever and I hope that our European partners will recognise the absolute necessity to step up the taxation of digital giants. Past attempts to create an EU-wide digital tax have failed in the face of opposition from Ireland, where many big US tech companies book profits, and some Nordic countries. In the face of the deadlock, some European countries, starting with France, have pushed ahead with their own national taxes on digital companies. France's tax triggered threats of tariff retaliation from the United States, which have been put on hold to give time for a deal to be reached this year at the OECD. Romania will not extend a state of emergency past its 15 May expiry date, but will impose a \"state of alert\" allowing some modest relaxation of restrictions, president Klaus Iohannis said on Monday. \"Unfortunately this epidemic has not yet passed. We need to be responsible and be very cautions further ahead,\" Iohannis said, adding that some travel restrictions were lifted but \"people won't be allowed to travel in groups larger than three\". Gatherings, outdoor and indoor, were still banned, he added. An internal Chinese report warns that Beijing faces a rising wave of hostility in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak that could tip relations with the United States into confrontation, Reuters reports. The report, presented early last month by the ministry of state security to top Beijing leaders including president Xi Jinping, concluded that global anti-China sentiment is at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, sources said. As a result, Beijing faces a wave of anti-China sentiment led by the US in the aftermath of the pandemic and needs to be prepared in a worst-case scenario for armed confrontation between the two global powers, according to people familiar with the report's content, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. The report was drawn up by the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a think tank affiliated with the ministry of state security, China's top intelligence body. Reuters has not seen the briefing paper, but it was described by people who had direct knowledge of its findings. \"I don't have relevant information,\" the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson's office said in a statement responding to questions from Reuters on the report. China's Ministry of State Security could not be reached for comment. CICIR, an influential think tank that until 1980 was within the ministry of state security and advises the Chinese government on foreign and security policy, did not reply to a request for comment. Reuters couldn't determine to what extent the stark assessment described in the paper reflects positions held by China's state leaders, and to what extent, if at all, it would influence policy. But the presentation of the report shows how seriously Beijing takes the threat of a building backlash that could threaten what China sees as its strategic investments overseas and its view of its security standing. Relations between China and the United States are widely seen to be at their worst point in decades, with deepening mistrust and friction points from US allegations of unfair trade and technology practices, to disputes over Hong Kong, Taiwan and contested territories in the South China Sea. In recent days, US president Donald Trump, facing a more difficult re-election campaign as the coronavirus has claimed tens of thousands of American lives and ravaged the US economy, has been ramping up his criticism of Beijing and threatening new tariffs on China. His administration, meanwhile, is considering retaliatory measures against China over the outbreak, officials said. It is widely believed in Beijing that the United States wants to contain a rising China, which has become more assertive globally as its economy has grown. An international conference to drive forward the global race for coronavirus vaccines, treatments and tests is taking place today. The virtual Coronavirus Global Response International Pledging Conference, is co-hosted by the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Saudi Arabia, and the European Commission. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will confirm the government's pledge of \u00a3388m in aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments. This includes \u00a3250m for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to develop vaccines against coronavirus - the biggest such donation to the fund by any country. Speaking to the conference, Johnson will say: The more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It's humanity against the virus - we are in this together, and together we will prevail. On Thursday, the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca announced a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university. Swiss parliamentarians, who broke off work in March over the coronavirus outbreak, gathered on Monday in a large exhibition hall for a special session to discuss the best way forward in the pandemic. Opening the session in Bern - only the fourth in history to be held outside Switzerland's stately parliament building - president Simonetta Sommaruga acknowledged that the country was living through \"an unprecedented crisis\" and urged MPs to get back to work. \"The government needs you,\" she said, standing at a lonely podium, her microphone covered with a plastic bag, in a large hall with the country's 246 parliamentarians and their aides seated at tables spaced out with at least two metres between them. Sommaruga acknowledged that the government had been forced during the crisis to infringe on personal and economic liberties but said it had not taken such decisions \"lightly\". Over the next four days, MPs will discuss the restrictions imposed to halt the spread of the virus, and the path forward as Switzerland, like a number of other European countries, begins easing the lockdown. The wealthy Alpine country of some 8.5 million people has been relatively hard-hit by the pandemic, counting more than 1,450 deaths out of almost 30,000 people infected. Last week, hairdressers, garden centres, hardware stores and doctors' surgeries reopened again. Next week, schools, shops and markets, along with restaurants, museums and libraries are set to open their doors as well. Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, has outlined a list of what the public should be expecting of and demanding from their governments during the coronavirus pandemic. In brief: An aggressive \"test, trace, isolate\" policy involving mass community testing The protection of health and social care workers who are most at risk from contracting the virus Constant surveillance of the virus using tracking systems to quickly detect hotspots across the country Clear and honest communication with the public to ensure trust Recognition that any \"exit\" strategy will not mean a return to normal pre-coronavirus Lockdowns are not a solution by themselves - they should be used as sparingly as possible The world is still awaiting key scientific findings that will determine the ultimate \"exit strategy\". Iceland's secondary schools and universities began reopening on Monday, as the country started easing measures put in place seven weeks ago to curb the spread of coronavirus. The vast island in the North Atlantic has confirmed 1,799 cases of the illness and 10 deaths, but the number of new cases has ranged between zero and three since 23 April. A study published in April in the New England Journal of Medicine attributed Iceland's success at containing the pandemic to its widespread testing, having tested more people than any other country and starting a month before the first case was even confirmed. As of Sunday, Iceland had carried out tests on 50,406 people, or 14% of its 364,000-strong population. The aggressive testing programme appears to have helped slow the spread of the virus by allowing health authorities to detect people who were infected and contagious but had no symptoms or thought they just had a cold or the flu. When people test positive, they have to self-isolate at home until 14 days after their fever subsides or until they test negative for the virus. Anybody who comes in contact with them has to self-quarantine for two weeks. The University of Iceland in Reykjavik, which has 13,000 students, predicted a slow and gradual reopening on Monday, principal Jon Atli Benediktsson told AFP, and the same was expected at its six other campuses across the country. Ukraine's government on Monday extended a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus pandemic until 22 May but agreed to partially lift some restrictions from 11 May, according to televised cabinet proceedings. The partial lifting of the restrictions includes opening parks and recreation areas, and allowing some shops, such as those specialising in household goods or textiles, to open. Cafes can reopen for takeaway services. Major South African lender Absa said on Monday it had agreed hundreds of millions of dollars in temporary repayment relief for its borrowers, after the industry said 1.2 million people had applied for help. The impact of the lockdown on South Africa, a country of over 58 million, mostly poor people, is expected to be devastating: the economy had already fallen into recession at the end of 2019, and official unemployment was close to 30%. Absa said more than 376,000 of its account holders had applied for assistance and the bank would deliver 5.8bn rand of relief, such as repayment breaks or reductions in installments, over three months. The Banking Association of South Africa (BASA) said the industry had already implemented more than 15bn rand ($798.03 million) in temporary repayment help - with roughly half going to individuals and half to businesses. The death toll from the Covid-19 outbreak in Iran rose by 74 in the past 24 hours to 6,277, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said on Monday. The total number of diagnosed cases in Iran, one of the countries hardest hit by the outbreak in the Middle East, has reached 98,647, he said. Indian police fired tear gas on Monday to scatter migrant workers during clashes in the western state of Gujarat, officials said, as authorities relaxed one of the world's strictest lockdowns to stem the spread of the coronavirus. The nationwide lockdown, extended twice since it was implemented on 25 March, is being eased in some areas, but will run until 17 May, the government said last week. The tally of infections stands at more than 42,500, with 1,300 dead. About 1,000 stranded workers seeking help to return to homes in states across India gathered on the outskirts of the industrial and diamond-processing city of Surat, but threw stones at police who ordered them to break up, an official said. \"The police fired tear gas shells to disperse protesters,\" a police official in Kadodara, near the site of the clash, told Reuters, seeking anonymity as he was not authorised to speak with media. Television showed images of police entering buildings and homes in the area and detaining people. Surat has suffered incidents of labour unrest since the lockdown began. The shutdown endangers the economic survival of many of India's estimated 140 million migrant labourers, though officials say it is key to beating the virus in a nation of 1.3 billion people, where health services are already stretched. It's Jessica Murray here, I'm taking over from my colleague Aamna and will be running the global live blog for the next few hours, updating you on the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. If you're looking for UK-focused coronavirus news, Andrew Sparrow is heading up the UK live blog as ministers discuss plans for how Britain's lockdown could be eased.

US officials believe China hid virus's severity to hoard medical supplies. An intelligence report by US Department of Homeland Security, obtained by AP, claims China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it. The report follows claims by US defence secretary Mark Esper that Russia and China are taking advantage of the coronavirus emergency to put their interests forward in Europe. Police in Kuwait dispersed protests by stranded Egyptians unable to return home. The development was the first reported sign of unrest from the region's vast population of foreign workers who have lost their jobs over the crisis. Japan extends the country's national state of emergency to May 31. Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday he had decided to extend the country's national state of emergency to 31 May, Reuters reports. High schools and universities slowly reopen in Iceland. The country began easing measures put in place seven weeks ago to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. South Africa's unemployment rate could reach 40%. In a radio interview, South Afica's treasury director general, Dondo Mogajane, said the country could see about 200bn rand under-collection in tax revenue, painting the starkest picture yet of the economic impact of the coronavirus on the nation. The number of coronavirus cases in Russia has risen by 10,581 over the past 24 hours. This brought Russia's nationwide tally to 145,268, the country's coronavirus crisis response centre said on Monday. Swimming body FINA postpones 2021 World Aquatics Championships to 2022. The FINA World Championships in Fukuoka (JPN) was initially scheduled for the summer of 2021, but will now take place from 13-29 May 2022. Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, has been giving evidence to the European parliament's committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Ammon told the committee that only Bulgaria among all European countries is still experiencing an increase in cases of infection. She said: \"The country where we now see still an increase is Bulgaria. There are four countries where we see no substantial changes in the last 14 days - Poland, Romania, Sweden, and the UK. All the others we really see this substantial decrease.\" Ammon said that lockdowns in Europe have reduced the overall transmission of coronavirus by 45% compared with 8 April. \"As of Saturday it appears the initial wave of transmission has passed its peak,\" she said. Ammon sounded cautious about the rollout of masks to the public as a way of controlling the spread given the lack of evidence for their utility. \"Wearing a face mask should always be seen as an additional tool to hand-washing and social distancing measures,\" she said. Ammon added that there was a risk that masks would give citizens a \"false sense of security\". She said: This is a marathon not a sprint. People's expectations about the pandemic situation, duration, effect it'll continue to have on their lives for the foreseeable future needs to be managed. This isn't going to end any time soon and people need to prepare for it. Ammon said her agency had 'low confidence' that the death figures collected by governments within the EU/EEA and the UK are complete. An intelligence report by US Department of Homeland Security, obtained by AP, claims China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it. Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page dated 1 May. The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with secretary of state Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable. The French prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe will present more details of the government's deconfinement or end of lockdown plan as well as the bill extending the \"state of health emergency\" until 24 July, to the S\u00e9nat, the upper house of parliament, on Monday afternoon. The government is hoping for a quick passage through the house and on to the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale tomorrow where the debate is likely to be more heated, but where Emmanuel Macron's centrist government has a large majority. France's health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran warned at the weekend that the date for the end of lockdown of 11 May is not set in stone and if there is no significant continuation of the drop in the spread of the virus, the date would be put back. However, the figures are continuing to look encouraging and the curve is still heading downwards, so France will almost certainly end the lockdown in a week. But the return to more normal life will be \"progressive\" and will largely depend on where the virus is still circulating and how hospital intensive care units are coping. A map, updated every day, has been published dividing the country's departments into \"red\", \"orange\" and \"green\", indicating which areas may still face some lockdown regulations. The orange departments will be declared red or green when a definitive map is published on Thursday. In any case, the French have been told not to make journeys of more than 100km without good professional or major family reasons after 11 May for the foreseeable future. One of Macron's main objectives in ending the lockdown is to reopen the country's schools, but this is proving problematic. Nursery and primary schools will reopen classes on Tuesday, but with a maximum of between 10 and 15 pupils. The two lower years of secondary schools, will return the following Monday. In Paris, City Hall estimates only 10% of nursery and primary school pupils will be able to return on Tuesday. The opening of classes is hampered because the city will almost certainly remain \"red\" on the coronavirus map and many city school buildings make it impossible to impose social distancing on youngsters. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo is among 334 mayors from the \u00cele de France region who have written an open letter to Macron asking for the reopening of schools to be postponed because of concerns over the potential health risk to children and teachers. For a second consecutive day, Spain's overnight coronavirus death toll has reached 164, according to the latest figures from the health ministry. To date, there have been 218,011 confirmed cases in the country and 25,428 deaths. The embattled carrier Norwegian Air has won support from aircraft lessors for its rescue plan as it faces a crunch shareholder vote on the $1.2bn (\u00a3950m) plan to convert debt into equity at an emergency meeting on Monday. Norwegian's shareholder meeting got under way in Oslo on Monday morning, as the European Union's competition watchdog approved French state aid worth (EURO)7bn (\u00a36bn) for Air France. The Covid-19 pandemic has plunged the global aviation industry into its worst crisis, bringing air travel to a near-standstill. Airlines across Europe have sought government help as coronavirus lockdowns have forced them to ground their fleets. As it approved the French state guarantee and shareholder loan to Air France, the European commission noted the importance of the carrier, with more than 300 planes, to the French economy and its role in repatriating stranded citizens and transporting medical supplies. Norwegian - one of the biggest airlines at London's Gatwick airport - grounded 95% of its fleet in mid-March and has warned it could run out of cash by the middle of the month unless it pushes through its rescue plan. The plan will hand majority ownership to the airline's creditors and leave current shareholders with just 5.2% of the company, but there was no alternative, Norwegian's chief executive, Jacob Schram, said. He told Norway's TV2: \"Without a yes [from shareholders], it will be game over.\" Malaysian health authorities on Monday reported 55 new coronavirus cases, Reuters reports, raising the total to 6,353 cases as Malaysians began heading out under relaxed curbs on movement and businesses. There were no new fatalities reported, leaving total deaths at 105. Meanwhile, Indonesia reported 395 new coronavirus infections on Monday, taking the total in the south-east Asian country to 11,587, said health ministry official Achmad Yurianto. Yurianto reported 19 new coronavirus-related deaths, taking the total to 864, while 1,954 have recovered. More than 86,000 people have been tested, he said. The number of coronavirus cases in Bangladesh surpassed 10,000 on Monday, the country's health ministry said, Reuters reports, with infections increasing in pace over the past several days. Bangladesh reported 688 new cases of Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, taking its tally since it reported its first case two months ago to 10,143. The death toll rose to 182. Russia and China are taking advantage of the coronavirus emergency to put their interests forward in Europe, US defence secretary Mark Esper claimed on Monday, according to a report by Reuters. Both China and Russia have offered support to Italy, sending doctors, medical equipment and face masks to the country which was the first in Europe to be hit hard by the outbreak. When asked whether China and Russia were trying to gain influence in Italy by sending aid, Esper told the Italian daily newspaper La Stampa: [The United States] is aware that some will try to use the pandemic as a way to invest in critical industry and infrastructure, with effect on security in the long term... Potential opponents will almost certainly try to use their interest to put their interests forward and create divisions in NATO and Europe Huawei and 5G are an important example of this malign activity by China.\" Esper's comments come at a time when some US officials have blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo said on Sunday Washington had evidence the disease emerged from a Chinese lab, which Beijing strongly denies. Police in Kuwait dispersed what they described as a riot by stranded Egyptians unable to return home amid the coronavirus pandemic, authorities said on Monday, AP reports. The development was the first reported sign of unrest from the region's vast population of foreign workers who have lost their jobs over the crisis. Online videos purported to show Kuwaiti police firing teargas at the demonstrators overnight, who earlier chanted: \"Where is our embassy?\" The state-run Kuna news agency called the confrontation a \"riot\" carried out by Egyptians corralled at a group shelter. \"Security officials intervened and took control, arresting a number of them,\" the Kuna report said. It did not acknowledge what level of force police used to put down the unrest, nor how many people authorities ultimately arrested after the incident. Kuwait's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday he had decided to extend the country's national state of emergency to May 31, Reuters reports. Abe will consider lifting the state of emergency without waiting for its 31 May expiration if experts decide that is possible based on detailed analysis of regional infection trends, he said at the start of a meeting of the government's coronavirus task force. Iceland's secondary schools and universities began reopening on Monday, as the country began easing measures put in place seven weeks ago to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, AFP reports. The country, a vast island of 364,000 people located in the North Atlantic, has confirmed 1,799 cases of the illness and 10 deaths, but the number of new cases has ranged between zero and three since 23 April. The University of Iceland in Reykjavik, which has 13,000 students, predicted a slow and gradual reopening, principal Jon Atli Benediktsson told AFP, and the same was expected at its six other campuses across the country. Of Iceland's 38 secondary schools, it was mainly vocational schools that were resuming classes in smaller groups. At these schools, which often involve practical classes, the approaching end-of-year exams must be conducted in person and not online. Most general secondary schools contacted by AFP said they would not be reopening and would instead continue distance learning for the last three weeks of the academic year, avoiding the need to find tricky solutions to social distancing in classrooms. Those students will take their final exams exclusively online. Nursery schools and primary schools, which have remained open albeit with reduced hours, resumed their regular schedules on Monday. Hundreds of people queued outside liquor stores in New Delhi on Monday as the Indian capital began easing some curbs after a 40-day lockdown against the coronavirus, Reuters reports. Some offices resumed work with fewer staff and traffic trickled into the streets. Many government cars were among the traffic on Delhi's boulevards on Monday, while police at checkpoints peered into cars to ensure there were no more than two occupants. Everyone wore masks. South Africa's treasury director general warned that unemployment rate could reach 40%, Reuters reports. In a radio interview, Dondo Mogajane said the country could see around 200bn rand under-collection in tax revenue, painting the starkest picture yet of the economic impact of the coronavirus on the nation. He added the economy could contract by between 6% and 12% due to the coronavirus. The number of coronavirus cases in Russia has risen by 10,581 over the past 24 hours, Reuters reports, compared with a record of 10,633 on the previous day. This brought Russia's nationwide tally to 145,268, the country's coronavirus crisis response centre said on Monday. It also reported 76 new deaths from COVID-19, bringing the total death toll in Russia to 1,356. Britain's defence minister declined to comment on media reports that a dossier by the US led 'Five Eyes' intelligence consortium had said that China lied about the coronavirus outbreak. The 15-page intelligence report claimed China deliberately suppressed or destroyed evidence of the coronavirus outbreak in an \"assault on international transparency\" that cost tens of thousands of lives. The report, obtained by Australia Sunday Telegraph, was reportedly produced by The Five Eyes, an intelligence group made up of Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. When asked about the report on BBC Radio, defence secretary Ben Wallace said: \"Every day I get intelligence bulletins from our agencies around the world. I don't comment on individual bulletins, what I have and haven't seen. That would be wrong.\" The Five Eyes evolved from a secret World War Two alliance between British and U.S. cypher and code breaking teams, Reuters reports. The Ugandan government has launched an investigation into the activities of a megachurch in Kampala after seven members of its internationally renowned children's choir were diagnosed with Covid-19 following an overseas tour. The country's child affairs minister, Florence Nakiwala Kiyingi, told the Guardian the Internal Security Organisation was investigating Watoto church for allegedly breaching child labour laws, taking the children out of the country without permission and putting them at risk by not cancelling the tour as coronavirus cases escalated and countries closed their borders. The church has not responded to the Guardian's requests for comment on the allegations. The children, aged between seven and 10, were diagnosed shortly after returning from a UK tour on 20 March. They, along with seven adults on the tour who also tested positive for the virus, have all now fully recovered, the church said. However, more than 80 members of the choir, including 48 children, reportedly remain stranded in the US, Malaysia, New Zealand and Brazil as they were unable to travel back to Uganda before the country closed its borders on the 23 March. As of Tuesday, Uganda had 83 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. In Afghanistan, the health ministry has warned that the threat of coronavirus is at its highest level across the war-torn country as number of confirmed deaths of Covid-19 reached 90. The country reported 190 new coronavirus cases and five new deaths over past 24 hours, including the highest one-day rise of infections in Paktia province and continued surge of transmission in Kandahar. Th latest figures push the total number of infections to 2894 and death toll to 90. The number of transmission continued to surge in Kandahar and Kabul on Monday, with around 50 new cases confirmed in both provinces. Kabul is the country's worst affected area with 704 confirmed cases. One-third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan's capital came back positive, health officials said Sunday. Wahid Majroh, deputy health minister said on Monday that the result of 500 tests are concerning though it's \"not comparable with around 5 million population of Kabul and the tests were rapid and some may not confirmed at the end\". He warned in press conference that the threat of the coronavirus is currently at its \"highest level\". And asked the people to cooperate with health workers and stay at home. The Afghan government has pledged to distribute bread to poor people over the weekend using Kabul bakeries. \"Some bread is being distributed in the bakeries, but more people gathering. It has more disadvantages than advantages because the virus is spreading rapidly\", said Wahidullah Mayar, health ministry spokesman. War continued to intensify in the country, a government spokesman said 17 civilians were killed by the Taliban in first week of Ramadan. The FINA World Championships in Fukuoka (JPN) was initially scheduled for the summer of 2021, but will now take place from 13 May 2022 to 29 May 2022. FINA president Dr Julio C. Maglione said in a statement: After liaising with the relevant stakeholders and receiving feedback from them, we have no doubt that the decision taken will provide the best possible conditions for all participants at the Championships. We look forward to witnessing the world's best aquatic athletes from around the world competing in the city of Fukuoka (JPN) in 2022 At a time of unprecedented uncertainty, FINA hopes the announcement of these dates will allow for some clarity in planning for all concerned. Singapore's health ministry said on Monday it confirmed 573 new coronavirus cases, taking the city-state's tally of infections to 18,778, according to a report by Reuters. Is Australia flattening the curve? My colleagues in Australia dig into the data. They bring together all the Covid-19 confirmed cases, maps, stats and graphs from NSW, Victoria, Queensland, SA, WA, Tasmania, ACT and NT to get a broad picture of the Australian outbreak and track the impact of government response. A global alliance of world leaders, potentially including China and the US, is expected to pledge to raise an initial $8.2bn (\u00a36.5bn) at a virtual summit on Monday to research and equitably distribute vaccines and therapeutics to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic. It is hoped national research efforts will be streamlined so that vaccines are manufactured quickly for distribution to poorer countries, and not just for the benefit of the wealthy economies that produce them. National prestige and huge profits are potentially at stake for the countries and firms that win the race for a vaccine that can take the world's economies out of lockdown, but there is a risk of uncoordinated duplication of research efforts slowing the process and adding to the cost. Monday's fundraising summit comes after the concept was launched at a previous meeting on 24 April. Neither China nor the US attended the hastily assembled earlier summit, which also included the World Health Organization. The US president, Donald Trump, who is at loggerheads with the WHO and China over what he has called a conspiracy to cover up the origin of the virus, had been urged to support the summit. But optimism that the US might relent and join the initiative had waned by Monday morning. PA Media has a breakdown of what different aspects of UK society could look like after the lockdown is eased. Offices According to the BBC, staggered shift times, less sharing of equipment and continued maximisation of home working are among a number of ideas listed as part of a draft government strategy to help businesses prepare for a return to work.Increased hygiene procedures and the installation of protective screens are also included in the plan. Meanwhile, the Guardian says ministers are holding talks with technology firms over the creation of \"health passports\" that use \"coronavirus testing and facial recognition\" to prove which workers have had Covid-19. Retail The British Retail Consortium (BRC) last month published guidance for measures that retail stores could introduce to help with the transition once restrictions are lifted. The recommended measures include limiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed. The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores. Public transport Speaking on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show, transport secretary Grant Shapp said increased bus and train timetables will be implemented to help the public transport system cope with an influx in passengers while still adhering to social distancing recommendations. He also pointed to active transport methods such as cycling as a way for people to take more personal responsibility over their welfare. \"The second thing to say is active travel, I think, is a very important part of this, by which I mean cycling, walking and so on,\" he said. Airports Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye has warned that the nation's major international airports do not have enough space for social distancing to be a solution for safe travel post-lockdown. \"Forget social distancing - it won't work in aviation or any other form of public transport, and the problem is not the plane, it is the lack of space in the airport,\" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. \"Just one jumbo jet would require a queue a kilometre long.\" Instead, Holland-Kaye believes mandatory health checks for passengers, increased levels of hygiene and compulsory face masks would be more realistic options to enable airports to reopen and air travel to resume.

The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide has passed 3.5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with deaths nearing a quarter of a million. North America and European countries accounted for most of the new cases reported in recent days, but numbers were rising from smaller bases in Latin America, Africa and Russia. There are currently 3,506,924 confirmed cases of the virus, and 247,473 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. Trump 'very confident' there will be a vaccine by the end of this year. US president Donald Trump is \"very confident\" there will be vaccine by the end of 2020. In a \"virtual town hall\" with Fox news, Trump said: \"We are very confident we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year.\" Trump's declaration came despite his own pandemic task force predicting it could be another 18 months. The US president also said that up to 100,000 Americans could die in the pandemic. Mike Pompeo says coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, claimed there was \"enormous evidence\" coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory - but did not provide any of the alleged evidence. US intelligence had issued a formal statement saying the scientific consensus is the virus was not manmade or genetically modified. When reminded of this, Pompeo replied: 'That's right. I agree with that.'\" France won't quarantine EU, Schengen area citizens. France said on Sunday it would not quarantine anyone arriving from the EU, the Schengen area or Britain due to the coronavirus, as it prepares to start easing confinement measures after two months of lockdown. New Zealand records zero new cases. New Zealand has recorded a day of no new cases of Covid-19 for the first time since before the lockdown. It's an \"encouraging\" result, said Ashley Bloomfield, the director general of health. There have been 1,487 confirmed and probable cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, with 86% of them now recovered. Seven people were still in hospital. Japan expected to extend state of emergency until end of May. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is set to extend the country's state of emergency on Monday, until the end of May, public broadcaster NHK said. The government is also expected to determine new prevention measures for the coronavirus outbreak that has infected about 15,000 people and killed more than 500 in the country, Reuters reports. Bolsonaro fuels protests in defiance of health advice. Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has spent another weekend stirring up street protests in defiance of his own health ministry's appeals for citizens to stay at home because of coronavirus. Meanwhile, Brazil passed 100,000 confirmed cases. UK and France to trial tracing apps. France's tracing app is expected to enter testing week on Monday. France's state-supported \"StopCOVID\" contact-tracing app should enter its testing phase a week on Monday when the country starts to unwind its lockdown, a government minister has said. The UK will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme next week on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England, cabinet minister Michael Gove announced as the government looked to minimise the risk of a second wave of infection. More than a million renters in Britain risk losing their jobs in the coronavirus pandemic and should be protected by an immediate rent freeze, according to a thinktank. Calling on the government to suspend all private rents for three months as an emergency measure to protect those most at risk, the New Economics Foundation (NEF) said 1.2 million people living in privately rented homes could fall into severe financial hardship otherwise. These people are among 5.6 million it identified who will miss out from the government's Covid-19 job retention scheme, due to having their hours cut or being made redundant rather than being furloughed. It also includes people ineligible for the self-employed income protection scheme. Thailand's new coronavirus cases rose to 18 on Monday, after falling to single-digits for the past week, but the country reported no new deaths. Monday's report brought the total number of cases to 2,987 since the new virus was detected in Thailand in January, with a total of 54 deaths. The new cases were migrants who were entering Thailand through an immigration checkpoint in the southern province of Songkhla, which shares a border with Malaysia, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman of the government's Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration. They were all being quarantined in an immigration detention centre, along with 42 cases found previously on 25 April, Taweesin said. The full story on the latest from Japan now: Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is poised to extend the country's state emergency until the end of the month, amid warnings that relaxing social distancing advice too early could flood already crowded hospitals with coronavirus patients. Abe declared a month-long state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures on 7 April, enabling local governors to request that people avoid unnecessary trips outside and that non-essential businesses close. The measures have since been expanded nationwide, but they are far less restrictive than those introduced in the US and parts of Europe, with no fines or other penalties for those who do not comply. The restrictions were due to end on Wednesday - the end of a series of public holidays known as Golden Week - but Abe has reportedly decided to extend them on the advice of experts who warned that a second wave of infections could put intolerable pressure on hospitals, particularly in Tokyo. Abe, who was due to explain his decision at a press conference later Monday, has warned that Japan faces a \"drawn-out battle\" against the virus: Here's a look at the stories leading the papers this morning: Six Italians on lives changed by coronavirus The Guardian's Angela Giuffrida and Lorenzo Tondo have this in-depth report from Italy: The coronavirus crisis agony of Spain's poor Paloma P\u00e9rez, a smoker who has dealt with pancreatitis and cancer, has more reason than many to fear the coronavirus as she waits out the lockdown in her house in the mountains outside Madrid. To limit her exposure, the 74-year-old has told the home help who used to pop in twice a week to stop coming, and her main meal of the day - usually fish or meat, but with a decent variety of sides - is left outside her closed front door by the Catholic charity C\u00e1ritas. The nightmares P\u00e9rez suffered when the pandemic began have receded and she is adapting to the enduring lockdown with far fewer problems than many people in Spain. C\u00e1ritas has reported a surge in pleas for help since Spain went into national lockdown on 14 March. It says demand in the Madrid region has tripled over the past few weeks and 85% of the requests it receives are for food, medicine, or assistance in covering basic living costs. Trump 'very confident' of Covid-19 vaccine in 2020 and predicts up to 100,000 US deaths Donald Trump has said he is \"very confident\" there will be a vaccine for coronavirus by the end of the year, revising up his estimate of the final US death toll as several European countries prepare for a cautious easing of lockdowns. The president used a Fox News \"virtual town hall\" on Sunday night to repeat his regular virus talking points, including that a vaccine was not far away, Covid-19 was China's fault and the economy would not only recover but \"grow like crazy\". \"We are very confident we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year,\" Trump said. Scientists have repeatedly warned that a vaccine may take 12-18 months or longer. Trump in April predicted 60,000 American lives would be lost but on Sunday said: \"We're going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to 100,000 people. That's a horrible thing.\" Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said on Monday that the government has \"not yet\" received an invitation to take part in this month's meeting of the World Health Organization's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly. However, the government will strive \"until the last moment\" to participate as an observer, ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said in a statement. Taiwan's lack of membership at the WHO, due to China's objections which considers the island as one of its provinces, has infuriated Taipei, which says its exclusion has created a glaring gap in the global fight against the coronavirus. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Global coronavirus cases top 3.5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with deaths nearing a quarter of a million. There are currently 3,506,924 confirmed cases of the virus, and 247,473 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far.

On Saturday, the government had said it would extend the state of emergency to contain the crisis until at least 24 July, and anyone entering France would have to remain in isolation for two weeks. New Zealand has recorded a day of no new cases of Covid-19 for the first time since before the lockdown. It's an \"encouraging\" result, said Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health, who's announcing the latest figures at an ongoing news conference in Wellington.

Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has spent another weekend stirring up street protests in defiance of his own health ministry's appeals for citizens to stay at home because of coronavirus. Brazil passes 100,000 confirmed cases. There have been 4,588 new cases of the coronavirus in Brazil and 275 deaths over the last 24 hours, the health ministry said on Sunday, bringing total confirmed cases in the country to over 100,000. Italy reports lowest toll since first day of lockdown.

Coronavirus health passports for UK 'possible in months' The Guardian's Kate Proctor and Hannah Devlin report: Tech firms are in talks with ministers about creating health passports to help Britons return safely to work using coronavirus testing and facial recognition. Facial biometrics could be used to help provide a digital certificate - sometimes known as an immunity passport - proving which workers have had Covid-19, as a possible way of easing the impact on the economy and businesses from ongoing physical distancing even after current lockdown measures are eased. The UK-based firm Onfido, which specialises in verifying people's identities using facial biometrics, has delivered detailed plans to the government and is involved in a number of conversations about what could be rolled out across the country, it is understood. Its proposals, which have reached pilot stages in other countries, could be executed within months, it says. The firm could use antibody tests - proving whether someone has had the virus - or antigen tests, which show current infections. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is speaking to the press now. Ardern has told reporters that a trans-Tasman reopening - in which Australians and New Zealanders could travel between the countries without a 14-day quarantine period - wouldn't \"be in the very very near short term.\" \"Don't expect this to happen in a couple of weeks time,\" Ardern said. She added that the two countries \"have very similar perspective of the type of timeline\" that might be possible. While Australian prime ministers had attended New Zealand's cabinet ministers before, Ardern understood that she was the first New Zealand prime minister to be invited to an Australian gathering. \"It highlights what's happened with cooperation at the state level and the mutual importance of both countries economies to each other,\" she said. Here's the full story on New Zealand, which has recorded its first day of no new cases of Covid-19 since a stringent national lockdown began more than one month ago. The public has been engrossed by the daily release of case numbers by the health ministry each afternoon - especially as a deadline looms for the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, to decide whether the country's lockdown rules will ease further next Monday. One week into level-3 restrictions, however, officials sounded a cautious note as breaches of the shutdown rules continued to rise. Jacinda Ardern joins national cabinet meeting as Australia, New Zealand share coronavirus strategyRead more \"It is cause for celebration ... It is important that we reflect that it is symbolic of the effort that everybody has put in,\" said Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand's director-general of health, as he announced zero new cases of the coronavirus on Monday. \"I don't want to downplay that but once again, we need to be continuing vigilance.\" There have been 1,487 confirmed and probable cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, with 86% of them now recovered. Seven people are in hospital. Twenty people have died of the virus; no additional deaths were reported on Monday. A dog is for life and not just for the Covid-19 lockdown, a UK charity has warned after online searches about getting a puppy surged by 120%. The Dogs Trust says it is concerned that the increased interest in acquiring a dog may be followed by a rise in people giving up their new pets when some form of normality resumes. The animal welfare charity, formerly known as the National Canine Defence League, is temporarily changing its famous slogan, \"a dog is for life, not just for Christmas\" to \"a dog is for life, not just for lockdown\". The organisation's chief executive, Owen Sharp, said: \"Like Christmas, when people are at home more, they might think now is the perfect time to get a dog. \"For some people this will be the case, but we're asking people to consider when the lockdown lifts how your life will need to change to accommodate your four-legged friend. We're encouraging potential dog owners to carry out our new test to see if you're dog ready. \"Are you ready to be chief pooper scooper? Are you ready to forego a lie-in ever again? As well as more serious questions around vet treatment and preparing for emergencies.\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has extended a nationwide coronavirus lockdown until 17 May, but has allowed some relaxations, which will take effect on Monday. The following lists what remains banned and what is permitted, Reuters reports: NATIONWIDE: Travel by air, rail and metro and inter-state movement of people by road remains banned all over the country. Schools, hotels, restaurants, bars, shopping malls, cinemas and places of worship are also shut nationally. There will be no restriction on movement of goods between states or on the manufacturing and distribution of essential items. Different regions have been colour-coded according to how much restrictions can be eased: RED ZONES: The metropolises of Mumbai, New Delhi and Bengaluru have been designated as red zones - where most curbs remain in place. The classification is made based on number of active coronavirus cases, the doubling rate of cases, and the level of testing and surveillance in the area. In urban red zones that are not marked as containment zones - which are areas sealed off due to coronavirus cases - private offices can open at 33% capacity. Construction activity can also resume, as long as workers reside on site. Manufacturing of essential goods and IT hardware is permitted. E-commerce activities are only allowed for essential goods, while standalone shops are able to open. In rural red zones, all agricultural, construction and industrial activity is permitted. ORANGE ZONES: In orange zones, all the activities allowed in red zones are permitted. In addition, taxis are allowed, provided they are carrying only two passengers, as is travel between districts for permitted activities. GREEN ZONES: Areas designated as green zones, or places that have not seen any incidence of Covid-19 in 21 days, are allowed to resume all activities except those prohibited nationally. Buses are allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to extend the country's state of emergency on Monday until the end of May, public broadcaster NHK said. The government is also expected to determine new prevention measures for the coronavirus outbreak that has infected around 15,000 people and killed more than 500 in the country, Reuters reports. Abe is expected to explain the reasoning behind the extension of the state of emergency, which is now due to expire on Wednesday, at a news conference in the evening, NHK said. The government may also ease some of the current coronavirus-related constraints on economic activity by allowing places with relatively low infection risks, such as parks, to re-open, even in hard-hit prefectures. The state of emergency gives governors in those prefectures the authority to request residents to stay at home and businesses to close. There are, however, no penalties for non-compliance. The virus-triggered slump in business activity is threatening to throw the world's third-largest economy into a deep recession, prompting calls for more government spending. Japan's parliament last week approved an extra budget to fund a record $1.1tn stimulus package. New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will join Tuesday's meeting of Australia's national cabinet to discuss approaches to managing the coronavirus and Australia's CovidSafe app. Scott Morrison, who has been in regular dialogue with leaders during the pandemic, invited Ardern to join Tuesday's national cabinet discussion with state premiers last week. Morrison and the premiers will meet twice this week to consider easing some of the restrictions imposed to flatten the curve of infections, with announcements expected on Friday. Australia and New Zealand have both deployed successful strategies to manage the pandemic, although New Zealand's lockdown has been more stringent than Australia's. New Zealand on Monday reported no new cases of Covid-19 for the first time in a month. The country has recently eased restrictions from level four to level three. Piers Morgan has said he will be temporarily stepping back from presenting Good Morning Britain after developing a \"mild\" coronavirus symptom, PA media reports. The programme will be hosted by ITV presenter Ben Shephard alongside Susanna Reid as Morgan waits for his test results, which are due on Monday. Morgan said in a tweet on Sunday night he had had a test and will be stepping back from presenting duties \"on medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution\". This week, Morgan was cleared of breaching TV watchdog Ofcom's rules after attracting more than 3,000 complaints over his \"combative\" questioning of Helen Whately, the social care minister, in two interviews. During an animated interview, he asked Whately how many health workers and care workers who had died from the illness. She accused him of \"shouting at me and not giving me a chance to answer your questions\" and \"attempting to score points\". Morgan defended his approach, saying it was not as \"uncomfortable\" as the conditions for the carers on the front line of the coronavirus crisis. Almost 600 viewers also complained about another interview, with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, on 16 April, who accused him of constantly interrupting him. Circling back to US president Donald Trump's Fox News town hall earlier, where he said up to 100,000 Americans could die from coronavirus. \"We're going to lose anywhere from 75,000, 80,000 to 100,000 people. That's a horrible thing,\" said Trump, who as recently on Friday had said he hoped fewer than 100,000 Americans would die and earlier in the week had talked about 60,000 to 70,000 deaths. Nonetheless, he called his administration's response to the pandemic a success: While millions of people took advantage of easing coronavirus lockdowns to enjoy the outdoors, some of the world's most populous countries reported worrisome new peaks in infections Sunday, including India, which saw its biggest single-day jump yet, AP reports. Second in population only to China, India reported more than 2,600 new infections. In Russia, new cases exceeded 10,000 for the first time. The confirmed total death toll in Britain climbed near that of Italy, the epicenter of Europes outbreak, even though the U.K. population is younger than Italys and Britain had more time to prepare. The United States continues to see tens of thousands of new infections each day, with more than 1,400 additional deaths reported Saturday. Health experts have warned of a potential second wave of infections unless testing is expanded dramatically once the lockdowns are relaxed. But pressure to reopen keeps building after the weeks-long shutdown of businesses plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s and wiped out millions of jobs. In Mexico City, where authorities expect infections to peak next week, workers will turn the Hernandez Rodriguez Formula 1 racecourse into a temporary hospital for Covid-19 patients. Governments have reported 3.5 million infections and more than 247,000 deaths, including more than 67,000 dead in the United States, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University. Deliberately concealed outbreaks, low testing rates and the severe strain the disease has placed on health care systems mean the true scale of the pandemic is undoubtedly much greater. US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said there is \"enormous evidence\" the coronavirus outbreak originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, China, but failed to provide evidence following his statement. Pompeo added, \"experts seem to think it was manmade\", before reversing his statement after he was reminded the US intelligence dismissed those claims last week. Here's the video: Podcast: The global race for face masks The world economy may have dramatically dipped and the price of oil crashed, but one commodity is seeing an unprecedented boom: the face mask. Samanth Subramanian explores the newly distorted marketplace for masks and the lengths some will go to get them: France said Sunday that it would not quarantine anyone arriving from the EU, the Schengen area or Britain due to the coronavirus, as it prepares to start easing confinement measures after two months of lockdown, Reuters reports. On Saturday, the government had said it would extend the state of emergency to contain the crisis until at least 24 July, and anyone entering France would have to remain in isolation for two weeks. But the quarantine rules would not apply to \"anyone arriving from the European Union, the Schengen zone or Britain, regardless of their nationality\", the presidency said on Sunday. And for French and EU citizens arriving in France from other regions outside the EU, the Schengen area and Britain, \"the rules will be announced in the coming days\", the presidency said. Nevertheless, the tougher border controls introduced by France in mid-March to limit coronavirus contagion, particularly at the border with Germany, will continue, the interior ministry told AFP. \"The travel restrictions currently in place at our borders will continue to apply,\" the ministry said. \"Nothing has changed.\" The number of new deaths from Covid-19 in France has been declining in recent days, with 135 fatalities reported over the past 24 hours on Sunday. People are FaceTiming the eels at Sumida Aquarium: In case you missed it, the aquarium asked people to call in via video, so that the eels would not \"forget humans\" and grow to shy to come out when visits to the aquarium resume. More than 300,000 in the UK may have quit smoking during the coronavirus crisis as evidence mounts that the habit makes them more vulnerable to Covid-19, a survey suggests. A further 550,000 have tried to quit, while 2.4 million have cut down, according to the joint study by YouGov and the campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (Ash). The survey of 1,004 people suggested 2% of smokers had quit because of concerns about coronavirus; 8% were trying to quit; 36% had cut down; and 27% were now more likely to quit. A quarter of former smokers said they were less likely to resume smoking, although 4% said the pandemic had made them more likely to relapse. UK business confidence at all-time low, Deloitte report reveals Business confidence at British companies has sunk to an all-time low because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a survey of finance chiefs at the largest UK firms. The accountancy group Deloitte found that nine out of 10 finance directors believe there is a high or very high level of uncertainty facing their business. Deloitte's latest quarterly survey of chief financial officers took place after the UK was placed into lockdown, and warns that only 16% of executives are more optimistic about the prospects for their company than they were three months ago. The survey has recorded its lowest business confidence reading since it was launched in 2007, even lower than during the global financial crisis, in stark contrast to the final quarter of 2019, when the survey recorded confidence at a record high.

Staying in Asia Pacific now: New Zealand has recorded a day of no new cases of Covid-19 in the country for the first time since before the lockdown. It's an \"encouraging\" result, said Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health, who's announcing the latest figures at an ongoing news conference in Wellington. There have been 1,487 confirmed and probable cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, with 86% of them now recovered. Seven people are in hospital. 20 people have died of the virus so far, and no additional deaths were reported on Monday. Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's prime minister, has won international praise for her swift and early lockdown of New Zealand. The most stringent measures eased last Monday, and officials and the public are keenly watching the daily figures to see whether measures can ease further next week. China reported three new coronavirus cases for 3 May, up from two the day before, data from the national health authority showed on Monday. All of the new cases were imported, the National Health Commission said. The commission also reported 13 new asymptomatic cases for May 3, an increase of one from the previous day. The number of confirmed cases in China has reached 82,880. With no new deaths reported, the death toll remained at 4,633. Trump is being asked about getting the nation back to work, and he says that not working can also have serious consequences for people, but praises the administration's success with the virus. Acknowledging that every death is one too many, he says: \"In terms of the deaths... we're at the lowest level predicted, and we might not even hit that.\" Then he appears to lay out his re-election strategy, pretty much in dot-point form: 1. Get rid of the virus 2. Get the country back to work \"quickly and safely\" 3. Economically, he says quarter three will be a \"transition\" quarter, improved in quarter 4, and then a \"great year\" next year. It's six months exactly until the US election will be held (3 November), and he is asked about whether he will hold election rallies: \"Everyone wants the rallies... but I don't think you can a rally with an empty stadium,\" he says, adding that he hopes he will be able to to them in the last couple of months. And the event wraps up. Mike Pence is finally getting a word in. He's being asked about not wearing a mask when he visited the Mayo clinic last week, an event that was widely publicised. He apologises. \"I didn't think it was necessary, but i should have worn a mask at the Mayo clinic,\" he says. The vice president then goes on to reassure that he \"knows we'll get through this (pandemic)\" and thanks the American people for what they've done. Steve Mnuchin has still barely said a word. The vice president, Mike Pence, and Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, have joined the broadcast alongside Trump, but they are barely getting a word in. Trump is asked if he is considering tariffs as a way of punishing China. \"It's the ultimate punishment, I'll tell you that. We are all playing a complicated game of chess or poker...but it's not checkers, I'll tell you that.\" \"Tariffs at a minimum are the greatest negotiating tool,\" he says. He then attacks the World Health Organization for their involvement in managing the virus. He says the WHO missed \"every call\" on the virus. He's also strongly targeting China: \"Don't forget China tried to blame it first on some of our soldiers. Then they tried to blame it on Europe.\" Asked if the virus came from a lab, by intent or by accident, he says: \"I think they made a horrible mistake and they didn't want to admit it. \"My opinion is they made a mistake, they tried to cover it... they couldn't put out the fire. They stopped people going into China but didn't stop people going around the world. \"They knew they had a problem. I think they were embarrassed about the problem,\" Trump says. Will this affect his relationship with President Xi? He's reluctant to blame Xi directly. \"I did a great trade deal with him. I'm not going to say anything. He's a strong man,\" he says. \"But this should never have happened. They should have put it out. They should have let us and other countries in to put it out.\" Just a reminder that Trump claimed he was treated worse by the press than Abraham Lincoln: Trump is speaking as global coronavirus cases have passed 3.5 million, with deaths nearing a quarter of a million, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Reuters reports that the rate of fatalities and new cases has slowed from peaks reached last month. North America and European countries accounted for most of the new cases reported in recent days, but numbers were rising from smaller bases in Latin America, Africa and Russia. There are currently 3,503,533 confirmed cases of the virus, and 247,306 people have lost their lives in the pandemic so far. Trump is asked about the relationship with China, including on trade, and he's not happy about it: \"China never gave 10 cents to our country... they ripped off our country... I've told this to President Xi... I get along with him... (but) he should have done something different on this.\" He then goes on to list all the successful trade deals he has done... with South Korea, Japan and others. The message is that the economy will bounce back next year. \"This country is going to grow like crazy,\" he says. Now he's being asked about whether the manufacture of drugs will be brought back on shore, antibiotics and the like. He doesn't give specifics but says \"America first\" was his election mantra, and reiterates that he thinks there will be a vaccine soon. \"We're gonna have a vaccine by the end of the year. I firmly believe it,\" he says. Trump's virtual town hall is back from an ad break, and the next video call is from a business which has not qualified for any financial support. \"At some point we have to open up our country. We can't stay closed as a country or we won't have a country left.\" Trump says the \"greatest thing we can do is get rid of the virus\". He's now pushing the economic recovery he expects next year. \"We did the right thing (closing businesses down), but we never want to do it again,\" he says. The next question is from a Trump supporter who asks why he doesn't answer questions at news conferences and goes off on other tangents about positive decisions he's made. He launches into a long rant about how hostile the press is and that he has been treated worse than Abraham Lincoln by the press. \"The media might as well be in the Democrat (sic) party,\" he says. Then lists what else he sees as his successes....killing Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, killing Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, launching space force. The Fox anchor suggests he will be judged at the election on his handling of the virus. He doesn't agree. Meanwhile in Michigan: Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan issued a rebuke of the armed protesters who gathered inside the state capitol last week in defiance of statewide lockdown orders, saying the demonstrators embodied some of the \"worst racism\" of the nation's history. \"Some of the outrageousness of what happened at our capitol depicted some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country,\" Whitmer said during a Sunday interview on CNN's State of the Union. Last week Donald Trump had said of the protesters: \"These are very good people.\" Hundreds of protesters, many not wearing protective face masks and some armed legally with \"long guns\", gathered inside the statehouse in Lansing on Thursday as lawmakers debated the Democratic governor's request to extend her emergency powers to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The tightly packed crowd attempted to enter the floor of the legislative chamber and were held back by a line of state police and capitol staff, according to video footage posted by local journalists. It's worth noting that this Fox News \"virtual town hall\" as they are calling it, is a very controlled interview environment, compared with President Trump's usual daily White House briefings. He is being interviewed with two Fox news anchors and taking some phone calls. Fox has selected the questions to put to Trump from \"thousands\" of video questions and calls it has received from viewers over the past week. When asked about why he didn't act on the virus earlier, he was quick to point out that many people, including he says, disease expert Anthony Fauci, said Covid-19 \"was going to pass\". He indicates the US intelligence community will release a report on the virus on Monday. He's now being asked about what measures are being taken to protect nursing homes: \"The nursing home issue is ground zero\" \"What we're doing is legislation immediately about how many people can be in (visit)... it's the one thing about this disease that everyone has learned... is that it's so contagious.\" He reminds viewers that nursing homes are a matter for states. He's saying elective surgery must recommence, but again, it's up to the state governors. \"They have to get back,\" he says. \"You think they're making a lot of money? They're losing a fortune. they have to get back to elective surgery.\" The network is taking an ad break. More on Trump's town hall now, from AP: Trump declared Sunday that he believed a vaccine could be available by year's end, despite his own pandemic task force predicting it could be another 18 months. Anxious for an economic recovery, President Donald Trump fielded Americans' questions about decisions by some states to allow nonessential businesses to reopen while other states are on virtual lockdown due to the coronavirus. After more than a month of being cooped up at the White House, Trump returned from a weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland and participated in a virtual town hall, hosted Sunday night by Fox News Channel, from inside the Lincoln Memorial. He pushed for an economic reopening, one his advisers believe will be essential for his reelection chances this November. \"We have to get it back open safely but as quickly as possible,\" Trump said. Though the administration's handling of the pandemic, particularly its ability to conduct widespread testing, has come under fierce scrutiny, the president defended the response and said the nation was ready to begin reopening. \"I'll tell you one thing. We did the right thing and I really believe we saved a million and a half lives,\" the president said. But he also broke with the assessment of his senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, saying it was \"too soon to say if the federal government was overseeing a success story.\" Trump's impatience also flashed. While noting that states would go at their own pace in returning to normal, with ones harder hit by the coronavirus going slower, he said of some states, \"frankly I think aren't going fast enough\" and singled out Virginia, which has a Democratic governor and legislature. And he urged the nation's schools and universities to return to classes this fall. This is the setting for Tump's Fox News town hall, by the way: President Trump is giving a sit-down interview with Fox news, and taking calls from viewers about the coronavirus. Asked about a Covid-19 vaccine, he says: \"We are very confident we are going to have a vaccine by the end of the year.\" Trump is asked about schools going back in the US in September: \"We have to go back,\" he says, adding that he is concerned about some older teachers and their possible exposure to the virus. He's criticising the Democrat's response to the pandemic, implying it would suit their political purposes if the virus outcome was worse. He talks about hydroxychloroquine, reminding viewers that he doesn't own shares in the company that produces it: \"We don't lose anything with hydroxy.... people aren't dying from it.\" He's asked why he didn't act earlier on the virus, and says his intelligence was that \"on January 23 I was told there could be a virus coming but it was of no real import,\" and then reminds viewers he stopped flights from China early. Trump is speaking now on Fox news, we'll have more on this shortly. In the meantime, he has said this, referring to deaths in the US: The current US death toll, far higher than any other country, is 67,674 people. Hello and welcome to our global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I'm Helen Sullivan, with you for the next few hours. You can get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan with comments, questions and news from where you live. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has claimed in a TV interview that there is 'enormous evidence' coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory, but did not provide any of this alleged evidence. But, writes the Guardian's Julian Borger, \"when he was reminded that US intelligence had issued a formal statement noting the opposite - that the scientific consensus was that the virus was not manmade or genetically modified - Pompeo replied: 'That's right. I agree with that.'\" Meanwhile in Brazil, far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has been encouraging his supporters to protest, even as the country's cases pass 100,000. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Bolsonaro fuels protests in defiance of health advice. Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro, has spent another weekend stirring up street protests in defiance of his own health ministry's appeals for citizens to stay at home because of coronavirus. Brazil passes 100,000 confirmed cases. There have been 4,588 new cases of the coronavirus in Brazil and 275 deaths over the last 24 hours, the health ministry said on Sunday, bringing total confirmed cases in the country to over 100,000. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed there is \"enormous evidence\" coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory - but did not provide any of the alleged evidence. Italy reports lowest toll since first day of lockdown. Italyhas reported 174 new coronavirus deaths, its lowest toll since 168 fatalities were registered when the country's lockdown started on March 10. The 1,389 new infections were also the lowest since the first week of March UK to trial new tracing programme. The UK will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme next week on the Isle of Wight, just off the south coast of England, cabinet minister Michael Gove has announced as the government looks to minimise the risk of a second wave of infection. France's tracing app expected to enter testing week on Monday. France's state-supported 'StopCOVID' contact-tracing app should enter its testing phase a week on Monday when the country starts to unwind its lockdown, a government minister has said. Portugal downgrades state of emergency. Portugal has downgraded its state of emergency to a category of \"calamity\", as the rate of new coronavirus infections reached its lowest since the beginning of the outbreak, six weeks after a state of emergency was declared. Singapore records 657 new infections, the vast majority of them foreign workers living in dormitories, taking the city-state's total to 18,205. The Pope has called for any successful Covid-19 vaccine to be shared worldwide. He said international scientific cooperation would be important in discovering a vaccine, stressing that it is \"important to unite scientific capabilities, in a transparent and impartial way\". NHS England has announced a further 327 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19. The total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England is now 21,180. A coalition of artists, celebrities, scientists and intellectuals has warned that Brazil's indigenous peoples are at grave risk of a Covid-19 \"genocide\". Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Brad Pitt, David Hockney and Paul McCartney are among those who have signed an open letter to the country's president, Jair Bolsonaro. Vietnam has confirmed its first Coronavirus case in nine days, meaning its total now stands at 271. The country's lockdown was eased in late April and it is yet to record a Covid-19 death. Footballers in Serie A, Italy's top division, will be allowed to start individual training sessions from Monday. It is the latest step in a series of cautious moves towards restarting top-level sport across Europe, which has also seen players in England and Germany permitted different degrees of training ground work. One third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, have come back positive. It has raised fears that one of the world's most fragile states may be harbouring widespread undetected infections.160011falsefalseHelen Sullivan (now and earlier), Kevin Rawlinson, Jessica Murray and Aamna Mohdin (earlier)US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo holds a news briefing.Five friends who passed away due to coronavirus.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ANNOUNCER: From CNN's New York headquarters, the MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR WITH DOBBS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOU DOBBS, HOST: Good evening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world financial system tonight is under greater pressure than at any time since last October's global market break.</p><p>Our top stories tonight: A frenetic wave of selling that swept Wall Street where the Dow Jones Industrials plummeted more than 350 points, the worst one-day sell-off of the year, the third worst sell- off ever, and that sell-off sparked by chaos more than 5,000 miles away.  In Russia, financial markets there all but decimated with Russian officials talking of closing their markets at least temporarily.  And the U.S. government has brought a suspected terrorist to justice and to these shores charged with murdering 12 Americans in the Kenya embassy bombing.</p><p>But we begin tonight on Wall Street where stocks suffered the steepest losses since last October's market break.  Fears that Russia is spinning out of control both politically and economically sparked a sell-off of global proportions, from Asia to Europe to Latin America on to Wall Street where the Dow plunged 357 points, lost more than 4 percent on volume of 938 million shares, the second heaviest trading day ever on the big board.  The NASDAQ Composite Index fell 81 points, lost 4-1/2 percent.  Today's plunge leaves the Dow a staggering 1,100 points from its record set in July.</p><p>Jan Hopkins reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JAN HOPKINS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The trading was fast and furious as stocks plunged at the opening bell, never to recover from triple-digit losses.  The Dow closed at its low for the session, down 357 points to 8,165.  It's the third biggest point drop ever and the lowest level since February.  The NASDAQ Composite tumbled 81 points, its second largest point drop ever.</p><p>BERNARD SCHAEFFER, SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH: It was kind of a cumulative impact of this day-by-day destruction in the overseas markets and, finally, we went over the threshold on a 10-percent correction, and that selling begat more selling at that point. HOPKINS: The average price per share at the New York Stock Exchange fell $1.62.  Investors responded to more news of Russia's financial crisis.  Currency trading in Russia halted for the second day in a row, and rumors flew that President Boris Yeltsin may not be in power for long.  Dreyfus estimates investors worldwide have already lost $115 billion in Russian financial markets.</p><p>RON CHAPMAN, INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIST, DREYFUS: To write a check that big for global financial markets in a period of about five, six trading sessions here gives us all quite a great shock, and I would compare this to the shock we had last October in Europe and in the U.S. when it became clear the extent of the problems in Korea, the extent of the problems in Indonesia.</p><p>HOPKINS: Back home, among the hardest hit, banking and financial stocks.  J.P. Morgan down 13-3/16.  Citicorp shed 11-7/8.  Bankers Trust fell 8-5/16.  Merrill Lynch lost 6-5/16.  Sell-offs around the globe spurred the downturn on Wall Street.  Stocks in Tokyo closed at their lowest level in six years, down more than 3 percent.  In London, the Financial Times 100 Index plummeted 3 percent.  Even closer to home, Latin American stocks were gouged.  In Mexico, the IBC (ph) fell 6 percent.  Venezuelan stocks dropped nearly 10 percent.  Brazil's Bovesba (ph) also tumbled nearly 10 percent.  Argentinian shares fell more than 10-1/2 percent.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOPKINS: Even with the continued sell-off, the Dow is still hanging on to positive territory for the year.  It's up 3-1/3 percent. And the NASDAQ is also in the black for the year.  It's up 7.4 percent.</p><p>Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Jan, thank you.</p><p>We'll have much more on the carnage on Wall Street and, indeed, on world markets later in the broadcast, a full report for you on the day's biggest losers on Wall Street, and we'll take a look at what is looming to be, as one of the greatest concerns for economists right now, deflation.</p><p>Wall Street's dramatic decline came as the political and economic turmoil in Russia intensified.  The stock market there, already battered, fell another 17 percent.  Russians are also struggling to cope with a collapsing currency and a fury of speculation about Boris Yeltsin's future.</p><p>Jill Dougherty is live in Moscow and has the latest for us.</p><p>Jill.</p><p>JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Lou, today, there were a lot of very worrying signs of this economic meltdown that's going on in Russia.  Number one, the Central Bank suspended trading on the currency markets yet again, two days in a row.  It will happen again tomorrow.  The ruble is on a very steep downward spiral and, today, Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was trying to calm the waters.  He said that he is taking some tough steps, as he put it, and the main priorities that he has: protect the ruble and protect average Russian citizens.</p><p>Now in the eye of this economic storm, there is definitely a political vacuum, and as you mentioned, there have been rumors all over Moscow and, indeed, even some news reports that President Yeltsin is preparing to step down.  Now his press secretary came out -- twice, in fact -- vehemently denying that he is stepping down and coming back at the media and saying stop obstructing preparations for the summit that's going to be taking place next week presumably with U.S. President Bill Clinton.</p><p>Now there are, Lou -- I very quickly should note that there actually is a draft proposal that's working its way through the parliament -- through a committee in the parliament -- government -- parliament committee that would provide for how to deal with the president once a president should step down.  It gets into pensions, bodyguards, and even legal protection for actions that he would take as president.  That although has been in the works for a number of months, but now it has been picking up steam in the recent light of these political developments.</p><p>Meanwhile, Russians themselves on the streets -- once again today, they've been in lines in banks trying to get their money back, dollars or rubles.  They don't care.  It's basically impossible now to get dollars, and those are the lucky ones who can even get rubles out at this point.  So there's a lot of concern on the part of Russians, and those who do have rubles see their value declining very, very rapidly.</p><p>Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: In the midst of economic chaos and heightened political uncertainty in Moscow, indeed throughout Russia, it would be fair to describe what is happening at those Russian banks with those long lines as people try to bring those rubles out of those banks -- that's a run on the banks, is it not?</p><p>DOUGHERTY: But it's not really a panicked run.  It's not a panicky situation.  It's more that -- people, don't forget, have been through things like this before, and they have -- or least partially this bad, but they have been through severe economic problems before, and there is kind of an angry resignation to this.  Now it depends on how long this goes on.  People's moods could change, but, right now, it's not necessarily a sense of panic at all, but it's anger and frustration more than anything else.</p><p>DOBBS: OK, Jill.  Jill Dougherty reporting from Moscow.  Thank you very much.</p><p>Well, coming up next here on the MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR, we'll have an in-depth analysis of Russia's economic calamity and its political uncertainty.  I'll be talking with Russian expert Professor Marshall Goldman.  And as he faces an inquiry over 1996 fund-raising, Vice President Al Gore spends his day fund-raising.  The MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR continues.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: It is difficult at best to comprehend the severity of Russia's economic crisis.  The world's best-performing stock market over the past two years today at its lowest level ever.  The battered ruble has not even traded officially for the past two days, nor will it tomorrow.  Russia's economy, which last year finally emerged from recession, has contracted by 4-1/2 percent of the latest quarter, and the current unemployment rate tops 9 percent, but perhaps the most striking illustration of Russia's economic, social, and environmental problems: Life expectancy for the average Russian male is now a mere 58 years and declining.</p><p>I am joined now by one of this country's most renowned Russian experts, Harvard University's Professor Marshall Goldman, who joins us from Boston.</p><p>Good to have you back with us, Marshall.</p><p>PROF. MARSHALL GOLDMAN, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: Thanks, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: None of the news out of Russia is good.  We hear today at least rumors and certain news reports that a transition is being prepared for Boris Yeltsin.  What do you make of it?</p><p>GOLDMAN: Well, I heard those rumors, actually, as early as -- by my standards on Tuesday when I was told people were preparing different terms, how to protect Yeltsin in retirement.  You know, they don't treat Russian presidents -- ex-Russian presidents very well, and so this was to guarantee him that he wouldn't be sued for ta -- financial hanky panky and that he would be protected against charges of treason and different things and with a pension and\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: We should say, when you say hanky panky, at least charges of hanky panky.</p><p>GOLDMAN: Charges of hanky -- absolutely.  I don't want to be sued.  But it -- but, you know, it's -- so it's -- look how they treated Gorbachev, and -- or Kryuchkov or something like that, but there are these rumors that his own health is not good.  You know, he hasn't been seen.  You showed a picture of him there, but I don't think that was today's photography.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.  You're quite right and, secondly, he nor his Cabinet has, if you will, been out front and in public over this crisis that's been going on now for the better part of a month certainly.  What do you now?  As we see people lining up for hours outside banks trying to take out rubles or hard currency from banks, as we see the unemployment rising, as we see the raw commodity prices falling, which is after all Russia's best hope as an exporting country in those areas of oil and precious metals, what do you see as the economic prospect for Russia?</p><p>GOLDMAN: Bleak.  It's really sad, partly because they haven't decided themselves what they want to do and they haven't decided who's in charge.  It's true that Chernomyrdin has become the acting prime minister, but I was -- listened in to a conference call from Moscow yesterday from some bankers, and they were complaining that they -- that Fyodorov, who'd been made the deputy prime minister in charge of the economy, is nowhere to be seen.  He's hiding from what seems to be this turn of events, and just nobody's saying, \"Let's -- what do we do now to get out of it?\" and that's probably the most frightening thing.</p><p>DOBBS: And interesting if not frightening was the fact that Stanley Fischer, the deputy director of the International Monetary Fund, quoted as saying that George Soros had to bear some responsibility for this chaos, resonating almost with Malitere's (ph) comments in Malaysia that George Soros was behind the problems in Southeast Asia.  What do you make of those kinds of comments?</p><p>GOLDMAN: Well, I -- George -- I think George Soros, because he wrote this letter to \"The Financial Times\" saying that currency had to be devalued and they should set up a currency board, does bear some responsibility, but it's a -- but, you know, the -- normal implications, OK, bear responsibility because you were selling short or you were doing something and, you know, it was announced that the Soros -- the Quantum Fund, which is George Soros' fund, lost $2 billion.</p><p>DOBBS: Two billion dollars.</p><p>GOLDMAN: Well, he -- you know, I think -- I know him reasonably well, and I think, in this case, what he was saying -- \"Look it.  This is something that has to be done,\" but I don't think he expected to profit on this, and he was just saying, \"Do something,\" and he\u2026</p><p>DOBBS: But the IMF\u2026</p><p>GOLDMAN: \u2026 even though it hurts him.</p><p>DOBBS: And the IMF -- $23 billion -- that money just in the past month.  It's gone.</p><p>GOLDMAN: Well, not all of it.  I -- they made a first installment, the first -- that was about $4-1/2 billion.  That's gone. They're supposed to make the second installment in September, and the question is, knowing how quickly it goes, whether or not they will draw down on it, but what is true is that, when they came up with this $22-1/2-billion package, that was thought to be enough to deter all kinds of speculators, and it didn't.</p><p>DOBBS: And the political situation in Moscow tonight, Chernomyrdin returning to power as prime minister after six years, after being thrust aside rather unceremoniously by Boris Yeltsin\u2026</p><p>GOLDMAN: For incompetence.</p><p>DOBBS: \u2026 and having been returned to power.  Now great talk and loud noises being made in the Duma, particularly by the leadership of the Communist Party and Communist-related parties there.  What are the prospects in terms of a change in political direction for Russia tonight? GOLDMAN: Well, I think there is a change in political direction and economic direction, too, but it's not one, I think, that we're going to be particularly enthusiastic about.  They threw out what I considered to be the best government they've had since the 1890s. That was Kiriyenko.  He knew what he was going to do, and he set out to get after the Alegarks (ph), the people who'd really stolen all the money, making them pay taxes, if they're not paying taxes, declare them bankrupt, and the state take back over the resources.  They got rid of him for that, brought in Chernomyrdin who Yeltsin had just criticized for being so incompetent, and now I don't know where it's going to go.  They'll probably bring in some other groups, but that will make it such a large spectrum that they won't get anything done.</p><p>DOBBS: And President Bill Clinton on his way next week for a summit with Boris Yeltsin.  What do you expect to be accomplished? What can be accomplished?</p><p>GOLDMAN: Well, first of all, it's going to make Clinton look good because -- by comparison, if Yeltsin is still there, but I think he has to go because I think -- look at it this way.  What happens if he doesn't go?  The world and the markets will take that as a vote of no confidence, and the Russians will say, \"OK.  In our hour of need here, you're not coming to help us, even us to show -- stand by,\" whether Yeltsin is there or Chernomyrdin becomes president in the interim.  So I think he's got to go.  I don't think we should expect any great solutions to the problems, but maybe we can talk about the long run, and maybe we can help them focus on some of their difficulties.</p><p>DOBBS: And in the short term, a very difficult, even precarious situation.</p><p>GOLDMAN: Very much so.</p><p>DOBBS: All right.  Marshall, thank you very much.</p><p>GOLDMAN: Thank you.</p><p>DOBBS: Professor Marshall Goldman.</p><p>The political crisis in the Kremlin comes as scandal engulfs the White House.  John King is live at the White House and has the latest for us on next week's upcoming Russian summit, Al Gore's fund-raising concerns, and new developments in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.</p><p>John.</p><p>JOHN KING, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Lou, let's start with the vice president.  He's in California tonight helping Democratic candidate for governor, Gray Davis, raise some money.  Back in Washington today, the Justice Department confirming it has opened a 90-day inquiry into the vice president's 1996 fund-raising calls.  One of the issues here: whether the vice president told the truth when he was interviewed by the Justice Department back in 1995 and said that he believed all the money he was raising on those phone calls was going into so-called soft money accounts directly to the Democratic National Committee.  Some new evidence has emerged that some of that money may have gone directly to the Clinton-Gore campaign.  The vice president saying through his lawyer today that he has told the truth about this.  The president issuing a statement, offering words of support to the vice president, saying that the -- the president saying he believes everything his vice president did was both legal and proper.</p><p>Now on to the Monica Lewinsky investigation.  Sources telling CNN that, tomorrow morning, the deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey will go before Ken Starr's grand jury here in Washington.  Bruce Lindsey, the president's closest friend, a key man in the White House damage-control operations.  It was Bruce Lindsey who first got word to the president that Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed as a witness in the Paula Jones sexual-harassment case.  Lindsey's testimony in the past has been the subject of disputes over both attorney-client and executive privilege.  The attorney-client privilege dispute the administration filed has been thrown out in the courts.  We're told by sources, though, it is possible tomorrow that Mr. Lindsey would decline to answer some questions if they -- if he considers them breaches of executive privilege, his confidentiality with the president.</p><p>Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: And, John, the president's trip next week for a summit with Boris Yeltsin.  No change in those plans tonight.</p><p>KING: No change in those plans.  As Professor Goldman just said on your program, the White House feels it has no choice but to go, despite this time of enormous political and economic uncertainty in Moscow.  When the rumors came out earlier today that perhaps President Yeltsin was resigning, senior officials here quickly got in touch with the deputy secretary of state Strobe Talbott, but he is in Moscow.  He told them that he was in meetings throughout the day with Yeltsin government officials.  They seemed eager to go ahead with the summit next week.  Very low expectations.  No one at the White House anticipating any major agreements or any major commitments by Russia to push new economic reforms.  One thing the White House says is certain: No more Western and particularly no more U.S. economic aid until Russia shows that it's willing to get its economic house in order.</p><p>DOBBS: John, thank you.  John King reporting from the White House.</p><p>Coming up next on the NEWS HOUR, the FBI brings a would-be suicide bomber to New York and charges him with murder.  The NEWS HOUR continues.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: A suspected terrorist has been arrested, interrogated, and flown to the United States, today charged with terrorism and put behind bars, less than three weeks after the embassy bombings in Africa.</p><p>Pierre Thomas reports from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PIERRE THOMAS, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): With one suspect still in route, another prime suspect in the Kenya embassy bombing appeared in detention clothes before a magistrate at U.S. District Court in New York.  Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, also known as Khalid Salim, charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and using a weapon of mass destruction.</p><p>JANET RENO, ATTORNEY GENERAL: We are not going to forget.  We're going to pursue every last murderer until justice is done.</p><p>THOMAS: After flying Salim from Kenya, U.S. officials for the first time outlined details on how the deadly assault on the U.S. embassy in Kenya was carried out.  According to U.S. officials, in late July, Salim traveled from Lahore, Pakistan, to Nairobi, Kenya. He then began planning the attack that left more than 200 dead and 5,000 wounded.</p><p>MARY JO WHITE, U.S. ATTORNEY: His alleged role in the August 7th bombing in Kenya included casing the embassy in Nairobi on August 4th, traveling as a passenger in the vehicle containing the bomb delivered to the U.S. embassy compound on August 7th, and throwing a flash grenade at a guard stationed at the embassy on the morning of the bombing.</p><p>THOMAS: Salim, injured in the blast, told FBI agents he planned to die in the attack.  He also told investigators he had ties to one of the world's most dangerous terrorists.</p><p>LOUIS FREEH, U.S. FBI DIRECTOR: He said he was trained in a number of camps in Afghanistan, including a number of camps affiliated with Alcata, an international terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden dedicated to opposing non-Islamic governments with force and violence.</p><p>THOMAS: The Kenya probe spans a number of countries, and more arrests are expected in what is described as the largest overseas investigation in U.S. history.  Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, another suspect in the Kenya bombing, was expected to arrive in New York early Friday to face charges.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>THOMAS: The charges against Salim carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole or death.</p><p>Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Pierre, thank you.  Pierre Thomas reporting from Washington.</p><p>Coming up next on the NEWS HOUR, Hurricane Bonnie is now Tropical Storm Bonnie, but that doesn't mean the threat is over, nor the rains. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Hurricane Bonnie was downgraded to Tropical Strom Bonnie, and although the storm has slowed down, heavy rains could still bring dangerous flooding to North Carolina.  The storm threatens to dump more than 20 inches of rain before it moves on.  So far, the good news is there has been no major damage, mostly downed trees and power lines and blown-out windows.  Right now, the storm is kicking up winds of 65 miles an hour.  Tonight, Bonnie is expected to hug the East Coast while it heads north and then out to sea with its winds and rains pushing storm watches as far north as Massachusetts.</p><p>Coming up next on the MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR, Wall Street suffers its biggest one-day drop of the year, its third worst ever.  A world of troubles hit home.  We'll have a full market wrap from Wall Street. And the growing crisis of emerging markets is leading many on Wall Street now to utter the dreaded D word, and the D word is deflation. We'll be taking a look at what the nation's small investors are doing. So far, they're hanging in there.  Just barely.</p><p>All of that and a lot more coming up next on the NEWS HOUR.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Moscow's deepening economic and political crisis today sparked heavy market losses worldwide.  Share prices tumbled from Asia, to Europe, to Latin America, and Wall Street.  In the biggest drop since last October's pull back, the Dow Jones Industrials plunged 357 points, losing more than 4 percent.  Volume on the Big Board 938 million shares, the second heaviest day of trading ever on Wall Street.  The Nasdaq index plunged 81 points, losing 4.5 percent.  All that wiped out a staggering $430 billion of market value.</p><p>Katharine Barrett has our report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATHARINE BARRETT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The worldwide worry list and the worried faces are growing longer with Russia's crumbling currency inflicting pain in financial markets.  From Sidney to Mexico and Toronto, the crisis is moving ever closer to home.</p><p>WILLIAM HUMMER, MARKET STRATEGIST, WAYNE HUMMER: This is a problem that's not going to evaporate quickly.  In fact the we already were in the worst world monetary crisis since World War II.  And in recent days this has deteriorated even further and is spreading rapidly, spread beyond into China, Japan, into Russia, China and Latin America.  Now it's starting to lap at our shores.</p><p>BARRETT: The selling swamped stocks, what one strategist termed a shoot first, ask questions later move.  Steep opening losses spiraled into a punishing midday plunge.  Dropped 352 points before noon.  The setback has now wiped out 7 months of blue chip gains.  The Nasdaq fared worse, suffering 6th biggest percentage plunge.  Only twice since 1997 has Nasdaq fallen more.</p><p>ROBERT WAHLBERG, TECH ANALYST, BRIEFING.COM: Today was really the first sign in our view the large cap technology stocks are beginning to buckle.</p><p>BARRETT: Globally exposed banks were battered again, the Dow casualties J.P. Morgan lost a whopping 13 dollars, American Express slid more than 6.  IBM and United Technologies fell more than $5 a piece.  Coca-Cola sank 4 7/16 after Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock due to worldwide weakness.</p><p>Some insist that when the selling reaches this fever pitch, we're nearing the bottom.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Another day like this one and we will have wiped out most of the year's market gains.  The Dow tonight, clings to a return of 3.3 percent since New Year's, the Nasdaq now up a slightly more respectable 7.4 percent -- Lou?</p><p>DOBBS: And those are beginning to feel like very strong gains indeed.</p><p>BARRETT: They may.</p><p>DOBBS: Thank you, Katharine Barrett.</p><p>Taking a closer look now at the market collapse today.  The Dow stands at 8165.99.  This is the lowest level for the Dow in almost 7 months.  It plunged 357.36 today, the third largest point decline ever.  But in percentage terms, it doesn't even rank in the top 100. On the Big Board, 976 stocks hit new 52-week lows.  Just 15 stocks hit 52-week highs.  The S&amp;P 500 index had its third biggest point loss ever tumbling 41.68. losing almost 4 percent.  And the Nasdaq composite losing almost 82 points, tonight at 1686.41, also its lowest level since February.  And it was the Nasdaq's second biggest point decline ever.  And to give you an even better idea about how severe the selling was today, on the Big Board, the volume of losing shares was 882 million.  Only 53 million shares advanced against that number declining.</p><p>On the Nasdaq, the volume of losing shares 860 million, but just 81 million for gainers.  The meltdown in Moscow slammed markets all around the world.  London's market down 3.2 percent.  Paris off 4 percent, 4.3 percent.  And Frankfurt's Dax dive 3.3 percent to a four- month low.</p><p>Emerging markets in Latin America suffered even more.  Mexico, dropping 6 percent.  Venezuela and Brazil both down almost 10 percent. Argentina's market down almost -- well, down 10.6 percent on the day. Overnight in Tokyo trading, the Nikkei average plunged 3 percent.  It is now at its lowest level in more than 6 years.</p><p>The global turmoil has left one clear winner and that is the U.S. bond market.  Investors today continued the flight to safety, driving the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond issue to an all-time low.  It stands tonight at 5.34 percent, that after the bond jumped 1 3/32 in price.  Those record low yields are setting the tone for cheaper mortgage interest rates.  A 30-year fixed rate loan is now averaging 6.91 percent, a 15 year fixed loan, 6.6 percent.</p><p>The crisis in emerging markets has many economists warning about deflation.  In fact, prices for some raw materials have fallen so low that the Commodities Research Bureau index, the CRB, tonight stands at its lowest level in 21 years.</p><p>From Chicago, Ceci Rodgers with the report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CECI RODGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Investors in U.S. stocks are getting a lesson in international economics.  Asia in recession and Russia in collapse, are resulting in a serious slide in the price of many raw materials.  Commodity prices are down a whopping 40 percent over the past year, as measured by the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities.  And there are new signs the deflation is spreading.</p><p>ROBERT HAFER, BRIDGE-CRB: Any economy that's dependent upon raw material production is going to be hurt by these lower prices. Obviously they see falling revenue with falling prices, so it can impact any economy that is not a service economy.</p><p>RODGERS: That includes not only Russia and South Asian countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, but Canada in the northern hemisphere and Venezuela, Mexico and Argentina, in the southern hemisphere.  Many of these countries have been dumping commodities to raise cash and defend their faltering currencies.</p><p>Russia was said to be selling oil and gas today.  And Australia, South Africa, and Canada, were all in the market selling gold. Australia and Canada were also seen in the foreign exchange markets supporting their own currencies.  Economists worry the Federal Reserve isn't moving quickly enough to stop the contagion.</p><p>BRIAN WESBURY, CHIEF ECONOMIST, GRIFFIN KUBIK: With currencies collapsing and stock markets collapsing not only around the world, but even in the United States, we'd normally expect to see gold prices rise as investors flew to quality, the quality and staying power of gold.  But instead gold prices fall, which shows, without a shadow of a doubt in my mind, that the Fed is way too tight.</p><p>RODGERS: The bond market seems to agree, long-term yields are at record lows.  CRB research suggests short-term rates may decline more, as 3-month treasury bills, which tend to follow the CRB, are lagging commodity declines.</p><p>(on camera): With asset prices starting to follow the downward spiral of commodities, a growing contingent of Fed watchers is now banking on a cut in short term rates by year end, a move many say would quench the thirst for global liquidity.</p><p>Ceci Rodgers, CNN financial news, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) DOBBS: Up next on MONEYLINE: surveying the damage from today's market plunge.

It could be an indication of small investor sentiment and a falling stock market.  While they haven't panicked during the sell-off this summer, some figures suggest that investors are becoming more cautious.</p><p>From Los Angeles, Casey Wian reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY WIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Wall Street may be in the midst of a selling frenzy, but talking to individual investors, you would hardly know the Dow was down more than 350 points.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE, INVESTOR: I think sitting tight is the best way to go.  You cause a lot of problems if everybody rushes out and sells.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE, INVESTOR: I'm going to ride out the storm, and hopefully things will right themselves as they have in the past.</p><p>WIAN: Charles Schwab says the sell-off brought only a modest increase in customer calls.</p><p>RANDALL KIRK, CHARLES SCHWAB: Our customers, so far, are not panicking in any way.  Most of them have learned that markets do go up and down, and if they're properly allocated with the right mixture of stocks, bonds and cash, then they're not very worried.</p><p>WIAN: While there's little panic, august is shaping up to be the first month in nearly eight years in which investors take more money out of global equity mutual funds than they put in, according to the newsletter \"Trim Tabs (ph).\" The flow of money into U.S. equity funds has slowed to a trickle.  One point one billion dollars so far in august, compared with a 1998 monthly average of $18 billion.</p><p>ELEANOR HOAGLAND, AMT CAPITAL ADVISERS: It's not so much that we're seeing floods of selling, but that people are nervous, that people are adjusting positions.  What we do see notably is that investors do not seem to be comfortable putting new money in.</p><p>WIAN: Most new money is going into bond or money market funds. Some are determined to buck the trend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE, INVESTOR: I decided to start an account today because the market's really low and it's a good time to start.</p><p>Things can't get that much worse and the stocks that I'm trying to buy are at all-time lows.</p><p>WIAN (on camera): Since 1996, individual investors have generated about $4 billion week to invest in mutual funds.  That money's still coming in.  But for now, and until the stock market stabilizes, very little is going into equities.</p><p>Casey Wian, CNN financial news, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOBBS: Our \"MONEYLINE Focus\" tonight: the global market meltdown.  Even before today's massive sell-off, stock prices had fallen sharply from their 52-week highs.  More than 90 percent of S&amp;P 500 stocks are down 10 percent or more.  On the Big Board it's 93.5 percent.  The hardest hit the Nasdaq, almost 100 percent of the stocks there down more than 10 percent.  More than 80 percent are down 30 percent from their highs.</p><p>Joining me tonight Robert Farrell.  He is the senior investment manager at Merrill Lynch handling $1.4 trillion in total client assets.  Mark Holowesko manage $37 billion dollars in funds for Templeton Worldwide.  Gentlemen good to have you with us.</p><p>Let me ask you -- we might as well start right now -- there's been a lot of discussion, is this just a pause, is it a bear market? What is this and how would you describe it?</p><p>ROBERT FARRELL, SENIOR INVESTMENT MANAGER, MERRILL LYNCH: I think it's a serious bear market, cyclical bear market.  The name isn't as important as the fact that most stocks are going down.  I can't call it a bull market while most stocks are going down.  It's much more apparent in the broad list of stocks than it is in the big stocks.  The way these sequences go when you get into a decline of, with the kind of selling pressure we've had here, which is greater than anything since 1990, at least, then you will get to the stocks that are the best stocks last.</p><p>DOBBS: The big cap.</p><p>FARRELL: The big cap stocks.</p><p>DOBBS: And as we look at the Dow, it's held up fairly well.  We just reported on the Nasdaq that the Dow was up 3.3 percent so far. In terms of the Nasdaq, we're up seven percent, better than seven percent, but those mass some very treacherous numbers below them. Your numbers at Merrill Lynch, 81 percent, the last number I saw. Eighty-one percent of the stocks on the Nasdaq down 30 percent or more.  What does that suggest?</p><p>FARRELL: I think breadth is important in a market.  The markets really have been deteriorating since a year ago, a year ago was when everything was Goldilocks, everything was great and we were seeing a thousand new highs on the New York Stock Exchange.  At that point you started the meltdown on a global basis.  This is what is of concern. This is a global down market, a global bear phase that has likely to get to the safe haven before it's over.</p><p>DOBBS: Mark it was just last year Russia was a Cinderella story. Everyone was putting their money in.  The best performing market over two years.  What do you expect to happen now?</p><p>MARK HOLOWESKO, TEMPLETON WORLDWIDE: Russia is in chaos.  They went from communism to chaos rather than communism to capitalism, unfortunately.  Russia is not one of those markets that has fallen dramatically in the emerging market sphere that I am putting money to. They have serious problems in Russia and the rolling currency crises that we've seen around the world is hitting Russia and it's going to have ramifications in Europe and it's going to hit the U.S. shores as well.  I would have to agree with the comments recently made.  There are serious problems around the world and eventually they're going to come here to America and affect American share prices even further.</p><p>DOBBS: In terms of assessing emerging markets and looking at those markets around the world, where do you not see problems?  Maybe we could do it that way.</p><p>HOLOWESKO: I think, Lou, there are problems everywhere but there are some places where the price is already discounted.  I think to a certain extent it's already discounted somewhat in Hong Kong.  You can't find one person out there who is bullish on Hong Kong.  The stocks are down about 60 percent.  You can argue that in the interim here, prices are artificially supported by the Hong Kong monetary authorities and probably will come down some more, but it's one of the few places in the world where you can buy companies below the net cash they have in the bank.  There are some ideas in Hong Kong and Singapore and a couple ideas in Latin America, but the developed markets are still extremely heavily priced and we're under most of the developed markets around the world.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let's return to the U.S. market, Bob.  It's a cyclical bear market.  What's an investor to do here?  A lot of damage has already been done, obviously.</p><p>FARRELL: Right, I think you don't sell into an emotional down market.  My guess is the market's not going to reach a real low until later this year, but there's probably an interim low coming up very shortly maybe early next week.  I think the investor that's looking to find stocks at a bargain in a decline should probably wait until we get to what I think is going to be one of the big tech selling periods in many, years.  I think it's the end of October and November.  The end of October is when mutual funds are going to liquidate to take losses in November.  I think, a lot of people will offset the gains that they've taken here as the tax law has been changed so that you can qualify for 20 percent tax. DOBBS: Capital gains advantage is going to be in (UNINTELLIGIBLE) with worldwide economic problems and some not particular happy earnings.</p><p>FARRELL: I think this is a fundamental decline.  I think deflation is really what is the cause of this.  That's why low interest rates, low inflation is not the answer to supporting this market.</p><p>DOBBS: As you know better than anyone investors have been pavlovian (ph) like in their response to these declines -- moving in, buying on a 10 percent decline or even less, that resiliency isn't there right now isn't it?</p><p>FARRELL: I think that the history of markets is that people are conditioned by how markets act and this one has been such a great bull market for so long.  They've learned to buy weakness and it's been very brief.  Now things have changed.  I think at least for a fair amount of time you're going to have to be restrained and try to stay with the quality stocks particularly when they're weak as where you do your buying, but basically, I think this is a time to be careful.</p><p>DOBBS: Deflation, Mark, you talked about Hong Kong, Singapore, we're seeing examples of it across the world.  How big a factor is that in your investment decisions right now globally?</p><p>HOLOWESKO: It's very important.  I think Russia is going to add further prices pressures on commodities because they need to dump things on the world market to get foreign exchange.  Also, you're going to see pricing pressure in America.  Most of the countries that are in trouble need to get foreign exchange.  You only get foreign exchange by selling good to a foreigner and unfortunately that's going to be Americans and some Europeans and there's going to be a lot of pricing pressure for American corporation while they also have pressure on costs.  So, I think pricing pressures can be very difficult.  When you have to compete with an Asian company, you're going to find it very difficult to raise prices.</p><p>DOBBS: Let me -- I'm trying to find something uplifting here.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>We're look at a world, a system of markets right now that is beleaguered.  The U.S. market is beleaguered.  You're talking about a cyclical bear market.  I guess the way we have to do this is conclude by giving investors your best counsel Bob.</p><p>FARRELL: I think you reallocate your assets for the time being toward bonds, be willing to hold liquidity.  Figure that declines also present opportunities.  Just don't jump the gun.</p><p>DOBBS: And jumping the gun would be any time before October, is that correct?</p><p>FARRELL: Well, yes, basically, but I think there will be individual stocks that will have different timing. DOBBS: Mark.</p><p>HOLOWESKO: I would agree with that.  I think though, this is a typical bear market.  It could last quite some time and stocks are still about 35 percent above fair value in America if we look at long- term averages.  It could take some time to work its way out.</p><p>DOBBS: Mark Holowesko, Bob Farrell, gentlemen, thanks for being with us.</p><p>MONEYLINE will continue in just one moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: Well, merger mania continues in the radio business. Chancellor Media today said it will buy Capstar Broadcasting. Chancellor will put up $2.3 billion in stock, assume $1.8 billion in debt.  That deal leapfrogs CBS to create the biggest radio station group in the country.  Chancellor Media closed down $2 a share, Capstar lost 2-3/16 on the announcement of the deal.</p><p>Radio pioneer CBS said today it is going to split off its lucrative radio business.  CBS will call the new company Infinity Broadcasting, sell a 20 percent stake to the public.  The move made CBS one of few stocks today to gain, up 2-1/16.</p><p>Donald Van de Mark now reports on the continuing struggle to rebuild CBS and its stock.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD VAN DE MARK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): For months, rumors of financial rejiggering have swirled around CBS, though Wall Street observers thought the network itself, with its skyrocketing sports costs and shrinking share of TV viewers, could be sold. Instead CBS President Mel Karmazin, who came to the Tiffany network when he sold Infinity Broadcasting to CBS, will sell 20 percent of Infinity to the public.</p><p>PAUL SWEENEY, MEDIA ANALYST, SALOMONSMITH BARNEY: CBS was looking to create a currency -- a stock currency that reflects solely the radio and outdoor businesses in an effort to make further acquisitions in the radio and outdoor business.  So they feel like creating this stand-alone radio and outdoor stock will represent a much more attractive currency.</p><p>VAN DE MARK: By retaining 80 percent of the radio and billboard business, Karmazin will keep the division's $800 million cash flow on CBS's books.  Karmazin has played the IPO game twice before.  First taking Infinity public in 1986, only to take it back private two years later.  He went public again in '92 at $17.50 a share.  Four years later, those shares were worth $170 when Infinity merged with Westinghouse and CBS.  Taking Infinity public a third time, the valuation for the division, now a whopping $20 billion</p><p>DREW MARCUS, BROADCAST ANALYST, BT ALEX. BROWN: The history of Infinity going public has been a glorious history.  He -- they went public for the first time prior to the October '87 crash, and then went private after the crash, and despite the fact the crash was in between, they generated a lot of value for shareholders.</p><p>VAN DE MARK: Particularly for Karmazin, who now owns a $300 million chunk of CBS.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>We could see similar financial re-engineering from the other major broadcast networks, since the same problems, skyrocketing programming costs and shrinking audiences, are hitting all three -- Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Wall Street's got to be excited that Mel Karmazin has decided to share.</p><p>VAN DE MARK: Well, they showed it today.</p><p>DOBBS: All right, Donald, thanks.</p><p>Cendant's stock price today plunged more than 10 percent, that after regulators ordered the troubled franchiser to change the way it accounts for revenue.  That change forced Cendant to delay its shareholder meeting, and it delayed the filing of its annual report until late September.  Cendant says the decision by the SEC is separate from the company's investigation into accounting fraud. Cendant's directors met today to discuss that investigation and the SEC decision.  The discovery of fraud in April rocked Cendant's shares, and led to the ouster of Chairman Walter Forbes and eight of the company's board members.</p><p>MONEYLINE continues in just a moment.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DOBBS: We began this broadcast with the top story of the day: a devastating session on Wall Street, one that obliterated $430 billion of market value.  And today's meltdown tied to Russia's worsening economic disaster.  Some perspective is in order; it is also a painful illustration of just how far Moscow's stock market has fallen. Russia's most widely held stock, the National Power Authority; it's stock today closed at a price of two cents a share.</p><p>For tonight, that is the bottom line.  Thanks for being with us. Good night from New York.  \"CROSSFIRE\" is coming up next.</p><p>TO PURCHASE A VIDEOTAPE OF THIS PIECE, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3THW-FDS0-009B-G4MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7294\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>August 27, 1998;

Speaking at the HT Leadership Summit, Alex Hardiman, Head of News Product at Facebook, said that there are several aggressive bad actors with sophisticated ways who are spreading misinformation and both traditional media outlets and social media platforms must come together to devise increasingly smart methods to deal with them. 'At Facebook, we are spending tremendous amount of time and energy to identify fake news. </p><p>We are now sharing information with other big tech companies to find out the root cause. Facebook is going to increase head counts and investments to counter fake news in 2018,' Hardiman told the gathering. 'All stakeholders \u2014 governments, third-party players, traditional media houses and social media giants \u2014 need to come under one umbrella to eliminate bad actors,' emphasised Hardiman who has worked as Vice President of News Product at The New York Times. Facebook along with tech giants like Twitter and Google[2] is facing intense scrutiny in the US after the company disclosed details about the presence of Russian political ads, tweets and posts on their platforms during the presidential election in 2016. The Kremlin-linked Russian organisations purchased more than $100,000 of ads on social media platforms during the US election. Facebook told US Congress this month that 126 million of its users in the US might have seen ads produced and circulated by Russian operatives. Not just the US, Facebook and Twitter have also agreed to share details with British authorities on Russia's interference in the Brexit referendum by using their platforms. 'Facebook is fully cooperating with the governments. I can't comment on the specifics but we are regulated \u2014 be it in the EU or the US. We will abide by the laws of the land. Back at the company, we are recalibrating efforts and will make sure that inclusive news goes out,' she noted. According to her, Facebook is identifying and blocking misinformation in myriad ways. 'Our Machine Learning (ML) tools are constantly eliminating fake accounts. Human reviewers are helping us spot nuanced information in sensenalised posts and ads. We are also doing third-party fact-checking to understand what is real and what is not,' Hardiman said. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML techniques, Facebook is removing Islamic State (IS) and Al Qaeda-related terror content from its platform before anyone flags it, the social media giant said this week. In its bid to help readers identify trustworthy news sources, Facebook along with Google, Twitter and several media organisations have joined the non-partisan 'The Trust Project'.'The Trust Project' is led by award-winning journalist Sally Lehrman of Santa Clara University's Markkula Centre for Applied Ethics. As part of the project, an icon will appear next to articles in Facebook News Feed. When you click on the icon, you can read information on the organisations' ethics and other standards, the journalists' backgrounds, and how they do their work. 'We are now deeply involved with media houses to identify false news as bringing both sides together will ensure high-quality news,' the Facebook executive said. Hardiman is positive on the India market for Facebook. 'The Indian publishers have so much data and can make good decisions about content strategy and revenue models. Facebook is bullish on India when it comes to local context, regional languages \u2014 to create strong threads and connect the next billion,' she told the audience, adding that Facebook product like 'Instant Article' are being fast adopted in the country. Talking about India-first innovation, Hardiman said: 'More than four million donors in India have signed up for Facebook's blood donation feature which the company launched from the country'. In October, Facebook launched a new blood donations feature, starting in India, to make it easier for people to donate blood.

People are hankering for governments to do more to regulate these corporate giants, said Tanya O'Carroll, Director of Amnesty Tech.</p><p>The results are a damning indictment of how Big Tech companies harvest and use our personal data. People want to see an end to tech companies trampling over our right to privacy.</p><p>Respondents who are worried about the collection of their personal data are most concerned with the violation of their right to privacy (62%), with a majority (59%) also worried about the loss of control over their data.</p><p>Of those who said they are worried, more than half (51%) are concerned that data about their online activity might reveal a lot about them; while almost a third (32%) fear their data could be used by state authorities to target them.</p><p>The central business model underpinning the internet today - using data to create detailed profiles of people for the purpose of selling targeted advertising - is seen as a major problem by nearly eight in ten people (77%).</p><p>When asked to explain why, six in ten said (59%) it was an invasion of privacy. More than half (53%) are concerned people could be unfairly influenced with political advertising without their knowledge. Nearly half (48%) also felt that advertisers would target people when they are at their most vulnerable.</p><p>In the USA, where next year's Presidential race is well underway, three in four (75%) Americans said it is a problem that tech companies create and sell access to detailed personal profiles. Six in ten (61%), of those who said it was a problem, were concerned people could be unfairly influenced by political advertising.</p><p>Scandals like Cambridge Analytica's illicit harvesting of millions of people's personal data have seriously damaged public trust in tech companies, said Tanya O'Carroll.</p><p>Governments need to take action on the manipulation of targeted online political advertising. Our poll shows that people simply don't trust Big Tech to determine the terms of political debate.</p><p>Almost half of those polled (49%) are more cautious about how they share their personal information online. Over a third (37%) avoid certain search terms or web pages because they are concerned about tracking, while the same percentage of people (37%) elected not to use a platform because of data privacy concerns. This shows that online corporate surveillance is having a chilling on people's ability to access the digital world. Nearly a third (32%) use tools to limit online tracking.</p><p>The results of the poll reinforce Amnesty's analysis that the core business-model of Facebook and Google poses a systemic threat to human rights. Last month, Amnesty International released an in-depth report showing how the surveillance-based business model of the two tech giants is incompatible with every element of the right to privacy. This includes freedom from intrusion into our private lives, the right to control information about ourselves, and the right to a space in which we can freely express our identities. It also showed how the business model poses a threat to a range of other rights including freedom of opinion expression and assembly, freedom of thought, and the right to equality and non-discrimination.</p><p>Amnesty International is calling on governments to overhaul the surveillance-based business model and protect people from corporate human rights abuses. As a first step, governments must enact and enforce laws that prevent companies from making access to their services conditional on individuals consenting to the collection, processing or sharing of their personal data for marketing or advertising.</p><p>Source: Amnesty International</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNB-TGP1-JB5P-J1VC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Critics fear he's a British Donald Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Johnson won the contest to lead the governing Conservative Party on Tuesday, and is set to become Britain's prime minister on Wednesday. Like revered World War II leader Churchill, Johnson aims to turn a national crisis - in this case Brexit - into a triumph. Like Trump, he gained his country's top political office by deploying celebrity, clowning, provocation and a loose relationship with the truth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"He's a different kind of a guy, but they say I'm a different kind of a guy, too,\" Trump said approvingly last week. \"We get along well.\"</p><p>Maintaining strong relations with the volatile Trump will be one of the new leader's major challenges. So will negotiating Britain's stalled exit from the European Union, the conundrum that brought down predecessor Theresa May.</p><p>WASHINGTON</p><p>FBI's Wray dodges questions on Mueller</p><p>FBI Director Christopher Wray offered a lesson Tuesday in how to dodge questions about the special counsel's Russia investigation , offering a possible preview of what lawmakers can expect when Robert Mueller testifies to Congress.</p><p>Wray, in an appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee, repeatedly declined to answer specific questions about Mueller's findings. He said he would leave those questions to Mueller, who will appear before the House on Wednesday, to answer himself.</p><p>Wray was willing to address other law enforcement subjects - such as describing China as the biggest national security threat to the U.S. A number of Republicans on the committee, including the chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of President Donald Trump's closest allies, asked Wray about the origins of the Russia investigation. The South Carolina Republican has vowed to investigate the how the Russia investigation was launched. Wray would not provide details about the two probes into the origins of the Russia probe - one being conducted by the Justice Department's inspector general and another by U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was appointed by the attorney general to examine the surveillance methods used during the investigation - other than to say the FBI was fully cooperating with both inquiries.</p><p>Justice Dept. launches Big Tech antitrust probe</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice opened a sweeping antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.</p><p>It comes as a growing number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up of the big tech companies, which have come under intense scrutiny following a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy.</p><p>President Donald Trump also has relentlessly criticized the big tech companies by name in recent months. He frequently asserts, without evidence, that companies such as Facebook and Google are biased against him and conservative politicians.</p><p>The Justice Department did not name specific companies in its announcement.</p><p>The focus of the investigation closely mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. Its chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has sharply criticized the conduct of Silicon Valley giants and said legislative or regulatory changes may be needed. He has called breaking up the companies a last resort.</p><p>Senate approves bill to extend 9/11 victims fund</p><p>The Senate gave final legislative approval Tuesday to a bill ensuring that a victims' compensation fund related to the Sept. 11 attacks never runs out of money.</p><p>The 97-2 vote sends the bill to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.</p><p>The vote came after Democratic senators agreed to allow votes on amendments sponsored by two Republican senators who had been blocking the widely popular bill. The Senate easily defeated the amendments proposed by GOP Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky. The two men were the only senators who voted against the bill's final passage.</p><p>Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said 9/11 first responders and their families have had \"enough of political games\" that delayed passage of the bill for months.</p><p>\"Our 9/11 heroes deserve this program as written,\" Gillibrand said. \"Let our heroes go home and live in peace and finally exhale.\"</p><p>USDA rule would cut food stamp benefits for 3.1M</p><p>About 3.1 million people would lose food stamp benefits under the Trump administration's proposal to tighten automatic eligibility requirements for the food stamp program. The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the rule would close \"a loophole\" that enables people receiving only minimal benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to be eligible automatically for food stamps without undergoing further checks on their income or assets.</p><p>\"For too long, this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines. Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.</p><p>The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program.

But he also seemed to stand by his Cabinet official, praising Acosta's performance on the job and saying he felt \"very badly\" for him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As for Epstein, Trump - who had once praised the financier as \"a terrific guy\" - distanced himself from the hedge-fund manager now charged with abusing minors, saying the two had had a falling-out 15 or so years ago. \"I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you,\" Trump said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">His comments came as a parade of Democratic presidential contenders and party leaders demanded that Acosta, a former federal prosecutor in south Florida, resign or be fired over his role in a secret 2008 plea deal that let Epstein avoid federal prosecution after allegations he molested teenage girls.</p><p>Epstein pleaded not guilty on Monday to new child sex-trafficking charges. Federal prosecutors in New York accuse him of abusing dozens of underage girls in the early 2000s, paying them hundreds of dollars in cash for massages and then molesting them at his homes in Florida and New York. He could face up to 45 years in prison if convicted.</p><p>Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump repeatedly praised Acosta, calling him a \"really great secretary of labor\" and \"very good\" at his job. He suggested it's not unusual to find past mistakes if you look hard enough.</p><p>WASHINGTON</p><p>Most attackers made threats before incident, report finds</p><p>One-third of the attackers who terrorized schools, houses of worship or businesses nationwide last year had a history of serious domestic violence, two-thirds had mental health issues, and nearly all had made threatening or concerning communications that worried others before they struck, according to a U.S. Secret Service report on mass attacks.</p><p>The Secret Service studied 27 incidents where a total of 91 people were killed and 107 more injured in public spaces in 2018. Among them: the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed and 17 others injured, and the fatal attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.</p><p>The report analyzed the timing, weapons, locations and stressors of the attacker, plus events that led up to the incident, in an effort to better understand how such attacks unfold and how to prevent them. Members of the Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center, which did the study, briefed police, public safety and school officials at a seminar Tuesday.</p><p>\"We want the community to know prevention is everyone's responsibility,\" said Lina Alathari, the center's chief. \"Not just law enforcement.\"</p><p>Other incidents examined included a man who drove a truck into a Planned Parenthood clinic in New Jersey, injuring three, and a man who killed two at a law firm, and then one at a psychologist's office in June. Criteria for the study included an incident where three or more people were injured in a public place.</p><p>DALLAS</p><p>H. Ross Perot rose from poverty to self-made billionaire</p><p>H. Ross Perot rose from a childhood of Depressionera poverty to become a self-made billionaire who twice ran for president with a mixture of folksy sayings and simple solutions to America's problems. His 19 percent of the vote in 1992 stands among the best showings by an independent candidate in the last century.</p><p>Perot died of leukemia Tuesday at his home in Dallas surrounded by his family, family spokesman James Fuller said. He was 89.</p><p>As a boy in Texarkana, Texas, Perot delivered newspapers from the back of a pony. He earned his billions in a more modern way, however. After attending the U.S. Naval Academy and becoming a salesman for IBM, he set out on his own - creating and building Electronic Data Systems Corp., which helped other companies manage their computer networks.</p><p>The most famous event in his storied business career didn't involve sales or earnings. In 1979, Perot financed a private commando raid to free two EDS employees who were being held in a prison in Iran. The tale was turned into a book and a movie.</p><p>\"I always thought of him as stepping out of a Norman Rockwell painting and living the American dream,\" said Tom Luce, who was a young lawyer when Perot hired him to handle his business and personal legal work. \"A newspaper boy, a midshipman, shaking Dwight Eisenhower's hand at his graduation, and he really built the computer-services industry at EDS.\"</p><p>WASHINGTON</p><p>McConnell equates his ancestors' slave ownership to Obama's</p><p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says his family's history of slave ownership doesn't change his opposition to reparations.</p><p>The Kentucky Republican said Tuesday that he and former President Barack Obama have opposed reparations, and \"both are the descendent of slave owners.\"</p><p>Last month, McConnell said he didn't think \"reparations for something that happened 150 years ago, for whom none of us currently living are responsible, is a good idea.\" He said the nation paid for the \"sin of slavery\" by electing Obama president.</p><p>NBC News this week used census records to show that two of McConnell's great-great- grandfathers were slave owners before the Civil War. Obama has white ancestors who were slave owners, according to reports.</p><p>House Democrats are considering legislation to study reparations for slavery.</p><p>RICHMOND, VA.</p><p>GOP-led Virginia Legislature abruptly adjourns gun session</p><p>Less than two hours after beginning a special session called in response to a mass shooting, Virginia lawmakers abruptly adjourned Tuesday and postponed any movement on gun laws until after the November election.</p><p>Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam summoned the Republican-led Legislature to the Capitol to address gun violence in the wake of the May 31 attack that killed a dozen people in Virginia Beach. He put forward a package of eight gun-control measures and called for \"votes and laws, not thoughts and prayers\" in reaction to the massacre.</p><p>But not a single vote was cast on the legislation. Republican leaders said the session was premature and politically motivated. They assigned the state's bipartisan crime commission to study the Virginia Beach shooting and the governor's proposed legislation.</p><p>In reply, angry Democrats said Republicans were beholden to the gun lobby and afraid of passing commonsense laws they know will save lives.</p><p>It was a familiar outcome in a stalled debate that plays out yearly in Virginia on an issue that has divided the nation for more than two decades.</p><p>WASHINGTON</p><p>Trump v. Big Tech: Social media summit will snub tech titans</p><p>President Donald Trump is gathering conservative groups at the White House this week for a \"summit\" on social media that will prominently snub the tech titans who run big platforms on Facebook, Twitter and Google.</p><p>It's a sharp contrast to earlier days in Trump's tenure when tech executives were occasional celebrity guests at the White House, serving as a fresh indication of the president's escalating battle with Big Tech.</p><p>Now, Trump regularly accuses the big social media platforms of suppressing conservative voices. He has suggested the companies may be acting illegally and should be sued by U.S. regulators.</p><p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said the White House conference on Thursday would bring together \"digital leaders for a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today's online environment.\"</p><p>But Google, Facebook and Twitter weren't invited, their representatives confirmed. And their leaders may be more likely to turn up Thursday at an annual media industry conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, a venue oriented more toward high-stakes deal-making than reflections on perceived bias in online communications.</p><p>WASHINGTON</p><p>Amazon, Microsoft wage war over the Pentagon's 'war cloud'</p><p>Amazon and Microsoft are battling it out over a $10 billion opportunity to build the U.S. military its first \"war cloud\" computing system. But Amazon's early hopes of a shock-and awe victory may be slipping away.</p><p>Formally called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure plan, or JEDI, the military's computing project would store and process vast amounts of classified data, allowing the Pentagon to use artificial intelligence to speed up its war planning and fighting capabilities. The Defense Department hopes to award the winner-take-all contract as soon as August. Oracle and IBM were eliminated at an earlier round of the contract competition.</p><p>But that's only if the project isn't derailed first. It faces a legal challenge by Oracle and growing congressional concerns about alleged Pentagon favoritism toward Amazon. Military officials hope to get started soon on what will be a decade-long business partnership they describe as vital to national security.</p><p>\"This is not your grandfather's internet,\" said Daniel Goure, vice president of the Lexington Institute, a defense-oriented think tank. \"You're talking about a cloud where you can go from the Pentagon literally to the soldier on the battlefield carrying classified information.\"</p><p>Amazon was considered an early favorite when the Pentagon began detailing its cloud needs in 2017, but its candidacy has been marred by an Oracle allegation that Amazon executives and the Pentagon have been overly cozy. Oracle has a final chance to make its case against Amazon - and the integrity of the government's bidding process - in a court hearing Wednesday.</p><p>LONDON</p><p>UK Tory contenders trade blows; Labour backs new Brexit vote</p><p>The two men vying to be Britain's next leader traded verbal blows in a televised debate Tuesday about who is more likely to break the country's Brexit deadlock and lead the U.K. out of the European Union. About 160,000 Conservative Party members are voting for a successor to Prime Minister Theresa May, who announced her resignation last month after failing repeatedly to get Parliament to back her divorce deal with the EU.</p><p>The two finalists, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, both used their only televised debate to argue that they were best placed to negotiate Britain's twice-postponed exit, currently scheduled for Oct. 31.</p><p>Johnson, a populist former mayor of London whom polls suggest is the strong front-runner, argued that Britain leaving on schedule, with or without a divorce deal, is a \"do or die\" issue.</p><p>\"Delay does not deliver a deal.

Deliver universal free health care, education and other public services that also work for women and girls. Stop supporting privatization of public services. Provide pensions, child benefits and other social protection for all. Design all services to ensure they also deliver for women and girls.</p><p>2. Free up women's time by easing the millions of unpaid hours they spend every day caring for their families and homes. Let those who do this essential work have a say in budget decisions and make freeing up women's time a key objective of government spending. Invest in public services including water, electricity and childcare that reduce the time needed to do this unpaid work.</p><p>3. End the under-taxation of rich individuals and corporations. Tax wealth and capital at fairer levels. Stop the race to the bottom on personal income and corporate taxes. Eliminate tax avoidance and evasion by corporations and the super-rich. Agree to a new set of global rules and institutions to fundamentally redesign the tax system to make it fair, with developing countries having an equal seat at the table.</p><p>Controversy</p><p>Policymakers should take Oxfam's findings and suggestions with a grain of salt, however, since even after repeated criticism year after year, the report remains methodologically sloppy. Their calculation of inequality is based on \"net assets\" in which the assets owned by individuals, such as property and shares, is subtracted by their debt liabilities, to calculate their position in the global wealth distribution. Income is excluded from the calculation.</p><p>One of the most intuitive problems with this is that the poorest people by this method are not those in developing countries living with little to nothing, but young professionals, who own no assets with a significant degree of student debt. It seems absurd to believe that a Harvard graduate in his first job, with a steady income, is somehow worse off than those living with little debt in sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia, simply because he had to take out a loan for college.</p><p>Jamie White, research director at the UK think tank, Institute of Economic Affairs, says that what Oxfam got fundamentally wrong isn't so much the inclusion of the debt; it's the failure to recognize the asset that it funded.</p><p>\"It's true that a Harvard graduate, say from law school, has a high debt. But what Oxfam isn't counting is the value from this degree,\" he said.</p><p>Issues like these persist throughout Oxfam's work. Individual data, for example, does not capture family assets nor the pension claims that one has. Last year, Oxfam tried to dismiss claims that pension funds act as institutional investors for the average person by claiming \"even in countries where pension funds are significant institutional investors, in effect sharing the returns with pensioners, their share of these lucrative assets has been declining.\"</p><p>This is contrasted with the evidence that pension funds and liabilities represent a growing share of the global economy. Pension funds are rapidly expanding around the world, with China having the fastest growth rate. Ignoring this distorts the findings on the real ownership structures of capital assets.</p><p>What really matters</p><p>It is clear that the Oxfam report is not of the high academic caliber worthy of the sort of media attention it generates. The organization's notion that global wealth is a collective pool to which people around the world contribute, and from which the rich take the lion's share, depriving others, is preposterous.</p><p>Jamie White says that taking away the wealth of the 26 super-rich and giving it to the poor - a policy Oxfam may favor - wouldn't help at all. \"All that would happen is they would double their net worth, and that would amount to an increase of $750 [per person]. That's not an increase in their income, but a one-off payment. It wouldn't really change their lives at all,\" he said.</p><p>But the underlying problem of inequality is nonetheless real. Economist David Autor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that a significant degree of inequality can be explained by what is referred to as \"superstar firms\" such as big tech companies that significantly outperform everyone else.</p><p>Research into the likes of Google and Facebook shows that most inequality is not between bosses and their employees, but between those that work at superstar companies with smaller labor forces and everyone else.</p><p>That is why Jamie White argues that rather than increasing the scope of regulations that allows for special interests to capture policy, the focus should be on increasing competition and reducing barriers to market entry. A more competitive market economy would increase prosperity and combat cronyism in a much more effective manner than the suggestions proposed by Oxfam.</p><p>Source: DW - Deutsche Welle</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V7R-YKX1-DXMS-84J9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1044\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 22, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001X99</classCode><className>CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS524126 DIRECT PROPERTY &amp;

It's time Big Tech made the positive case for harvesting our data View</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There has been much controversy recently about the so-called loss of privacy brought about by large tech companies, like Facebook and Google. There are lots of people telling us how concerned we should be about giving up our data - but almost no one can tell us exactly why. And even fewer people are reminding us that privacy is a small price to pay for what those tech platforms have created for our lives, economies and societies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As it becomes more and more fashionable among both the public and lawmakers to focus on the perceived negatives of these companies, we are forgetting the positives which, if we are still aware of them at all, seem to be being taken for granted.</p><p>Those positives are significant. For instance, Big Tech has created the most personalised, relevant and effective advertising in history. This has delivered huge benefits to consumers, to the point that an irrelevant or inappropriate advert appearing online is a moment for outcry or confusion.</p><p>Much bigger than the benefits to consumers, however, is the economic gain. There are so many small and medium-sized businesses which now have access to cost-effective, targeted advertising, thanks to Big Tech's algorithms.</p><p>Big Tech has created the most personalised, relevant and effective advertising in history. This has delivered huge benefits to consumers, to the point that an irrelevant or inappropriate advert appearing online is a moment for outcry or confusion.</p><p>Shirish Agarwal</p><p>Digital marketing consultant, founder of Flow 20</p><p>I have lost count of the number of businesses which have been able to survive, thrive, grow and create jobs with business models based purely on online advertising; online advertising that is built on algorithms and data harvested and harnessed by Big Tech. With old, offline advertising, those businesses would have gone bust long ago.</p><p>But this is not a case the large tech companies are willing to make. Afraid of public outcry if the trade-off between privacy and quality of advertising is made explicit, they have withdrawn from the debate.</p><p>The result? We are seldom reminded that giving up our privacy is a small price to pay for receiving the best advertising ever created, to say nothing of the knock-on benefits in terms of economic growth and employment from which we all benefit, directly or indirectly.</p><p>Rather than allay our concerns, Big Tech's silence has worsened them. We suspect that they have access to much more data than they are openly admitting. I certainly feel that the built-in recording facility in smartphones is being used by Facebook's ads algorithm. On two recent occasions, I have had conversations with friends - once about joining a gym and once about going on holiday - that then almost immediately seemed to influence the ads Facebook was showing me.</p><p>It is important that Big Tech be open and honest about the data they are taking from us - and equally frank and unapologetic about why it is worth us handing it over.</p><p>Shirish Agarwal</p><p>Digital marketing consultant, founder of Flow 20</p><p>What is so bad about being told about gyms in your area when you are considering joining one, or learning about Thai holidays when you are planning a getaway? Would it have been better if Facebook had shown me ads displayed at random, trying to sell me cupcakes and stair lifts instead?</p><p>This seems ludicrous, but it was the reality with which we were all faced until recently - and still do face in non-targeted advertising, like roadside billboards or general print advertising. Unsurprisingly, we tune out when consuming those media - but tune in when we are viewing highly-relevant ads online. Online advertising works because we like it - even if some of us pretend not to.</p><p>I for one am very happy with the hyper-relevant ads I have bought by selling my privacy. If I could, I would trade up even further: I would be happy for Facebook to have access to my thoughts if it meant I received better targeted ads.</p><p>Lawmakers seem to disagree with me, however. Where the first two decades of this millennium were spent demonising and regulating banks, it seems that the third decade will be spent making Big Tech into the new bogeyman.</p><p>Regulators should remember that before they clamp down too hard on advertising platforms that we all benefit from. Privacy is overrated - social media isn't.</p><p>Shirish Agarwal</p><p>Digital marketing consultant, founder of Flow 20</p><p>This means higher taxes, more regulation and perhaps even a climate of personal persecution against the founders who have made these platforms a part of our lives. These are conditions that stifle entrepreneurship, and would have stopped the dotcom boom in its tracks if they were present a generation ago.</p><p>It is important that Big Tech be open and honest about the data they are taking from us - and equally frank and unapologetic about why it is worth us handing it over. Until we are willing to pay a monthly subscription for using Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn, it is the only way to make their businesses sustainable.</p><p>Regulators should remember that before they clamp down too hard on advertising platforms that we all benefit from.

There are lots of people telling us how concerned we should be about giving up our data - but almost no one can tell us exactly why. And even fewer people are reminding us that privacy is a small price to pay for what those tech platforms have created for our lives, economies and societies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As it becomes more and more fashionable among both the public and lawmakers to focus on the perceived negatives of these companies, we are forgetting the positives which, if we are still aware of them at all, seem to be being taken for granted.</p><p>Those positives are significant. For instance, Big Tech has created the most personalised, relevant and effective advertising in history. This has delivered huge benefits to consumers, to the point that an irrelevant or inappropriate advert appearing online is a moment for outcry or confusion.</p><p>Much bigger than the benefits to consumers, however, is the economic gain. There are so many small and medium-sized businesses which now have access to cost-effective, targeted advertising, thanks to Big Tech's algorithms.</p><p>Big Tech has created the most personalised, relevant and effective advertising in history. This has delivered huge benefits to consumers, to the point that an irrelevant or inappropriate advert appearing online is a moment for outcry or confusion.</p><p>Shirish Agarwal </p><p>Digital marketing consultant, founder of Flow 20</p><p>I have lost count of the number of businesses which have been able to survive, thrive, grow and create jobs with business models based purely on online advertising; online advertising that is built on algorithms and data harvested and harnessed by Big Tech. With old, offline advertising, those businesses would have gone bust long ago.</p><p>But this is not a case the large tech companies are willing to make. Afraid of public outcry if the trade-off between privacy and quality of advertising is made explicit, they have withdrawn from the debate.</p><p>The result? We are seldom reminded that giving up our privacy is a small price to pay for receiving the best advertising ever created, to say nothing of the knock-on benefits in terms of economic growth and employment from which we all benefit, directly or indirectly.</p><p>Rather than allay our concerns, Big Tech's silence has worsened them. We suspect that they have access to much more data than they are openly admitting. I certainly feel that the built-in recording facility in smartphones is being used by Facebook's ads algorithm. On two recent occasions, I have had conversations with friends - once about joining a gym and once about going on holiday - that then almost immediately seemed to influence the ads Facebook was showing me.</p><p>It is important that Big Tech be open and honest about the data they are taking from us - and equally frank and unapologetic about why it is worth us handing it over.</p><p>Shirish Agarwal </p><p>Digital marketing consultant, founder of Flow 20</p><p>What is so bad about being told about gyms in your area when you are considering joining one, or learning about Thai holidays when you are planning a getaway? Would it have been better if Facebook had shown me ads displayed at random, trying to sell me cupcakes and stair lifts instead?</p><p>This seems ludicrous, but it was the reality with which we were all faced until recently - and still do face in non-targeted advertising, like roadside billboards or general print advertising. Unsurprisingly, we tune out when consuming those media - but tune in when we are viewing highly-relevant ads online. Online advertising works because we like it - even if some of us pretend not to.</p><p>I for one am very happy with the hyper-relevant ads I have bought by selling my privacy. If I could, I would trade up even further: I would be happy for Facebook to have access to my thoughts if it meant I received better targeted ads.</p><p>Lawmakers seem to disagree with me, however. Where the first two decades of this millennium were spent demonising and regulating banks, it seems that the third decade will be spent making Big Tech into the new bogeyman.</p><p>Regulators should remember that before they clamp down too hard on advertising platforms that we all benefit from. Privacy is overrated - social media isn't.</p><p>Shirish Agarwal </p><p>Digital marketing consultant, founder of Flow 20</p><p>This means higher taxes, more regulation and perhaps even a climate of personal persecution against the founders who have made these platforms a part of our lives. These are conditions that stifle entrepreneurship, and would have stopped the dotcom boom in its tracks if they were present a generation ago.</p><p>It is important that Big Tech be open and honest about the data they are taking from us - and equally frank and unapologetic about why it is worth us handing it over. Until we are willing to pay a monthly subscription for using Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn, it is the only way to make their businesses sustainable.</p><p>Regulators should remember that before they clamp down too hard on advertising platforms that we all benefit from.

A major problem is that online advertising practices are complex and secretive, so people are not able to give meaningful consent as to how their personal data is used. </p><p>Big Tech is profiting by abusing an individual's right to privacy. We've previously seen it with Facebook and now Google, with both embroiled in revelations of targeting of children and reports of secretive hidden websites to harvest data. This is a systemic problem with surveillance-driven Big Tech firms, and companies have got away with it for too long.</p><p>Today's fines, while welcome, are a drop in the ocean for a company that made US$136 billion in revenue in 2018. There needs to be tougher efforts by governments to address the underlying human rights risks posed by such large-scale corporate surveillance.</p><p>Background</p><p>On Wednesday, US regulators agreed a settlement with Google of US$170 million and ordered changes to privacy on YouTube, after the tech giant was found to have harvested personal information from children without their parents' consent.</p><p>In response to the FTC settlement, YouTube's CEO stated the company will now limit data collection and use for children's content on the platform, and stop serving personalised advertising on such content.</p><p>The fine came on the same day the firm was accused of using secret hidden websites to harvest personal information, according to a report in the Financial Times.</p><p>In response to the Financial Times report, a spokesperson for Google said, We do not serve personalised ads or send bid requests to bidders without user consent.

A major problem is that online advertising practices are complex and secretive, so people are not able to give meaningful consent as to how their personal data is used.</p><p>Big Tech is profiting by abusing an individual's right to privacy. We've previously seen it with Facebook and now Google, with both embroiled in revelations of targeting of children and reports of secretive hidden websites to harvest data. This is a systemic problem with surveillance-driven Big Tech firms, and companies have got away with it for too long.</p><p>Today's fines, while welcome, are a drop in the ocean for a company that made US$136 billion in revenue in 2018. There needs to be tougher efforts by governments to address the underlying human rights risks posed by such large-scale corporate surveillance.</p><p>Background</p><p>On Wednesday, US regulators agreed a settlement with Google of US$170 million and ordered changes to privacy on YouTube, after the tech giant was found to have harvested personal information from children without their parents' consent.</p><p>In response to the FTC settlement, YouTube's CEO stated the company will now limit data collection and use for children's content on the platform, and stop serving personalised advertising on such content.</p><p>The fine came on the same day the firm was accused of using secret hidden websites to harvest personal information, according to a report in the Financial Times.</p><p>In response to the Financial Times report, a spokesperson for Google said, We do not serve personalised ads or send bid requests to bidders without user consent. The spokesperson also said that Google is co-operating with investigations in Ireland and the UK into its advertising business.</p><p>States have an obligation to protect human rights in the context of corporate activities, including through regulation and oversight.

Device usage in the developing world will continue to grow, driving access to finance for millions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Opportunities in the developing world are based on young populations, growing mobile phone usage and poor existing domestic banking services. Of the 710 million people expected to subscribe to mobile services for the first time over the next seven years, half will come from Asia Pacific and half from Sub-Saharan Africa (GSMA Intelligence: The Mobile Economy 2019). Around a third of Brazilians don't have bank accounts, because the services are too expensive, branches are too far away, or they don't trust the institutions (Global Findex Database: The Unbanked 2017).</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2020, we could see:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Greater financial inclusion. More people will discover ways to use devices to manage their financial affairs and will leapfrog straight from unbanked to taking part in the digital economy, without ever having a bricks and mortar bank account. Diversification of services. As scale of use grows, and digital networks spread throughout developing world countries, it will become commercial for fintech companies to offer a greater variety of digital banking services.</emphasis></p><p>2.\u00a0Domestic players in Southern hemisphere nations will strengthen further, expanding theranks of fintech leaders beyond the usual suspects.</p><p>In 2019 we continued to see the emergence of major fintech players beyond the traditional developed world:\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Whether it's Tencent's WeBank, the Chinese private direct bank with a $21.5 billion deposit base at the end of 2018, Brazilian digital bank Nubank, which reached 15 million customers in October, or Nigerian digital payments company Interswitch, which became Africa's second unicorn in November, fintech is spreading throughout Southern hemisphere nations.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>In 2020, we could see:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Continued investment in new developing world infrastructure. The growing visibility of the opportunity will drive investment, e.g. a mooted Interswitch IPO, and by longer term initiatives such as China's Belt and Road initiative. More true innovation outside the US.\u00a0 Talent will pool in new places and gains confidence and access to funds for R&amp;D.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p>3.\u00a0The FAANGs and legacy financial services companies will start to partner more withspecialist players to expand into new services, especially beyond the developed world markets</p><p>In 2019 we saw some of the world's largest technology companies and banking services providers make a push into mobile money in a bid to further monetise their existing customer relationships and trust:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">In April, Mastercard invested $56 million in Africa-focused e-commerce start-up Jumia ahead of its New York Stock Exchange IPO, and further Mastercard collaborations with African fintechs Zazu, uKheshe and Kasha followed in November and December and with mobile operators Vodacom and Airtel in July and October. In June, Facebook formally announced plans for Libra, Facebook's own cryptocurrency, to a highly mixed reception, attracting criticism from governments and central banks. In August, Apple made its Apple card available, in the US for now, but with the potential for the company to make it more widely available, to more of its 1.3bn active users. This dwarfs the customer base of the largest bank in the world, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, with its 567m personal customers. In November Visa paid $200 million for 20% of Interswitch.</emphasis></p><p>In 2020 we could see:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">More regulation of Big Tech in finance. New moves could be held back by regulators concerned for ways in which global technology companies could interfere with the operation of governments and threaten the rights and freedoms of the customer. Smaller players moving in to take advantage. Nimbler companies could exploit opportunities the FAANGs might now be too big and well-known to seize without serious reputational damage at home. Partnership between large global technology companies and legacy banking companies on the one hand and digital specialists on the other. This approach to launching additional services will be less problematic culturally than acquisitions and can drive\u00a0innovation faster than organic launches.</emphasis></p><p>4.\u00a0The flows of trade will shift and significant new corridors will emerge.</p><p>In 2019, economic and political borders were strengthened or disputed by many developed world nations and countries, but Africa was a bright spot for free trade:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">In May, US President Donald Trump banned US firms dealing with Chinese firms including global ICT solutions provider Huawei.\u00a0 In November, Apple complied with a new Russian law by describing the Crimean Peninsula territory annexed by Russia as part of Russia in its Maps and Weather apps for Russian users. 54 out of 55 African states signed up to the African Continental Free Trade Area (ACFTA), which encompasses 1.2 billion people and has an output of more than $3 trillion.</emphasis></p><p>In 2020, we could see:\u00a0\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Increased national investment in technology to secure Critical National Infrastructure. The Chinese Communist party has just ordered state offices to replace all foreign PCs and software. Whether third nations opt into US or Chinese 'spheres of influence' or attempt to make their own bespoke combinations secure, putting a secure national stamp on solutions will be the order of the day for many nations. More intra-regional migration. While borders in the Northern hemisphere have hardened to South-North immigration, flows of people within southern hemisphere regions continue and will grow. With ACFTA, the free movement of goods and services will be underpinned by freer movement of people and currencies. More 'South-South' commerce. Transsion (Chinese), Samsung (South Korean) and Huawei (Chinese) were the African smartphone market leaders in terms of shipments in Q2 2019. All are Android-based devices, rather than using Apple's iOS operating system, and the newly launched Huawei Mate 30 contains no US parts. Next year trade will build further on the growing commercial links and technology infrastructure behind this and other South-South trading relationships.</emphasis></p><p>Commenting, Tamer El-Emary, Chief Commercial Officer at WorldRemit, said:</p><p>\"Across our network we see trends that all point to the growing importance of the global South in the mobile money market. Increased device penetration has driven huge change already, but with much more still to come. At WorldRemit we look forward to embracing further shifts in what we believe will be the year of the Southern hemisphere.\"</p><p>About WorldRemit</p><p>Leading digital money transfer company WorldRemit has disrupted an industry previously dominated by offline legacy players, such as Western Union, by taking international money transfers online - making them more convenient, safer, faster and lower-cost.

He told The Australian Financial Review he was hoping to make the most of his visit by opening his chequebook for his first Australian investments. \"My basic theory is to never underestimate anyone and that almost every major city has two or three companies in our 'Goldilocks Zone' of investing: which is not too hot, not too cold,\" Mr Calacanis said.</p><p>\"By way of the investments I've made - we have really saturated ourselves in San Francisco, so I have a team of 11 people looking at companies to invest in and I make the final say. This is sort of our coming-out party in Australia and if we can leave Sydney with 10 great founders that we've started a relationship with that would be success for us.\"</p><p>Mr Calacanis is well known in the US for ruffling feathers with his unfiltered commentary on the tech industry, and he said he believes major cities like Sydney and Melbourne in Australia and capital cities across Europe are beginning to offer a better environment than San Francisco for aspirational start-up founders.</p><p>He said his recent LAUNCH events in San Francisco had been \"shaken down\" by unions trying to force him to employ more expensive audio-visual staff by sabotaging his venues, and the chasm between wealth and poverty had created a city that's increasingly dysfunctional. \"It's a horrible city to visit. It's one of the most wonderful groups of people, in a completely mismatched city. The homelessness, the crime, it's a horrible city in many ways right now,\" he said. \"If you had a choice between going to Sydney, New York, San Francisco and picked 10 random cities in the world ... I'm going to guess that San Francisco would be No.10 ... so more people will be looking elsewhere to start and grow companies.\"</p><p>Mr Calacanis said start-up founders should seek him out, as he was open to companies in any category, and he believed his dollars to be worth double those of other angel investors with less influence and acumen.</p><p>He describes himself as the best active angel investor in the world, saying that those who were previously better than him have all retired to spend their wealth. He said good angel investors would eventually hit a big deal (in his case Uber) by working hard, and that then, with judgment, it can snowball to incorporate a suite of big wins.</p><p>While he could afford to never work another day in his life, he said he had no desire to retire and let his mind \"get old\". \"The thing that kills venture capitalists' careers is being good at it. Unless you have something inside of you, where it's not just about wealth, then the money does f--- with people's heads ... I see it happen all the time,\" he said. \"When people get rich they don't call in sick, they call in rich and decide they are going to go off and buy a farm in Tuscany instead of going to work.</p><p>\"There's really nothing I like more than winning and being part of a winning team ... so I've got a little bit left. If you retire, you start to become boring and get old and I'm only 46. Intellectually my job is to talk to people who want to change the world - and then decide which one I want to stand next to and say 'go get em'.\"</p><p>Despite his clear self-confidence Mr Calacanis said most successful entrepreneurs feel the sting of failure in their careers. He points out that aside from his standout investments he has backed lots more that have failed to return his money.</p><p>His visit to Australia coincided with the voluntary administration of high-profile Australian start-up Unlockd, which blamed Google for killing its business model by looking to kick it off its AdMob and Google Play platforms.</p><p>He said he would always back a strong founder who had lost his money if he could see they still had the desire and ability to succeed.</p><p>One of Mr Calacanis' earlier ventures, Mahalo, went up against Google in search by human curation rather than relying on algorithms. The business was flying until Google changed its algorithms and Mahalo's traffic plummeted, with the company eventually closing down.</p><p>Mr Calacanis pointed to YouTube creators having their revenue streams decimated by changed algorithms, and said start-up founders were mistaken if they trusted big tech platforms not to change the rules without warning.</p><p>Despite his personal issues with Google, however, he said they and Apple were actually much better to deal with than Facebook.</p><p>\"The fact is Google has a history of pulling the rug out from under their partners ... and they lie to their partners too about what their intentions are and then flip the rules. As a founder you have to try and have resiliency in your business to handle this, which isn't always possible,\" he said.</p><p>\"Google, to its credit, pays out a large amount of money to people. Apple is probably the best partner, paying out 70 per cent with the App Store; and Facebook is the worst because it has just screwed over journalists, celebrities, brands - over and over and over again, and it never shares the money.</p><p>\"You can't trust the big companies, and should understand that they are going to intentionally or unintentionally destroy your business.\"</p><p>Mr Calacanis has publicly criticised Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in the past, and said he had no doubt that when big media companies invest time and money to work with Facebook to tackle \"Fake News\" he will simply take all the information that is useful to Facebook and then change the rules to exclude them again.</p><p>He said companies needed to know the nature of companies they were dealing with when they were to become the foundation of revenue streams. Apple could be great, Google okay but unreliable and Facebook was \"inherently untrustworthy\".</p><p>\"Zuckerberg is the worst of it. He studies everybody's businesses through Facebook connect, through the 'Like' buttons and uses their data to evaluate features and companies before copying and stealing from them,\" he said. \"Zuckerberg is the biggest thief in the industry. I mean, he stole every feature from Snapchat after they refused to sell to him.\"</p><p>While accepting that some people will think he is bitter, after he \"went mad\" at Google publicly following the update that killed Mahalo, he said his comments simply showed he was now in a position where he can afford to speak honestly. It was valuable to warn start-up founders of both the obvious benefits and serious dangers of dealing with the big fish in the tech ocean.</p><p>He said there were huge positives to be derived from working with the likes of Google, but that he had spoken with many founders who were blinded to his warnings, based on mistaken trust in personal relationships with executives.</p><p>\"They think; 'oh, no, no, no, I know somebody over there' ... Well I knew Sergey and Larry, and I knew Marissa Mayer,\" Mr Calacanis said. \"I knew everybody at Google back in the day, and you know what? None of them helped me when I had to lay off 75 writers at Mahalo when they changed their search algorithm and 80 to 90 per cent of our traffic went away overnight.\"</p><p>Having spent some time in Australia Mr Calacanis said he has been impressed by the quality of ideas on display, and feels the country just needs a few more Atlassian-style success stories to create more wealthy angel investors in future companies.</p><p>He said he is not a great advocate for government regulating start-ups to success, believing the best thing politicians can do is \"get out of the way\".</p><p>However, he said he had been surprised by restrictions on investors in Australia, which deemed only \"sophisticated\" investors, with wealth over $2.5 million, could register to invest in start-ups. \"The accreditation rules are pretty severe here. If you found somebody who won the lottery, they would be sophisticated, but if you found an economics professor at the best school here - they would not be sophisticated?,\" Mr Calacanis said.</p><p>\"We all know people who got rich because they got lucky or their parents gave it to them, but that doesn't mean they're more sophisticated than a journalist who covers technology or economics ... so I think you have to re-do that law and just make people do a test and get accredited.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc70mu2eq4hwj1028s0n0o</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SKF-RRY1-JD34-V2KG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1482\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

A world-class bank will undoubtedly be a digital leader. It will invest in technology that makes a real difference to how the bank is run and how it interacts with its clients across wholesale and retail businesses. It will mirror many leading pure-play technology companies in the quality and effectiveness of its systems and apps, but it will adapt that DNA to the unique challenges of the banking industry.It will be a bank that plays to its strengths. It will not grow for growth's sake. It will take a long-term view, led by a stable and cohesive senior management team, who see themselves not as leaders of a bank today but as stewards of a business that will thrive in the future, while building on the culture of the past.\u00a0It will be a diversified bank. That might not mean diversification across multiple geographies, but it will operate across borders. It will probably be a universal bank, where business lines work together and complement each other, and in which a poor quarter or two in one division has a limited impact on the whole.\u00a0And it will be a bank that takes its role in broader society seriously, putting corporate responsibility at the heart of what it does. It will apply \"\" rather than just promise \"\" a duty of care to its employees and its clients.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Piyush Gupta</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>The bank in the world today that best matches these criteria is DBS, the Singaporean firm led by Piyush Gupta. For that reason, DBS is named as the world's best bank by Euromoney in 2019.</p><p>DBS is the epitome of a regional bank that is clearly world class in what it does. Ask the chief executive of any other leading bank which peers they admire, and DBS is likely to figure in the conversation. It is impossible not to be impressed by the passion, energy and commitment that Gupta and his colleagues bring to the task of making DBS a modern bank for the future world.\u00a0</p><p>Gupta began the strategy six years ago.\u00a0</p><p>\"We had to stop thinking: \"~What will other banks do?' We had to start thinking: \"~What would big tech do?'\" he says.</p><p>Of course, none of this means anything unless a bank can clearly demonstrate that it has the right model. On that count, DBS scores highly as well. The group had a record year, with a 28% increase in net profit to S$5.63 billion in 2018. Its return on equity, at 12.1%, is the highest it has been since the global financial crisis and in the upper range of cross-border universal banks globally.\u00a0</p><p>In part, this is the result of the deliberate elevation of two high-return businesses, wealth management and cash management, which have grown five and eight times over respectively in the last 10 years. Today the two businesses account for 33% of group income, up from 11% in 2009.\u00a0</p><p>At the same time, the contribution of the volatile treasury and markets group has been deliberately managed down from 22% in 2009 to 5% today (in truth, that downward management probably overshot last year).\u00a0</p><p> We had to stop thinking: \"~What will other banks do?' We had to start thinking: \"~What would big tech do?'\u00a0 \u00a0- Piyush Gupta </p><p>All DBS's numbers are underpinned by tech. Digital customers, by DBS's definition, account for 48% of the consumer and small business base today, which is good news because at DBS those customers carry a cost-to-income ratio of 34%, compared with 54% for traditional customers, while delivering twice the income per head.\u00a0</p><p>The ability to quantify and position for this difference has been instrumental in the bank's performance and has helped the cost-to-income ratio fall consistently by half a percentage point a year for a while now. It has further to go, with the consolidation of former ANZ wealth businesses having been a drag on the numbers, now largely absorbed.\u00a0</p><p>DBS is also a stable house, with a non-performing loan ratio that declined from 1.7% to 1.5% during 2018. The common equity tier-1 ratio, at 13.9%, is way above regulatory requirements.\u00a0</p><p>Although its business is still dominated in profitability terms by Singapore and Hong Kong, the bank is well positioned for the future. Income in Greater China beyond Hong Kong grew 31% year on year in 2018, south and southeast Asia by 14%.\u00a0</p><p>Digibank initiatives in India and Indonesia added 1.2 million customers in 2018 \"\" and Gupta is quick to admit that mistakes were made but crucially learned from \"\" along the way.\u00a0</p><p>Digital work continues, with a focus on making technology infrastructure cloud-native: now over 80% of DBS's open systems are cloud-ready and there are over 60 cloud-native applications.\u00a0</p><p>The bank has published over 350 application programming interfaces (APIs), enabling 90 external partners to integrate the bank's technologies; it has trained over 10,000 staff on a data-driven curriculum; and has increased its \"~release cadence' of new applications 10 times over, looking more and more like the tech companies that Gupta so admires.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-b1fmmkjyhws0h9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP0-SX21-JD1P-T06C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"844\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009SVL</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XKJ</classCode><className>BUSINESS ETHICS &amp; CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000340</classCode><className>COMPANY EARNINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000093</classCode><className>ANNIVERSARIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001410</classCode><className>COMPANY PROFITS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009SVL</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001912</classCode><className>RETAIL &amp; WHOLESALE TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

But, Alston said, the digitization of welfare systems has very often been used to promote deep reductions in the overall welfare budget, a narrowing of the beneficiary pool, the elimination of some services, the introduction of demanding and intrusive forms of conditionality, the pursuit of behavioural modification goals, the imposition of stronger sanctions regimes, and a complete reversal of the traditional notion that the state should be accountable to the individual.</p><p>\"Digital welfare states thereby risk becoming a Trojan Horses for neoliberal hostility towards social protection and regulation,\" said the UN Special Rapporteur. \"Moreover, empowering governments in countries with significant rule of law deficits by endowing them with the level of control and the potential for abuse provided by these biometric ID systems should send shudders down the spine of anyone even vaguely concerned to ensure that the digital age will be a human rights friendly one\".</p><p>Alston said governments justified the introduction of expensive and complex biometric digital identity card systems on the grounds that they would improve welfare services and reduce fraud.</p><p>\"The process is commonly referred to as 'digital transformation' by governments and the tech consultancies that advise them, but this somewhat neutral term should not be permitted to conceal the revolutionary, politically-driven, character of many such innovations,\" Alston said. \"Systems of social protection and assistance are increasingly driven by digital data and technologies that are used for diverse purposes, including to automate, predict, identify, surveil, detect, target and punish.\"</p><p>The dominant role of the private sector in designing, constructing and even operating significant parts of the digital welfare state is a major reason for concern, according to Alston. \"Most Governments have stopped short of requiring Big Tech companies to abide by human rights standards, and because the companies themselves have steadfastly resisted any such efforts, the companies often operate in a virtually human rights free-zone,\" said Alston.</p><p>The human rights community has thus far done a very poor job of persuading industry, government, or seemingly society at large, of the fact that a technologically-driven future will be disastrous if it is not guided by respect for human rights and grounded in hard law.

The inside story of how one company, Cambridge Analytica, misused intimate personal Facebook data to micro-target and manipulate swing voters in the US election, is compellingly told in The Great Hack, a new documentary out today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But as the former CEO of the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica tells the film-makers, this is not just about one company. The film goes further to open our eyes to the way our lives are constantly monitored - and controlled - through digital technology. And it goes to the heart of how far the entire business model of some Big Tech companies may be deeply threatening our human rights.</p><p>In the online and digital world, everything you do leaves a trace of data exhaust - a record of everything, from what time you put petrol in your car, to what websites you visited. When combined, even seemingly innocuous data points can reveal a LOT about a person.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica bragged that it had up to 5000 data points on every US voter. By applying psychographic analytics to its dataset, it claimed to be able to determine people's personality type and then individually micro-target messages to influence their behaviour. The most important source of the data was Facebook. Via a third-party app, Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data from up to 87 million Facebook profiles - including status updates, likes and even private messages.</p><p>But the incident was not an aberration: it was an inevitable consequence of a system founded on harvesting and monetising our information - the business model that academic Shoshana Zuboff dubs surveillance capitalism. The model's fundamental characteristics are: aggregating vast amounts of data on people, using it to infer incredibly detailed profiles on their lives and behaviour, and monetising it by selling these predictions to others such as advertisers. Cambridge Analytica simply deployed the same basic model to target voters rather than consumers.</p><p>This model has become core to the data economy, and underpins a complex ecosystem of tech companies, data brokers, advertisers and beyond. But it is the model's pioneers Google and Facebook that have unparalleled access to tracking and monetising our lives, by controlling the primary gateways - outside China - to the online world (between them Google Search, Chrome, Android, YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp).</p><p>Facebook and Google of course have long affirmed their commitment to respecting human rights. But increasingly, we are being forced to ask whether the internet's surveillance model itself inherently conflicts with our human rights.</p><p>Facebook and Google have amassed data vaults with an unprecedented volume of information on human beings. This goes far beyond the data that you choose to share on their platforms to include the vast amounts of data tracked as you engage with the digital world. Mass corporate surveillance on such a scale threatens the very essence of the right to privacy. Indeed, in 2010, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg famously admitted that social networking had already changed privacy as a social norm.</p><p>But harvesting the data is only the first part of the story. The next step is using sophisticated analytics powered by machine learning to profile people - and thereby influence their behaviour. In the furore over Cambridge Analytica, Facebook's own profiling practices largely escaped scrutiny. The company has explored personality profiling, how to manipulate emotions, and target people based on psychological vulnerabilities such as when they felt worthless or insecure. Google developed a tool to target ads so precisely that they can sway people's beliefs and change behaviour through social engineering - while initially developed to counter Islamic extremism, the tool is publicly available for anyone to (mis)use.</p><p>One of the most urgent and uncomfortable questions raised in The Great Hack is: to what extent are we susceptible to such behavioural manipulation? Ultimately, if these capabilities are as powerful as the companies and their customers claim, they pose a real threat to our ability to make our own autonomous decisions or even our right to opinion, undermining the fundamental value of dignity that underpin all human rights. Advertising and propaganda aren't new, but there is no precedent for targeting individuals in such intimate depth, and at the scale of whole populations.</p><p>The model may also be helping to fuel discrimination. Companies - and governments - could easily abuse data analytics to target people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or other protected characteristics. The push to grab users' attention and to keep them on platforms can also encourage the current toxic trend towards the politics of demonization. People are more likely to click on sensationalist or incendiary material, meaning platforms systematically privilege conspiracy theories, misogyny, and racism.</p><p>What is to be done? The data-driven business model presents a systemic and structural issue that will not be easy to address and requires a mix of political and regulatory solutions. Stronger data protection is certainly part of the answer: properly enforcing Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which has international reach, and using it as a model in other countries, would mitigate the extent of data-mining and profiling.</p><p>More radical calls to break up the Big Tech companies have now become commonplace, and the industry is already being examined by competition authorities in various jurisdictions. A recent decision by Germany's Federal Cartel Office to limit data sharing and aggregation between Facebook and WhatsApp is an example of a precise measure to counter the concentration of power towards the big players.</p><p>Whatever regulatory tools are deployed, it is vital that they are grounded in an analysis of the human rights risks posed by the model. Human rights provide the only international, legally binding framework that can capture the multi-faceted ways in which the business model is impacting our lives and what it means to be human - and hold the companies to account.</p><p>What is clear is that current efforts are not tackling the root causes of the problem. Two weeks ago, US regulators approved a record $5bn settlement against Facebook over Cambridge Analytica. But after news of the fine broke, Facebook's share price went UP.</p><p>The lesson: the company and its investors would be happy for this to remain an isolated incident. It will pay some relatively nominal fines - $5bn is a drop in the ocean for a company that makes $22bn in pure profit a year - and make a few improvements to their privacy protections, but then go back to business as usual.</p><p>We cannot let this happen. It is high time to confront the human rights impacts of surveillance capitalism itself.</p><p>Source: Amnesty International</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2263361923</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFR-KSV1-JBHT-D340-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1152\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The inside story of how one company, Cambridge Analytica, misused intimate personal Facebook data to micro-target and manipulate swing voters in the US election, is compellingly told in The Great Hack, a new documentary out today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But as the former CEO of the now-defunct Cambridge Analytica tells the film-makers, this is not just about one company. The film goes further to open our eyes to the way our lives are constantly monitored - and controlled - through digital technology. And it goes to the heart of how far the entire business model of some Big Tech companies may be deeply threatening our human rights.</p><p>In the online and digital world, everything you do leaves a trace of data exhaust - a record of everything, from what time you put petrol in your car, to what websites you visited. When combined, even seemingly innocuous data points can reveal a LOT about a person.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica bragged that it had up to 5000 data points on every US voter. By applying psychographic analytics to its dataset, it claimed to be able to determine people's personality type and then individually micro-target messages to influence their behaviour. The most important source of the data was Facebook. Via a third-party app, Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data from up to 87 million Facebook profiles - including status updates, likes and even private messages.</p><p>But the incident was not an aberration: it was an inevitable consequence of a system founded on harvesting and monetising our information - the business model that academic Shoshana Zuboff dubs surveillance capitalism. The model's fundamental characteristics are: aggregating vast amounts of data on people, using it to infer incredibly detailed profiles on their lives and behaviour, and monetising it by selling these predictions to others such as advertisers. Cambridge Analytica simply deployed the same basic model to target voters rather than consumers.</p><p>This model has become core to the data economy, and underpins a complex ecosystem of tech companies, data brokers, advertisers and beyond. But it is the model's pioneers Google and Facebook that have unparalleled access to tracking and monetising our lives, by controlling the primary gateways - outside China - to the online world (between them Google Search, Chrome, Android, YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp).</p><p>Facebook and Google of course have long affirmed their commitment to respecting human rights. But increasingly, we are being forced to ask whether the internet's surveillance model itself inherently conflicts with our human rights.</p><p>Facebook and Google have amassed data vaults with an unprecedented volume of information on human beings. This goes far beyond the data that you choose to share on their platforms to include the vast amounts of data tracked as you engage with the digital world. Mass corporate surveillance on such a scale threatens the very essence of the right to privacy. Indeed, in 2010, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg famously admitted that social networking had already changed privacy as a social norm.</p><p>But harvesting the data is only the first part of the story. The next step is using sophisticated analytics powered by machine learning to profile people - and thereby influence their behaviour. In the furore over Cambridge Analytica, Facebook's own profiling practices largely escaped scrutiny. The company has explored personality profiling, how to manipulate emotions, and target people based on psychological vulnerabilities such as when they felt worthless or insecure. Google developed a tool to target ads so precisely that they can sway people's beliefs and change behaviour through social engineering - while initially developed to counter Islamic extremism, the tool is publicly available for anyone to (mis)use.</p><p>One of the most urgent and uncomfortable questions raised in The Great Hack is: to what extent are we susceptible to such behavioural manipulation? Ultimately, if these capabilities are as powerful as the companies and their customers claim, they pose a real threat to our ability to make our own autonomous decisions or even our right to opinion, undermining the fundamental value of dignity that underpin all human rights. Advertising and propaganda aren't new, but there is no precedent for targeting individuals in such intimate depth, and at the scale of whole populations.</p><p>The model may also be helping to fuel discrimination. Companies - and governments - could easily abuse data analytics to target people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or other protected characteristics. The push to grab users' attention and to keep them on platforms can also encourage the current toxic trend towards the politics of demonization. People are more likely to click on sensationalist or incendiary material, meaning platforms systematically privilege conspiracy theories, misogyny, and racism.</p><p>What is to be done? The data-driven business model presents a systemic and structural issue that will not be easy to address and requires a mix of political and regulatory solutions. Stronger data protection is certainly part of the answer: properly enforcing Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which has international reach, and using it as a model in other countries, would mitigate the extent of data-mining and profiling.</p><p>More radical calls to break up the Big Tech companies have now become commonplace, and the industry is already being examined by competition authorities in various jurisdictions. A recent decision by Germany's Federal Cartel Office to limit data sharing and aggregation between Facebook and WhatsApp is an example of a precise measure to counter the concentration of power towards the big players.</p><p>Whatever regulatory tools are deployed, it is vital that they are grounded in an analysis of the human rights risks posed by the model. Human rights provide the only international, legally binding framework that can capture the multi-faceted ways in which the business model is impacting our lives and what it means to be human - and hold the companies to account.</p><p>What is clear is that current efforts are not tackling the root causes of the problem. Two weeks ago, US regulators approved a record $5bn settlement against Facebook over Cambridge Analytica. But after news of the fine broke, Facebook's share price went UP.</p><p>The lesson: the company and its investors would be happy for this to remain an isolated incident. It will pay some relatively nominal fines - $5bn is a drop in the ocean for a company that makes $22bn in pure profit a year - and make a few improvements to their privacy protections, but then go back to business as usual.</p><p>We cannot let this happen. It is high time to confront the human rights impacts of surveillance capitalism itself.</p><p>Source: Amnesty International</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN6-HMV1-JB5P-J2V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1151\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It comes as lawmakers consider new tough regulations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Simply put, they have too much power,\" said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who chairs the panel conducting a year-long investigation into the business practices of the four companies.</p><p>Cicilline said the hearing made clear that the firms \"have monopoly power -- some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable\".</p><p>He added the coronavirus outbreak had strengthened them even further: \"They are likely to emerge (from the pandemic) stronger and more powerful than ever before.\"</p><p>\"With big power comes big responsibilities, and these companies like any other companies have to play by the rules. And I think that message was drawn very clearly yesterday,\" Pinar Akman, Director of the Centre for Business Law and Practice at the University of Leeds, told Euronews.</p><p>But there was also an evident divide among the lawmakers carrying out the grilling: Republicans mainly took issue at what they perceive as anti-conservative bias from tech giants, while Democrats seemed more concerned about the impact of big tech on small competitors.</p><p>\"Competition laws are there not to protect small competitors, but to ensure that effective competition of markets delivers benefits to consumers: lower prices, more innovation, a higher range of products, more choice and so on,\" Akman said.</p><p>\"And what was missing from the hearings was really a discussion of the harms or benefits to consumers that the companies these CEOs represent generate.\"</p><p>CEOs answer accusations of stifling competition and political bias</p><p>The executives did provide bursts of data showing how competitive their markets are, and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices.</p><p>They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on US democracy and their role in China.</p><p>Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.</p><p>Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he could not guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.</p><p>Regulators in the US and Europe have scrutinised Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business, Bezos said in a response to a question from US Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. But I can't guarantee to you that policy hasn't been violated.</p><p>Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p>But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>Zuckerberg was put on the defensive with regards to the social network's role as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Lawmakers then deployed the company's internal documents against Zuckerberg, asserting that Facebook has gobbled up rivals to squelch competition.</p><p>Trump threatens executive orders on Big Tech</p><p>As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. Big Tech is out to get conservatives, said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio.</p><p>In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.</p><p>If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.</p><p>Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.</p><p>Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>Powerful giants</p><p>The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world's richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.</p><p>Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.</p><p>In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.</p><p>Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.</p><p>Cicilline also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, these giants stand to profit and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.</p><p>The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies' practices</p><p>No strangers to anti-trust accusations</p><p>Just last year, the European Commission fined Google 1.49 billion for abusive practices in online advertising.</p><p>The EU's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in 2019 Google had illegally misused \"its dominant position for the brokering of online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-contractual restrictions on third-party websites.</p><p>\"This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. The misconduct lasted over 10 years and denied other companies the possibility to compete on the merits and to innovate - and consumers the benefits of competition.</p><p>In April 2018, Zuckerberg made his debut before the Senate in a five-hour hearing before a joint session of the Commerce and Judiciary committees.</p><p>He not only answered questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal but also had to defend his company against monopoly power accusations. When asked about his biggest competitor in 2018, Zuckerberg said he could not name one.</p><p>Source: Euronews </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2428551656</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GB-1CM1-JBHT-D099-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1383\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

It comes as lawmakers consider new tough regulations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Simply put, they have too much power,\" said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who chairs the panel conducting a year-long investigation into the business practices of the four companies.</p><p>Cicilline said the hearing made clear that the firms \"have monopoly power -- some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable\".</p><p>He added the coronavirus outbreak had strengthened them even further: \"They are likely to emerge (from the pandemic) stronger and more powerful than ever before.\"</p><p>\"With big power comes big responsibilities, and these companies like any other companies have to play by the rules. And I think that message was drawn very clearly yesterday,\" Pinar Akman, Director of the Centre for Business Law and Practice at the University of Leeds, told Euronews.</p><p>But there was also an evident divide among the lawmakers carrying out the grilling: Republicans mainly took issue at what they perceive as anti-conservative bias from tech giants, while Democrats seemed more concerned about the impact of big tech on small competitors.</p><p>\"Competition laws are there not to protect small competitors, but to ensure that effective competition of markets delivers benefits to consumers: lower prices, more innovation, a higher range of products, more choice and so on,\" Akman said.</p><p>\"And what was missing from the hearings was really a discussion of the harms or benefits to consumers that the companies these CEOs represent generate.\"</p><p>CEOs answer accusations of stifling competition and political bias</p><p>The executives did provide bursts of data showing how competitive their markets are, and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices.</p><p>They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on US democracy and their role in China.</p><p>Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.</p><p>Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he could not guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.</p><p>Regulators in the US and Europe have scrutinised Amazon's relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.</p><p>We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business, Bezos said in a response to a question from US Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. But I can't guarantee to you that policy hasn't been violated.</p><p>Pichai's opening remarks touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, in the home districts of the antitrust panel's Democratic chairman, Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline, and its ranking Republican, Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin.</p><p>But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.</p><p>Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing.</p><p>Zuckerberg was put on the defensive with regards to the social network's role as a conduit for Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Lawmakers then deployed the company's internal documents against Zuckerberg, asserting that Facebook has gobbled up rivals to squelch competition.</p><p>Trump threatens executive orders on Big Tech</p><p>As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. Big Tech is out to get conservatives, said Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio.</p><p>In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.</p><p>If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\" Trump tweeted.</p><p>Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can't use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.</p><p>Trump's Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.</p><p>Powerful giants</p><p>The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world's richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.</p><p>Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.</p><p>In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.</p><p>Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.</p><p>Cicilline also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, these giants stand to profit and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.</p><p>The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies' practices</p><p>No strangers to anti-trust accusations</p><p>Just last year, the European Commission fined Google 1.49 billion for abusive practices in online advertising.</p><p>The EU's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in 2019 Google had illegally misused \"its dominant position for the brokering of online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-contractual restrictions on third-party websites.</p><p>\"This is illegal under EU antitrust rules. The misconduct lasted over 10 years and denied other companies the possibility to compete on the merits and to innovate - and consumers the benefits of competition.</p><p>In April 2018, Zuckerberg made his debut before the Senate in a five-hour hearing before a joint session of the Commerce and Judiciary committees.</p><p>He not only answered questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal but also had to defend his company against monopoly power accusations. When asked about his biggest competitor in 2018, Zuckerberg said he could not name one.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-NP31-DXMS-80MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1381\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Four days into world leaders\u2019 speeches, the biggest surprise has been China\u2019s pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 . Despite the dire times, leaders have offered no institutional innovation to speak of, except for the mailing in of their speeches, as Ian Bremmer  points out .   The biggest 2020 innovation, the COVAX vaccine alliance, is missing some key participants (cough, the U.S., China and Russia) \u2014 a stark difference from the development of a fully-fledged G20 in response to the 2008 global financial crisis.   While  \"Corona anywhere is corona everywhere,\" as Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar pointed out Thursday, most countries haven\u2019t been investing in possible coronavrius vaccines. This new Global Translations vaccine readiness ranking  illustrates that most of the world is hoping to free-ride their way back to normal.     A message from Bank of America:     \u201cThe economics of climate change solutions have been shifting for the better. This problem used to be very expensive to address. That\u2019s not the case anymore,\u201d says Haim Israel of BofA Global Research. Learn about the sustainable solutions that could help fight climate change.      LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT\u2019S \u2026 MORE YAWN-INDUCING UNGA SPEECHES    FRIDAY PREVIEW: The world\u2019s weirdest U.N. General Assembly continues, with three more days of speeches and a biodiversity summit still to come. Japan\u2019s new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will introduce himself to the world today. Other middle powers speaking include Italy, Canada, Pakistan, and Australia. India and the U.K. speak Saturday, but Germany is not appearing until Tuesday.   The most significant UNGA side event today is a meeting of the \u201c Alliance of Multilateralism, \u201d chaired by German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and his French counterpart Jean-Yves le Drian, focused on the theme of \"build back better,\" according to a copy of Maas' prepared remarks. To that end, Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel gave a Multilateralism 101 class to the world on Thursday. Speaking at an open government event, Merkel called for a stronger World Health Organization, arguing, \u201cGlobal tasks can only be solved globally.\u201d   UNSUSTAINABLE HUMANITARIAN DONOR BASE: The German government\u2019s lead official on humanitarian assistance, Sibylle Katharina Sorg , did not mince words Thursday at a meeting of the world\u2019s top 10 foreign aid donors. After calling 2020 \u201cexceptionally difficult for humanitarian action,\u201d she added that, \u201coverall humanitarian funding clearly remains too low compared to the needs and our collective capabilities.\u201d The fact that a small number of countries fund most humanitarian assistance is not new, but \u201cin the light of skyrocketing need, this is getting completely unsustainable,\u201d Sorg said. \u201cWe cannot put more and more responsibility on fewer and fewer shoulders.\u201d The U.S. donated the most humanitarian aid of any country in 2019: $9 billion, though Norway contributed the most per person.   MALNUTRITION POWER STRUGGLE: In Thursday's Global Translations we reported on the politics of food. Devex, a development news agency, now reports on tension between two U.N. agencies \u2014  UNICEF and the World Food Programme \u2014 on how to improve malnutrition programs. Less than half of the 47 million children who need nutrition support are getting treatment today. \"UNICEF, the lead coordinating agency, treats severe acute malnutrition. WFP treats moderate acute malnutrition. The parallel systems prevent the agencies from delivering a continuum of care to malnourished children and have led to a dispute over which agency should have the authority to procure ready-to-use therapeutic foods,\" Devex reported .   GREEN DEALS GOING GLOBAL: Leaders of the U.K., Canada and the European Commission used a U.N. roundtable with Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to commit to turbocharging their economies with green investment, urging others to join them. The newest initiative is from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , who said his government has made disclosing climate risk exposure a mandatory condition for companies seeking pandemic-related government funding and loans.   What\u2019s next? Britain\u2019s Boris Johnson will host a virtual summit Dec. 12. to squeeze commitments out of the 100 or so countries that have failed to meet a 2020 deadline for updated Paris Climate Agreement commitments.   TAXING TIMES \u2014 EVASION, MONEY LAUNDERING AND CORRUPTION BLOOM: Governments must do more to tackle tax abuse and corruption in global finance, according to a new report from a panel of former heads of state, government and central banks. Estimated government losses include: $500 billion siphoned by profit-shifting enterprises; $7 trillion in private wealth hidden in haven countries, and $1.6 trillion laundered each year, often to fund other criminal activity. \u201cCorruption and tax avoidance are rampant. Too many banks are in cahoots and too many governments are stuck in the past. We\u2019re all being robbed, especially the world\u2019s poor,\u201d said Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 , former president of Lithuania and co-chair of the group that authored the report.

REALITY CHECK  CORNER   CARBON TAX CHECK-IN: Sweden and Finland\u2019s carbon taxes \u2014 the world\u2019s first \u2014 are now in their fourth decade. The nonpartisan Tax Foundation did a health check and found that Sweden levies the highest carbon tax rate in the world at $126 per metric ton of CO2. And yet, throughout the life of the tax, \u201cSweden\u2019s carbon emissions have been declining, while there has been steady economic growth\u201d \u2014 GDP has grown 50 percent in real terms.   DID YOU KNOW? \u201c More people live under democracy in Asia than in any other region of the world,\u201d but \u201cChina is home to four-fifths of those still living under authoritarianism globally,\u201d International Republican Institute President Daniel Twining testified this week before a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the democracy and human rights outlook in Asia.   BLACK TALENT IS EVERYWHERE: It was less a faux pas and more a sign of flawed thinking, for which he has now apologized . This week\u2019s foot-in-mouth award goes to Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf who said in an internal memo that he faces \u201c a very limited pool of Black talent \u201d when seeking to diversify his leadership team. Scharf repeated the comments in a Zoom call over the summer. Plenty of other banks disagree, as do Scharf\u2019s own Black employees. At a Bloomberg Equality Summit on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs and SoftBank chirped about how many minority-owned businesses they invest in. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s the CEO of Wells Fargo who lacks the talent to recruit Black workers,\u201d U.S. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet. In the past year, Scharf has added two Black executives to his operating committee: Lester Owens as head of operations and Ather Williams as head of strategy, digital and innovation.                        Rich countries have moved aggressively to lock down sufficient vaccine doses for their citizens, but few have invested in ensuring there\u2019s an effective vaccine, in the first place.  Even big upfront investment, moreover, could be wasted if citizens are too skeptical to take an eventual vaccine.

D-DAY IS OCT. 14 \u2014 EU DATA GOVERNANCE REGULATION DAY: There\u2019s nothing big tech companies hate more than EU regulation of their activities, so they\u2019re going to be pretty unhappy next month, when the EU executive publishes a new data governance framework. It will come in the form of a regulation \u2014 the most rigid form of law it can propose, where a single legal text is applied across all 27 member countries. Among the possible measures that have been debated are a new framework to enable different sectors to share data safely between organizations; rules requiring interoperability (for example, so you can move your social media content to a new platform); and so-called data altruism rules, in which users can consent to the use of their personal data for the public good \u2014 say, to develop better health care.   INSIDE FACEBOOK\u2019S POLITICAL ADS BACKFLIP: As recently as 2019, Mark Zuckerberg insisted, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy.\u201d Sheryl Sandberg looked your author in the eye and said she really thinks banning political ads is the wrong thing to do. But this month, Facebook agreed to ban new political ads in the week before Election Day, and will reject ads that claim victory before vote counting is finished. That doesn\u2019t, however, ensure an end to false or conspiratorial posts from users going viral, but it\u2019s a start. Nancy Scola has more .    POWER PLAYS AND ELECTIONS    CANADA \u2014 CLIMATE AND CHILD-FOCUSED \u201cTHRONE SPEECH\u201d: The label is misleading given there are no monarchs involved \u2014 just a governor-general, Queen Elizabeth\u2019s representative in Canada, reading out the government\u2019s new legislative agenda. That agenda claims climate measures as its \"cornerstone,\" including proposals to create jobs by retrofitting homes and buildings to be more energy efficient. The government also promised a \"significant, long-term, sustained\" investment in a national early learning and child care system.

US 2020 \u2014 TALKING TO CANDIDATES WHO OPENLY EMBRACE CONSPIRACY : This week\u2019s episode of the Campaign Confidential podcast features two candidates, Mike Cargile , who\u2019s running for a congressional seat in California, and Derrick Grayson , who\u2019s running for Senate in Georgia, as well as POLITICO\u2019s Sabrina Rodriguez, who\u2019s been wading through Spanish language disinformation spreading across Florida. You can read her full piece: \"'This is f---ing crazy': Florida Latinos swamped by wild conspiracy theories.\"    UNITED STATES \u2014 \u201cDEMOCRACIES DO DECLINE\u201d: That piece of wisdom came from  Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and historian Anne Applebaum at the Atlantic Festival on Thursday, as debate swirled around the meaning of President Trump twice suggesting he may not accept the results of the 2020 elections.  Applebaum told an audience pondering America\u2019s role in the world that the country\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic has had a \u201cprofound effect\u201d on global opinion of the country. \u201cThe system itself has been perceived to have failed,\u201d leaving America \u201clooking more like Brazil than Germany,\u201d she said. Applebaum doesn\u2019t think those image problems will disappear under a Biden presidency, chiefly because she thinks the former vice president\u2019s longtime advisers don\u2019t appear to understand how everything has changed globally \u2014 and that there is no going back to America\u2019s previous hegemonic role in the world.   Who\u2019s stepping into the void? While \u201cthe only (Western) body that even has that capability is the European Union,\u201d it\u2019s all appetite and no action from Europe, said Applebaum. No single country except China could fill the void. So either a new community of democracies needs to coalesce, or it\u2019s China assuming charge. Case in point:  The EU\u2019s failure to impose sanctions on Belarus lays bare its weakness, the New York Times concluded.   EU \u2014 HOW HUNGARY\u2019S VIKTOR ORB\u00c1N BROKE THE EU, AND GOT AWAY WITH IT: POLITICO\u2019s Lily Bayer details how Orb\u00e1n managed to keep his hands on billions of EU funds (often funneled towards his connections), while spending the last decade dismantling or twisting Hungary\u2019s democratic infrastructure, built up over the previous 20 years of post-Soviet democracy. Orb\u00e1n has been enabled by Europe\u2019s largest political group \u2014 the center-right European People\u2019s Party to which he belongs \u2014 despite growing efforts to boot him. Last year, the think tank Freedom House downgraded its assessment of Hungary to \u201cpartly free,\u201d due to \u201csustained attacks on the country\u2019s democratic institutions.\u201d   SWITZERLAND \u2014 REFERENDUM ON OPEN BORDERS WITH EU COUNTRIES: In a Sunday vote initiated by the right wing populist Swiss Peoples\u2019 party, the Swiss will decide whether to void their freedom of movement arrangements with Brussels. The initiative is expected to fail , with polls showing opposition running near 60 percent.   ETHIOPIA \u2014 OPPOSITION FIGURES CHARGED WITH TERRORISM: Opposition leader and media mogul Jawar Mohammed  faced terrorism charges in court Monday, along with 22 others. Mohammed is a critic of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed \u2014 who won last year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize \u2014  and wants the government to grant more autonomy for the country\u2019s ethnically diverse regions. Mohammed has also waged a campaign against Ahmed\u2019s decision to delay an election due in August, supposedly because of the coronavirus.     INSTITUTIONALIZED    EU TECH LOBBYING BAN IN THE CARDS? Big Tech companies should be banned from lobbying EU lawmakers if their CEOs keep refusing to testify before the European Parliament, warned St\u00e9phanie Yon-Courtin, a French member of parliament  from Emmanuel\u2019s Macron\u2019s centrist party. Key EU lawmakers want a hearing with Facebook\u2019s Zuckerberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos , Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook , an idea the Renew Europe politician has championed since July , after U.S. lawmakers grilled the four CEOs.     A message from Bank of America:     \u201cThe economics of climate change solutions have been shifting for the better. This problem used to be very expensive to address.

That\u2019s bad news for anyone hoping for a full regulatory reckoning with Silicon Valley\u2019s and Seattle\u2019s giants over their monopolistic tendencies.  Washington lawmakers see their job as protecting the consumer first and foremost, while Brussels wants to make sure other companies are allowed to compete with the incumbents. Sadly for Europe, the Americans have all the power but their approach is unlikely to produce radical change (as my Opinion colleague Tara Lachapelle wrote this week).  That isn\u2019t to say the European Union is wasting its time in leading the charge against Big Tech. Congress\u2019s grilling last week of the chief executives of Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. showed that the \u201cBrussels Effect\u201d is in full force. The EU plays an outsized role when it comes to regulation because other regions \u2014 even the Americans \u2014 tend to follow its lead. Up to a point, at least.  As U.S. lawmakers made the case against the West Coast giants, time and again their arguments echoed efforts already well underway in Europe. When the Democratic Representative David Cicilline tackled the way Google displays news snippets in search results without reimbursing the publishers, he evoked new copyright laws proposed by the EU last year.  For two years Brussels has been looking at whether Amazon uses its marketplace data to compete unfairly with the sellers on its website; that\u2019s now a hot topic on Capitol Hill too. The market power of Apple\u2019s App Store and of virtual assistants such as Siri and Alexa, both of which are the subject of new EU investigations, were also on Congress\u2019s agenda.  Tackling companies with combined annual revenue of $782 billion, more than the gross domestic product of Switzerland, is a huge challenge, meaning competition authorities benefit from the work that\u2019s already been done elsewhere. Even the British Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s study of the digital-advertising market got a shout out from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who cited the agency\u2019s findings on Google\u2019s dominant market share.  The European Commission does have the legal authority to try to break companies up, but no one thinks it would ever try this on a U.S. company. The political blowback would be too severe. The Americans could themselves seek breakups, and would have the power to do so, but their antitrust regime has different priorities. While the problems \u2014 and the levels of exasperation at the cavalier behavior of the companies \u2014 might be the same, the types of punishment that lawmakers have in mind are different, according to Nicolas Petit, the joint chair in competition law at the European University Institute.  That\u2019s because American antitrust law focuses on the interests of the consumer \u2014 primarily around pricing \u2014 while Europe considers the broader market dynamics and effect on competition. While Vestager probably wants to foster the creation of a company that could counterbalance Google and Facebook\u2019s might in search and social media, her U.S. peers only worry if the impact of their dominance is detrimental to consumers.  That narrower American focus limits the likelihood of far-reaching action, says Tommaso Valletti, the head of Imperial College London\u2019s Department of Economics and Public Policy, and a former chief competition economist at the European Commission. \u201cThe U.S. has, de facto, abdicated any enforcement for 20 years in this area,\u201d he told me.  In her submission to the House of Representatives\u2019 antitrust subcommittee, Vestager called for \u201ccommon\u201d policy responses, according to a document obtained by the website Euractiv. It\u2019s an admirable goal and should be the logical conclusion of investigations tackling many of the same topics. It\u2019s also a pipe dream.

Congress is considering proposals to rein in social media's harvesting of personal information, as Europe has done, and redefine social media companies as publishers, thus making them legally responsible for what they disseminate. There is even a suggestion to give newspapers and other news media outlets the power to crack down on the pilfering of their content by social media.</p><p>Facebook has been particularly criticized for what it has done (distributing the personal data of its users without their knowledge) and what it has failed to do (stopping the disinformation campaigns of Russia and other adversary nations in U.S. elections).</p><p> In a recent op-ed column, one of Facebook's congressional critics, Josh Hawley, a freshman Republican senator from Missouri, wondered whether \"maybe we'd be better off if Facebook disappeared.\"</p><p> Certainly, Facebook, Instagram and President Trump's personal favorite, Twitter, provide entertainment and a convenient way for people to keep up with family, friends and the famous. But these social media platforms also seem to bring out the worst in people, whether it's being self-absorbed or bullying the weak or rushing to judgment based on unfiltered falsehoods.</p><p> Hawley writes that in order for these companies to be profitable, their business model depends on \"constantly developing new schemes to hijack their users' neural circuitry.\" In other words, to addict people on posting to these platforms and reading what other people post. Anyone who doubts the addicting qualities of social media must have their own heads stuck in their smartphones.</p><p> As with most addictions, the result is usually not good. \"For all social media's supposed wizardry 'connecting' us to content and to each other,\" writes Hawley, \"we're not a more literate or more social nation thanks to social media. We are not a happier or kinder one. We are, in fact, more impoverished, lonely and despairing.\"</p><p> Are we content to stay in that dreadful state that the gentleman from Missouri describes, or are we willing to do something about it?\u2008Hopefully federal regulators have reached the point where they're going to take action on behalf of the public good.</p><p> Such action is needed because individuals are not likely to disconnect on their own from the psychological hold that they've been manipulated into by Facebook and its ilk.
