The firm named Katie Haun, a former DOJ prosecutor, to help manage the fund, becoming the firm's first female general partner.

The new grading system, which may go into effect as soon as next year, \"reflects the Fed's uneasiness with surprising bankers and financial markets with bad news\" and \"demonstrates how Fed officials have grownmore comfortable with big banks' risk-managementchops.\"</p><p>David takes on Goliath: \"A handful of upstart advisers are challenging investment banks on turf once thought impenetrable: the $7 billion-a-year business of handling complex stock-related transactions,\" the paper reports. \"Without underwriting or trading arms, these advisers say they can giveunbiased judgmentand help clients wrangle a horde of hungry bankers. Their pitch is resonating, especially in Silicon Valley, where finance departments tend to be less robust and more suspicious of Wall Street.\"</p><p>Financial Times</p><p>Welcome aboard: HSBC has hired Ewen Stevenson away from Royal Bank of Scotland to be its chief financial officer, the \"first significant management appointmentunder the bank's new leadership team.\" He will succeed Iain Mackay, who is retiring after eight years on the job.

The Court's ruling couldshield tech platforms from litigationif plaintiffs cannot prove that both sides of a two-sided market are being harmed by the platform's practices.\"</p><p>But Big Tech could face antitrust concerns on other fronts, namely the ban by Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft on cryptocurrency ads, which \"threaten the fledgling industry's existence,\" Mark Epstein, an antitrust attorney, writes in a Journal op-ed. All four companies offer online or peer-to-peer payment services, which compete against digital exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance. \"In effect, four of the eight largest companies in the world control an online-advertising oligopoly and aredenying competitors accessto these services,\" Epstein says.</p><p>Big money: Speaking of cryptocurrency, Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, said it has raised $300 million to back blockchain and cryptocurrency-related ideas, including investing in digital currencies directly. The firm named Katie Haun, a former DOJ prosecutor, to help manage the fund, becoming the firm's first female general partner. She said she would help the company \"foster responsible innovation and strike the right balance between innovation and regulation.\"Wall Street Journal,Financial Times,New York Times</p><p>Wall Street Journal</p><p>Failure is not an option: The Federal Reserve is moving toward getting rid of pass-or-fail grades on bank stress tests and replacing them with a public capital ratio that the bank must meet. The new grading system, which may go into effect as soon as next year, \"reflects the Fed's uneasiness with surprising bankers and financial markets with bad news\" and \"demonstrates how Fed officials have grownmore comfortable with big banks' risk-managementchops.\"</p><p>David takes on Goliath: \"A handful of upstart advisers are challenging investment banks on turf once thought impenetrable: the $7 billion-a-year business of handling complex stock-related transactions,\" the paper reports. \"Without underwriting or trading arms, these advisers say they can giveunbiased judgmentand help clients wrangle a horde of hungry bankers. Their pitch is resonating, especially in Silicon Valley, where finance departments tend to be less robust and more suspicious of Wall Street.\"</p><p>Financial Times</p><p>Welcome aboard: HSBC has hired Ewen Stevenson away from Royal Bank of Scotland to be its chief financial officer, the \"first significant management appointmentunder the bank's new leadership team.\" He will succeed Iain Mackay, who is retiring after eight years on the job.

The announcement came amidst the ongoing trade war between the U.S and some of its biggest sources of imports. During a press conference held in Chicago, Powell assured the public that the Fed is aware and monitoring current economic developments and will act accordingly to sustain the near-record economic expansion.[1]The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S...00, and the Nasdaq all rebounded today, each closing up over 2%; the Dow added 511 points. These index increases come as a sigh of relief after a lackluster May for the market as many stocks felt the ramifications of the heated trade rhetoric.The positive news from the central bank was accompanied by China easing the tensions of the trade war. </p><p>A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement that the trade dispute should be handled with 'dialogue and consultation.'[2] They followed up the statement by pointing out that these talks would need to be conducted with 'respect, equality, and mutual benefit.'The report comes after both sides recently escalated the dispute through threats of cutting off needed resources. The tariffs President Trump threatened to issue on some Mexican goods were followed by Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard stating that he believed the two countries could find common ground.[3] The positive news lead to a surge in stocks that previously fell victim to the trade war rhetoric such as General MotorsGM[4] and Ford F[5]. Major tech companies also felt the impact of the news and here are the ones to be most attentive to.AppleOn Monday, AppleAAPL[6] announced upcoming product launch plans at its Worldwide Developer Conference. The company showcased new features it developed for iPhones, as well as its newest Mac Pro, which it presented as its most powerful computer to date. The highlight of the conference was the company's new tool, 'sign in with Apple.' It provides developers the option to add to apps that would allow users to log in without the creation of a username and password. According to Apple, this option doesn't gather any personal information from the user. This feature distinguishes Apple from companies like Facebook[7], who are under scrutiny because of the lack of privacy it gives users. Shares of AAPL have gained 9.86% year-to-date, and the stock currently sits at a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank.FacebookFacebook FB[8] has been under investigation for its privacy policies because of the data it collects from its users. Shares of the company took a hit Monday as antitrust regulation fears impacted the market; government threats to investigate big tech companies for violations of antitrust laws have made investors wary of delving into big tech stocks. Despite possibly facing regulatory sanctions from the government, analysts don't believe it will affect the company's fundamentals.[9] Many analysts also don't believe that the regulators will come down as hard as many perceive. Breaking up these tech conglomerates is unlikely[10] as these investigations are in their early stages. This analyst sentiment as well as some positive estimate revision and Facebook's Estimated Long-Term EPS Growth Rate of +20.20% give the social media giant a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank. The company is also projected to see year-over-year earnings growth of +9.20% for the current fiscal quarter.Today's Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?

It is the lowest level that we have seen since May of last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now we are going to hear from the Fed. We are seconds away from the latest Beige Book report on the economy. We have an all-star panel standing by to react. There we go.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's go to Peter Barnes with the breaking news. Peter?</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, hi, Melissa, the 12 Federal Reserve banks reported modest to moderate economic growth in this latest survey of economic conditions. This is the Beige Book that the Fed will use at its next policy meeting at the end of this month when it is expected to end its latest round of quantitative easing.</p><p>I looked through the report to find -- check on some of the issues that are concerning investors right know exports, for example, to Europe and oil supplies and prices. And I did find this reference from the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank. It said, \"That manufacturing firms there seeing lower production attributed it to seasonal factors or declining exports.\"</p><p>On excess supplies of crude oil, the Beige Book does report on that and uses the term, \"excess supplies\" reporting on its context in the period up to October 6th. It says, \"Oil exploration activity increased in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.\" and of course the Minneapolis District does include those big shale oil reserves in North Dakota.</p><p>But, again, this information was all collected before October 6th. We've had a lot happened since then. The Dow down, 1,000 points since October 6th unclear how these latest developments in the markets will affect Fed policy making at the end of this month.</p><p>Melissa?</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, Peter Barnes reporting in disguise there. Thank you so much. Let's get to the market reaction right now.</p><p>It has been a rough run today. The Dow diving more than 400 points, so now we're down 420. When we came on the air a few seconds ago we were down 400. We're all over the map today. It is the steepest drop in more than three years. One of the big reasons, Ebola. Let's get you up to speed on the very latest on that one that caused the free fall this morning.</p><p>A second person contracted Ebola in the U.S. The patient has not yet been identified but it has been confirmed that the health care worker did travel by air before experiencing any symptoms of the deadly disease, the beginning of this week that was. The president is set to meet with cabinet leaders in just over an hour from now. They're going to discuss the government's response to this growing crisis.</p><p>Let's bring in today's panel. We have Fox Business's Charlie Gasparino, the Wall Street Journal's James Freeman is with us and co-founder of WhoWeUse, Spencer Ante is here as well.</p><p>Charlie?</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: I would say part of the drop that's going down and every time we take eye an off the markets, it goes down.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right, it.</p><p>GASPARINO: And what do we have now, right?</p><p>FRANCIS: It's amazing. 420.</p><p>GASPARINO: To the point.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: . I think some of the drop right now is attributed, I think, to David Asman's report earlier that Richard Fisher.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>GASPARINO: . now he's a hawk but David reported exclusively that Fisher has ruled out QE. Look at it this way.</p><p>FRANCIS: Way too premature is what he said.</p><p>GASPARINO: . is that he's way too -- yes, way too -- so it means it's not going to happen anytime soon. Here is what the market loves. The market loves printing money. It knows that the global economy isn't doing so well. There's lots of fears out there. This is not a good environment to be owning stocks if the Fed is not going to ease.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think David Asman's going to be out later with more on that report. I just want to give you a couple of the headlines that are coming from David Asman's conversation with Fisher saying that the market correction doesn't mean the economy is in trouble. What do you think about that one, James Freeman?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND WHOWEUSE CO-FOUNDER: Well, I think that this is an issue we've talked about recently where he's trying to, I think, partly get out in front of his Fed colleagues. He knows a lot of them do not have market experience. And as academics, they can get rattled a bit.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's terrifying.</p><p>FREEMAN: . they can get rattled a bit sort of like Geithner was during the crisis where people on the street would whisper to him scary stuff without the experience to know he would kind of overreact. And I think that's what Fisher may be concerned about with some of his Fed colleagues.</p><p>GASPARINO: Do you think the economy is getting better? I mean.</p><p>FREEMAN: Slowly, yes, I do. And I think his point -- what Fisher, I think he's right on the money.</p><p>FRANCIS: You know, wait, wait, wait, I mean, let me stop you right there because you look at the data that's coming out of Germany, you look at the data that's coming out of China...</p><p>GASPARINO: Not good.</p><p>FRANCIS: . it seems like globally, I don't know, it feels like something has happened, something has shifted and we aren't all of a sudden getting better the way they were. You don't agree with that?</p><p>FREEMAN: I agree. Europe is depressing. I think the U.S. economy is still plugging along.</p><p>SPENCER ANTE, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: I agree with that. I think China is slowing down and Europ is slowing down but the U.S. is the main bright spot in the global economy. And.</p><p>FRANCIS: But how can we keep this lower.</p><p>GASPARINO: It's not going to last.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. How can we keep this going.</p><p>GASPARINO: I will say this.</p><p>FRANCIS: . if they're staggering.</p><p>GASPARINO: Let's bring this politically.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: One thing that Hillary Clinton is -- what she's worried about, big time, is the fact that economies generally -- economic cycles generally run in seven years. And seven year for this economic cycle is coming to an end.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah, but this isn't a normal cycle. It's been such slow growth.</p><p>GASPARINO: That is -- I know, that's the counter argument.</p><p>FREEMAN: Normally, I mean, it's different from so many other good.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>FREEMAN: . recoveries. So I wouldn't expect them.</p><p>GASPARINO: But we do know. But you don't know.</p><p>FREEMAN: . to be similar in that way.</p><p>FRANCIS: I want to -- Let's talk specifically about this big move that we've seen today because it is staggering.</p><p>Charlie, there were a lot of folks talking earlier today about maybe a Hedge Fund liquidation.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yeah, I mean, listen, here's the thing. You had that Shire deal, the Shire -- there was that.</p><p>FREEMAN: AbbVie.</p><p>GASPARINO: . AbbVie, right. Now that deal, this is a little technical, but here's what happened. A lot of people -- a lot of arbs got in that deal, meaning professional traders who bet the deal would happen. So they would go along the stock that was being bought. In short, the stock that was being sold, that was the acquirer.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>GASPARINO: . and guess what happened? That deal didn't happen. So all those arbs got crushed and what they did was they sold stock and they went into bonds. That's why you saw the 10-year go down on basis points and on the yield on 10-year go down.</p><p>My bigger point is this, deals like this generally screw up when the economy and the markets are insane.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.</p><p>ANTE: And so obviously the bad news is outweighing good news in the market right now. But one bit of good news is that oil and gas prices are falling.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, no, that's not good news. That's not good news.</p><p>ANTE: No, that is good news. Let's not over think this.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, it's not.</p><p>ANTE: Let me finish my point.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>ANTE: Seventy percent of consumers spending in the U.S. economy -- of GDP comes your consumer spending. When oil prices and gas prices go down, it puts more people in money's pockets and they use.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: That's a good side of it. The bad side of it is the reason why it's happening.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: . it's because there is a global slowdown going down.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: Look at what's happening.</p><p>ANTE: There's a global increase in supply of oil because of better technology.</p><p>GASPARINO: There's never any good -- there's never any</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: All of a sudden, out of nowhere? No. There's a shrinking of demand in China, in Europe and that's why.</p><p>ANTE: Supply is the big factor here.</p><p>GASPARINO: Let me ask you a question. Why is it then that every time we get a lousy print, GDP print, from overseas, price of oil goes down? I mean, it's totally.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's the precall that we've seen.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yes?</p><p>FREEMAN: But the result is a good one. Things get cheaper for all kinds of consumers.</p><p>FRANCIS: The result is a good one, but the question is which has the bigger impact? And I don't know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ANTE: . but all these things that's horrible for the economy.</p><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely.</p><p>ANTE: Oil prices are going down. Let's not over think it. It's one of the only bright spots we have right now.</p><p>GASPARINO: But inflation goes down when your economy slows. You know that.</p><p>ANTE: We're not talking about inflation.</p><p>GASPARINO: I'm just saying.</p><p>ANTE: There's deflation.</p><p>FRANCIS: Let's get back to today's market right here. So what are you hearing from folks about this particular selloff right now down 424.</p><p>GASPARINO: A lot of.</p><p>FRANCIS: . does it continue? Is this the bottom? Is this the beginning?</p><p>GASPARINO: Who knows? I mean, yes, I think it continues until the Fed gives us some clarity on rates. whether they do a QE, whether Richard Fisher is obviously overruled. I would say this. When I talk to money managers that deal with high net worth people.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: . but they're getting a lot of calls from their rich clients, they're asking about deflation. There is an issue, there's a little spook on deflation out in the market right now.</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you think about the 10-year? What's the 10-year telling you?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, obviously there's a lot of fear and we've talked about fundamentals.</p><p>FRANCIS: Here it is right here.</p><p>FREEMAN: . you talk about Germany, you talk about Europe, not seeming to be sliding back into recession. U.S. consumer spending also is not good. But I think Ebola is also part of the fear factor today.</p><p>FRANCIS: Without question.</p><p>FREEMAN: Why shouldn't it be?</p><p>ANTE: I talked to a broker at JPMorgan, (Piven Kline) yesterday and they're actually advising their clients to buy into these dips. So that's just one major bank advising their wealthiest clients that, you know, that don't panic, you know, and that this is an opportunity over the long-term.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you think it's an opportunity?</p><p>FREEMAN: I would discount the Ebola threat. I mean, definitely this is.</p><p>FRANCIS: You would or would not?</p><p>FREEMAN: I would. This is an economic catastrophe in those countries in Africa where tons of.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yeah, but here's why.</p><p>FRANCI: I think they're very easy to overreact to this.</p><p>GASPARINO: I suppose people, at least in a short-term for a quarter, stopped going to movie theaters, stopped flying.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, there's going to be a sizable economic impact because of this. I'm not saying it's real. I'm not saying this is.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. I don't know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Are we away from that because they are talking about this, so now this second person that's contracted in the United States flew on Monday, they're talking about the 132 people that were on the plane with this person when they flew on Monday, tracking them down, who have they have been in contact with. She is now sick. I mean, it's.</p><p>GASPARINO: Melissa, a friend of mine went by the Dallas hub of Newark yesterday and it was empty. OK. I'm just telling you whether it's real, not real, whether we're overblown.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>GASPARINO: . it's having an impact.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really briefly though, I want to point out there is some green on the board. Shares of Time Warner climbing after CEO Jeff Bewkes announcing the company will more than double its earnings over the next several years. I mean, this is one of the stocks that's in the positive zone.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: . that's been getting some attention today. I don't want to totally ignore it.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>ANTE: And also HBO announced it's going to be selling content.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>ANTE: . over the web for the first time ever. It's something that skeptics of Time Warner never thought they would ever do. I think that's a positive sign.</p><p>GASPARINO: I agree. And that story is bigger. That story -- if we didn't have the market going down this much would be the big headline.</p><p>ANTE: I agree.</p><p>GASPARINO: HBO going what's known as over the top is huge game-changer for the cable industry. They're basically saying we're going to bypass cable and we're going to be -- that puts more control.</p><p>ANTE: With the content owners.</p><p>GASPARINO: . with the content owners.</p><p>ANTE: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: And here's the other thing. I think Jeff -- I think Bewkes. Whatever you said.</p><p>FRANCIS: Bewkes. Jeff Bewkes.</p><p>GASPARINO: I think he's a good CEO. Now, I know he turned down the Murdoch deal and, you know, our boss, Mr. Murdoch and he's going to be criticized for that because I don't think he'll be able to live up to his projections here. But low and behold, this guy is basically taking this company, he's squeezing it down and he's going to sell it to somebody.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. We're going to pause for a second.</p><p>FREEMAN: But where is the growth?</p><p>FRANCIS: We have a market right now that's down 395 points. 60 days, that is how long the United Nation says we have to tackle Ebola before it becomes something uncontainable. Do you trust the government to handle it? We are going to be speaking to Dr. Ben Carson on what realistically can be done.</p><p>Plus, how Ebola made its way on to a flight with frontier airlines?</p><p>More \"money,\" more answers. That's the big story. Coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Very steep declines across the board today in the market. The headlines are coming very fast.</p><p>The second Ebola identified. Lousy economic data weighing heavily. We just heard the latest from the Fed's Beige Book.</p><p>Let's go to Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. We also have Jo Ling Kent who is at the Nasdaq.</p><p>Nicole, let me start with you. Wild ride down there today.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: No doubt.</p><p>Melissa, what a wild ride this has been. You're talking about a thousand points that we've lost since last Wednesday's close.</p><p>Right now the Dow is down 380 points. We had been down 460 points, roughly a little less than that. And so you are seeing a broad-based selloff here. Everything is for sale. People are a little too nervous to take the risk. There's also some margin calls that maybe involved as well. But we are seeing some stocks that are shaving off some key numbers off the Dow Jones Industrial average.</p><p>So, three names, Goldman Sachs, Visa and Boeing actually accounting for about 100 points of the Dow's 375 points right now. So we can see Goldman down 3.7 percent, Visa down 2.6 percent and Boeing down 3.9 percent. It's also worth noting that Boeing itself is at a new low but big picture here, you're seeing all the major averages into negative territory for the year. The Dow, Nasdaq and the S&amp;P, it's only the transports that's really heading on. The Russell also has been negative for this year. But transports had a tough October, don't forget, but still positive for the year.</p><p>So the selling is broad-based, energy, financials, health care weak. Yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, Jo, what are you seeing?</p><p>JO LING KEN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're looking at those big large caps, tech stocks of course here at the Nasdaq. They're all not doing terribly well here.</p><p>Take a look at Intel. Itself is down about 5 percent. It's shaving seven points off the Nasdaq composite right now. Vodafone also down quite a bit, one of the top losers of the hour here, Microsoft down as well as Expedia down 4 percent and of course apple down 2.6 percent, really dragging down some of these big tech stocks.</p><p>But although the Nasdaq overall right now is negative, the Nasdaq 100 continues to be positive just slightly for the year. So we're looking at all kinds of different global growth issues here. But Nasdaq 100 remains a silver lining for now.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. Thank you so much. Thanks to both of you.</p><p>Airline stocks reacting after news that a second health care worker to contract Ebola flew a domestic flight from Cleveland to Dallas just two days ago. We are learning that the victim did have a low-grade fever when she was traveling on that flight. Although the carrier which was Frontier Airlines has disinfected the plane, twice. Could this be a real threat to travelers?</p><p>Joining me now is Tom Sullivan he is our resident pilot, we also have Charlie Gasparino and James Freeman back us.</p><p>Tom, let me start with you. What do you think about that?</p><p>TOM SULLIVAN, FOX BUSINESS: Well, the airlines say they disinfect the plane but really what they do is they vacuum and they clean the pockets out of -- so that when you get on the plane, the people that left their junk. It's not fair.</p><p>FRANCIS: You don't think they got on there with hazmat suits? And really like.</p><p>FREEMAN: . before cleaning on this one.</p><p>SULLIVAN: But full cleaning, what's full cleaning? We got these hazmat people. They have don't have hazmat people. They just have cleaners and they spray a little Lysol and wiped down the mirrors. That's all they do.</p><p>GASPARINO: Does Lysol kill Ebola? I mean, you know, part of the problem is we're not doctors.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: And I will say this. This just shows the folly and why the markets are trading low with all this baloney about the screenings. I mean, people can get through those screenings by lying, by taking Tylenol, if they have a fever so the fever goes down.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: If you really want to get through these screenings. It's like.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not only that.</p><p>GASPARINO: It's like -- I mean like say Ramzi Yousef got through a screening. That's.</p><p>FRANCIS: But the information that's being released changes because first we hear she flew but she had no symptoms. Now, we're hearing, \"She flew but she had a temperature of 99.5.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: . she was on the plane with 132 other passengers, you know, I mean it's -- this is what is making people so concerned and why it feels out of control.</p><p>SULLIVAN: These are medical people that should know that she was part of a group that was being monitored. She should know that you can't go traveling just like Dr. Nancy Snyderman should have known. What's wrong with these people? They're the professionals.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, James, go ahead.</p><p>FREEMAN: There's an argument that she shouldn't have traveled but we should remember that based on everything we know to this point, it is not that easy to transmit it. The two health care workers, it is concerning, you want to know everything how it happened but this is not like the flu. This is not like.</p><p>FRANCIS: It's not going to come here. You can't get it. It's not.</p><p>GASPARINO: James, I talked to doctors, OK, it's a lot harder to get than the flu because it is not really airborne.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: It's a lot easier to get, as I said, than hep C and AIDS. It's somewhere in the middle. There is a degree where casual contact does transmit this thing.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: . we talk to doctors off the record.</p><p>FREEMAN: Here's the deal.</p><p>GASPARINO: . and that's a problem.</p><p>FREEMAN: OK. But you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Why is the U.S. saying that we have 60 days to get a hold of this thing before it gets really out of control?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, this points the issue of why you really don't want them to cut off air travel right now because the best way to fight this is to keep airplanes going in and out of West Africa to bring people with knowledge and skills.</p><p>SULLIVAN: No. I absolutely disagree.</p><p>FRANCIS: In and out? I mean, maybe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead, Tom.</p><p>SULLIVAN: . then have the military fly them in, have charter flights bring them in but you don't need to put them on United Airlines and have them mix in with the populace.</p><p>GASPARINO: Listen, I mean, there's a part of me that does not want to like raise the specter of Armageddon here. I mean, that is an issue. I agree with James on that point. But I will tell you this, they don't know a lot about this disease. If you talk to doctors off the record, they really aren't sure about just how casual the contact has to be to catch it. So what does that mean? I mean, this is where this becomes an economic.</p><p>FRANCIS: Hang on. Hang on. You talk about cleaning the plan. The Frontier Airlines says Flight 1143, that was the number by the way, received a thorough cleaning per our normal procedures which is consistent with CDC guidelines prior to returning to service the next day. It was also cleaned again the next day in Cleveland.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yeah.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, but the flight came in around 6:00 at night. She shows up at midnight and says, \"I've got a problem here.\" So the plane that night overnighted in Dallas. So they went and again, they washed it down, they vacuumed. I'm sorry. I don't think that is the same. And the question then becomes did she use the restroom? Did she cough? Who was sitting next to her? Who was sitting in front and behind her? Those kinds of things, again, we don't know if she did in fact sneezed during the flight? We don't know.</p><p>FREEMAN: OK. There's a lot we don't know and it's true, there's very little in the medical literature. But everything we do know.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>FREEMAN: . so far is you don't get it by being in a room or playing with people's.</p><p>GASPARINO: James, James, James.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>GASPARINO: The woman got it from taking off her hazmat suit. I know that.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right.</p><p>FREEMAN: We're not sure how those.</p><p>FRANCIS: We got to go. We're going to have more on this later. I want to tell you right now. The market is down 331 points. So we are still down - - right. We are off the lows of the session. We've been down more than 400 points at the start of the show. Gaining back a little bit of ground, but we've seen this back and forth all day.</p><p>And a reminder that President Obama is meeting with White House officials today at three 3:30 to discuss the U.S. government's actions against ongoing Ebola threat. Fox Business will monitor this. We are going to bring you the remarks as we get them.</p><p>And the Fox Business exclusive scoop, David Asman is going to join us next with what the Fed is telling him directly. We're the only ones with this information.</p><p>Plus, plummeting oil prices may feel good at the pumps. But we're going to tell you who it's really going to hurt. In fact, we could be seeing it happen right now.</p><p>More \"money\" coming up. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK</p><p>FRANCIS: Extreme declines for stocks. The Dow and the S&amp;P down more than 2 percent.</p><p>Our very own, David Asman has been speaking exclusively with Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, he joins us now. Charlie and James are back as well.</p><p>You have new headlines right now?</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Well, this is -- the back story of this conversation that I had with Richard Fisher was of course he is reluctant about going on air but he and I have relationships and he said -- and I told him -- I said, \"Charlie Gasparino, Steve Forbes, a lot of people are wondering.</p><p>GASPARINO: Then he said, \"Who the hell is Charlie Gasparino?\"</p><p>ASMAN: . are wondering whether there's going to be another QE as a result of this market downturn.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>ASMAN: He wanted to be absolutely clear that you could have a market downturn without having any need for QE. And he also wanted to be clear that it wasn't just him saying that.</p><p>FRANCIS: This is a big news right here. Go ahead.</p><p>ASMAN: He specifically said, whether it's me, Janet Yellen or the head of the European central bank and he spelled out to me Draghi, Draghi specifically, because there is a lot of pressure on Draghi right now to do a QE sort of thing in Europe. Draghi has been resisting and according to Richard Fisher, Draghi agrees with him that there's no need for QE that you can have a functioning economy without a QE. And in fact it's up to the politicians.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>ASMAN: . to do what's necessary to spur growth, not the central bank.</p><p>FRANCIS: This banner on the bottom of the screen right now is big. So I want to emphasize this. So he said to you that Yellen also agrees.</p><p>ASMAN: He said.</p><p>FRANCIS: . there is no need.</p><p>ASMAN: . whether it's me, Janet Yellen, the head of the European Central Bank and this is interesting, he wanted to make sure I got in the governor of the Bank of India. Apparently, there's been some questions whether India is going to through QE. He said, \"We do not need more monetary stimulus.\"</p><p>GASPARINO: OK. He basically ruled out Yellen doing a QE4.</p><p>ASMAN: He did. Well, what he did is he said that Janet Yellen and he agree on the fact that what's necessary for growth is fiscal reform, not monetary policy right now.</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you think of that?</p><p>FREEMAN: This is the best news we've heard all day, right? I mean, the.</p><p>ASMAN: Not with the market necessarily.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: It should be. Maybe not for every trader at this moment but generally, if there's now a realization that monetary policy can't do it, more money printing can't do it, you have to reform -- and this is the big problem in Europe.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: . and more so than the U.S. They have not reformed their economies.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right. You see, I.</p><p>FREEMAN: . that's why we're headed back.</p><p>GASPARINO: I'll be honest with you. I don't doubt that he said -- I know he said that to you. I doubt that Yellen is not.</p><p>FRANCIS: Sticks to that.</p><p>GASPARINO: Listen, think of it this way. She's President Obama's puppet to a certain extent.</p><p>ASMAN: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: What does President Obama have in two years? He really wants to say, \"I took the market from six to 17.\" And without QE, this thing, I know it's bouncing back a little, actually it's going down again. This market.</p><p>ASMAN: Because you're talking.</p><p>GASPARINO: This market is not a very healthy market without more stimulus either by keeping rates where they are or doing another.</p><p>ASMAN: However, Janet Yellen is on record saying we do not take our cues from the stock market. If you believe that, perhaps as Charlie would say I've got a bridge in Brooklyn but that's what both she and Ben Bernanke have said. A lot of people disagree. In fact, Jon Hilsenrath who I have on in the 4:00 hour by the way to talk about all this did say -- he's the first person to say that they are looking for market cues.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>ASMAN: . the Fed is.</p><p>FRANCIS: But you and I both noticed earlier today Keith McCullough from Hedgeye was on and he shared something that that was very -- about this market that at some point, you know, the world realizes that zero plus zero doesn't equal anything greater than zero. Why did you like that?</p><p>ASMAN: Well, because of that fact that we've got close to zero interest rates. You can't have more zero interest rates create something else.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>ASMAN: I mean, the zero interest rates haven't worked to help.</p><p>GASPARINO: OK. We know that but that.</p><p>ASMAN: We need fiscal reform.</p><p>GASPARINO: But some of this -- listen, of course and that -- those are two arguments though but there's a political argument. Can Hillary Clinton run in 2016 with Dow 12,000?</p><p>ASMAN: Good question.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, all right.</p><p>ASMAN: Good question, Charlie.</p><p>FRANCIS: We're going to pause for a second. The search is on for a vaccine as the second person in the U.S. contracts Ebola. One of the nation's prominent research centers is on the hunt for a cure.</p><p>Plus, fears over the virus stirring a national debate. Dr. Ben Carson is here to sound off on the Ebola threat that it's facing the nation right now.</p><p>We've got a lot more. \"Piles of Money\" coming up. Don't go anywhere.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: The very latest now on Ebola. The CDC director speaking just moments ago.</p><p>Richard Edson is here with all of the headlines. Rich, what did you hear?</p><p>RICHARD EDSON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, Melissa, this is about a second confirmation of a case when testing positive, another health care worker at that Dallas hospital. She also flew on a flight from Cleveland to Dallas on October 13th so did showing symptoms on the 14th, CDC said she should have never flown and now they're implementing new procedures, they say, to prevent people because she did have contact with that first patient, Thomas Eric Duncan. And now the CDC saying it's also working with that hospital on its protocols.</p><p>DR. TOM FRIEDEN, CDC DIRECTOR: We're working very closely with the hospital in Dallas to promote a safe environment for the care of everyone at that hospital for the patients and for the health care workers. We have continued with our intensive investigation and interventions to understand what may have happened and to increase safety.</p><p>EDSON: This is the first live test of an Ebola vaccine every happening right here at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. They're testing a number of patients. This timeline at least for the initial stage its suppose to take until December that might seem like a long time but as doctors here say, that timeline has been moved up dramatically.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COL. SHON REMICH, WRAIR: Once the regulatory agency say that this is safe to move on to phase two then we'll progress from there. So the timeline is at this point being compressed but it's unclear when e product actually might hit the market. We took about six weeks to do. It would normally take in about six months.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: Canadian officials developed this. This is now been licensed to new link genetics in American based company. There's also another effort going on nearby at the National Institutes of Health that's in cooperation with GlaxoSmithKline, so very close here at Maryland, two different institutions, two very well renowned institutions working on a vaccine. I'm not saying racing on another but trying to get this out as quickly as possible.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Rich, thank you so much.</p><p>So with the latest in Ebola, it may seem like the situation is spiraling out of control. The United Nations it turns out would agree. The head of the U.N.'s Ebola Emergency Response says, \"The world as 60 days to get this situation under control or face an unprecedented situation.\" Those are their words.</p><p>Dr. Ben Carson is the former director of pediatric neurosurgery at John Hopkins Hospital, he's also a Fox News contributor and he joins me now. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>Let me ask you, what does that mean?</p><p>DR. BEN CARSON, FMR. JOHN HOPKINS HOSPITAL: My pleasure.</p><p>FRANCIS: We have 60 days to stop this. What does that mean? What does it look like to have stopped it?</p><p>CARSON: Well, they're just recognizing the exponential potential of this thing to spread. And, you know, it's just like if you take two and then multiply it by two, you keep doing that. It doesn't take you very long to get into some very, very large numbers.</p><p>And so they're just being realistic. You know, we've known for a long time that it had this kind of potential and that's the reason that several weeks ago I said it was a real mistake to bring infected people into this country in any way. Not because we don't have -- no, not because we don't have the protocols.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, now that's happened -- yes. Now that's happened and you mentioned the protocol and that's what they're blaming the situation now in Texas where we see that it has spread. They're calling it a breach in protocol. What do you think happened there?</p><p>CARSON: No. No, the problem is you have human beings. And when you have human beings involved, I don't care how good your protocol is, there are going to be breaches, there are going to be problems because people are not perfect. And, you know, in the case of that most recent person who's infected, flying on a airplane, I wonder if anybody told her that she couldn't fly on airplane. I suspect, probably not. We need to tighten those things up.</p><p>But most importantly right now, the people who have contracted it in this country, we need to determine exactly how they contracted it and we need to make sure that that door is closed and that no one else can contract it that way. There are some urgency involved there.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, let me ask you about that because now we're learning -- we're finally learning the name, we've heard it but now we're able to share the name of the patient, she's being identified, her name, you could see it there at the bottom of the screen, Amber Vinson. She is the one that flew -- 29 years old, she flew, at the time they thought she had no signs of symptoms, now we're learning that she had a temperature of 99.5 degrees, she flew on that flight 1193 from Cleveland to Dallas Fort Worth.</p><p>What is the danger in flying on a plane, Dr. Carson? Because we have heard a lot of debate about that that it's hard to get it, it's not just if she sneezes, it's not that big of a deal that she was on a plane. Other people as we've seen in the market today are worried. Where do you come down?</p><p>CARSON: Well, we don't have any evidence that it's spread by ways other than, you know, contact with bodily fluids. But if one were to be prudent, one we'd look at worse case scenarios and one would plan for worst case scenarios. We seem to always think of best case scenarios and then have to backtrack and say, \"Well, we were wrong.\" And that seems to be a general pattern here.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>CARSON: And that's very problematic.</p><p>FRANCIS: And speaking of that, I mean the CDC is saying now that they were not monitoring her at the time, when she showed these symptoms, when her temperature went up, when she got on this plane with more than a hundred other people, she was not being monitored. Does that make you nervous that there are other people out there right now who have symptoms.</p><p>CARSON: Of course.</p><p>FRANCIS: . who are not being monitored?</p><p>CARSON: Yeah, of course, it makes you very nervous. And, you know, if I were in charge, I would assemble, you know, the experts in this area very, very quickly. And I would say, \"Look guys and gals, you know, we need to figure out within a day or two.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>CARSON: . what we should be doing with all these people who have been exposed and we need to implement that right now.\" This is not a time for a great debate.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Can I ask you personally? I mean, how concerned are you personally? Are you flying on planes? Are you looking around? Are you concerned?</p><p>CARSON: I am flying on planes a lot but believe me, I wash my hands a lot, you know, if I go into the bathroom, I flush it with a piece of paper in my hand. I don't touch the handle. You have to be careful. There's no question.</p><p>FRANCIS: Dr. Carson, thank you for joining us today. We really appreciate your time.</p><p>CARSON: Always a pleasure.</p><p>FRANCIS: Steep declines for stocks continue right now, although we are down 300 points. We had been down, well, more than 400 so we are well off the lows of the session but still that is a big loss right now. We are hitting the trading floors with the very latest. That is coming up.</p><p>Also, oil flirting with $80 a barrel? You might be surprised who is really losing here. We're going to tell you. Coming up.</p><p>At the end of the day, it is al about \"money\".</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief.</p><p>Japan is recalling nearly 1.7 million vehicles around the world. That includes Corolla and Lexus models, Toyota says it is worried about faulty brakes but it thinks no injuries have occurred so far.</p><p>Gap is making a huge push this holiday season. Employing in extra 63,000 temporary workers, it is one of the largest seasonal hires of any retailer. It is even more than Walmart at the Gap. That is very optimistic.</p><p>And U.S. drug maker AbbVie is reconsidering its takeover of European rival Shire. That is after treasury proposals to severely limit the move of U.S. companies overseas. Investors weren't expecting AbbVie to backtrack and Shire stock sank the most in 12 years.</p><p>That's the latest from the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Stocks coming back off the worst levels of the day at the low. The Dow was down 457 points. Right now, you can see it's down 293 points, that's good by comparison.</p><p>Let's go to Nicole Petallides in the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. China, you know, look at the bright side of this one, Nicole.</p><p>PETALLIDES: Yeah, right, the silver lining. I mean, you're in the 15,000 range at one point right now, Dow nearly 300. You're basically seeing all 10 sectors lower. The Dow is down 1.8 percent right now up off the lows of the day with Visa, Goldman Sachs, Boeing together still accounting for about 85 negative Dow points.</p><p>Also, I want you to take a look at the VIX, the ViX now above the 31 level, right, to move to 31. You can see right now it's up about 20.5 percent. So for the people who bet the VIX, because there are people who'd do that. It is really well.</p><p>But what's interesting, Melissa, as I toss it back to you and I think there and I know they're selling across the board is the question of when people are going to buy. And some are saying there's just not enough fear in the market yet to say, \"I'm ready to get it.\" And so people still seem a little tepid and a little nervous to say, \"I'm going to buy in here.\"</p><p>FRANCIS: Not enough fear in the market.</p><p>PETALLIDES: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, on a daylight, that's an amazing.</p><p>PETALLIDES: An idea like it's almost that there needs to be more of a cleanse, I don't know how many.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Total capitulation. Yeah.</p><p>PETALLIDES: Yeah. All right, Nicole, thank you so much.</p><p>Oil prices down, they are not out there crude dropping all the way to $80 a barrel before climbing back a little bit here. It is been Roscoe oil down 10 percent in the past month alone. You may be surprised whose really getting hurt by cheap oil.</p><p>Let's bring in trader Scott Shellady at the CME, James is here as well.</p><p>I mean, of course this is fantastic news for drivers. Everybody who's filled up lately is very excited about this. We wanted to point to the other side of the trade, because there's some interesting folks in the other side, the most obvious of which is certainly the Saudis.</p><p>Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is talking about the catastrophe in oil prices and the fact that he thinks the Saudi oil minister isn't serious enough and isn't worried enough about this decline.</p><p>Scott, what do you think?</p><p>SCOTT SHELLADY, CME GROUP: I think there's kind of a story underneath here that says they're trying to try that even the U.S. producers out of business. They want to see how low they could go and I think that our numbers are rounded $60 a barrel. They want to push it down there to start to really -- they want to give us some pain. So there is a little bit of a fight under here that we're not really seeing.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>SHELLADY: But I think that there could be something there about pushing it low to hurt us, not them.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, that's an interesting point of view and, James, we'll ask you about that because we were looking at Ali Al-Naimi there on the screen who is the Saudi oil minister next to Prince Alwaleed and, you know, that for shale, so there's been a huge shale revolution here in the U.S. but the breakeven price is said to be $80 to $85 on Brent.</p><p>Do you think it's possible that these guys are trying to drive the shale drillers here in the U.S. out of business?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, you can come up with a lot of theories. Vladimir Putin thinks that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: . this is aimed at him. And I think -- I see a lot of upside here and not just people driving their cars, it's everyone who's using petroleum to create products, so do all kinds of commerce, the people who are hurt the most are not the U.S. frackers there. As we said, Putin's Russia, Venezuela, they all have budgets built on very high oil prices.</p><p>So basically what you're doing is you're squeezing the world's dictators.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: . while you get U.S. consumers in business as a price cut.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, that's a great point. That's a great point. And, Scott, I mean, what do you think about that, because you look at the price decline there. You know, every dollar decline that we see in the price of oil translates to about $2 billion in losses for Putin and for Russia.</p><p>What do you think, Scott?</p><p>SHELLADY: And I think that, you know, I think that that could -- it could be a little bit self-centered on their behalf but at the end of the day, it's about the dollar and I think that oil still is a harbor chair for the economy and the economy is not doing well. I don't think these low oil prices are going to port over to better retail sales and a better economy. I think the reason why -- A lot of the reason why oil is going down is the consumer just doesn't have that money anymore and we've started to see some of these retail sales numbers like today coming in.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>SHELLADY: . a little weak and it's going to continue that way.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>SHELLADY: The worst is yet to come. The worst is yet to come.</p><p>FRANCIS: On that, you know, we're going to leave the segment, thank you so much Scott and James.</p><p>We are keeping a very close eye in the market. The Dow right now is down 302 points. What do you do with your money right now? The trader and the money manager's take. We've got that next.</p><p>You can never have too much \"money\", that is for sure.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Stocks still in the red as the Dow suffers its steepest intraday decline in almost three years.</p><p>Here with some advice for your money is Alan Knuckman from Bulls-eye Options, we also have Dominic Tavella from Diversified Financial</p><p>Dominic, you want to be the voice of reason. Go ahead.</p><p>DOMINIC TAVELLA, DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT: Look, these headlines are scary for people and I'm not really talking about the guys sitting at his office or at home and going, \"I'm going to rebalance my 401K Com, I broke -- let's be reasonable here. There are more people that die in this country from the flu, 25,000 people a year that have died so far. No one, no one's died from Ebola American in this country so far</p><p>The U.S. is growing. We're probably around 3 percent. China, India, growing about 4 percent or 7 percent.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>TAVELLA: . that's 65 percent of the world GDP.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, Alan, I mean that sounds very rational. Why then at the OPEC do we see just a washout?</p><p>ALAN KNUCKMAN, BULLS-EYE OPTION: I think people get a lot of information and have a difficulty processing it. The fundamentals haven't changed just like we stated. Right now, we've got record low interest rates plunging here the 10-year notes, bouncing off at 2 percent. We were worried about rates going up. That's not going to happen. Earning here is still fantastic, oil prices are going down. So all these things are positive fundamentals but the markets get overdone because of psychology, everybody was worried about a selloff.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>KNUCKMAN: . and now they've got something to worry about.</p><p>FRANCIS: Let me challenge you though, are you sure that the fundamentals haven't changed? I mean, you look at the data coming out of Germany, you look at the data coming out of China, there is a slowdown going on elsewhere around the world. How is it not going to be contagious here in the U.S. where we're seeing a bit of growth, but not much? Dominic?</p><p>TAVELLA: So let's focus on energy, right, which I think is a fantastic story. It's estimated that between $75 billion and $100 billion will come back to the consumer because of lower energy prices. That's equal to the Obama tax increase last year. So consumers are going to get that back in their pocket just in time for Christmas, that's going to help our economy.</p><p>FRANCIS: Alan, what do you think about that? I mean, is that enough or it is the reason why oils lower because everything is slowing down around the world and people aren't driving as much because they don't have money and they're not going to out shopping and they're not going out to do things. Go ahead.</p><p>KNUCKMAN: I think it's nothing but a benefit but I think that if you want to look at Europe slowing, that's going to make our markets more attractive in the long-run.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>KNUCKMAN: So from my standpoint, I'm looking at scaling back in here. I was surprised, I didn't think the market could go straight down for three weeks but, you know, I got knocked out following my plan but we can always get back in with a clear head and I think that's where we have to look at here.</p><p>FRANICS: Gentlemen, thanks to both of you.</p><p>No doubt this has been a tough day for the marketer. Our very own Liz Claman is here to give us a preview of what's coming up in the next and most important hour of trading.</p><p>Liz.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: I love to tell you earlier, I said, \"It looks better. It's down 280 points.\"</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: Listen, perspective at the moment.</p><p>FRANCIS: Take improvements.</p><p>CLAMAN: That's exactly what we're going to give you in this final hour in which we know anything can happen. We could see in an acceleration to the downside or we could see a fight back to at least getting closer to the green. So we're going to take you to every index trading floor that matters. We're talking to traders. We're talking of money experts as we look at the markets right now. It is pretty much a mess at the moment. We do have the S&amp;P down 30 points, the Nasdaq down 53. It is truly just a lot of red on the screen but we wouldn't exactly call it a complete capitulation. You were addressing that too.</p><p>So we've got two experts here. One of them runs a fund, the Hennessey Funds which is actually over the past 10 years during which we know there's been so much going on returned an annual live 10 percent. So David Raney is important to hear from right now, he's a good investor. James Bianco of Bianoc Research, he's going to be talking specifically about the technical levels you need to worry about the most and are we seeing capitulation? He is the man to be answering that.</p><p>And at this point, when we have seen the 10-year yield fall below 2 percent earlier today, why not just buy Intel. Look at the Intel yield, 2.8 percent. First on Fox Business interview with the Dow component CEO Brian Krzanich, he is going to come right here on Fox, I'm going to ask him all of this global turmoil. They do 80 percent of their business outside the U.S. Is that going to affect the current quarter? That may mean a lot to all technology investments.</p><p>Plus, they have a brand new phone/tablet, a two in one that just rolled out with ASUS but it's got that Intel chip in it. Wait until you see this thing. It's called the PadFone, we're talking to Brian about all that and so much more at first on Fox Business. See you at the top of the hour.</p><p>FRANCIS: We look forward to it, Liz. Thank you so much.</p><p>CLAMAN: You got it.</p><p>Netflix prepares for earnings, but in these cell streaming device, it could be hurting its bottom-line.</p><p>At the end of the day, it is all about \"money\".</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS: President Obama delaying his fundraising and campaign events today so that he can remain at the White House for a meeting with cabinet members on Ebola just moments ago.</p><p>White House Press Secretary John Earnest saying the president felt like he needed to be in the White House to fulfill his responsibilities. We're going to bring you any updates as we have them. That's a switch from the past by the way.</p><p>Netflix set to report a third-quarter earnings after the Belden stock came session lows after HBO announced it will launch a stand-alone streaming service for next year.</p><p>Our very own Jo Ling Kent is at the Nasdaq, James and Spencer back as well.</p><p>Jo, tell me about Netflix right now. What's it doing?</p><p>KENT: Well, it's down a little less than 1 percent. Now, like you said off the session lows, we're expecting an EPS of 93 cents of share, (inaudible) looking for a revenue of $1.41 billion. But there could be a silver lining here if HBO continues to be competitive to Netflix. Of all the people who are cutting quarters, maybe they'll migrate to Netflix as well.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, interesting. Spencer, what do you think about Netflix after the bell and what do you think about the competition from HBO here?</p><p>ANTE: You know, honestly, I'm surprised that Netflix is not down more than 1 percent and change right now, you know, because HBO is saying they're going over the top is definitely the single biggest new competitor and threat they face when HBO releases that service in 2015.</p><p>So I think that people maybe underestimating the power of.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>ANTE: . this new service.</p><p>FRANCIS: James?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah, I think it suggests maybe questions about whether HBO can execute. As far as Netflix, obviously, they're priced for a lot of growth in the future. They have to pay a lot for programming, whether they can keep that edge in terms of user friendly experience.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: Big question.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Thanks to all three of you. Stay tuned at Fox Business, we're going to have live coverage of Netflix earnings on \"After the Bell\" coming straight after this. That is all we have for now. I hope that you are somehow making money today. The market is down 279. It was much worse earlier. Stay tuned.</p><p>Liz Claman in \"Countdown\" starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

You could see there, the S&amp;P, the biggest loser on a  percentage basis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors rushing to the safety of bonds, the 10-year treasury yield now at  about 2 percent, just higher than that.  It is the lowest level that we  have seen since May of last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now we are going to hear from the Fed.  We are seconds away from the latest  Beige Book report on the economy.  We have an all-star panel standing by to  react.  There we go.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's go to Peter Barnes with the breaking news.  Peter?</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, hi, Melissa, the 12  Federal Reserve banks reported modest to moderate economic growth in this  latest survey of economic conditions.  This is the Beige Book that the Fed  will use at its next policy meeting at the end of this month when it is  expected to end its latest round of quantitative easing.</p><p>I looked through the report to find -- check on some of the issues that are  concerning investors right know exports, for example, to Europe and oil  supplies and prices.  And I did find this reference from the Cleveland  Federal Reserve Bank.  It said, \"That manufacturing firms there seeing  lower production attributed it to seasonal factors or declining exports.\"</p><p>On excess supplies of crude oil, the Beige Book does report on that and  uses the term, \"excess supplies\" reporting on its context in the period up  to October 6th.  It says, \"Oil exploration activity increased in the  Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.\" and of course the  Minneapolis District does include those big shale oil reserves in North  Dakota.</p><p>But, again, this information was all collected before October 6th.  We've  had a lot happened since then.  The Dow down, 1,000 points since October  6th unclear how these latest developments in the markets will affect Fed  policy making at the end of this month.</p><p>Melissa?</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right, Peter Barnes reporting in disguise there.  Thank you  so much.  Let's get to the market reaction right now.</p><p>It has been a rough run today.  The Dow diving more than 400 points, so now  we're down 420.  When we came on the air a few seconds ago we were down  400.  We're all over the map today.  It is the steepest drop in more than  three years.  One of the big reasons, Ebola.  Let's get you up to speed on  the very latest on that one that caused the free fall this morning.</p><p>A second person contracted Ebola in the U.S.  The patient has not yet been  identified but it has been confirmed that the health care worker did travel  by air before experiencing any symptoms of the deadly disease, the  beginning of this week that was.  The president is set to meet with cabinet  leaders in just over an hour from now.  They're going to discuss the  government's response to this growing crisis.</p><p>Let's bring in today's panel.  We have Fox Business's Charlie Gasparino,  the Wall Street Journal's James Freeman is with us and co-founder of  WhoWeUse, Spencer Ante is here as well.</p><p>Charlie?</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  I would say part of the drop  that's going down and every time we take eye an off the markets, it goes  down.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right, it.</p><p>GASPARINO:  And what do we have now, right?</p><p>FRANCIS:  It's amazing.  420.</p><p>GASPARINO:  To the point.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO:  . I think some of the drop right now is attributed, I think, to  David Asman's report earlier that Richard Fisher.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes.</p><p>GASPARINO:  . now he's a hawk but David reported exclusively that Fisher  has ruled out QE.  Look at it this way.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Way too premature is what he said.</p><p>GASPARINO:  . is that he's way too -- yes, way too -- so it means it's not  going to happen anytime soon.  Here is what the market loves.  The market  loves printing money.  It knows that the global economy isn't doing so  well.  There's lots of fears out there.  This is not a good environment to  be owning stocks if the Fed is not going to ease.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I think David Asman's going to be out later with more on that  report.  I just want to give you a couple of the headlines that are coming  from David Asman's conversation with Fisher saying that the market  correction doesn't mean the economy is in trouble.  What do you think about  that one, James Freeman?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND WHOWEUSE CO-FOUNDER:  Well, I  think that this is an issue we've talked about recently where he's trying  to, I think, partly get out in front of his Fed colleagues.  He knows a lot  of them do not have market experience.  And as academics, they can get  rattled a bit.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's terrifying.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . they can get rattled a bit sort of like Geithner was during the  crisis where people on the street would whisper to him scary stuff without  the experience to know he would kind of overreact.  And I think that's what  Fisher may be concerned about with some of his Fed colleagues.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Do you think the economy is getting better?  I mean.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Slowly, yes, I do.  And I think his point -- what Fisher, I think  he's right on the money.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You know, wait, wait, wait, I mean, let me stop you right there  because you look at the data that's coming out of Germany, you look at the  data that's coming out of China...</p><p>GASPARINO:  Not good.</p><p>FRANCIS:  . it seems like globally, I don't know, it feels like something  has happened, something has shifted and we aren't all of a sudden getting  better the way they were.  You don't agree with that?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I agree.  Europe is depressing.  I think the U.S. economy is  still plugging along.</p><p>SPENCER ANTE, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  I agree with that.  I think China  is slowing down and Europ is slowing down but the U.S. is the main bright  spot in the global economy.  And.</p><p>FRANCIS:  But how can we keep this lower.</p><p>GASPARINO:  It's not going to last.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.  How can we keep this going.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I will say this.</p><p>FRANCIS:  . if they're staggering.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Let's bring this politically.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO:  One thing that Hillary Clinton is -- what she's worried about,  big time, is the fact that economies generally -- economic cycles generally  run in seven years.  And seven year for this economic cycle is coming to an  end.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yeah, but this isn't a normal cycle.  It's been such slow growth.</p><p>GASPARINO:  That is -- I know, that's the counter argument.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Normally, I mean, it's different from so many other good.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . recoveries.  So I wouldn't expect them.</p><p>GASPARINO:  But we do know.  But you don't know.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . to be similar in that way.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I want to -- Let's talk specifically about this big move that  we've seen today because it is staggering.</p><p>Charlie, there were a lot of folks talking earlier today about maybe a  Hedge Fund liquidation.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Yeah, I mean, listen, here's the thing.  You had that Shire  deal, the Shire -- there was that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  AbbVie.</p><p>GASPARINO:  . AbbVie, right.  Now that deal, this is a little technical,  but here's what happened.  A lot of people -- a lot of arbs got in that  deal, meaning professional traders who bet the deal would happen.  So they  would go along the stock that was being bought.  In short, the stock that  was being sold, that was the acquirer.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>GASPARINO:  . and guess what happened?  That deal didn't happen.  So all  those arbs got crushed and what they did was they sold stock and they went  into bonds.  That's why you saw the 10-year go down on basis points and on  the yield on 10-year go down.</p><p>My bigger point is this, deals like this generally screw up when the  economy and the markets are insane.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Go ahead.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.</p><p>ANTE:  And so obviously the bad news is outweighing good news in the market  right now.  But one bit of good news is that oil and gas prices are  falling.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No, no, that's not good news.  That's not good news.</p><p>ANTE:  No, that is good news.  Let's not over think this.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No, it's not.</p><p>ANTE:  Let me finish my point.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>ANTE:  Seventy percent of consumers spending in the U.S. economy -- of GDP  comes your consumer spending.  When oil prices and gas prices go down, it  puts more people in money's pockets and they use.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's a good side of it.  The bad side of it is the reason why  it's happening.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  . it's because there is a global slowdown going down.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Look at what's happening.</p><p>ANTE:  There's a global increase in supply of oil because of better  technology.</p><p>GASPARINO:  There's never any good -- there's never any</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  All of a sudden, out of nowhere?  No.  There's a shrinking of  demand in China, in Europe and that's why.</p><p>ANTE:  Supply is the big factor here.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Let me ask you a question.  Why is it then that every time we  get a lousy print, GDP print, from overseas, price of oil goes down?  I  mean, it's totally.</p><p>FRANCIS:  That's the precall that we've seen.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Yes?</p><p>FREEMAN:  But the result is a good one.  Things get cheaper for all kinds  of consumers.</p><p>FRANCIS:  The result is a good one, but the question is which has the  bigger impact?  And I don't know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ANTE:  . but all these things that's horrible for the economy.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Absolutely.</p><p>ANTE:  Oil prices are going down.  Let's not over think it.  It's one of  the only bright spots we have right now.</p><p>GASPARINO:  But inflation goes down when your economy slows.  You know  that.</p><p>ANTE:  We're not talking about inflation.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I'm just saying.</p><p>ANTE:  There's deflation.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Let's get back to today's market right here.  So what are you  hearing from folks about this particular selloff right now down 424.</p><p>GASPARINO:  A lot of.</p><p>FRANCIS:  . does it continue?  Is this the bottom?  Is this the beginning?</p><p>GASPARINO:  Who knows?  I mean, yes, I think it continues until the Fed  gives us some clarity on rates. whether they do a QE, whether Richard  Fisher is obviously overruled.  I would say this.  When I talk to money  managers that deal with high net worth people.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO:  . but they're getting a lot of calls from their rich clients,  they're asking about deflation.  There is an issue, there's a little spook  on deflation out in the market right now.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What do you think about the 10-year?  What's the 10-year telling  you?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, obviously there's a lot of fear and we've talked about  fundamentals.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Here it is right here.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . you talk about Germany, you talk about Europe, not seeming to  be sliding back into recession.  U.S. consumer spending also is not good.   But I think Ebola is also part of the fear factor today.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Without question.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Why shouldn't it be?</p><p>ANTE:  I talked to a broker at JPMorgan, (Piven Kline) yesterday and  they're actually advising their clients to buy into these dips.  So that's  just one major bank advising their wealthiest clients that, you know, that  don't panic, you know, and that this is an opportunity over the long-term.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Do you think it's an opportunity?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I would discount the Ebola threat.  I mean, definitely this is.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You would or would not?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I would.  This is an economic catastrophe in those countries in  Africa where tons of.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Yeah, but here's why.</p><p>FRANCI:  I think they're very easy to overreact to this.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I suppose people, at least in a short-term for a quarter,  stopped going to movie theaters, stopped flying.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I mean, there's going to be a sizable economic impact because  of this.  I'm not saying it's real.  I'm not saying this is.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I don't know.  I don't know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Are we away from that because they are talking about this, so now  this second person that's contracted in the United States flew on Monday,  they're talking about the 132 people that were on the plane with this  person when they flew on Monday, tracking them down, who have they have  been in contact with.  She is now sick.  I mean, it's.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Melissa, a friend of mine went by the Dallas hub of Newark  yesterday and it was empty.  OK.  I'm just telling you whether it's real,  not real, whether we're overblown.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>GASPARINO:  . it's having an impact.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Really briefly though, I want to point out there is some green on  the board.  Shares of Time Warner climbing after CEO Jeff Bewkes announcing  the company will more than double its earnings over the next several years.   I mean, this is one of the stocks that's in the positive zone.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  . that's  been getting some attention today.  I don't want to  totally ignore it.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.</p><p>ANTE:  And also HBO announced it's going to be selling content.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.</p><p>ANTE:  . over the web for the first time ever.  It's something that  skeptics of Time Warner never thought they would ever do.  I think that's a  positive sign.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I agree.  And that story is bigger.  That story -- if we didn't  have the market going down this much would be the big headline.</p><p>ANTE:  I agree.</p><p>GASPARINO:  HBO going what's known as over the top is huge game-changer for  the cable industry.  They're basically saying we're going to bypass cable  and we're going to be -- that puts more control.</p><p>ANTE:  With the content owners.</p><p>GASPARINO:  . with the content owners.</p><p>ANTE:  Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO:  And here's the other thing.  I think Jeff -- I think Bewkes.   Whatever you said.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Bewkes.  Jeff Bewkes.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I think he's a good CEO.  Now, I know he turned down the  Murdoch deal and, you know, our boss, Mr. Murdoch and he's going to be  criticized for that because I don't think he'll be able to live up to his  projections here.  But low and behold, this guy is basically taking this  company, he's squeezing it down and he's going to sell it to somebody.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  We're going to pause for a second.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But where is the growth?</p><p>FRANCIS:  We have a market right now that's down 395 points.  60 days, that  is how long the United Nation says we have to tackle Ebola before it  becomes something uncontainable.  Do you trust the government to handle it?   We are going to be speaking to Dr. Ben Carson on what realistically can be  done.</p><p>Plus, how Ebola made its way on to a flight with frontier airlines?</p><p>More \"money,\" more answers.  That's the big story.  Coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Very steep declines across the board today in the market.  The  headlines are coming very fast.</p><p>The second Ebola identified.  Lousy economic data weighing heavily.  We  just heard the latest from the Fed's Beige Book.</p><p>Let's go to Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.   We also have Jo Ling Kent who is at the Nasdaq.</p><p>Nicole, let me start with you.  Wild ride down there today.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  No doubt.</p><p>Melissa, what a wild ride this has been.  You're talking about a thousand  points that we've lost since last Wednesday's close.</p><p>Right now the Dow is down 380 points.  We had been down 460 points, roughly  a little less than that.  And so you are seeing a broad-based selloff here.   Everything is for sale.  People are a little too nervous to take the risk.   There's also some margin calls that maybe involved as well.  But we are  seeing some stocks that are shaving off some key numbers off the Dow Jones  Industrial average.</p><p>So, three names, Goldman Sachs, Visa and Boeing actually accounting for  about 100 points of the Dow's 375 points right now.  So we can see Goldman  down 3.7 percent, Visa down 2.6 percent and Boeing down 3.9 percent.  It's  also worth noting that Boeing itself is at a new low but big picture here,  you're seeing all the major averages into negative territory for the year.   The Dow, Nasdaq and the S&amp;P, it's only the transports that's really heading  on.  The Russell also has been negative for this year.  But transports had  a tough October, don't forget, but still positive for the year.</p><p>So the selling is broad-based, energy, financials, health care weak.  Yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, Jo, what are you seeing?</p><p>JO LING KEN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're looking at  those big large caps, tech stocks of course here at the Nasdaq.  They're  all not doing terribly well here.</p><p>Take a look at Intel.  Itself is down about 5 percent.  It's shaving seven  points off the Nasdaq composite right now.  Vodafone also down quite a bit,  one of the top losers of the hour here, Microsoft down as well as Expedia  down 4 percent and of course apple down 2.6 percent, really dragging down  some of these big tech stocks.</p><p>But although the Nasdaq overall right now is negative, the Nasdaq 100  continues to be positive just slightly for the year.  So we're looking at  all kinds of different global growth issues here.  But Nasdaq 100 remains a  silver lining for now.</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right.  Thank you so much.  Thanks to both of you.</p><p>Airline stocks reacting after news that a second health care worker to  contract Ebola flew a domestic flight from Cleveland to Dallas just two  days ago.  We are learning that the victim did have a low-grade fever when  she was traveling on that flight.  Although the carrier which was Frontier  Airlines has disinfected the plane, twice.  Could this be a real threat to  travelers?</p><p>Joining me now is Tom Sullivan he is our resident pilot, we also have  Charlie Gasparino and James Freeman back us.</p><p>Tom, let me start with you.  What do you think about that?</p><p>TOM SULLIVAN, FOX BUSINESS:  Well, the airlines say they disinfect the  plane but really what they do is they vacuum and they clean the pockets out  of -- so that when you get on the plane, the people that left their junk.   It's not fair.</p><p>FRANCIS:  You don't think they got on there with hazmat suits?  And really  like.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . before cleaning on this one.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  But full cleaning, what's full cleaning?  We got these hazmat  people.  They have don't have hazmat people.  They just have cleaners and  they spray a little Lysol and wiped down the mirrors.  That's all they do.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Does Lysol kill Ebola?  I mean, you know, part of the problem  is we're not doctors.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO:  And I will say this.  This just shows the folly and why the  markets are trading low with all this baloney about the screenings.  I  mean, people can get through those screenings by lying, by taking Tylenol,  if they have a fever so the fever goes down.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  Right.</p><p>GASPARINO:  If you really want to get through these screenings.  It's like.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Not only that.</p><p>GASPARINO:  It's like -- I mean like say Ramzi Yousef got through a  screening.  That's.</p><p>FRANCIS:  But the information that's being released changes because first  we hear she flew but she had no symptoms.  Now, we're hearing, \"She flew  but she had a temperature of 99.5.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  . she was on the plane with 132 other passengers, you know, I  mean it's -- this is what is making people so concerned and why it feels  out of control.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  These are medical people that should know that she was part of a  group that was being monitored.  She should know that you can't go  traveling just like Dr. Nancy Snyderman should have known.  What's wrong  with these people?  They're the professionals.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah, James, go ahead.</p><p>FREEMAN:  There's an argument that she shouldn't have traveled but we  should remember that based on everything we know to this point, it is not  that easy to transmit it.  The two health care workers, it is concerning,  you want to know everything how it happened but this is not like the flu.   This is not like.</p><p>FRANCIS:  It's not going to come here.  You can't get it.  It's not.</p><p>GASPARINO:  James, I talked to doctors, OK, it's a lot harder to get than  the flu because it is not really airborne.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>GASPARINO:  It's a lot easier to get, as I said, than hep C and AIDS.  It's  somewhere in the middle.  There is a degree where casual contact does  transmit this thing.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>GASPARINO:  . we talk to doctors off the record.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Here's the deal.</p><p>GASPARINO:  . and that's a problem.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  But you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Why is the U.S. saying that we have 60 days to get a hold of this  thing before it gets really out of control?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, this points the issue of why you really don't want them to  cut off air travel right now because the best way to fight this is to keep  airplanes going in and out of West Africa to bring people with knowledge  and skills.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  No.  I absolutely disagree.</p><p>FRANCIS:  In and out?  I mean, maybe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Go ahead, Tom.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  . then have the military fly them in, have charter flights bring  them in but you don't need to put them on United Airlines and have them mix  in with the populace.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Listen, I mean, there's a part of me that does not want to like  raise the specter of Armageddon here.  I mean, that is an issue.  I agree  with James on that point.  But I will tell you this, they don't know a lot  about this disease.  If you talk to doctors off the record, they really  aren't sure about just how casual the contact has to be to catch it.  So  what does that mean?  I mean, this is where this becomes an economic.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Hang on.  Hang on.  You talk about cleaning the plan.  The  Frontier Airlines says Flight 1143, that was the number by the way,  received a thorough cleaning per our normal procedures which is consistent  with CDC guidelines prior to returning to service the next day.  It was  also cleaned again the next day in Cleveland.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Yeah.</p><p>SULLIVAN:  Yeah, but the flight came in around 6:00 at night.  She shows up  at midnight and says, \"I've got a problem here.\"  So the plane that night  overnighted in Dallas.  So they went and again, they washed it down, they  vacuumed.  I'm sorry.  I don't think that is the same.  And the question  then becomes did she use the restroom?  Did she cough?  Who was sitting  next to her?  Who was sitting in front and behind her?  Those kinds of  things, again, we don't know if she did in fact sneezed during the flight?   We don't know.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  There's a lot we don't know and it's true, there's very  little in the medical literature.  But everything we do know.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . so far is you don't get it by being in a room or playing with  people's.</p><p>GASPARINO:  James, James, James.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>GASPARINO:  The woman got it from taking off her hazmat suit.  I know that.</p><p>FRANCIS:  All right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  We're not sure how those.</p><p>FRANCIS:  We got to go.  We're going to have more on this later.  I want to  tell you right now.  The market is down 331 points.  So we are still down - - right.  We are off the lows of the session.  We've been down more than  400 points at the start of the show.  Gaining back a little bit of ground,  but we've seen this back and forth all day.</p><p>And a reminder that President Obama is meeting with White House officials  today at three 3:30 to discuss the U.S. government's actions against  ongoing Ebola threat.  Fox Business will monitor this.  We are going to  bring you the remarks as we get them.</p><p>And the Fox Business exclusive scoop, David Asman is going to join us next  with what the Fed is telling him directly.  We're the only ones with this  information.</p><p>Plus, plummeting oil prices may feel good at the pumps.  But we're going to  tell you who it's really going to hurt.  In fact, we could be seeing it  happen right now.</p><p>More \"money\" coming up.  Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK</p><p>FRANCIS:  Extreme declines for stocks.  The Dow and the S&amp;P down more than  2 percent.</p><p>Our very own, David Asman has been speaking exclusively with Dallas Fed  President Richard Fisher, he joins us now.  Charlie and James are back as  well.</p><p>You have new headlines right now?</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  Well, this is -- the back story of this  conversation that I had with Richard Fisher was of course he is reluctant  about going on air but he and I have relationships and he said -- and I  told him -- I said, \"Charlie Gasparino, Steve Forbes, a lot of people are  wondering.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Then he said, \"Who the hell is Charlie Gasparino?\"</p><p>ASMAN:  . are wondering whether there's going to be another QE as a result  of this market downturn.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>ASMAN:  He wanted to be absolutely clear that you could have a market  downturn without having any need for QE.  And he also wanted to be clear  that it wasn't just him saying that.</p><p>FRANCIS:  This is a big news right here.  Go ahead.</p><p>ASMAN:  He specifically said, whether it's me, Janet Yellen or the head of  the European central bank and he spelled out to me Draghi, Draghi  specifically, because there is a lot of pressure on Draghi right now to do  a QE sort of thing in Europe.  Draghi has been resisting and according to  Richard Fisher, Draghi agrees with him that there's no need for QE that you  can have a functioning economy without a QE.  And in fact it's up to the  politicians.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>ASMAN:  . to do what's necessary to spur growth, not the central bank.</p><p>FRANCIS:  This banner on the bottom of the screen right now is big.  So I  want to emphasize this.  So he said to you that Yellen also agrees.</p><p>ASMAN:  He said.</p><p>FRANCIS:  . there is no need.</p><p>ASMAN:  . whether it's me, Janet Yellen, the head of the European Central  Bank and this is interesting, he wanted to make sure I got in the governor  of the Bank of India.  Apparently, there's been some questions whether  India is going to through QE.  He said, \"We do not need more monetary  stimulus.\"</p><p>GASPARINO:  OK.  He basically ruled out Yellen doing a QE4.</p><p>ASMAN:  He did.  Well, what he did is he said that Janet Yellen and he  agree on the fact that what's necessary for growth is fiscal reform, not  monetary policy right now.</p><p>FRANCIS:  What do you think of that?</p><p>FREEMAN:  This is the best news we've heard all day, right?  I mean, the.</p><p>ASMAN:  Not with the market necessarily.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN:  It should be.  Maybe not for every trader at this moment but  generally, if there's now a realization that monetary policy can't do it,  more money printing can't do it, you have to reform -- and this is the big  problem in Europe.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . and more so than the U.S.  They have not reformed their  economies.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Right.  You see, I.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . that's why we're headed back.</p><p>GASPARINO:  I'll be honest with you.  I don't doubt that he said -- I know  he said that to you.  I doubt that Yellen is not.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Sticks to that.</p><p>GASPARINO:  Listen, think of it this way.  She's President Obama's puppet  to a certain extent.</p><p>ASMAN:  Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO:  What does President Obama have in two years?  He really wants  to say, \"I took the market from six to 17.\"  And without QE, this thing, I  know it's bouncing back a little, actually it's going down again.  This  market.</p><p>ASMAN:  Because you're talking.</p><p>GASPARINO:  This market is not a very healthy market without more stimulus  either by keeping rates where they are or doing another.</p><p>ASMAN:  However, Janet Yellen is on record saying we do not take our cues  from the stock market.  If you believe that, perhaps as Charlie would say  I've got a bridge in Brooklyn but that's what both she and Ben Bernanke  have said.  A lot of people disagree.  In fact, Jon Hilsenrath who I have  on in the 4:00 hour by the way to talk about all this did say -- he's the  first person to say that they are looking for market cues.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>ASMAN:  . the Fed is.</p><p>FRANCIS:  But you and I both noticed earlier today Keith McCullough from  Hedgeye was on and he shared something that that was very -- about this  market that at some point, you know, the world realizes that zero plus zero  doesn't equal anything greater than zero.  Why did you like that?</p><p>ASMAN:  Well, because of that fact that we've got close to zero interest  rates.  You can't have more zero interest rates create something else.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>ASMAN:  I mean, the zero interest rates haven't worked to help.</p><p>GASPARINO:  OK.  We know that but that.</p><p>ASMAN:  We need fiscal reform.</p><p>GASPARINO:  But some of this -- listen, of course and that -- those are two  arguments though but there's a political argument.  Can Hillary Clinton run  in 2016 with Dow 12,000?</p><p>ASMAN:  Good question.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK, all right.</p><p>ASMAN:  Good question, Charlie.</p><p>FRANCIS:  We're going to pause for a second.  The search is on for a  vaccine as the second person in the U.S. contracts Ebola.  One of the  nation's prominent research centers is on the hunt for a cure.</p><p>Plus, fears over the virus stirring a national debate.  Dr. Ben Carson is  here to sound off on the Ebola threat that it's facing the nation right  now.</p><p>We've got a lot more. \"Piles of Money\" coming up.  Don't go anywhere.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  The very latest now on Ebola.  The CDC director speaking just  moments ago.</p><p>Richard Edson is here with all of the headlines.  Rich, what did you hear?</p><p>RICHARD EDSON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Melissa, this is  about a second confirmation of a case when testing positive, another health  care worker at that Dallas hospital.  She also flew on a flight from  Cleveland to Dallas on October 13th so did showing symptoms on the 14th,  CDC said she should have never flown and now they're implementing new  procedures, they say, to prevent people because she did have contact with  that first patient, Thomas Eric Duncan.  And now the CDC saying it's also  working with that hospital on its protocols.</p><p>DR. TOM FRIEDEN, CDC DIRECTOR:  We're working very closely with the  hospital in Dallas to promote a safe environment for the care of everyone  at that hospital for the patients and for the health care workers.  We have  continued with our intensive investigation and interventions to understand  what may have happened and to increase safety.</p><p>EDSON:  This is the first live test of an Ebola vaccine every happening  right here at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.  They're testing  a number of patients.  This timeline at least for the initial stage its  suppose to take until December that might seem like a long time but as  doctors here say, that timeline has been moved up dramatically.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COL. SHON REMICH, WRAIR:  Once the regulatory agency say that this is safe  to move on to phase two then we'll progress from there.  So the timeline is  at this point being compressed but it's unclear when e product actually  might hit the market.  We took about six weeks to do.  It would normally  take in about six months.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON:  Canadian officials developed this.  This is now been licensed to  new link genetics in American based company.  There's also another effort  going on nearby at the National Institutes of Health that's in cooperation  with GlaxoSmithKline, so very close here at Maryland, two different  institutions, two very well renowned institutions working on a vaccine.   I'm not saying racing on another but trying to get this out as quickly as  possible.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Rich, thank you so much.</p><p>So with the latest in Ebola, it may seem like the situation is spiraling  out of control.  The United Nations it turns out would agree.  The head of  the U.N.'s Ebola Emergency Response says, \"The world as 60 days to get this  situation under control or face an unprecedented situation.\"  Those are  their words.</p><p>Dr. Ben Carson is the former director of pediatric neurosurgery at John  Hopkins Hospital, he's also a Fox News contributor and he joins me now.   Thank you for joining us.</p><p>Let me ask you, what does that mean?</p><p>DR. BEN CARSON, FMR. JOHN HOPKINS HOSPITAL:  My pleasure.</p><p>FRANCIS:  We have 60 days to stop this.  What does that mean?  What does it  look like to have stopped it?</p><p>CARSON:  Well, they're just recognizing the exponential potential of this  thing to spread.  And, you know, it's just like if you take two and then  multiply it by two, you keep doing that.  It doesn't take you very long to  get into some very, very large numbers.</p><p>And so they're just being realistic.  You know, we've known for a long time  that it had this kind of potential and that's the reason that several weeks  ago I said it was a real mistake to bring infected people into this country  in any way.  Not because we don't have -- no, not because we don't have the  protocols.</p><p>FRANCIS:  I mean, now that's happened -- yes.  Now that's happened and you  mentioned the protocol and that's what they're blaming the situation now in  Texas where we see that it has spread.  They're calling it a breach in  protocol.  What do you think happened there?</p><p>CARSON:  No.  No, the problem is you have human beings.  And when you have  human beings involved, I don't care how good your protocol is, there are  going to be breaches, there are going to be problems because people are not  perfect.  And, you know, in the case of that most recent person who's  infected, flying on a airplane, I wonder if anybody told her that she  couldn't fly on airplane.  I suspect, probably not.  We need to tighten  those things up.</p><p>But most importantly right now, the people who have contracted it in this  country, we need to determine exactly how they contracted it and we need to  make sure that that door is closed and that no one else can contract it  that way.  There are some urgency involved there.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah, let me ask you about that because now we're learning --  we're finally learning the name, we've heard it but now we're able to share  the name of the patient, she's being identified, her name, you could see it  there at the bottom of the screen, Amber Vinson.  She is the one that flew  -- 29 years old, she flew, at the time they thought she had no signs of  symptoms, now we're learning that she had a temperature of 99.5 degrees,  she flew on that flight 1193 from Cleveland to Dallas Fort Worth.</p><p>What is the danger in flying on a plane, Dr. Carson?  Because we have heard  a lot of debate about that that it's hard to get it, it's not just if she  sneezes, it's not that big of a deal that she was on a plane.  Other people  as we've seen in the market today are worried.  Where do you come down?</p><p>CARSON:  Well, we don't have any evidence that it's spread by ways other  than, you know, contact with bodily fluids.  But if one were to be prudent,  one we'd look at worse case scenarios and one would plan for worst case  scenarios.  We seem to always think of best case scenarios and then have to  backtrack and say, \"Well, we were wrong.\"  And that seems to be a general  pattern here.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>CARSON:  And that's very problematic.</p><p>FRANCIS:  And speaking of that, I mean the CDC is saying now that they were  not monitoring her at the time, when she showed these symptoms, when her  temperature went up, when she got on this plane with more than a hundred  other people, she was not being monitored.  Does that make you nervous that  there are other people out there right now who have symptoms.</p><p>CARSON:  Of course.</p><p>FRANCIS:  . who are not being monitored?</p><p>CARSON:  Yeah, of course, it makes you very nervous.  And, you know, if I  were in charge, I would assemble, you know, the experts in this area very,  very quickly.  And I would say, \"Look guys and gals, you know, we need to  figure out within a day or two.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>CARSON:  . what we should be doing with all these people who have been  exposed and we need to implement that right now.\"  This is not a time for a  great debate.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.  Can I ask you personally?  I mean, how concerned are you  personally?  Are you flying on planes?  Are you looking around?  Are you  concerned?</p><p>CARSON:  I am flying on planes a lot but believe me, I wash my hands a lot,  you know, if I go into the bathroom, I flush it with a piece of paper in my  hand.  I don't touch the handle.  You have to be careful.  There's no  question.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Dr. Carson, thank you for joining us today.  We really appreciate  your time.</p><p>CARSON:  Always a pleasure.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Steep declines for stocks continue right now, although we are  down 300 points.  We had been down, well, more than 400 so we are well off  the lows of the session but still that is a big loss right now.  We are  hitting the trading floors with the very latest.  That is coming up.</p><p>Also, oil flirting with $80 a barrel?  You might be surprised who is really  losing here.  We're going to tell you.  Coming up.</p><p>At the end of the day, it is al about \"money\".</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  I'm Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief.</p><p>Japan is recalling nearly 1.7 million vehicles around the world.  That  includes Corolla and Lexus models, Toyota says it is worried about faulty  brakes but it thinks no injuries have occurred so far.</p><p>Gap is making a huge push this holiday season.  Employing in extra 63,000  temporary workers, it is one of the largest seasonal hires of any retailer.   It is even more than Walmart at the Gap.  That is very optimistic.</p><p>And U.S. drug maker AbbVie is reconsidering its takeover of European rival  Shire.  That is after treasury proposals to severely limit the move of U.S.  companies overseas.  Investors weren't expecting AbbVie to backtrack and  Shire stock sank the most in 12 years.</p><p>That's the latest from the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to  prosper.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Stocks coming back off the worst levels of the day at the low.   The Dow was down 457 points.  Right now, you can see it's down 293 points,  that's good by comparison.</p><p>Let's go to Nicole Petallides in the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.   China, you know, look at the bright side of this one, Nicole.</p><p>PETALLIDES:  Yeah, right, the silver lining.  I mean, you're in the 15,000  range at one point right now, Dow nearly 300.  You're basically seeing all  10 sectors lower.  The Dow is down 1.8 percent right now up off the lows of  the day with Visa, Goldman Sachs, Boeing together still accounting for  about 85 negative Dow points.</p><p>Also, I want you to take a look at the VIX, the ViX now above the 31 level,  right, to move to 31.  You can see right now it's up about 20.5 percent.   So for the people who bet the VIX, because there are people who'd do that.   It is really well.</p><p>But what's interesting, Melissa, as I toss it back to you and  I think  there and I know they're selling across the board is the question of when  people are going to buy.  And some are saying there's just not enough fear  in the market yet to say, \"I'm ready to get it.\"  And so people still seem  a little tepid and a little nervous to say, \"I'm going to buy in here.\"</p><p>FRANCIS:  Not enough fear in the market.</p><p>PETALLIDES:  Right.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yes, on a daylight, that's an amazing.</p><p>PETALLIDES:  An idea like it's almost that there needs to be more of a  cleanse, I don't know how many.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.  Total capitulation.  Yeah.</p><p>PETALLIDES:  Yeah.  All right, Nicole, thank you so much.</p><p>Oil prices down, they are not out there crude dropping all the way to $80 a  barrel before climbing back a little bit here.  It is been Roscoe oil down  10 percent in the past month alone.  You may be surprised whose really  getting hurt by cheap oil.</p><p>Let's bring in trader Scott Shellady at the CME, James is here as well.</p><p>I mean, of course this is fantastic news for drivers.  Everybody who's  filled up lately is very excited about this.  We wanted to point to the  other side of the trade, because there's some interesting folks in the  other side, the most obvious of which is certainly the Saudis.</p><p>Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is talking about the catastrophe in oil prices  and the fact that he thinks the Saudi oil minister isn't serious enough and  isn't worried enough about this decline.</p><p>Scott, what do you think?</p><p>SCOTT SHELLADY, CME GROUP:  I think there's kind of a story underneath here  that says they're trying to try that even the U.S. producers out of  business.  They want to see how low they could go and I think that our  numbers are rounded $60 a barrel.  They want to push it down there to start  to really -- they want to give us some pain.  So there is a little bit of a  fight under here that we're not really seeing.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>SHELLADY:  But I think that there could be something there about pushing it  low to hurt us, not them.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No, that's an interesting point of view and, James, we'll ask you  about that because we were looking at Ali Al-Naimi there on the screen who  is the Saudi oil minister next to Prince Alwaleed and, you know, that for  shale, so there's been a huge shale revolution here in the U.S. but the  breakeven price is said to be $80 to $85 on Brent.</p><p>Do you think it's possible that these guys are trying to drive the shale  drillers here in the U.S. out of business?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you can come up with a lot of theories.  Vladimir Putin  thinks that.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . this is aimed at him.  And I think -- I see a lot of upside  here and not just people driving their cars, it's everyone who's using  petroleum to create products, so do all kinds of commerce, the people who  are hurt the most are not the U.S. frackers there.  As we said, Putin's  Russia, Venezuela, they all have budgets built on very high oil prices.</p><p>So basically what you're doing is you're squeezing the world's dictators.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN:  . while you get U.S. consumers in business as a price cut.</p><p>FRANCIS:  No, that's a great point.  That's a great point.  And, Scott, I  mean, what do you think about that, because you look at the price decline  there.  You know, every dollar decline that we see in the price of oil  translates to about $2 billion in losses for Putin and for Russia.</p><p>What do you think, Scott?</p><p>SHELLADY:  And I think that, you know, I think that that could -- it could  be a little bit self-centered on their behalf but at the end of the day,  it's about the dollar and I think that oil still is a harbor chair for the  economy and the economy is not doing well.  I don't think these low oil  prices are going to port over to better retail sales and a better economy.   I think the reason why -- A lot of the reason why oil is going down is the  consumer just doesn't have that money anymore and we've started to see some  of these retail sales numbers like today coming in.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>SHELLADY:  . a little weak and it's going to continue that way.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>SHELLADY:  The worst is yet to come.  The worst is yet to come.</p><p>FRANCIS:  On that, you know, we're going to leave the segment, thank you so  much Scott and James.</p><p>We are keeping a very close eye in the market.  The Dow right now is down  302 points.  What do you do with your money right now?  The trader and the  money manager's take.  We've got that next.</p><p>You can never have too much \"money\", that is for sure.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  Stocks still in the red as the Dow suffers its steepest intraday  decline in almost three years.</p><p>Here with some advice for your money is Alan Knuckman from Bulls-eye  Options, we also have Dominic Tavella from Diversified Financial</p><p>Dominic, you want to be the voice of reason.  Go ahead.</p><p>DOMINIC TAVELLA, DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT:  Look, these  headlines are scary for people and I'm not really talking about the guys  sitting at his office or at home and going, \"I'm going to rebalance my 401K  Com, I broke -- let's be reasonable here.  There are more people that die  in this country from the flu, 25,000 people a year that have died so far.   No one, no one's died from Ebola American in this country so far</p><p>The U.S. is growing.  We're probably around 3 percent.  China, India,  growing about 4 percent or 7 percent.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>TAVELLA:  . that's 65 percent of the world GDP.</p><p>FRANCIS:  So, Alan, I mean that sounds very rational.  Why then at the OPEC  do we see just a washout?</p><p>ALAN KNUCKMAN, BULLS-EYE OPTION:  I think people get a lot of information  and have a difficulty processing it.  The fundamentals haven't changed just  like we stated.  Right now, we've got record low interest rates plunging  here the 10-year notes, bouncing off at 2 percent.  We were worried about  rates going up.  That's not going to happen.  Earning here is still  fantastic, oil prices are going down.  So all these things are positive  fundamentals but the markets get overdone because of psychology, everybody  was worried about a selloff.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>KNUCKMAN:  . and now they've got something to worry about.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Let me challenge you though, are you sure that the fundamentals  haven't changed?  I mean, you look at the data coming out of Germany, you  look at the data coming out of China, there is a slowdown going on  elsewhere around the world.  How is it not going to be contagious here in  the U.S. where we're seeing a bit of growth, but not much?  Dominic?</p><p>TAVELLA:  So let's focus on energy, right, which I think is a fantastic  story.  It's estimated that between $75 billion and $100 billion will come  back to the consumer because of lower energy prices.  That's equal to the  Obama tax increase last year.  So consumers are going to get that back in  their pocket just in time for Christmas, that's going to help our economy.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Alan, what do you think about that?  I mean, is that enough or it  is the reason why oils lower because everything is slowing down around the  world and people aren't driving as much because they don't have money and  they're not going to out shopping and they're not going out to do things.   Go ahead.</p><p>KNUCKMAN:  I think it's nothing but a benefit but I think that if you want  to look at Europe slowing, that's going to make our markets more attractive  in the long-run.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>KNUCKMAN:  So from my standpoint, I'm looking at scaling back in here.  I  was surprised, I didn't think the market could go straight down for three  weeks but, you know, I got knocked out following my plan but we can always  get back in with a clear head and I think that's where we have to look at  here.</p><p>FRANICS:  Gentlemen, thanks to both of you.</p><p>No doubt this has been a tough day for the marketer.  Our very own Liz  Claman is here to give us a preview of what's coming up in the next and  most important hour of trading.</p><p>Liz.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  I love to tell you  earlier, I said, \"It looks better.  It's down 280 points.\"</p><p>FRANCIS:  Right.</p><p>CLAMAN:  Listen, perspective at the moment.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Take improvements.</p><p>CLAMAN:  That's exactly what we're going to give you in this final hour in  which we know anything can happen.  We could see in an acceleration to the  downside or we could see a fight back to at least getting closer to the  green.  So we're going to take you to every index trading floor that  matters.  We're talking to traders.  We're talking of money experts as we  look at the markets right now.  It is pretty much a mess at the moment.  We  do have the S&amp;P down 30 points, the Nasdaq down 53.  It is truly just a lot  of red on the screen but we wouldn't exactly call it a complete  capitulation.  You were addressing that too.</p><p>So we've got two experts here.  One of them runs a fund, the Hennessey  Funds which is actually over the past 10 years during which we know there's  been so much going on returned an annual live 10 percent.  So David Raney  is important to hear from right now, he's a good investor.  James Bianco of  Bianoc Research, he's going to be talking specifically about the technical  levels you need to worry about the most and are we seeing capitulation?  He  is the man to be answering that.</p><p>And at this point, when we have seen the 10-year yield fall below 2 percent  earlier today, why not just buy Intel.  Look at the Intel yield, 2.8  percent.  First on Fox Business interview with the Dow component CEO Brian  Krzanich, he is going to come right here on Fox, I'm going to ask him all  of this global turmoil.  They do 80 percent of their business outside the  U.S.  Is that going to affect the current quarter?  That may mean a lot to  all technology investments.</p><p>Plus, they have a brand new phone/tablet, a two in one that just rolled out  with ASUS but it's got that Intel chip in it.  Wait until you see this  thing.  It's called the PadFone, we're talking to Brian about all that and  so much more at first on Fox Business.  See you at the top of the hour.</p><p>FRANCIS:  We look forward to it, Liz.  Thank you so much.</p><p>CLAMAN:  You got it.</p><p>Netflix prepares for earnings, but in these cell streaming device, it could  be hurting its bottom-line.</p><p>At the end of the day, it is all about \"money\".</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>FRANCIS:  President Obama delaying his fundraising and campaign events  today so that he can remain at the White House for a meeting with cabinet  members on Ebola just moments ago.</p><p>White House Press Secretary John Earnest saying the president felt like he  needed to be in the White House to fulfill his responsibilities.  We're  going to bring you any updates as we have them.  That's a switch from the  past by the way.</p><p>Netflix set to report a third-quarter earnings after the Belden stock came  session lows after HBO announced it will launch a stand-alone streaming  service for next year.</p><p>Our very own Jo Ling Kent is at the Nasdaq, James and Spencer back as well.</p><p>Jo, tell me about Netflix right now.  What's it doing?</p><p>KENT:  Well, it's down a little less than 1 percent.  Now, like you said  off the session lows, we're expecting an EPS of 93 cents of share,  (inaudible) looking for a revenue of $1.41 billion.  But there could be a  silver lining here if HBO continues to be competitive to Netflix.  Of all  the people who are cutting quarters, maybe they'll migrate to Netflix as  well.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah, interesting.  Spencer, what do you think about Netflix  after the bell and what do you think about the competition from HBO here?</p><p>ANTE:  You know, honestly, I'm surprised that Netflix is not down more than  1 percent and change right now, you know, because HBO is saying they're  going over the top is definitely the single biggest new competitor and  threat they face when HBO releases that service in 2015.</p><p>So I think that people maybe underestimating the power of.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.</p><p>ANTE:  . this new service.</p><p>FRANCIS:  James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yeah, I think it suggests maybe questions about whether HBO can  execute.  As far as Netflix, obviously, they're priced for a lot of growth  in the future.  They have to pay a lot for programming, whether they can  keep that edge in terms of user friendly experience.</p><p>FRANCIS:  Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Big question.</p><p>FRANCIS:  OK.  Thanks to all three of you.  Stay tuned at Fox Business,  we're going to have live coverage of Netflix earnings on \"After the Bell\"  coming straight after this.  That is all we have for now.  I hope that you  are somehow making money today.  The market is down 279.  It was much worse  earlier.  Stay tuned.</p><p>Liz Claman in \"Countdown\" starts right now.    </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2014 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

You could see there, the S&amp;P, the biggest loser on a percentage basis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors rushing to the safety of bonds, the 10-year treasury yield now at about 2 percent, just higher than that. It is the lowest level that we have seen since May of last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now we are going to hear from the Fed. We are seconds away from the latest Beige Book report on the economy. We have an all-star panel standing by to react. There we go.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's go to Peter Barnes with the breaking news. Peter?</p><p>PETER BARNES, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, hi, Melissa, the 12 Federal Reserve banks reported modest to moderate economic growth in this latest survey of economic conditions. This is the Beige Book that the Fed will use at its next policy meeting at the end of this month when it is expected to end its latest round of quantitative easing.</p><p>I looked through the report to find -- check on some of the issues that are concerning investors right know exports, for example, to Europe and oil supplies and prices. And I did find this reference from the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank. It said, \"That manufacturing firms there seeing lower production attributed it to seasonal factors or declining exports.\"</p><p>On excess supplies of crude oil, the Beige Book does report on that and uses the term, \"excess supplies\" reporting on its context in the period up to October 6th. It says, \"Oil exploration activity increased in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.\" and of course the Minneapolis District does include those big shale oil reserves in North Dakota.</p><p>But, again, this information was all collected before October 6th. We've had a lot happened since then. The Dow down, 1,000 points since October 6th unclear how these latest developments in the markets will affect Fed policy making at the end of this month.</p><p>Melissa?</p><p>FRANCIS: All right, Peter Barnes reporting in disguise there. Thank you so much. Let's get to the market reaction right now.</p><p>It has been a rough run today. The Dow diving more than 400 points, so now we're down 420. When we came on the air a few seconds ago we were down 400. We're all over the map today. It is the steepest drop in more than three years. One of the big reasons, Ebola. Let's get you up to speed on the very latest on that one that caused the free fall this morning.</p><p>A second person contracted Ebola in the U.S. The patient has not yet been identified but it has been confirmed that the health care worker did travel by air before experiencing any symptoms of the deadly disease, the beginning of this week that was. The president is set to meet with cabinet leaders in just over an hour from now. They're going to discuss the government's response to this growing crisis.</p><p>Let's bring in today's panel. We have Fox Business's Charlie Gasparino, the Wall Street Journal's James Freeman is with us and co-founder of WhoWeUse, Spencer Ante is here as well.</p><p>Charlie?</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: I would say part of the drop that's going down and every time we take eye an off the markets, it goes down.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right, it.</p><p>GASPARINO: And what do we have now, right?</p><p>FRANCIS: It's amazing. 420.</p><p>GASPARINO: To the point.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: . I think some of the drop right now is attributed, I think, to David Asman's report earlier that Richard Fisher.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes.</p><p>GASPARINO: . now he's a hawk but David reported exclusively that Fisher has ruled out QE. Look at it this way.</p><p>FRANCIS: Way too premature is what he said.</p><p>GASPARINO: . is that he's way too -- yes, way too -- so it means it's not going to happen anytime soon. Here is what the market loves. The market loves printing money. It knows that the global economy isn't doing so well. There's lots of fears out there. This is not a good environment to be owning stocks if the Fed is not going to ease.</p><p>FRANCIS: I think David Asman's going to be out later with more on that report. I just want to give you a couple of the headlines that are coming from David Asman's conversation with Fisher saying that the market correction doesn't mean the economy is in trouble. What do you think about that one, James Freeman?</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND WHOWEUSE CO-FOUNDER: Well, I think that this is an issue we've talked about recently where he's trying to, I think, partly get out in front of his Fed colleagues. He knows a lot of them do not have market experience. And as academics, they can get rattled a bit.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's terrifying.</p><p>FREEMAN: . they can get rattled a bit sort of like Geithner was during the crisis where people on the street would whisper to him scary stuff without the experience to know he would kind of overreact. And I think that's what Fisher may be concerned about with some of his Fed colleagues.</p><p>GASPARINO: Do you think the economy is getting better? I mean.</p><p>FREEMAN: Slowly, yes, I do. And I think his point -- what Fisher, I think he's right on the money.</p><p>FRANCIS: You know, wait, wait, wait, I mean, let me stop you right there because you look at the data that's coming out of Germany, you look at the data that's coming out of China...</p><p>GASPARINO: Not good.</p><p>FRANCIS: . it seems like globally, I don't know, it feels like something has happened, something has shifted and we aren't all of a sudden getting better the way they were. You don't agree with that?</p><p>FREEMAN: I agree. Europe is depressing. I think the U.S. economy is still plugging along.</p><p>SPENCER ANTE, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: I agree with that. I think China is slowing down and Europ is slowing down but the U.S. is the main bright spot in the global economy. And.</p><p>FRANCIS: But how can we keep this lower.</p><p>GASPARINO: It's not going to last.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right. How can we keep this going.</p><p>GASPARINO: I will say this.</p><p>FRANCIS: . if they're staggering.</p><p>GASPARINO: Let's bring this politically.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: One thing that Hillary Clinton is -- what she's worried about, big time, is the fact that economies generally -- economic cycles generally run in seven years. And seven year for this economic cycle is coming to an end.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah, but this isn't a normal cycle. It's been such slow growth.</p><p>GASPARINO: That is -- I know, that's the counter argument.</p><p>FREEMAN: Normally, I mean, it's different from so many other good.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>FREEMAN: . recoveries. So I wouldn't expect them.</p><p>GASPARINO: But we do know. But you don't know.</p><p>FREEMAN: . to be similar in that way.</p><p>FRANCIS: I want to -- Let's talk specifically about this big move that we've seen today because it is staggering.</p><p>Charlie, there were a lot of folks talking earlier today about maybe a Hedge Fund liquidation.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yeah, I mean, listen, here's the thing. You had that Shire deal, the Shire -- there was that.</p><p>FREEMAN: AbbVie.</p><p>GASPARINO: . AbbVie, right. Now that deal, this is a little technical, but here's what happened. A lot of people -- a lot of arbs got in that deal, meaning professional traders who bet the deal would happen. So they would go along the stock that was being bought. In short, the stock that was being sold, that was the acquirer.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>GASPARINO: . and guess what happened? That deal didn't happen. So all those arbs got crushed and what they did was they sold stock and they went into bonds. That's why you saw the 10-year go down on basis points and on the yield on 10-year go down.</p><p>My bigger point is this, deals like this generally screw up when the economy and the markets are insane.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.</p><p>ANTE: And so obviously the bad news is outweighing good news in the market right now. But one bit of good news is that oil and gas prices are falling.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, no, that's not good news. That's not good news.</p><p>ANTE: No, that is good news. Let's not over think this.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, it's not.</p><p>ANTE: Let me finish my point.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>ANTE: Seventy percent of consumers spending in the U.S. economy -- of GDP comes your consumer spending. When oil prices and gas prices go down, it puts more people in money's pockets and they use.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: That's a good side of it. The bad side of it is the reason why it's happening.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: . it's because there is a global slowdown going down.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: Look at what's happening.</p><p>ANTE: There's a global increase in supply of oil because of better technology.</p><p>GASPARINO: There's never any good -- there's never any</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: All of a sudden, out of nowhere? No. There's a shrinking of demand in China, in Europe and that's why.</p><p>ANTE: Supply is the big factor here.</p><p>GASPARINO: Let me ask you a question. Why is it then that every time we get a lousy print, GDP print, from overseas, price of oil goes down? I mean, it's totally.</p><p>FRANCIS: That's the precall that we've seen.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yes?</p><p>FREEMAN: But the result is a good one. Things get cheaper for all kinds of consumers.</p><p>FRANCIS: The result is a good one, but the question is which has the bigger impact? And I don't know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ANTE: . but all these things that's horrible for the economy.</p><p>FRANCIS: Absolutely.</p><p>ANTE: Oil prices are going down. Let's not over think it. It's one of the only bright spots we have right now.</p><p>GASPARINO: But inflation goes down when your economy slows. You know that.</p><p>ANTE: We're not talking about inflation.</p><p>GASPARINO: I'm just saying.</p><p>ANTE: There's deflation.</p><p>FRANCIS: Let's get back to today's market right here. So what are you hearing from folks about this particular selloff right now down 424.</p><p>GASPARINO: A lot of.</p><p>FRANCIS: . does it continue? Is this the bottom? Is this the beginning?</p><p>GASPARINO: Who knows? I mean, yes, I think it continues until the Fed gives us some clarity on rates. whether they do a QE, whether Richard Fisher is obviously overruled. I would say this. When I talk to money managers that deal with high net worth people.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: . but they're getting a lot of calls from their rich clients, they're asking about deflation. There is an issue, there's a little spook on deflation out in the market right now.</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you think about the 10-year? What's the 10-year telling you?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, obviously there's a lot of fear and we've talked about fundamentals.</p><p>FRANCIS: Here it is right here.</p><p>FREEMAN: . you talk about Germany, you talk about Europe, not seeming to be sliding back into recession. U.S. consumer spending also is not good. But I think Ebola is also part of the fear factor today.</p><p>FRANCIS: Without question.</p><p>FREEMAN: Why shouldn't it be?</p><p>ANTE: I talked to a broker at JPMorgan, (Piven Kline) yesterday and they're actually advising their clients to buy into these dips. So that's just one major bank advising their wealthiest clients that, you know, that don't panic, you know, and that this is an opportunity over the long-term.</p><p>FRANCIS: Do you think it's an opportunity?</p><p>FREEMAN: I would discount the Ebola threat. I mean, definitely this is.</p><p>FRANCIS: You would or would not?</p><p>FREEMAN: I would. This is an economic catastrophe in those countries in Africa where tons of.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yeah, but here's why.</p><p>FRANCI: I think they're very easy to overreact to this.</p><p>GASPARINO: I suppose people, at least in a short-term for a quarter, stopped going to movie theaters, stopped flying.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: I mean, there's going to be a sizable economic impact because of this. I'm not saying it's real. I'm not saying this is.</p><p>FRANCIS: I don't know. I don't know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Are we away from that because they are talking about this, so now this second person that's contracted in the United States flew on Monday, they're talking about the 132 people that were on the plane with this person when they flew on Monday, tracking them down, who have they have been in contact with. She is now sick. I mean, it's.</p><p>GASPARINO: Melissa, a friend of mine went by the Dallas hub of Newark yesterday and it was empty. OK. I'm just telling you whether it's real, not real, whether we're overblown.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>GASPARINO: . it's having an impact.</p><p>FRANCIS: Really briefly though, I want to point out there is some green on the board. Shares of Time Warner climbing after CEO Jeff Bewkes announcing the company will more than double its earnings over the next several years. I mean, this is one of the stocks that's in the positive zone.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: . that's been getting some attention today. I don't want to totally ignore it.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>ANTE: And also HBO announced it's going to be selling content.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right.</p><p>ANTE: . over the web for the first time ever. It's something that skeptics of Time Warner never thought they would ever do. I think that's a positive sign.</p><p>GASPARINO: I agree. And that story is bigger. That story -- if we didn't have the market going down this much would be the big headline.</p><p>ANTE: I agree.</p><p>GASPARINO: HBO going what's known as over the top is huge game-changer for the cable industry. They're basically saying we're going to bypass cable and we're going to be -- that puts more control.</p><p>ANTE: With the content owners.</p><p>GASPARINO: . with the content owners.</p><p>ANTE: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: And here's the other thing. I think Jeff -- I think Bewkes. Whatever you said.</p><p>FRANCIS: Bewkes. Jeff Bewkes.</p><p>GASPARINO: I think he's a good CEO. Now, I know he turned down the Murdoch deal and, you know, our boss, Mr. Murdoch and he's going to be criticized for that because I don't think he'll be able to live up to his projections here. But low and behold, this guy is basically taking this company, he's squeezing it down and he's going to sell it to somebody.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. We're going to pause for a second.</p><p>FREEMAN: But where is the growth?</p><p>FRANCIS: We have a market right now that's down 395 points. 60 days, that is how long the United Nation says we have to tackle Ebola before it becomes something uncontainable. Do you trust the government to handle it? We are going to be speaking to Dr. Ben Carson on what realistically can be done.</p><p>Plus, how Ebola made its way on to a flight with frontier airlines?</p><p>More \"money,\" more answers. That's the big story. Coming up.</p><p>FRANCIS: Very steep declines across the board today in the market. The headlines are coming very fast.</p><p>The second Ebola identified. Lousy economic data weighing heavily. We just heard the latest from the Fed's Beige Book.</p><p>Let's go to Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. We also have Jo Ling Kent who is at the Nasdaq.</p><p>Nicole, let me start with you. Wild ride down there today.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: No doubt.</p><p>Melissa, what a wild ride this has been. You're talking about a thousand points that we've lost since last Wednesday's close.</p><p>Right now the Dow is down 380 points. We had been down 460 points, roughly a little less than that. And so you are seeing a broad-based selloff here. Everything is for sale. People are a little too nervous to take the risk. There's also some margin calls that maybe involved as well. But we are seeing some stocks that are shaving off some key numbers off the Dow Jones Industrial average.</p><p>So, three names, Goldman Sachs, Visa and Boeing actually accounting for about 100 points of the Dow's 375 points right now. So we can see Goldman down 3.7 percent, Visa down 2.6 percent and Boeing down 3.9 percent. It's also worth noting that Boeing itself is at a new low but big picture here, you're seeing all the major averages into negative territory for the year. The Dow, Nasdaq and the S&amp;P, it's only the transports that's really heading on. The Russell also has been negative for this year. But transports had a tough October, don't forget, but still positive for the year.</p><p>So the selling is broad-based, energy, financials, health care weak. Yeah.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, Jo, what are you seeing?</p><p>JO LING KEN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're looking at those big large caps, tech stocks of course here at the Nasdaq. They're all not doing terribly well here.</p><p>Take a look at Intel. Itself is down about 5 percent. It's shaving seven points off the Nasdaq composite right now. Vodafone also down quite a bit, one of the top losers of the hour here, Microsoft down as well as Expedia down 4 percent and of course apple down 2.6 percent, really dragging down some of these big tech stocks.</p><p>But although the Nasdaq overall right now is negative, the Nasdaq 100 continues to be positive just slightly for the year. So we're looking at all kinds of different global growth issues here. But Nasdaq 100 remains a silver lining for now.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right. Thank you so much. Thanks to both of you.</p><p>Airline stocks reacting after news that a second health care worker to contract Ebola flew a domestic flight from Cleveland to Dallas just two days ago. We are learning that the victim did have a low-grade fever when she was traveling on that flight. Although the carrier which was Frontier Airlines has disinfected the plane, twice. Could this be a real threat to travelers?</p><p>Joining me now is Tom Sullivan he is our resident pilot, we also have Charlie Gasparino and James Freeman back us.</p><p>Tom, let me start with you. What do you think about that?</p><p>TOM SULLIVAN, FOX BUSINESS: Well, the airlines say they disinfect the plane but really what they do is they vacuum and they clean the pockets out of -- so that when you get on the plane, the people that left their junk. It's not fair.</p><p>FRANCIS: You don't think they got on there with hazmat suits? And really like.</p><p>FREEMAN: . before cleaning on this one.</p><p>SULLIVAN: But full cleaning, what's full cleaning? We got these hazmat people. They have don't have hazmat people. They just have cleaners and they spray a little Lysol and wiped down the mirrors. That's all they do.</p><p>GASPARINO: Does Lysol kill Ebola? I mean, you know, part of the problem is we're not doctors.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: And I will say this. This just shows the folly and why the markets are trading low with all this baloney about the screenings. I mean, people can get through those screenings by lying, by taking Tylenol, if they have a fever so the fever goes down.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: If you really want to get through these screenings. It's like.</p><p>FRANCIS: Not only that.</p><p>GASPARINO: It's like -- I mean like say Ramzi Yousef got through a screening. That's.</p><p>FRANCIS: But the information that's being released changes because first we hear she flew but she had no symptoms. Now, we're hearing, \"She flew but she had a temperature of 99.5.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: . she was on the plane with 132 other passengers, you know, I mean it's -- this is what is making people so concerned and why it feels out of control.</p><p>SULLIVAN: These are medical people that should know that she was part of a group that was being monitored. She should know that you can't go traveling just like Dr. Nancy Snyderman should have known. What's wrong with these people? They're the professionals.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, James, go ahead.</p><p>FREEMAN: There's an argument that she shouldn't have traveled but we should remember that based on everything we know to this point, it is not that easy to transmit it. The two health care workers, it is concerning, you want to know everything how it happened but this is not like the flu. This is not like.</p><p>FRANCIS: It's not going to come here. You can't get it. It's not.</p><p>GASPARINO: James, I talked to doctors, OK, it's a lot harder to get than the flu because it is not really airborne.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: It's a lot easier to get, as I said, than hep C and AIDS. It's somewhere in the middle. There is a degree where casual contact does transmit this thing.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>GASPARINO: . we talk to doctors off the record.</p><p>FREEMAN: Here's the deal.</p><p>GASPARINO: . and that's a problem.</p><p>FREEMAN: OK. But you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Why is the U.S. saying that we have 60 days to get a hold of this thing before it gets really out of control?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, this points the issue of why you really don't want them to cut off air travel right now because the best way to fight this is to keep airplanes going in and out of West Africa to bring people with knowledge and skills.</p><p>SULLIVAN: No. I absolutely disagree.</p><p>FRANCIS: In and out? I mean, maybe.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCIS: Go ahead, Tom.</p><p>SULLIVAN: . then have the military fly them in, have charter flights bring them in but you don't need to put them on United Airlines and have them mix in with the populace.</p><p>GASPARINO: Listen, I mean, there's a part of me that does not want to like raise the specter of Armageddon here. I mean, that is an issue. I agree with James on that point. But I will tell you this, they don't know a lot about this disease. If you talk to doctors off the record, they really aren't sure about just how casual the contact has to be to catch it. So what does that mean? I mean, this is where this becomes an economic.</p><p>FRANCIS: Hang on. Hang on. You talk about cleaning the plan. The Frontier Airlines says Flight 1143, that was the number by the way, received a thorough cleaning per our normal procedures which is consistent with CDC guidelines prior to returning to service the next day. It was also cleaned again the next day in Cleveland.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yeah.</p><p>SULLIVAN: Yeah, but the flight came in around 6:00 at night. She shows up at midnight and says, \"I've got a problem here.\" So the plane that night overnighted in Dallas. So they went and again, they washed it down, they vacuumed. I'm sorry. I don't think that is the same. And the question then becomes did she use the restroom? Did she cough? Who was sitting next to her? Who was sitting in front and behind her? Those kinds of things, again, we don't know if she did in fact sneezed during the flight? We don't know.</p><p>FREEMAN: OK. There's a lot we don't know and it's true, there's very little in the medical literature. But everything we do know.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>FREEMAN: . so far is you don't get it by being in a room or playing with people's.</p><p>GASPARINO: James, James, James.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>GASPARINO: The woman got it from taking off her hazmat suit. I know that.</p><p>FRANCIS: All right.</p><p>FREEMAN: We're not sure how those.</p><p>FRANCIS: We got to go. We're going to have more on this later. I want to tell you right now. The market is down 331 points. So we are still down - - right. We are off the lows of the session. We've been down more than 400 points at the start of the show. Gaining back a little bit of ground, but we've seen this back and forth all day.</p><p>And a reminder that President Obama is meeting with White House officials today at three 3:30 to discuss the U.S. government's actions against ongoing Ebola threat. Fox Business will monitor this. We are going to bring you the remarks as we get them.</p><p>And the Fox Business exclusive scoop, David Asman is going to join us next with what the Fed is telling him directly. We're the only ones with this information.</p><p>Plus, plummeting oil prices may feel good at the pumps. But we're going to tell you who it's really going to hurt. In fact, we could be seeing it happen right now.</p><p>More \"money\" coming up. Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK</p><p>FRANCIS: Extreme declines for stocks. The Dow and the S&amp;P down more than 2 percent.</p><p>Our very own, David Asman has been speaking exclusively with Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, he joins us now. Charlie and James are back as well.</p><p>You have new headlines right now?</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Well, this is -- the back story of this conversation that I had with Richard Fisher was of course he is reluctant about going on air but he and I have relationships and he said -- and I told him -- I said, \"Charlie Gasparino, Steve Forbes, a lot of people are wondering.</p><p>GASPARINO: Then he said, \"Who the hell is Charlie Gasparino?\"</p><p>ASMAN: . are wondering whether there's going to be another QE as a result of this market downturn.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>ASMAN: He wanted to be absolutely clear that you could have a market downturn without having any need for QE. And he also wanted to be clear that it wasn't just him saying that.</p><p>FRANCIS: This is a big news right here. Go ahead.</p><p>ASMAN: He specifically said, whether it's me, Janet Yellen or the head of the European central bank and he spelled out to me Draghi, Draghi specifically, because there is a lot of pressure on Draghi right now to do a QE sort of thing in Europe. Draghi has been resisting and according to Richard Fisher, Draghi agrees with him that there's no need for QE that you can have a functioning economy without a QE. And in fact it's up to the politicians.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>ASMAN: . to do what's necessary to spur growth, not the central bank.</p><p>FRANCIS: This banner on the bottom of the screen right now is big. So I want to emphasize this. So he said to you that Yellen also agrees.</p><p>ASMAN: He said.</p><p>FRANCIS: . there is no need.</p><p>ASMAN: . whether it's me, Janet Yellen, the head of the European Central Bank and this is interesting, he wanted to make sure I got in the governor of the Bank of India. Apparently, there's been some questions whether India is going to through QE. He said, \"We do not need more monetary stimulus.\"</p><p>GASPARINO: OK. He basically ruled out Yellen doing a QE4.</p><p>ASMAN: He did. Well, what he did is he said that Janet Yellen and he agree on the fact that what's necessary for growth is fiscal reform, not monetary policy right now.</p><p>FRANCIS: What do you think of that?</p><p>FREEMAN: This is the best news we've heard all day, right? I mean, the.</p><p>ASMAN: Not with the market necessarily.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: It should be. Maybe not for every trader at this moment but generally, if there's now a realization that monetary policy can't do it, more money printing can't do it, you have to reform -- and this is the big problem in Europe.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: . and more so than the U.S. They have not reformed their economies.</p><p>GASPARINO: Right. You see, I.</p><p>FREEMAN: . that's why we're headed back.</p><p>GASPARINO: I'll be honest with you. I don't doubt that he said -- I know he said that to you. I doubt that Yellen is not.</p><p>FRANCIS: Sticks to that.</p><p>GASPARINO: Listen, think of it this way. She's President Obama's puppet to a certain extent.</p><p>ASMAN: Yeah.</p><p>GASPARINO: What does President Obama have in two years? He really wants to say, \"I took the market from six to 17.\" And without QE, this thing, I know it's bouncing back a little, actually it's going down again. This market.</p><p>ASMAN: Because you're talking.</p><p>GASPARINO: This market is not a very healthy market without more stimulus either by keeping rates where they are or doing another.</p><p>ASMAN: However, Janet Yellen is on record saying we do not take our cues from the stock market. If you believe that, perhaps as Charlie would say I've got a bridge in Brooklyn but that's what both she and Ben Bernanke have said. A lot of people disagree. In fact, Jon Hilsenrath who I have on in the 4:00 hour by the way to talk about all this did say -- he's the first person to say that they are looking for market cues.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>ASMAN: . the Fed is.</p><p>FRANCIS: But you and I both noticed earlier today Keith McCullough from Hedgeye was on and he shared something that that was very -- about this market that at some point, you know, the world realizes that zero plus zero doesn't equal anything greater than zero. Why did you like that?</p><p>ASMAN: Well, because of that fact that we've got close to zero interest rates. You can't have more zero interest rates create something else.</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>ASMAN: I mean, the zero interest rates haven't worked to help.</p><p>GASPARINO: OK. We know that but that.</p><p>ASMAN: We need fiscal reform.</p><p>GASPARINO: But some of this -- listen, of course and that -- those are two arguments though but there's a political argument. Can Hillary Clinton run in 2016 with Dow 12,000?</p><p>ASMAN: Good question.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK, all right.</p><p>ASMAN: Good question, Charlie.</p><p>FRANCIS: We're going to pause for a second. The search is on for a vaccine as the second person in the U.S. contracts Ebola. One of the nation's prominent research centers is on the hunt for a cure.</p><p>Plus, fears over the virus stirring a national debate. Dr. Ben Carson is here to sound off on the Ebola threat that it's facing the nation right now.</p><p>We've got a lot more. \"Piles of Money\" coming up. Don't go anywhere.</p><p>FRANCIS: The very latest now on Ebola. The CDC director speaking just moments ago.</p><p>Richard Edson is here with all of the headlines. Rich, what did you hear?</p><p>RICHARD EDSON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, Melissa, this is about a second confirmation of a case when testing positive, another health care worker at that Dallas hospital. She also flew on a flight from Cleveland to Dallas on October 13th so did showing symptoms on the 14th, CDC said she should have never flown and now they're implementing new procedures, they say, to prevent people because she did have contact with that first patient, Thomas Eric Duncan. And now the CDC saying it's also working with that hospital on its protocols.</p><p>DR. TOM FRIEDEN, CDC DIRECTOR: We're working very closely with the hospital in Dallas to promote a safe environment for the care of everyone at that hospital for the patients and for the health care workers. We have continued with our intensive investigation and interventions to understand what may have happened and to increase safety.</p><p>EDSON: This is the first live test of an Ebola vaccine every happening right here at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. They're testing a number of patients. This timeline at least for the initial stage its suppose to take until December that might seem like a long time but as doctors here say, that timeline has been moved up dramatically.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COL. SHON REMICH, WRAIR: Once the regulatory agency say that this is safe to move on to phase two then we'll progress from there. So the timeline is at this point being compressed but it's unclear when e product actually might hit the market. We took about six weeks to do. It would normally take in about six months.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: Canadian officials developed this. This is now been licensed to new link genetics in American based company. There's also another effort going on nearby at the National Institutes of Health that's in cooperation with GlaxoSmithKline, so very close here at Maryland, two different institutions, two very well renowned institutions working on a vaccine. I'm not saying racing on another but trying to get this out as quickly as possible.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>FRANCIS: Rich, thank you so much.</p><p>So with the latest in Ebola, it may seem like the situation is spiraling out of control. The United Nations it turns out would agree. The head of the U.N.'s Ebola Emergency Response says, \"The world as 60 days to get this situation under control or face an unprecedented situation.\" Those are their words.</p><p>Dr. Ben Carson is the former director of pediatric neurosurgery at John Hopkins Hospital, he's also a Fox News contributor and he joins me now. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>Let me ask you, what does that mean?</p><p>DR. BEN CARSON, FMR. JOHN HOPKINS HOSPITAL: My pleasure.</p><p>FRANCIS: We have 60 days to stop this. What does that mean? What does it look like to have stopped it?</p><p>CARSON: Well, they're just recognizing the exponential potential of this thing to spread. And, you know, it's just like if you take two and then multiply it by two, you keep doing that. It doesn't take you very long to get into some very, very large numbers.</p><p>And so they're just being realistic. You know, we've known for a long time that it had this kind of potential and that's the reason that several weeks ago I said it was a real mistake to bring infected people into this country in any way. Not because we don't have -- no, not because we don't have the protocols.</p><p>FRANCIS: I mean, now that's happened -- yes. Now that's happened and you mentioned the protocol and that's what they're blaming the situation now in Texas where we see that it has spread. They're calling it a breach in protocol. What do you think happened there?</p><p>CARSON: No. No, the problem is you have human beings. And when you have human beings involved, I don't care how good your protocol is, there are going to be breaches, there are going to be problems because people are not perfect. And, you know, in the case of that most recent person who's infected, flying on a airplane, I wonder if anybody told her that she couldn't fly on airplane. I suspect, probably not. We need to tighten those things up.</p><p>But most importantly right now, the people who have contracted it in this country, we need to determine exactly how they contracted it and we need to make sure that that door is closed and that no one else can contract it that way. There are some urgency involved there.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, let me ask you about that because now we're learning -- we're finally learning the name, we've heard it but now we're able to share the name of the patient, she's being identified, her name, you could see it there at the bottom of the screen, Amber Vinson. She is the one that flew -- 29 years old, she flew, at the time they thought she had no signs of symptoms, now we're learning that she had a temperature of 99.5 degrees, she flew on that flight 1193 from Cleveland to Dallas Fort Worth.</p><p>What is the danger in flying on a plane, Dr. Carson? Because we have heard a lot of debate about that that it's hard to get it, it's not just if she sneezes, it's not that big of a deal that she was on a plane. Other people as we've seen in the market today are worried. Where do you come down?</p><p>CARSON: Well, we don't have any evidence that it's spread by ways other than, you know, contact with bodily fluids. But if one were to be prudent, one we'd look at worse case scenarios and one would plan for worst case scenarios. We seem to always think of best case scenarios and then have to backtrack and say, \"Well, we were wrong.\" And that seems to be a general pattern here.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>CARSON: And that's very problematic.</p><p>FRANCIS: And speaking of that, I mean the CDC is saying now that they were not monitoring her at the time, when she showed these symptoms, when her temperature went up, when she got on this plane with more than a hundred other people, she was not being monitored. Does that make you nervous that there are other people out there right now who have symptoms.</p><p>CARSON: Of course.</p><p>FRANCIS: . who are not being monitored?</p><p>CARSON: Yeah, of course, it makes you very nervous. And, you know, if I were in charge, I would assemble, you know, the experts in this area very, very quickly. And I would say, \"Look guys and gals, you know, we need to figure out within a day or two.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>CARSON: . what we should be doing with all these people who have been exposed and we need to implement that right now.\" This is not a time for a great debate.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Can I ask you personally? I mean, how concerned are you personally? Are you flying on planes? Are you looking around? Are you concerned?</p><p>CARSON: I am flying on planes a lot but believe me, I wash my hands a lot, you know, if I go into the bathroom, I flush it with a piece of paper in my hand. I don't touch the handle. You have to be careful. There's no question.</p><p>FRANCIS: Dr. Carson, thank you for joining us today. We really appreciate your time.</p><p>CARSON: Always a pleasure.</p><p>FRANCIS: Steep declines for stocks continue right now, although we are down 300 points. We had been down, well, more than 400 so we are well off the lows of the session but still that is a big loss right now. We are hitting the trading floors with the very latest. That is coming up.</p><p>Also, oil flirting with $80 a barrel? You might be surprised who is really losing here. We're going to tell you. Coming up.</p><p>At the end of the day, it is al about \"money\".</p><p>FRANCIS: I'm Melissa Francis with your Fox Business Brief.</p><p>Japan is recalling nearly 1.7 million vehicles around the world. That includes Corolla and Lexus models, Toyota says it is worried about faulty brakes but it thinks no injuries have occurred so far.</p><p>Gap is making a huge push this holiday season. Employing in extra 63,000 temporary workers, it is one of the largest seasonal hires of any retailer. It is even more than Walmart at the Gap. That is very optimistic.</p><p>And U.S. drug maker AbbVie is reconsidering its takeover of European rival Shire. That is after treasury proposals to severely limit the move of U.S. companies overseas. Investors weren't expecting AbbVie to backtrack and Shire stock sank the most in 12 years.</p><p>That's the latest from the Fox Business Network, giving you the power to prosper.</p><p>FRANCIS: Stocks coming back off the worst levels of the day at the low. The Dow was down 457 points. Right now, you can see it's down 293 points, that's good by comparison.</p><p>Let's go to Nicole Petallides in the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. China, you know, look at the bright side of this one, Nicole.</p><p>PETALLIDES: Yeah, right, the silver lining. I mean, you're in the 15,000 range at one point right now, Dow nearly 300. You're basically seeing all 10 sectors lower. The Dow is down 1.8 percent right now up off the lows of the day with Visa, Goldman Sachs, Boeing together still accounting for about 85 negative Dow points.</p><p>Also, I want you to take a look at the VIX, the ViX now above the 31 level, right, to move to 31. You can see right now it's up about 20.5 percent. So for the people who bet the VIX, because there are people who'd do that. It is really well.</p><p>But what's interesting, Melissa, as I toss it back to you and I think there and I know they're selling across the board is the question of when people are going to buy. And some are saying there's just not enough fear in the market yet to say, \"I'm ready to get it.\" And so people still seem a little tepid and a little nervous to say, \"I'm going to buy in here.\"</p><p>FRANCIS: Not enough fear in the market.</p><p>PETALLIDES: Right.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yes, on a daylight, that's an amazing.</p><p>PETALLIDES: An idea like it's almost that there needs to be more of a cleanse, I don't know how many.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah. Total capitulation. Yeah.</p><p>PETALLIDES: Yeah. All right, Nicole, thank you so much.</p><p>Oil prices down, they are not out there crude dropping all the way to $80 a barrel before climbing back a little bit here. It is been Roscoe oil down 10 percent in the past month alone. You may be surprised whose really getting hurt by cheap oil.</p><p>Let's bring in trader Scott Shellady at the CME, James is here as well.</p><p>I mean, of course this is fantastic news for drivers. Everybody who's filled up lately is very excited about this. We wanted to point to the other side of the trade, because there's some interesting folks in the other side, the most obvious of which is certainly the Saudis.</p><p>Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is talking about the catastrophe in oil prices and the fact that he thinks the Saudi oil minister isn't serious enough and isn't worried enough about this decline.</p><p>Scott, what do you think?</p><p>SCOTT SHELLADY, CME GROUP: I think there's kind of a story underneath here that says they're trying to try that even the U.S. producers out of business. They want to see how low they could go and I think that our numbers are rounded $60 a barrel. They want to push it down there to start to really -- they want to give us some pain. So there is a little bit of a fight under here that we're not really seeing.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>SHELLADY: But I think that there could be something there about pushing it low to hurt us, not them.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, that's an interesting point of view and, James, we'll ask you about that because we were looking at Ali Al-Naimi there on the screen who is the Saudi oil minister next to Prince Alwaleed and, you know, that for shale, so there's been a huge shale revolution here in the U.S. but the breakeven price is said to be $80 to $85 on Brent.</p><p>Do you think it's possible that these guys are trying to drive the shale drillers here in the U.S. out of business?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, you can come up with a lot of theories. Vladimir Putin thinks that.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: . this is aimed at him. And I think -- I see a lot of upside here and not just people driving their cars, it's everyone who's using petroleum to create products, so do all kinds of commerce, the people who are hurt the most are not the U.S. frackers there. As we said, Putin's Russia, Venezuela, they all have budgets built on very high oil prices.</p><p>So basically what you're doing is you're squeezing the world's dictators.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: . while you get U.S. consumers in business as a price cut.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, that's a great point. That's a great point. And, Scott, I mean, what do you think about that, because you look at the price decline there. You know, every dollar decline that we see in the price of oil translates to about $2 billion in losses for Putin and for Russia.</p><p>What do you think, Scott?</p><p>SHELLADY: And I think that, you know, I think that that could -- it could be a little bit self-centered on their behalf but at the end of the day, it's about the dollar and I think that oil still is a harbor chair for the economy and the economy is not doing well. I don't think these low oil prices are going to port over to better retail sales and a better economy. I think the reason why -- A lot of the reason why oil is going down is the consumer just doesn't have that money anymore and we've started to see some of these retail sales numbers like today coming in.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>SHELLADY: . a little weak and it's going to continue that way.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>SHELLADY: The worst is yet to come. The worst is yet to come.</p><p>FRANCIS: On that, you know, we're going to leave the segment, thank you so much Scott and James.</p><p>We are keeping a very close eye in the market. The Dow right now is down 302 points. What do you do with your money right now? The trader and the money manager's take. We've got that next.</p><p>You can never have too much \"money\", that is for sure.</p><p>FRANCIS: Stocks still in the red as the Dow suffers its steepest intraday decline in almost three years.</p><p>Here with some advice for your money is Alan Knuckman from Bulls-eye Options, we also have Dominic Tavella from Diversified Financial</p><p>Dominic, you want to be the voice of reason. Go ahead.</p><p>DOMINIC TAVELLA, DIVERSIFIED FINANCIAL FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT: Look, these headlines are scary for people and I'm not really talking about the guys sitting at his office or at home and going, \"I'm going to rebalance my 401K Com, I broke -- let's be reasonable here. There are more people that die in this country from the flu, 25,000 people a year that have died so far. No one, no one's died from Ebola American in this country so far</p><p>The U.S. is growing. We're probably around 3 percent. China, India, growing about 4 percent or 7 percent.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>TAVELLA: . that's 65 percent of the world GDP.</p><p>FRANCIS: So, Alan, I mean that sounds very rational. Why then at the OPEC do we see just a washout?</p><p>ALAN KNUCKMAN, BULLS-EYE OPTION: I think people get a lot of information and have a difficulty processing it. The fundamentals haven't changed just like we stated. Right now, we've got record low interest rates plunging here the 10-year notes, bouncing off at 2 percent. We were worried about rates going up. That's not going to happen. Earning here is still fantastic, oil prices are going down. So all these things are positive fundamentals but the markets get overdone because of psychology, everybody was worried about a selloff.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>KNUCKMAN: . and now they've got something to worry about.</p><p>FRANCIS: Let me challenge you though, are you sure that the fundamentals haven't changed? I mean, you look at the data coming out of Germany, you look at the data coming out of China, there is a slowdown going on elsewhere around the world. How is it not going to be contagious here in the U.S. where we're seeing a bit of growth, but not much? Dominic?</p><p>TAVELLA: So let's focus on energy, right, which I think is a fantastic story. It's estimated that between $75 billion and $100 billion will come back to the consumer because of lower energy prices. That's equal to the Obama tax increase last year. So consumers are going to get that back in their pocket just in time for Christmas, that's going to help our economy.</p><p>FRANCIS: Alan, what do you think about that? I mean, is that enough or it is the reason why oils lower because everything is slowing down around the world and people aren't driving as much because they don't have money and they're not going to out shopping and they're not going out to do things. Go ahead.</p><p>KNUCKMAN: I think it's nothing but a benefit but I think that if you want to look at Europe slowing, that's going to make our markets more attractive in the long-run.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>KNUCKMAN: So from my standpoint, I'm looking at scaling back in here. I was surprised, I didn't think the market could go straight down for three weeks but, you know, I got knocked out following my plan but we can always get back in with a clear head and I think that's where we have to look at here.</p><p>FRANICS: Gentlemen, thanks to both of you.</p><p>No doubt this has been a tough day for the marketer. Our very own Liz Claman is here to give us a preview of what's coming up in the next and most important hour of trading.</p><p>Liz.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: I love to tell you earlier, I said, \"It looks better. It's down 280 points.\"</p><p>FRANCIS: Right.</p><p>CLAMAN: Listen, perspective at the moment.</p><p>FRANCIS: Take improvements.</p><p>CLAMAN: That's exactly what we're going to give you in this final hour in which we know anything can happen. We could see in an acceleration to the downside or we could see a fight back to at least getting closer to the green. So we're going to take you to every index trading floor that matters. We're talking to traders. We're talking of money experts as we look at the markets right now. It is pretty much a mess at the moment. We do have the S&amp;P down 30 points, the Nasdaq down 53. It is truly just a lot of red on the screen but we wouldn't exactly call it a complete capitulation. You were addressing that too.</p><p>So we've got two experts here. One of them runs a fund, the Hennessey Funds which is actually over the past 10 years during which we know there's been so much going on returned an annual live 10 percent. So David Raney is important to hear from right now, he's a good investor. James Bianco of Bianoc Research, he's going to be talking specifically about the technical levels you need to worry about the most and are we seeing capitulation? He is the man to be answering that.</p><p>And at this point, when we have seen the 10-year yield fall below 2 percent earlier today, why not just buy Intel. Look at the Intel yield, 2.8 percent. First on Fox Business interview with the Dow component CEO Brian Krzanich, he is going to come right here on Fox, I'm going to ask him all of this global turmoil. They do 80 percent of their business outside the U.S. Is that going to affect the current quarter? That may mean a lot to all technology investments.</p><p>Plus, they have a brand new phone/tablet, a two in one that just rolled out with ASUS but it's got that Intel chip in it. Wait until you see this thing. It's called the PadFone, we're talking to Brian about all that and so much more at first on Fox Business. See you at the top of the hour.</p><p>FRANCIS: We look forward to it, Liz. Thank you so much.</p><p>CLAMAN: You got it.</p><p>Netflix prepares for earnings, but in these cell streaming device, it could be hurting its bottom-line.</p><p>At the end of the day, it is all about \"money\".</p><p>FRANCIS: President Obama delaying his fundraising and campaign events today so that he can remain at the White House for a meeting with cabinet members on Ebola just moments ago.</p><p>White House Press Secretary John Earnest saying the president felt like he needed to be in the White House to fulfill his responsibilities. We're going to bring you any updates as we have them. That's a switch from the past by the way.</p><p>Netflix set to report a third-quarter earnings after the Belden stock came session lows after HBO announced it will launch a stand-alone streaming service for next year.</p><p>Our very own Jo Ling Kent is at the Nasdaq, James and Spencer back as well.</p><p>Jo, tell me about Netflix right now. What's it doing?</p><p>KENT: Well, it's down a little less than 1 percent. Now, like you said off the session lows, we're expecting an EPS of 93 cents of share, (inaudible) looking for a revenue of $1.41 billion. But there could be a silver lining here if HBO continues to be competitive to Netflix. Of all the people who are cutting quarters, maybe they'll migrate to Netflix as well.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah, interesting. Spencer, what do you think about Netflix after the bell and what do you think about the competition from HBO here?</p><p>ANTE: You know, honestly, I'm surprised that Netflix is not down more than 1 percent and change right now, you know, because HBO is saying they're going over the top is definitely the single biggest new competitor and threat they face when HBO releases that service in 2015.</p><p>So I think that people maybe underestimating the power of.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK.</p><p>ANTE: . this new service.</p><p>FRANCIS: James?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yeah, I think it suggests maybe questions about whether HBO can execute. As far as Netflix, obviously, they're priced for a lot of growth in the future. They have to pay a lot for programming, whether they can keep that edge in terms of user friendly experience.</p><p>FRANCIS: Yeah.</p><p>FREEMAN: Big question.</p><p>FRANCIS: OK. Thanks to all three of you. Stay tuned at Fox Business, we're going to have live coverage of Netflix earnings on \"After the Bell\" coming straight after this. That is all we have for now. I hope that you are somehow making money today. The market is down 279. It was much worse earlier. Stay tuned.</p><p>Liz Claman in \"Countdown\" starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONEY-2014101501cb230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DCG-6751-DXH2-62GW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8224\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MONEY</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>October 15, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Reserve</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Beige Book</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CDC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ebola</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Richard Fisher</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Market</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amber Vinson</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Oil</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Saudi</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>US Federal Reserve System</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwQTBCNEI1REYxNDExMDgzQzVBNTc4NzgwN0YzQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTEzMzQzODVBMzEzNDczMEE1ODM5N0REMTc3QzFDMkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

But investors must beware of the lack of balance in the stock markets. </p><p>\"A failure to recognise how unevenly distributed the gains are could prove to be a costly mistake.\"Not all stocks represent the same opportunities as others. Investors must bear this imbalance in mind.\"Indeed, the equities boom is driven by a handful of companies, mainly in Big Tech, which are accounting for a significant and disproportionate level of the capitalisation of stock indexes, including the benchmark S&amp;P500 index.\"Therefore, buying an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, which are investment funds traded on stock exchanges, could, says the deVere CEO, expose investors unnecessarily.Nigel Green concludes: \"The Fed's announcement could provide investors with lucrative rewards - but in these unusual times, serious and joined-up planning is required to take full advantage of the opportunities. Working with an experienced fund manager will best-position them to capitalize on these and also to mitigate potential risks of uneven markets.\"e:<br/>t: +44 207 1220 925<br/>Twitter: @PriorConsultsdeVere Group is one of the world's largest independent advisors of specialist global financial solutions to international, local mass affluent, and high-net-worth clients.

The Fed board approved the decision by a 4-to-1 vote Friday, but it wasn't announced until Monday.</p><p>The announcement could pit the Fed against some of the country's biggest banks, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, which have  developed rival technology and fear that Silicon Valley companies could use the Fed system to push their way further into the banking world.</p><p>America's payment system lags behind that of many parts of the world, and U.S. banks are concerned about being left behind, said Aaron Klein, the policy director for the Center on Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. \"I think some of the large banks don't want to be the taxi medallions and be uberized,\" he said, a reference to the impact of ride hailing on taxi owners. \"The rest of the world went to real-time payments a long time ago.\"</p><p>The Fed's announcement comes as big technology companies are finding other ways into the banking world. Wall Street has raised concerns about Facebook's efforts to create an alternative global currency system, known as Libra. Meanwhile, Square, the mobile payment company, and Rakuten, known as the Amazon of Japan and operator of U.S. rewards program Ebates, have applied for a special banking license that would allow the companies to offer checking and savings accounts.</p><p>In 2005, Walmart waged a two-year battle for a similar bank charter but withdrew its application after small banks objected. But more than a decade later, Silicon Valley may pose a bigger threat to the stranglehold banking industry holds on key parts of the financial world.</p><p>Big tech companies could use the Fed's new service to gain direct access to the payment system, bypassing banks that now act as a gatekeeper, said Greg Baer, chief executive of the Bank Policy Institute, which represents the country's biggest banks.</p><p>The tech industry would like the Federal Reserve to give non-banks more access to the payment system, said Brian Peters, executive director of Financial Innovation Now, a lobbying group that includes Apple, Amazon and Google. But that is not likely to happen without congressional approval and is not why the industry supports the Fed developing its own service, he said. \"At this point, we just want to make our payment system work faster,\" Peters said.</p><p>For decades, banks flew planes across the country filled with paper checks ready to be processed. Now, depositing a check is as simple as snapping a photo with your phone.</p><p>But there is still often a delay of a couple of days before the money is deposited into an account, a frustrating feature of America's antiquated payment system, industry experts say.</p><p>The electronic payment system was built in the 1960s with physical checks in mind, not splitting a dinner bill with friends on a mobile phone app, they say. Retailers bundled physical checks into batches before taking them to the bank to be processed. That same type of process is now used for electronic payments.</p><p>The Fed decision to develop its service was cheered by community banks, credit unions and big tech companies that were weary of depending on a system developed by big banks.</p><p>\"Community bankers, we did it!\" Rebeca Romero Rainey, chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America,  said in a blog post Monday, adding that the decision would \"avoid a megabank monopoly.\"</p><p>\"I'm glad to see the Fed is heeding our calls to act, and that the American people will soon have a payments system that works for them,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who co-sponsored legislation directing the Federal Reserve to develop a real-time payments system.</p><p>The Federal Reserve is requesting comments on how its new service  should be designed. It is unclear how much it will cost to build.</p><p>The Fed will probably meet resistance from the big banks as it develops its service. The Clearing House, which is owned by 24 of the country's largest financial institutions, spent millions of dollars building a system that brings the typical processing time from a few days to less than five seconds, said Steve Ledford, a senior vice president at the company.</p><p>Launched in 2017, the real-time payments system is used in 16 of the 10,000 banks and credit unions across the country.</p><p>If the Fed develops a rival technology that could slow adoption across the industry, Ledford said in an interview before the announcement Monday. \"The numbers are ramping up,\" he said, but \"one of the complicating factors has been this Fed potential to move into the market.\"</p><p>The Fed's vice chair of supervision, Randal Quarles, the lone dissenting vote on the board, appeared to side with the big banks.</p><p>\"I do not see a strong justification for the Federal Reserve to move into this area and crowd out innovation when viable private-sector alternatives are available,\" Quarles said in a statement.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:renae.merle@washpost.com\">renae.merle@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-38f794fe-b7c6-11e9-b3b4-2bb69e8c4e39</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRP-DJR1-DXXY-31T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"926\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 6, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Now, depositing a check is as simple as snapping a photo with your phone.</p><p>But there is still often a delay of a couple of days before the money is deposited into an account, a frustrating feature of America's antiquated payment system, industry experts say.</p><p>The electronic payment system was built in the 1960s with physical checks in mind, not splitting a dinner bill with friends on a mobile phone app, they say. Retailers bundled physical checks into batches before taking them to the bank to be processed. That same type of process is now used for electronic payments.</p><p>The Fed decision to develop its service was cheered by community banks, credit unions and big tech companies that were weary of depending on a system developed by big banks.</p><p>\"Community bankers, we did it!\" Rebeca Romero Rainey, chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America,  said in a blog post Monday, adding that the decision would \"avoid a megabank monopoly.\"</p><p>\"I'm glad to see the Fed is heeding our calls to act, and that the American people will soon have a payments system that works for them,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who co-sponsored legislation directing the Federal Reserve to develop a real-time payments system.</p><p>The Federal Reserve is requesting comments on how its new service  should be designed. It is unclear how much it will cost to build.</p><p>The Fed will probably meet resistance from the big banks as it develops its service. The Clearing House, which is owned by 24 of the country's largest financial institutions, spent millions of dollars building a system that brings the typical processing time from a few days to less than five seconds, said Steve Ledford, a senior vice president at the company.</p><p>Launched in 2017, the real-time payments system is used in 16 of the 10,000 banks and credit unions across the country.</p><p>If the Fed develops a rival technology that could slow adoption across the industry, Ledford said in an interview before the announcement Monday. \"The numbers are ramping up,\" he said, but \"one of the complicating factors has been this Fed potential to move into the market.\"</p><p>The Fed's vice chair of supervision, Randal Quarles, the lone dissenting vote on the board, appeared to side with the big banks.</p><p>\"I do not see a strong justification for the Federal Reserve to move into this area and crowd out innovation when viable private-sector alternatives are available,\" Quarles said in a statement.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:renae.merle@washpost.com\">renae.merle@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-38f794feb7c611e9b3b42bb69e8c4e39</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRP-8SS1-DYX1-H53X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"926\"/><timeReceived>11:56 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 6, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Lael Brainard during a speech before the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.</p><p>The new service, FedNow, is expected to launch by 2024 and would allow banks to nearly instantaneously move money into customers' accounts, she said. The Fed board approved the decision by a 4-to-1 vote Friday, but it wasn't announced until Monday.</p><p>The announcement could pit the Fed against some of the country's biggest banks, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, who have already developed rival technology and fear that Silicon Valley companies could use the Fed system to push their way further into the banking world.</p><p>America's payment system lags behind many parts of the world, and U.S. banks are concerned about being left behind, said Aaron Klein, the policy director for the Center on Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. \"I think some of the large banks don't want to be the taxi medallions and be uberized,\" he said, a reference to the impact of ride hailing on taxi owners. \"The rest of the world went to real-time payments a long time ago.\"</p><p>The Fed's announcement comes at a time when big technology companies are finding other ways into the banking world. Wall Street has raised concerns about Facebook's efforts to create an alternate global currency system, known as Libra. Meanwhile, Square, the mobile payment company, and Rakuten, known as the Amazon of Japan and operator of U.S. rewards program Ebates, have applied for a special banking license that would allow the companies to offer checking and savings accounts.</p><p>In 2005, Walmart waged a two-year battle for a similar bank charter but withdrew its application after small banks objected. But more than a decade later, Silicon Valley may pose a bigger threat to the stranglehold banking industry holds on key parts of the financial world.</p><p>Big tech companies could use the Federal Reserve's new service to gain direct access to the payment system, bypassing banks that currently act as a gatekeeper, said Greg Baer, chief executive of the Bank Policy Institute, which represents the country's biggest banks.</p><p>The tech industry would like the Federal Reserve to give non-banks more access to the payment system, said Brian Peters, executive director of Financial Innovation Now, a lobbying group that includes Apple, Amazon and Google.

That is in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states also are considering more aggressive protections. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control about the use of their personal data - where they've been, what they view, who their friends are - and the powerful companies that mine the information for profit. </p><p>During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law simply could be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail\" for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive\" federal statute. </p><p>Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications told senators they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent\" state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling about privacy in April, was not present at the hearing. </p><p>Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation\" to provide meaningful consumer protections. </p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety about safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.\" </p><p>An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control about how broadband companies such as AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information. </p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African-Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings. </p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumer data: how it is collected, used, kept, shared and sold. </p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons. </p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they have collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information. </p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data. </p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it is strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry. </p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement. The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\" </p><p>The Trump White House said last summer the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties. </p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPRESS-VA0082501947</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPRESS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TD3-4PY1-JBM5-R1RD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">173096</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"847\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Daily Press, Inc.

That is in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states also are considering more aggressive protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control about the use of their personal data -- where they've been, what they view, who their friends are -- and the powerful companies that mine the information for profit.</p><p>During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law simply could be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail\" for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive\" federal statute.</p><p>Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications told senators they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent\" state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling about privacy in April, was not present at the hearing.</p><p>Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation\" to provide meaningful consumer protections.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety about safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.\"</p><p>An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control about how broadband companies such as AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African-Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumer data: how it is collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they have collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it is strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement. The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"</p><p>The Trump White House said last summer the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties.</p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. ct18 0012 180930 N S 0000000000 00003197</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: (Facebook and Whatsapp apps.)

That is in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states also are considering more aggressive protections. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control about the use of their personal data - where they've been, what they view, who their friends are - and the powerful companies that mine the information for profit. </p><p>During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law simply could be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail\" for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive\" federal statute. </p><p>Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications told senators they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent\" state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling about privacy in April, was not present at the hearing. </p><p>Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation\" to provide meaningful consumer protections. </p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety about safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.\" </p><p>An early move in President <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control about how broadband companies such as AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information. </p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African-Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings. </p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumer data: how it is collected, used, kept, shared and sold. </p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons. </p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they have collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information. </p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data. </p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it is strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry. </p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement. The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\" </p><p>The Trump White House said last summer the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties. </p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNSEN-FL0082594072</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNSEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TCM-DH61-DY37-F07V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144570</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Sentinel Communications Co.

That is in contrast to stricter European rules that took effect in May and a California law that takes effect in 2020. Other states also are considering more aggressive protections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However it works out, any regulatory push will find it challenging to reconcile the concerns of privacy advocates who want people to have more control about the use of their personal data -- where they've been, what they view, who their friends are -- and the powerful companies that mine the information for profit.</p><p>During a Senate hearing Wednesday, several Democratic senators warned that a national law simply could be used to override state efforts. Calling that pre-emption the \"Holy Grail\" for the industry, Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii said it won't get the bipartisan support it needs if the goal is merely to replace California's law with a weaker, \"non-progressive\" federal statute.</p><p>Senior executives from AT&amp;T, Amazon, Apple, Google, Twitter and Charter Communications told senators they support a federal proposal that could negate \"inconsistent\" state privacy laws. Facebook, which faced a major congressional grilling about privacy in April, was not present at the hearing.</p><p>Apple, which doesn't rely on advertising for revenue, was the most vocal in support of a stronger federal law. Bud Tribble, Apple's vice president of software technology, said the bar would have to be \"high enough in the federal legislation\" to provide meaningful consumer protections.</p><p>The Senate Commerce Committee hearing comes amid increasing anxiety about safeguarding consumers' data online and recent scandals that have stoked outrage among users and politicians. The committee's chairman, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said Republicans and Democrats now want to reach consensus on a national privacy law that \"will help consumers, promote innovation, reward organizations with little to hide and force shady practitioners to clean up their act.\"</p><p>An early move in President Donald Trump's tenure set the tone on data privacy. He signed a bill into law in April 2017 that allows internet providers to sell information about their customers' browsing habits. The legislation scrapped Obama-era online privacy rules aimed at giving consumers more control about how broadband companies such as AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon share that information.</p><p>Allie Bohm, policy counsel at the consumer group Public Knowledge, said examples abound of companies not only using the data to market products but also to profile consumers and restrict who sees their offerings: African-Americans not getting access to ads for housing, minorities and older people excluded from seeing job postings.</p><p>What is needed, privacy advocates maintain, is legislation to govern the entire \"life cycle\" of consumer data: how it is collected, used, kept, shared and sold.</p><p>The 28-nation European Union put in strict new rules this spring that require companies to justify why they're collecting and using personal data gleaned from phones, apps and visited websites. Companies also must give EU users the ability to access and delete data, and to object to data use under one of the claimed reasons.</p><p>A similar law in California will compel companies to tell customers upon request what personal data they have collected, why it was collected and what types of third parties have received it. Companies will be able to offer discounts to customers who allow their data to be sold and to charge those who opt out a reasonable amount, based on how much the company makes selling the information.</p><p>Andrew DeVore, Amazon's vice president and associate general counsel, told the Senate panel Wednesday that it should consider the \"possible unintended consequences\" of California's approach. For instance, he said the state law defines personal information too broadly such that it could include all data.</p><p>The California law doesn't take effect until 2020 and applies only to California consumers, but it could have fallout effects on other states. And it is strong enough to have rattled Big Tech, which is seeking a federal data-privacy law that would be more lenient toward the industry.</p><p>\"A national privacy framework should be consistent throughout all states, pre-empting state consumer-privacy and data security laws,\" the Internet Association said in a recent statement. The group represents about 40 big internet and tech companies, spanning Airbnb and Amazon to Zillow. \"A strong national baseline creates clear rules for companies.\"</p><p>The Trump White House said last summer the administration is working on it, meeting with companies and other interested parties.</p><p>The goal is a policy \"that is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity,\" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. ct18 0010 180930 R S 0000000000 00005891</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: (Facebook and Whatsapp icons displayed on an iPhone) MARIE WALDMANN/PHOTOTHEK</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo(s)5130</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHTRIB-180929358842716</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHTRIB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TCM-DBM1-DXY8-V324-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8119</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Chicago Tribune Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 30, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00027JF</classCode><className>CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001PB0</classCode><className>COMCAST CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The federal heritage minister says if new tools are needed to get digital giants to pay for Canadian content, they will be built. Steven Guilbeault says he is watching how other countries are trying to get companies such as Facebook and Google to pay for the copyrighted content that appears on their online platforms.</p><p>Australia and France have moved ahead on measures to help domestic media outlets, which often say they are losing ad money to international digital giants. With a global decline in ad dollars due to the COVID-19 pandemic, calls are growing louder for Canada to follow suit. Guilbeault says Australia and France have regulatory or legislative options that might not be on the table in Canada.</p><p>But he told the House of Commons industry committee Monday night that he is reviewing what is, or what might be needed. Facebook and Google have both said they are strong supporters of local journalism, pointing to related funds and causes they support in the countries where they have a presence. But Guilbeault says the government is still examining the issue closely. \"We've said for many months that we want the web giants to do their fair share, and clearly right now they're not,\" he said in response to a question from fellow Liberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith. \"If we can use existing tools to make that happen, we will, and if we need to create new tools, we will.\" Earlier this month, several Canadian publishers</p><p>banded together and published an open letter demanding the government force digital companies to share advertising revenues with Canadian media outlets. While the sector was already struggling ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic, a dramatic decline in advertising revenue has placed significant additional pressure on the companies. One estimate suggests 50 community newspapers have closed since the outbreak of the pandemic, with 100 media outlets making cuts to operations in sixweek period.</p><p>As many as 2,000 people have also lost their jobs, indicates an analysis conducted by the local news research project at Ryerson University's School of Journalism, the journalism news site J-Source and the Canadian Association of Journalists. In March, the Liberal government announced a $30-million ad campaign for COVID-19 awareness as a stop-gap measure as it moves to roll out additional support to the media industry in the form of tax credits announced last year. Guilbeault said the ads were placed in more than 900 newspapers, on 500 radio and television stations and in 12 different languages. Altogether, 97 per cent of the money was spent in Canadian media, he said. He did not say where the remaining three per cent of funds were spent. Both Facebook and Google have, in the past, pointed to their own financial support of local journalism, both in Canada and other countries.</p><p>Facebook has given US$5,000 grants to around 80 Canadian news outlets in recent weeks as part of a major financial effort to support COVID-19 related journalism here and in the United States. Google has also allocated funds from its news initiative program to some Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press. Facebook and Google did not immediately respond for comment.

Already, about another million additional  comments have been submitted.</p><p>Those totals were boosted by last week's online \"Day of Action\" conducted by tech companies and liberal privacy rights organizations that support the Net neutrality regulations, as well as opposing comments from those in favor of overturning the rules.</p><p>Big tech companies including Amazon, Google and Microsoft argue rolling back the rules will give Internet providers too much flexibility to favor some content and to charge more for others.</p><p>That fear ruled the day two years ago, when the FCC passed rules preventing Internet service providers (ISPs) from throttling or blocking content online and prohibited ISPs from prioritizing content, including their own, over other content, possibly for payment.</p><p>President Obama urged then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler to use certain rules that harken back to the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure the agency's regulatory authority.</p><p>New rules were needed because the agency's previous 2010 Open Internet order was tossed out of court in 2014 after a legal challenge by Verizon.</p><p>Even before he was a presidential candidate, President Trump criticized Obama's move, and, three months ago, current FCC Chairman and Trump appointee Ajit Pai said he would begin a new rule-making process to consider the overturning of the 2015 rules, calling them overly burdensome for ISPs. The commission approved the proposal 2-1 at its May 18 meeting.</p><p>Pai and his supporters -- including the big telecom and cable companies -- argued that the rules unfairly targeted Internet providers, prompting them to hold back on investments in broadband in underserved areas, such as rural America.</p><p>Companies from Amazon to Zynga chimed in just before the deadline -- Amazon filed its own comments Monday, and both companies (Amazon and Zynga) were listed on a filing by the Internet Association (other members include Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Pandora, Spotify, Twitter and Uber).</p><p>In that letter, more than three dozen companies called for \"strong and enforceable Net neutrality rules ... that ban blocking, throttling, paid prioritization and other discriminatory practices.\"</p><p>AT&amp;T, Comcast and other ISPs filed comments supporting the repeal of the current rules, echoing Pai's concerns that Title II -- the portion of the 1934 Communications Act on which the 2015 rules rely -- was written to deal with monopoly telephone service.</p><p>The issue has become highly politicized, with players on both sides of the issue crying foul over the comment process.</p><p>Pro-Net neutrality regulation supporters claimed to find 450,000 fake anti-Net neutrality comments among the filings.</p><p>Similarly, proponents of overturning the rules claimed more than 550,000 pro-Net neutrality comments were made from the same email address, from an address that didn't correspond to the name in the comment or were from a fake email generator. <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>photo Chip Somodevilla, Getty Images</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-92484943</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P2D-C9F1-DYRR-905C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Gannett Company, Inc.

Big Tech can't seem to go one month without becoming involved in some new data privacy scandal, but this time, Google parent Alphabet has outdone itself.  Yesterday, WSJ[3] broke a story about a deal between Alphabet and Ascension Health System, a Catholic non-profit that operates hospitals and nursing homes in 21 states and Washington DC. Ascension has more than 2,600 facilities, but its data - including critical patient data - is presently spread across 40 data centers in more than a dozen states. </p><p> But thanks to a deal between the two organizations that spawned Google's \"Project Nightingale\", all of that data are being moved into Google's cloud, and Google engineers are working on a system that they say could revolutionize how doctors use patient health data to make diagnoses.    The only problem, is some regulators have expressed concerns that the patient data aren't being properly protected, or that Google might illegally use the data to hone its ad micro-targeting. The sensitive health data of millions of Americans would be quite a score.  And there's reason to be suspicious: Without notifying patients or doctors, Ascension recently started sharing personally identifiable information on millions of patients with Google. The data include: patients' names and dates of birth; lab tests; doctor diagnoses; medication and hospitalization history; and some billing claims and other clinical records.  Now, the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services is investigating the arrangement to see if \"this mass collection of individuals' medical records to ensure that HIPAA protections were fully implemented.\"  For those who are unfamiliar with the term, HIPAA protections are the same rights that prevent doctors from giving out patients' information without their authorization.  Some Ascension patients who spoke with WSJ[4] said they were suspicious of Google's motives, since, according to its agreement with Ascension, Google is responsible for building the infrastructure, then Ascension will pay Google to manage the data after the project is completed.    Patients are worried that Google might find another payout somewhere else by using their data to court advertisers.  \"Google is not doing this out of the goodness of their heart,\" said Tim Wiesner, a 63-year-old retired nurse and Ascension patient in Wichita, Kan. He said he was disappointed not to have been notified of the data sharing directly by his doctor. \"It just seems deceitful. I'm sure they are going to make money off our information.\"  One academic agreed with the patients, adding that \"the optics are bad.\"  \"The optics are bad. The legal argument is tenuous. Ethically, this is a bad strategy. They need to tell people what they are doing,\" said Ellen Wright Clayton, a professor of biomedical ethics at Vanderbilt University. She said theAlphabetInc.unit risks running afoul of the rules if it uses the health data to perform independent research outside the direct scope of patient care.  Some lawmakers have expressed reservations about 'Nightingale', and have asked Google to suspend the project.  \"The optics are bad. The legal argument is tenuous. Ethically, this is a bad strategy. They need to tell people what they are doing,\" said Ellen Wright Clayton, a professor of biomedical ethics at Vanderbilt University. She said theAlphabetInc.unit risks running afoul of the rules if it uses the health data to perform independent research outside the direct scope of patient care.  Google employees working on the project might have access to the sensitive information. It's not clear what the company is doing to try and prevent this. Google stands to reap tens of millions in profits by repeating this work for other health-care giants. It should be able to figure out a way to satisfy those who are concerned about illegal sharing of data.

Now the Federal Government is looking into these companies for possible anticompetitive behavior. Officials at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission are getting ready to review how Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple deal with the competition. The House Judiciary Committee is also carrying out an investigation of its own. The question on all of this is why now? Bruce Hoffman is director of the Bureau of Competition at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. He's on the line from New York.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                Good morning, Mr. Hoffman.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BRUCE HOFFMAN:                 Good morning.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 So before we get to the why now, what is the FTC doing exactly? It's been reported that you're increasing scrutiny of these companies. You've set up a task force. What does this mean on the ground?             </p><p>BRUCE HOFFMAN:                 Well, let me first of all say that I don't want to comment on any specific pending investigation. But I think what we've been doing has been fairly visible. It's really so far been in two major directions. One is we've been conducting a series of hearings on competition policy, consumer protection policy, and that has touched a lot of the digital space on technology companies.             </p><p>                And second, as you noted, we set up recently a Technology Task Force, which was a new division inside the Bureau of Competition at the FTC, with a group of antitrust lawyers supported by some economists who are focused on this area, to try to better understand it, to develop our knowledge and be able to approach the area in a sophisticated and complete way.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 What are technology companies doing, or what is the set of circumstances that has concerned the FTC so much that it's ready to investigate?             </p><p>BRUCE HOFFMAN:                 Well, again, without talking about specific conduct that we might be looking at...             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Sure.             </p><p>BRUCE HOFFMAN:                 What I would say is there's obviously been a lot of public discussion about, No. 1, the size of the technology companies, or at least of some of them, and the fact that they've been large for a long time. Now, that in and of itself is not inherently an antitrust problem.             </p><p>                What I would say is there's obviously been a lot of public discussion about, No. 1, the size of the technology companies, or at least of some of them, and the fact that they've been large for a long time. Now, that in and of itself is not inherently an antitrust problem.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Right.             </p><p>BRUCE HOFFMAN:                 You can be a big, successful company because you're really good at what you do. But there've been a lot of claims of anticompetitive behavior, whether acquiring firms that could have been your competitors or engaging in conduct that would be aimed at squelching competition, like favoring your own services. Now, again, that might or might not be an antitrust problem in and of itself, but it's the sort of thing that you might want to look into.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 But there have been concerns about this for years, the things that you just laid out. This is nothing new. Why didn't you do something earlier?             </p><p>BRUCE HOFFMAN:                 Well, I think - you know, first of all, in terms of earlier, this in - what we've been looking at recently is the last couple of years, and this area was a big priority for Chairman Simons - Joe Simons, who is currently the chair of the FTC - when he came to the commission. That's only a year ago now.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 OK.             </p><p>BRUCE HOFFMAN:                 So from that period to present, there's a certain amount of developmental time that goes into anything we do. One of the hallmarks of the FTC, and this is true of the Department of Justice as well, is that we like to really have our facts straight. We do a lot of investigating, we do a lot of background work to make sure that when we actually engage in enforcement action, we're doing so on a sound, factual basis. So there's an awful lot of work that goes into this.             </p><p>                Now having said that, we have been bringing cases involving digital platforms and technology, but they've been cases that have been triggered by specific investigations. So we currently have a litigation filed against a digital platform in the e-prescribing space called Surescripts. We had a merger challenge last year involving digital platforms actually in the auto dealership business called CDK-Auto/Mate, where we sued actually to block a merger, and the merger was abandoned in the face of our lawsuit. So we've been doing things in this space, but in terms of the larger issues, there's a lot of development that goes into bringing cases.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 The dynamic here, at least from the outside, appears to be that regulators have really struggled to keep up with innovators. And I wonder - you said you do have to get your facts right, you do have to do a lot of research. Is that the reason that it seems the government is always a couple steps behind the big tech companies?             </p><p>BRUCE HOFFMAN:                 I don't think we're behind the big tech companies. I will say, I've been doing antitrust enforcement now for longer than I want to admit.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>BRUCE HOFFMAN:                 But this is actually a theme that recurs over and over again. So in the late 1990s, there was a great deal of public angst over the government's inability to do antitrust in what was then the tech space - you know, the dot-com world, the Microsoft world.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 Yeah.             </p><p>BRUCE HOFFMAN:                 And it turned out to be overblown, right? The Microsoft case proceeded. A lot of people have argued that the result of that case is what opened the door for today's tech companies. So - and by the way, if you go back through the history of antitrust, all the way back to the early 20th century, you find this constant issue, where every 10 years or every 15 years some new technology arises, the public gets all overwrought about it, saying, well, we've got - antitrust can't possibly keep up with this. You can't keep up with automobiles. You can't keep up with computers. You can't keep up with, you know, whatever the current technology is.             </p><p>                But ultimately, antitrust has proven able to adapt and to, I think, engage in good, sensible enforcement.             </p><p>NOEL KING:                 And just quickly, tech companies have said, look - you come after us, dismantle us, foreign tech firms will fill the void.

He told Business Insider that there is a dearth of litigators, an increase in judges who are against enforcement \u2014 and a years-long watering down of the definition of antitrust.\"[Congress is] going to have to figure out almost from scratch how they're going to enforce the antitrust laws,\" he said.

Our reforms to digital platforms are world-leading and following a groundbreaking 18-month inquiry by the [Australian Competition and Consumer Commission].\" Under the draft laws Facebook and Google could face hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties if they refuse to take part in a government-mandated arbitration process with news providers.</p><p>ACCC chairman Rod Sims, who has been a driving force behind the proposed laws, hit out at Facebook's announcement yesterday, branding its threats \"ill-timed and misconceived,\" and urging the company to \"engage in con-structive discussions\".</p><p>\"The draft media bargaining code aims to ensure Australian news businesses, including independent, community and regional media, can get a seat at the table for fair negotiations with Facebook and Google,\" he said. \"Facebook already pays some media for news content. The code simply aims to bring fairness and transparency to -Facebook and Google's relat-ionships with Australian news media businesses.\" The ACCC's moves to force Facebook and Google to compensate Australian media outlets for content would set a worldwide precedent.</p><p>Both Facebook and subsidiary Instagram issued alerts to users yesterday saying from October their Terms of Service would change to include: \"We also can remove or restrict -access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory -impacts to Facebook.\" This step would allow Facebook and Instagram to avoid paying for news. Facebook's Australia and New Zealand managing director Will Easton claimed news was not a big revenue earner. \"This is not our first choice - it is our last.

The FSB is an international body that monitors the global financial system.</p><p>Big tech firms' speed, efficiency and ubiquity may allow them to offer financial services in a more convenient way or at a lower cost to consumers, he said, but there could be other repercussions.</p><p>\"Technological innovation offers the promise of a substantially more efficient financial system. But new systems, processes and types of businesses will bring with them novel fragilities,\" he said in a speech hosted by the European Central Bank.</p><p>He warned that the impact of the biggest tech companies could be very substantial.</p><p>\"As they are only dipping their toes into the edges of the financial services water, the effects they have on the provision of financial services could grow enormously if they were to dive in -- [or cannonball],\" he said.</p><p>The growth in fintech has seen a move towards decentralization, as participants in financial markets were directly connected, said Quarles, who is also vice chairman for supervision at the Federal Reserve Board.</p><p>Its potential is broad for settling interbank payments, verifying and reconciling trade finance invoices, and keeping an audit trail to deter money laundering, he said. But new technologies also bring potential risks and the FSB would put significant resources into understanding these developments.</p><p>\"To be clear, we are not trying to oppose innovation, because innovation, including fintech, offers the world many potential benefits ... However, we have to work to ensure that we can reap the benefits offered by these new technologies without harming financial stability,\" he said.</p><p>Quarles also warned that new forms of interconnectedness between shadow banking firms -- lenders that are not regulated like banks -- and the banking system had emerged that could increase risk in the financial system. Shadow banking now accounted for just under 50 percent of total global financial assets, a share that has grown nearly 5 percentage points since 2009, he said.</p><p>Though Quarles said shadow banking provided a valuable alternative to bank financing and helped support real economic activity, he warned that it also often featured high leverage, opaque structures, and maturity and liquidity mismatches. The FSB promotes the resilience of shadow banks through its policies and worked alongside other standard-setting bodies like the Basel Committee to monitor those policies, as well as producing an annual report on the issue.</p><p>Quarles also said the FSB would examine the effectiveness of the reforms introduced in the wake of the financial crisis to deal with 'too big to fail' banks -- those that investors think would receive support from their governments if they became distressed.</p><p>\"We must ask ourselves, how effective have we been at reducing the problem of 'too big to fail'? Have we achieved our objective to reduce or eliminate the problem? Have we introduced new unintended risks to the financial system or costs to other financial market participants?\" he said.</p><p>The FSB had taken steps to deal with such institutions, including the introduction of a total loss absorbing capacity standard for banks along with its bail-in strategy, whereby investors' funds can be used to support the bank in a crisis so taxpayers are not affected.

The billions who use their services for making social media posts, uploading videos or searching the internet are targeted by the tech companies for their personal data - a prized asset that enhances the companies' power. Regulators are examining whether the companies have used their market power to crimp competition, potentially raising prices and hurting consumers.</p><p> Dissatisfaction with what federal authorities have done so far may be pushing some states to band together to run their own investigations, possibly eyeing more aggressive sanctions. The Federal Trade Commission's recent $5 billion fine against Facebook over privacy violations, for example, was criticized by consumer advocates and a number of public officials as being too lenient.</p><p> \"The states see it as part of their role to fill a vacuum,\" said Jay Himes, an antitrust lawyer in New York. Himes, a former head of the antitrust bureau in the New York attorney general's office, worked on the states' antitrust case against Microsoft about 20 years ago.</p><p>New York Attorney General Letitia James said Friday her probe will look into Facebook's dominance and any resulting anticompetitive conduct.</p><p> A separate group of state attorneys general is announcing Monday in Washington the launch of an investigation into \"whether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access and harmed consumers,\" an advisory from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Friday. The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, citing sources they didn't identify, have reported that target will be Google.</p><p> Both groups of state attorneys general include Democrats and Republicans. Joining James, a Democrat, in the Facebook investigation are the attorneys general of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and the District of Columbia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SPOKSR-35063148</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SPOKSR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0J-7J61-DYFF-854M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">157554</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Spokane Spokesman-Review</copyright><publicationName>Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)</publicationName><edition>Main Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 7, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NEW YORK STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>NEW YORK GIANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Lindsey Graham.</p><p> R-S.C., and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., is expected as soon as Wednesday with bipartisan support, according to three people familiar with the measure who requested anonymity since it has not been formally introduced.</p><p> Spokespeople for the lawmakers declined to comment for this story.</p><p> At the Justice Department, meanwhile, U.S. officials are set to unveil on Thursday a set of 11 \"voluntary principles\" that target child sexual exploitation, according to two additional sources and a copy of the invite. The proposal - crafted with the industry's aid, and backed by leaders of five countries - calls on tech companies to ensure search, social-networking, video streaming and chat tools aren't havens for child predators, according to a copy obtained by The Post. The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>SiliconValley companies including Facebook and Google share the U.S. government's goal of battling child pornography, human trafficking and a wide array of other harmful content targeting minors.</p><p> But they fear efforts to erode Section 230, which they view as fundamental to the web's growth, critical for free expression and essential for web sites that need legal cover to police their own platforms in the first place.</p><p> The industry has grown especially apprehensive about lawmakers' latest political salvo, fearing it is unworkable and could pave the way for the Justice Department and other law enforcement agents to burrow into their networks, devices and services to aid their investigations. Doing so could undermine end-to-end encryption, security technology that makes it so that only the sender and recipient of a message can see its contents.</p><p> On Tuesday, Facebook aired early doubts about the bill before it had even been released.</p><p> The fate of encryption is critical for the company, given that its messaging service, WhatsApp, is secured this way, and Facebook aims to deploy encryption further across its chat tools.</p><p> \"We share the EARN IT Act sponsors' commitment to child safety and have made keeping children safe online a top priority by developing and deploying technology to thwart the sharing of child abuse material,\" Facebook spokesman Thomas Richards said in a statement. \"We're concerned the EARN IT Act may be used to roll back encryption, which protects everyone's safety from hackers and criminals, and may limit the ability of American companies to provide the private and secure services that people expect.\"</p><p>Google did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p><p> The twin efforts - combined with growing apprehension among regulators about the unchecked power of many top tech companies - could set the stage for a major clash between Washington and Silicon Valley over the coming year.</p><p> Regulators in the United Kingdom, Australia and a host of other countries recently have sought to require Facebook, Google and other online services to spot, disable or demote abusive content quickly or face tough punishments.</p><p> In the United States, however, Section 230 often prevents the government from holding tech giants accountable for problematic speech - and stymies web users from taking action justice on their own in the courts.</p><p> But Democrats and Republicans in recent years have expressed greater willingness to rethink and revise the immunity the law affords. So has the Justice Department, where Attorney General William Barr has begun a broad review of big tech that includes possible changes to Section 230.</p><p> Publicly, Barr also has chided the industry for failing to clamp down on child sexual exploitation online. And he's specifically pointed to encryption as an impediment to efforts by DOJ and officials around the world to investigate potentially harmful messages, photos and other content in real time.</p><p> On Capitol Hill, Graham's and Blumenthal's legislation specifically seeks to protect kids and clamp down on abusive imagery, threats to child safety and the potential for human trafficking. If passed, the bill would set up a commission at the Justice Department to craft a set of voluntary guidelines for tech companies to follow to combat child sexual exploitation, according to a copy of the measure obtained by The Post.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-3e596b456c4ade9dc00ae8b849b824f9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899AA5719889C NWBKMA</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBY-TRD1-JBCN-44B2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"851\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Patriot Ledger<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It could presage tougher scrutiny of Silicon Valley in response to complaints that the FTC has been too soft on tech giants and the ways they collect, swap and manipulate personal information about billions of Americans.</p><p> \"When the FTC periodically engages in serious reflection and evaluation, we are better able to promote competition and innovation, protect consumers, and shape the law, so that free markets continue to thrive,\" Simons said in a statement.</p><p> Simons has modeled the effort after an inquiry conducted by the FTC in 1995, the agency said, three years before Google had been founded and almost 10 years before the launch of Facebook. Those previous hearings similarly sought to gauge if the agency had the right tools to tackle issues that included the arrival of online shopping and the threat of digital fraud.</p><p> Back then, FTC leaders sought to \"understand how antitrust law ought to apply to new dominant firms who got there often because they were the first to invent or first to implement a really good idea,\" said Bill Baer, who served at the FTC during that period and much later became the top antitrust official at the Justice Department under President Barack Obama.</p><p> Two decades later, some of those same challenges remain. But FTC under Simons also faces significant pressure to rein in the power and footprint of the country's tech giants. Privacy experts see the agency's ongoing investigation of Facebook, for example, as a major test of the FTC's ability and willingness to penalize Silicon Valley for its alleged misdeeds.</p><p> \"Their budget is sort of insanely low,\" said Michelle De Mooy, the director of the Privacy and Data Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington D.C.-based think tank. She noted the agency is limited in the rules it can write on its own and the staff it can hire, too.</p><p> \"Making sure they are able to be effective, now that they are faced with so many emerging technologies, is absolutely crucial for effective consumer protection,\" she said.</p><p> For now, the road trip marks the first major initiative from Simons, an antitrust lawyer by trade who arrived at the agency in May along with a full slate of new Democratic and Republican commissioners.</p><p> Before his Senate confirmation, many lawmakers had pressed Simons on the extent to which he'd keep a close eye on the biggest tech companies in Silicon Valley. In response, Simons promised the FTC under his watch would be \"vigorously enforcing the antitrust laws.\"</p><p> Along with privacy and security, Simons faces new demands - including from lawmakers on Capitol Hill - that the FTC stop big tech companies from getting bigger.</p><p> Some members of Congress are specifically asking the FTC to reopen its investigation of Google, which the agency previously probed for antitrust violations but closed its investigation in 2013 without bringing any significant penalties. In the meantime, European regulators slapped Google with a major fine.</p><p> While those companies aren't the explicit focus of the FTC's forthcoming hearings, the agency could hear an earful about them.</p><p> The goal, the agency said, is to explore whether \"broad-based changes in the economy, evolving business practices, new technologies or international developments might require any adjustments to competition and consumer protection enforcement law, enforcement priorities, and policy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMA-cc53116f1da98763d6fef108b301f3e0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899AA5719889C NWBKMA</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SM9-SR01-DXVP-V499-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399550</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Patriot Ledger<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Such actions should cost social media companies protection from liability for what is posted on their platforms. </p><p>Companies like Twitter and Facebook are granted liability protection under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act because they are treated as \"platforms,\" rather than categorisation of \"publishers\" given to traditional media groups, which can face lawsuits over the content the publish.</p><p/><p>\"They've had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences,\" Mr Trump said of social media companies as he prepared to sign the order. </p><p>\"There is no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction.\"</p><p>Mr Trump, who personally relies heavily on Twitter to verbally flog his foes, has long accused the tech giants in liberal-leaning Silicon Valley of targeting conservatives by fact-checking them or removing their posts. </p><p>\"We're fed up with it,\" Mr Trump said, claiming his order would uphold freedom of speech.</p><p>Technology industry groups disagreed, saying it removing the protection would stifle innovation and speech on the internet. </p><p/><p>The US Chamber of Commerce objected, saying that \"regardless of the circumstances that led up to this, this is not how public policy is made in the United States\".</p><p>The executive order directs executive branch agencies to ask independent rule-making agencies including the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to study whether they could place new regulations on the \"big tech\" platforms, which also include the likes of Facebook and Google. </p><p>However some experts doubt much can be done without an act of Congress.</p><p>\"This debate is an important one,\" FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. \"The Federal Communications Commission will carefully review any petition for rule-making filed by the Department of Commerce.\" </p><p>Facebook Chief Mark Zuckerberg moved to avoid being lumped in with Twitter, telling Fox News that Facebook prioritised free expression. </p><p>\"We have a different policy I think than Twitter on this,\" Mr Zuckerbeg said. </p><p>Both sites take down content that violates their terms of service, but Facebook's approach, he said, has \"distinguished us from some of the other tech companies in terms of being stronger on free expression and giving people a voice\".</p><p>Facebook applies labels to some misleading posts but exempts posts from politicians and outsources fact checking to media partners like Reuters, taking no stances itself. </p><p>The split with Twitter comes despite Mr Zuckerberg's more aggressive posture against misinformation in recent months, including pledges to wipe from Facebook's apps any misleading posts about the novel coronavirus which could cause physical harm.</p><p>Facebook took down a coronavirus-related post from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in March. It also explicitly bans content that misrepresents methods for voting or voter registration \"regardless of who it's coming from\". </p><p>Mr Zuckerberg said Mr Trump's comments on Tuesday did not hit Facebook's bar to be considered in violation of its voter suppression rules.</p><p>Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey said Mr Trump's claims \"may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot.\"</p><p>A Twitter spokeswoman said that senior executives, including Mr Dorsey, had approved the decision to label Trump's tweets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">With AAP</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTOL-30fa83517b7584489cb281a0d653ee93</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602X-KS51-JBPV-K0FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><timeReceived>10:59 PM AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"464E\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Lael Brainard during a speech before the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.</p><p>The new service, FedNow, is expected to launch by 2024 and would allow banks to nearly instantaneously move money into customers' accounts, she said. The Fed board approved the decision by a 4-1 vote Friday, but it wasn't announced until Monday.</p><p>The announcement could pit the Fed against some of the country's biggest banks, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, who have already developed rival technology and fear that Silicon Valley companies could use the Fed system to push their way further into the banking world.</p><p>America's payment system lags behind many parts of the world, and U.S. banks are concerned about being left behind, said Aaron Klein, the policy director for the Center on Regulation and Markets at the Brookings Institution. </p><p>\"I think some of the large banks don't want to be the taxi medallions and be uberized,\" he said, a reference to the impact of ride hailing on taxi owners. \"The rest of the world went to real-time payments a long time ago.\"</p><p>The Fed's announcement comes at a time when big technology companies are finding other ways into the banking world. </p><p>Wall Street has raised concerns about Facebook's efforts to create an alternate global currency system, known as Libra. Meanwhile, Square, the mobile payment company, and Rakuten, known as the Amazon of Japan and operator of U.S. rewards program Ebates, have applied for a special banking license that would allow the companies to offer checking and savings accounts.</p><p>In 2005, Walmart waged a two-year battle for a similar bank charter but withdrew its application after small banks objected. But more than a decade later, Silicon Valley may pose a bigger threat to the stranglehold banking industry holds on key parts of the financial world.</p><p>Big tech companies could use the Federal Reserve's new service to gain direct access to the payment system, bypassing banks that currently act as a gatekeeper, said Greg Baer, chief executive of the Bank Policy Institute, which represents the country's biggest banks.</p><p>The tech industry would like the Federal Reserve to give non-banks more access to the payment system, said Brian Peters, executive director of Financial Innovation Now, a lobbying group that includes Apple, Amazon and Google.</p><p> But that is not likely to happen without congressional approval and is not why the industry supports the Fed developing its own service, he said.</p><p>\"At this point, we just want to make our payment system work faster,\" Peters said.</p><p>For decades, banks flew planes across the country filled with paper checks ready to be processed. Now, depositing a check is as simple as snapping a photo with your phone.</p><p>But there is still often a delay of a couple of days before the money is deposited into an account, a frustrating feature of America's antiquated payment system, industry experts say.</p><p>The current electronic payment system was built in the 1960s with physical checks in mind, not splitting a dinner bill with friends on a mobile phone app, they say. Retailers bundled physical checks into batches before taking them to the bank to be processed. That same type of process is now used for electronic payments.</p><p>The Fed decision to develop its own service was cheered by community banks, credit unions and big tech companies that were weary of depending on a system developed by big banks.</p><p>\"Community bankers, we did it!,\" Rebeca Romero Rainey, chief executive of the Independent Community Bankers of America said in a blog post Monday, adding that the decision would \"avoid a megabank monopoly.\"</p><p>\"I'm glad to see the Fed is heeding our calls to act, and that the American people will soon have a payments system that works for them,\" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who co-sponsored legislation directing the Federal Reserve to develop a real-time payments system.</p><p>The Federal Reserve is requesting comments on how its service, FedNow, should be designed. It is unclear how much it will cost to build.</p><p>The Fed is likely to meet resistance from the big banks as it develops its service. The Clearing House, which is owned by 24 of the country's largest financial institutions, already spent millions building a system that brings the typical processing time from a few days to less than five seconds, said Steve Ledford, a senior vice president at the company.</p><p>The real time payments system launched in 2017 and is currently used in 16 of the 10,000 banks and credit unions across the country.</p><p>If the Fed develops a rival technology that could slow adoption across the industry, Ledford said in an interview before the announcement Monday. \"The numbers are ramping up,\" he said, but \"one of the complicating factors has been this Fed potential to move into the market.\"</p><p>The Fed's Vice Chair of Supervision, Randal Quarles, the lone dissenting vote on the board appeared to side with the big banks.</p><p>\"I do not see a strong justification for the Federal Reserve to move into this area and crowd out innovation when viable private-sector alternatives are available,\" he said in a statement.</p><p>Merle writes for </p><p>The Washington Post.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0099189252</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRR-B931-JBM5-R3D6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 6, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

However, Industry 4.0 differs from previous revolutions in important ways.In earlier episodes \u2014 mechanisation, mass production, automation and electronics \u2014 the key inputs, whether cotton, iron, coal, or oil, had a tangible quality that, in combination with significant amounts of productive labour and dedicated managerial capabilities, anchored the process of adding (and distributing) value in a well-defined network of spatial and social relations where public policies could shape the landscape of winners and losers.In the digital revolution, the key input, which is 'data', is intangible, requires little labour to create value and the capital behind it is inherently footloose.This has given rise to a world of disembodied networks and diminished bargaining power of those producing the input, particularly in developing countries where the laws and regulations over the ownership of data and the capacities to use it profitably are weak or missing altogether.In this world, first mover advantages enjoyed by the digital giants (Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Facebook, etc.) </p><p>in collecting data allow them to use Big Data analytics to out-compete smaller rivals and block potential rivals.The growth and operation of Uber \u2014 the world's biggest taxi service which owns no taxis \u2014 has exposed the vulnerability of national firms, especially in developing countries where infant platforms tend to receive little or no state support UNCTAD's 'Trade and Development Report' (2018) on 'Power, Platforms and The Free Trade Delusion', released this week, maps the growth of super platforms and big tech firms and reveals how their growing concentration has allowed them to take corporate rent seeking to a new level.Apple recently became the first company to be valued at more than $1 trillion, matching the combined output of Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Alibaba's profits-to-sales ratio increased from 10 per cent in 2011 to 32 per cent in 2015.As a result, these super platforms can bear losses for a longer time just to wipe out competition. The recent purchase of India's Flipkart by Walmart, following the hostile takeover efforts of Amazon, is an example of the growing anti-competitive practices of the global giants which follow predatory pricing and sunk losses to wipe out competition in national markets.The irony of the situation is that as these digital platforms are becoming more and more predatory, many developing countries are being encouraged to facilitate their entry, often with favourable tax and other incentives, in anticipation of attracting big investments, generating jobs, and building technological capabilities.The evidence for such spillovers is limited at best. In a world of 'disembodied digital networks', as more data is generated and more consumers are attracted, in turn bringing in more producers, the super platforms keep growing by feeding on data, and are able to further entrench their monopolistic power.Worse still, there is what the Chicago economist Luigi Zingales calls a 'Medici vicious circle' at play; the economic power that comes with establishing monopolistic positions readily translates into the capture of political power that reinforces those positions. That circle is already shaping digital rules, at both the national and international levels.The way aheadThis is an anti-development agenda. The big question is what is to be done?According to UNCTAD, national ownership of data and clear regulations on data localisation is a necessary first step for countries seeking to build an inclusive data-intensive economy. Designing digital industrial policies will be key and countries will need to protect their policy space and the freedom to make laws around regulating their data flows.There is a need to develop and protect infant digital national platforms through effective competition policies and targeted support measures. These need to be designed with a view to advancing small producers/platforms and not just protecting the consumers.Countries also need to encourage digital technology transfers. UNCTAD warns that there is a risk that the space of developing countries to design policies for enhancing development gains from the digital revolution can be severely curbed if the e-commerce proposals at the WTO are accepted.

However, Industry 4.0 differs from previous revolutions in important ways.</p><p>In earlier episodes mechanisation, mass production, automation and electronics the key inputs, whether cotton, iron, coal, or oil, had a tangible quality that, in combination with significant amounts of productive labour and dedicated managerial capabilities, anchored the process of adding (and distributing) value in a well-defined network of spatial and social relations where public policies could shape the landscape of winners and losers.</p><p>In the digital revolution, the key input, which is 'data', is intangible, requires little labour to create value and the capital behind it is inherently footloose.</p><p>This has given rise to a world of disembodied networks and diminished bargaining power of those producing the input, particularly in developing countries where the laws and regulations over the ownership of data and the capacities to use it profitably are weak or missing altogether.</p><p>In this world, first mover advantages enjoyed by the digital giants (Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Facebook, etc.) in collecting data allow them to use Big Data analytics to out-compete smaller rivals and block potential rivals.</p><p>The growth and operation of Uber the world's biggest taxi service which owns no taxis has exposed the vulnerability of national firms, especially in developing countries where infant platforms tend to receive little or no state support UNCTAD's Trade and Development Report 2018: Power, Platforms and The Free Trade Delusion, released this week, maps the growth of super platforms and big tech firms and reveals how their growing concentration has allowed them to take corporate rent seeking to a new level.</p><p>Apple recently became the first company to be valued at more than $1 trillion, matching the combined output of Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Alibaba's profits-to-sales ratio increased from 10 per cent in 2011 to 32 per cent in 2015.</p><p>As a result, these super platforms can bear losses for a longer time just to wipe out competition. The recent purchase of India's Flipkart by Walmart, following the hostile takeover efforts of Amazon, is an example of the growing anti-competitive practices of the global giants which follow predatory pricing and sunk losses to wipe out competition in national markets.</p><p>The irony of the situation is that as these digital platforms are becoming more and more predatory, many developing countries are being encouraged to facilitate their entry, often with favourable tax and other incentives, in anticipation of attracting big investments, generating jobs, and building technological capabilities.</p><p>The evidence for such spillovers is limited at best. In a world of 'disembodied digital networks', as more data is generated and more consumers are attracted, in turn bringing in more producers, the super platforms keep growing by feeding on data, and are able to further entrench their monopolistic power.</p><p>Worse still, there is what the Chicago economist Luigi Zingales calls a \"Medici vicious circle\" at play; the economic power that comes with establishing monopolistic positions readily translates into the capture of political power that reinforces those positions. That circle is already shaping digital rules, at both the national and international levels.</p><p>The way ahead</p><p>This is an anti-development agenda. The big question is what is to be done?</p><p>According to UNCTAD, national ownership of data and clear regulations on data localisation is a necessary first step for countries seeking to build an inclusive data-intensive economy. Designing digital industrial policies will be key and countries will need to protect their policy space and the freedom to make laws around regulating their data flows.</p><p>There is a need to develop and protect infant digital national platforms through effective competition policies and targeted support measures. These need to be designed with a view to advancing small producers/platforms and not just protecting the consumers.</p><p>Countries also need to encourage digital technology transfers. UNCTAD warns that there is a risk that the space of developing countries to design policies for enhancing development gains from the digital revolution can be severely curbed if the e-commerce proposals at the WTO are accepted.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122416102</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC7-F7X1-DYTH-G284-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 27, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Too fast, too soon. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It s a far cry from the worldview of techies in her hometown, many of whom still ascribe to Facebook s old ethos of  moving fast and breaking things.  </p><p>Over the past few years, Feinstein hasn t shied away from taking on the most powerful technology companies in the world including Apple, Facebook, Google, and Twitter in high-profile debates over encryption and other national security issues. She s also tangled with companies creating new technologies, from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/senator-dianne-feinstein-encounter-with-drone-technology-privacy-surveillance-102233\"> drones </url> to driverless cars, over consumer-safety concerns. </p><p>Yet the powerful, 25-year senator still enjoys widespread support among voters in the tech-heavy regions near her hometown. Feinstein beat her Democratic challenger former state Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n, who represents parts of Los Angeles by over 30 points in San Mateo, Santa Clara, and San Francisco counties in the June primary.</p><p> It is very helpful if your member of the United States Senate has a lot of clout in Washington,  said Steve Westly, a former California state controller and venture capitalist with stakes in companies like Tesla.  And I think, by any standard, Dianne Feinstein has clout. </p><p>In recent years, that power has often worked against some of Silicon Valley s top policy priorities in the nation s capital, including in the current debate over driverless cars. </p><p>Companies like Google and Uber say that a future of autonomous vehicles is fast approaching. And they ve lobbied for months to pave the way for it, advocating a Senate bill known as AV Start to hitch a ride on the must-pass Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill heading to the chamber s floor in the coming weeks. The bill would greatly expand the number of federal safety exemptions each auto manufacturer can receive, allowing for the sale of tens of thousands of new autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Both tech companies and car manufacturers expect massive returns on their investments, which have escalated dramatically as they rack up millions of miles to prove driverless technology is ready for rapid adoption.</p><p>But the companies say that outdated federal highway-safety standards and a patchwork of state rules <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/transportation/autonomous-vehicles-self-driving-vehicles-enacted-legislation.aspx\"> 29 states </url> have enacted legislation so far have made it difficult to bring the new technology to the mass market. So last fall, the House passed a bill without opposition to loosen federal restrictions and create a nationwide framework usurping state regulations. The Senate Commerce Committee introduced and passed similar legislation soon after, appearing to give momentum to the ultimate passage of the legislation.</p><p>That momentum faltered in December, when Feinstein said she was  strongly opposed  to the bill and essentially told the industry to slow down and get tested. </p><p> People need to be assured, and they need to be assured over time,  she told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/1/18/16905964/self-driving-car-testing-roads-congress-senate\"> Recode </url></emphasis> a month later.  And you can t just dump something on a freeway and have people looking over saying,  My God, there s no driver.   </p><p>By March, she and four other Democratic senators had placed  holds  on the legislation, writing a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/f/1/f168c367-bec0-48cc-9220-6a13cbd9dd27/D00752809320841613B5F03BB8517FC2.03.14.2018-av-start-act-letter.pdf\"> letter </url> expressing their concern that the bill  indefinitely preempts state and local safety regulations even if federal safety standards are never developed.  A few days later, an autonomous car operated by Uber with a backup driver hit and killed a woman on a street in Arizona. Uber immediately suspended testing, and the bill s momentum       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/665441/senate-driverless-car-bill-further-jeopardized-pedestrian-death\"> halted </url>. </p><p>Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune, the lead sponsor of AV Start, said he believes Feinstein is a primary driver of Senate opposition to the bill.  She s ginned up a lot of opposition just based on the fact that she doesn t like the technology and doesn t think it s safe,  Thune told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis>.</p><p> It s all in her backyard,  he continued.  I keep telling these tech companies that the next time she s back in her state they ought to take her for a ride in an autonomous vehicle, to just show her this stuff is safe and it ll save a lot of lives in the long run. </p><p>In an interview, Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, praised Sen. Feinstein s role in the debate.</p><p> I think it s especially a profile of courage, considering she represents a state where a number of the tech companies are located,  Chase said.  The fact that she s able and willing to express concerns about the swiftness of this bill moving forward, I think, is very commendable. </p><p>This is only Feinstein's latest fight with Silicon Valley. In 2016, she <url normalizedValue=\"https://sf.curbed.com/2016/7/14/12193340/airbnb-ftc-investigation-feinstein\"> pushed </url> the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Airbnb, the popular online marketplace for short-term lodging rentals, and in 2017 she introduced drone legislation that some industry advocates       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://dronelife.com/2017/05/26/feinstein-introduces-drone-federalism-act-protect-state-regulations/\"> say </url> would unduly restrict the usage and testing of unmanned aerial vehicles. </p><p>Feinstein has threatened top lawyers at Facebook, Google, and Twitter with new regulations in the wake of the Russian government s meddling on their platforms in the 2016 presidential election.  You have to be the ones who do something about it or we will,  she warned the companies during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.</p><p>And when law enforcement was unable to break into an attacker s iPhone following the San Bernardino mass shooting in 2015, Feinstein sided with the FBI over Apple in the debate over federal access to encrypted communications. She and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley are now <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cyberscoop.com/new-encryption-bill-dianne-feinstein-chuck-grassley-senate-judiciary-comittee/\"> reportedly </url> mulling another shot at legislation to create  backdoors  for law enforcement to break into encrypted software and hardware.</p><p> In [Silicon] Valley, there s a great belief in civil liberties, in the importance of fighting mass surveillance, in the importance of encryption, in not having the expansive power of the state over the individual,  said Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democratic member from Silicon Valley who supports Feinstein s Senate challenger.  She just has been on the other side of those issues. </p><p>When asked about her overall relationship with Silicon Valley, Feinstein noted in a statement to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis> that she  regularly  meets with tech leaders and advocates, whether it be for a new patent office in San Jose or to push for expanding H1-B visas, which are given to highly skilled foreign citizens. </p><p> These relationships are collaborative, and I m happy that I ve been able to develop close ties to tech executives over the years,  Feinstein wrote.  Tech companies are one of the biggest drivers not only for California s economy but the entire country. I ve long had a very close relationship with Silicon Valley.  </p><p>But de Le\u00f3n, Feinstein s challenger in California s unique  top-two  general election, has garnered support and donations from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/reid-hoffman-dianne-feinstein-1518813384-83804181-7aca-4148-91ff-2c6d37296ac7.html\"> some </url> of the top tech leaders in his state. After calling AV Start  just another D.C. power-grab and end-run around state regulations  in March, a de Le\u00f3n campaign aide says he now supports the bill, putting him in line with several       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://walters.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-mimi-walters-self-drive-act-will-reduce-congestion-and-save-lives\">California</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://cardenas.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-passes-c-rdenas-bill-autonomous-vehicle-legislative-package\"> members </url> of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://matsui.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=14\">Congress</url>. In an interview with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis>, de Le\u00f3n claimed that the senator is not doing enough for the industry.</p><p> It d be the equivalent of the senator for Michigan not lifting a finger for Ford, for Chrysler, for Chevy, GM in fact, less than not even lifting a finger, but going after them,  de Le\u00f3n said of Feinstein s continued opposition to the bill and to Silicon Valley s priorities in general.</p><p>Westly says Feinstein has had  a strong 30-year track record in the Valley  but acknowledged he d  love to see her leaning forward a little more.</p><p> I think Senator Feinstein may have been slower to embrace some of the new technologies than I would like, but I think she will get there,  he said.  There will be more drones. There will be more autonomous vehicles. Some of them will lead to accidents, but over time I guarantee you autonomous vehicles will be safer than vehicles driven by people. </p><p>But for now, Feinstein is still urging the tech industry to pump the brakes.</p><p> This bill determines how the federal government and states will manage self-driving cars,  she told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis> in a statement.  A bill this important deserves a thorough debate and shouldn t be rushed through while serious concerns remain unresolved. </p><p>And as the debate drags on, others on Capitol Hill wonder why Silicon Valley can t bring its hometown senator along for the ride.</p><p> It makes me think that maybe the tech community isn t very effective when it comes to lobbying members of their state,  Thune said.  There s a lot of stuff that they want to get done, and we re working with them. But they have a hard time bringing along the people that are closest to them. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-671106</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SYX-T3V1-JBNW-33VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The National Journal Group, Inc.

It\u2019s part of a larger effort that needs to be taken to stop the plague of gun violence in our communities.\u201d\u201cThe fact is, no matter how many times big tech companies claim they\u2019re cracking down on illegal online firearm sales, determined gun sellers and buyers find new ways to get around it,\u201d Senator Menendez said, who has continually called out Facebook for its failure to enforce and monitor its own ban on gun sales. \u201cWith this bill, we are making very clear to gun sellers who are caught illegally moving their weapons online: if you make the sale, you will pay the price.\u201d</p><p>Some technology companies have banned selling firearms and ammunition on their platforms. However, sellers use tactics like misrepresenting guns as other items to circumvent those restrictions.</p><p>For instance, sellers advertise on platforms like Facebook\u2019s Marketplace, claiming to sell stickers alongside images of gun makers\u2019 logos. Sellers typically ask an interested party to send a private message where buyers then learn the posting was actually for a gun sale and receive details and pricing.</p><p>Last month, Facebook reported it had removed 1.3 million pieces of content related to firearms between April and June 2020 from its platforms.</p><p>\u201cInternet marketplaces like Facebook are the virtual dark alley where unscrupulous gun sellers go to meet dangerous individuals who are trying to get their hands on a firearm,\u201d said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. \u201cStopping these illegal sales would save lives, and we applaud Senators Feinstein and Menendez for introducing legislation to do exactly that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverwhelming majorities of Americans support policies that ensure that individuals who should not possess firearms are not able to purchase them, including online,\u201d said Kris Brown, president of Brady. \u201cBrady is grateful to Senators Feinstein and Menendez for addressing a dangerous practice of falsely advertising firearm sales online. Such sales are designed to circumvent the regulations that help keep our families and communities safe. This is a common-sense fix to a growing problem that applies the spirit of our nation's existing gun safety laws to novel, 21st century issues.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3804633</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XM-D1P1-F0YC-N02T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"475\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 25, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It's part of a larger effort that needs to be taken to stop the plague of gun violence in our communities.\"</p><p>\"The fact is, no matter how many times big tech companies claim they're cracking down on illegal online firearm sales, determined gun sellers and buyers find new ways to get around it,\" Senator Menendez said, who has continually called out Facebook for its failure to enforce and monitor its own ban on gun sales. \"With this bill, we are making very clear to gun sellers who are caught illegally moving their weapons online: if you make the sale, you will pay the price.\"</p><p>Some technology companies have banned selling firearms and ammunition on their platforms. However, sellers use tactics like misrepresenting guns as other items to circumvent those restrictions.</p><p>For instance, sellers advertise on platforms like Facebook's Marketplace, claiming to sell stickers alongside images of gun makers' logos. Sellers typically ask an interested party to send a private message where buyers then learn the posting was actually for a gun sale and receive details and pricing.</p><p>Last month, Facebook reported it had removed 1.3 million pieces of content related to firearms between April and June 2020 from its platforms.</p><p>\"Internet marketplaces like Facebook are the virtual dark alley where unscrupulous gun sellers go to meet dangerous individuals who are trying to get their hands on a firearm,\" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety. \"Stopping these illegal sales would save lives, and we applaud Senators Feinstein and Menendez for introducing legislation to do exactly that.\"</p><p>\"Overwhelming majorities of Americans support policies that ensure that individuals who should not possess firearms are not able to purchase them, including online,\" said Kris Brown, president of Brady. \"Brady is grateful to Senators Feinstein and Menendez for addressing a dangerous practice of falsely advertising firearm sales online. Such sales are designed to circumvent the regulations that help keep our families and communities safe. This is a common-sense fix to a growing problem that applies the spirit of our nation's existing gun safety laws to novel, 21st century issues.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CODUPB-COS1B709242020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X8-PY21-JCCP-03F2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

An optometrist has an office downstairs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Weinberg's company, DuckDuckGo, has become one of the feistiest adversaries of Google. Started over a decade ago, DuckDuckGo offers a privacy-focused alternative to Google's search engine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The company's share of the search engine market is still tiny \u2014 about 1% compared with Google's 85%, according to StatCounter. But it has tripled over the past two years and is now handling about 40 million searches a day. It has also made a profit in each of the past five years, Weinberg said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Weinberg, 40, is among the most outspoken critics of the internet giants. DuckDuckGo's CEO has repeatedly called for new privacy-focused legislation and has warned at hearings and in newspaper opinion pieces about the problems that big companies can cause by tracking our every move online.</p><p> But the challenges faced by DuckDuckGo reflect just how difficult it is to take on the giants and build an internet business that is focused on the privacy of its users.</p><p> After a decade, the private company's modest success is an indication that, even as regulators around the world consider tougher rules for the data-tracking methods of big tech companies, selling consumers on privacy-focused services is still an uphill battle.</p><p> Like other search companies, DuckDuckGo displays ads at the top of each search page. But unlike others, it does not track the online behavior of its users to tailor ads to them.</p><p>DuckDuckGo constantly bumps into Google's business, which stretches far beyond search. It also has to contend with the fact that most people don't seem willing to give up much to recover their privacy, and are easily overwhelmed when they decide to try to make a change.</p><p> \"It's not as easy to switch as we'd like it to be,\" Weinberg said while sitting in his office in jeans, red sneakers and a black short-sleeve shirt. \"There is a lot of inertia drawing people back to the existing system.\"</p><p> These limitations are reflected in DuckDuckGo's modest offices. DuckDuckGo, which has 65 employees, has done only two relatively small fundraising rounds, about $13 million, that add up to less than what Google makes in an hour. Weinberg parks his 2011 Honda minivan in a parking lot you can see from his corner office, which is papered mostly in drawings by his two sons.</p><p> For people who care about privacy, DuckDuckGo is a reminder that it is possible to offer internet access and build an online business without logging every move made by users. It also provides a vision of what the internet might look like if companies are forced to scale back the surveillance economy.</p><p> \"DuckDuckGo is very much a poster child for a future in which companies stand with their users and still make money,\" said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco nonprofit focused on privacy and online rights. \"They counter the assumption that we've all been socialized to accept: that it is normal to hand overall your information. DuckDuckGo shows that doesn't have to be the way.\"</p><p>Google has so far avoided any showdowns with DuckDuckGo. Last year, Google added DuckDuckGo as one of the four default search engines available for users of its internet browser, Chrome.</p><p> But the internet giant has not taken kindly to DuckDuckGo's suggestions that it is selling information about its users to the highest bidder.</p><p> \"The data we collect makes our product more helpful for people in a variety of ways, such as improving our understanding of queries and combating threats like spam and fraud,\" said Lara Levin, a Google spokeswoman. \"We keep this data private and secure, and we provide controls so people can make their own choices.\"</p><p> Weinberg started DuckDuckGo in 2008 when he was a stay-at-home dad, after struggling to get two previous startups off the ground. The early versions of DuckDuckGo (its name is a nod to the children's game) did not have any focus on privacy. When he went in that direction, it was attractive to only a small number of privacy advocates.</p><p> But after Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, revealed extensive online surveillance by the U.S. government in 2013, privacy became a selling point. Business began to grow.</p><p>DuckDuckGo is not the only upstart that is trying to capitalize on privacy concerns. Proton Technologies, a Swiss startup, is taking on Gmail with an alternative email service. The Firefox and Brave browsers are more focused on privacy than Chrome. And Google Maps users can switch to OpenStreetMap.</p><p>DuckDuckGo's search site looks similar to Google, with the G replaced by a playful cartoon head of a duck, who goes by the name Dax. Type in a question and up pops a list of links that looks like what you'd get from Google, with definitions from Wikipedia at the top and maps supplied through a partnership with Apple Maps.</p><p> Weinberg said the site was designed to make it feel similar to Google, to ease the transition for new users. While DuckDuckGo does not keep data on its users, it can pull the geographic location from each query and serve local results for things like restaurants and news.</p><p> \"We don't think privacy is stopping getting good search results for anybody,\" Weinberg said.</p><p> In online reviews at sites like Reddit and Quora, users praising DuckDuckGo's little features \u2014 like shortcuts for searching specific websites, known as bangs \u2014 are roughly equal in number to those who find its search results inferior.</p><p> I made DuckDuckGo my default search engine while I was doing my reporting for this article. I mostly didn't notice a difference, though I did find the maps and local results to be less on target. And there were times when DuckDuckGo couldn't figure out what I was looking for when Google could, especially for more obscure queries.</p><p> Joseph Turow, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has written extensively about privacy, said that whenever he had tried DuckDuckGo, he had given up after a few days because of nagging doubts about quality of the results.</p><p> \"I'm almost embarrassed to say that I don't use it more than I do,\" Turow said. \"There is something in my head that tells me I'll get a better search from Google, even when I don't know if that is demonstrably correct or not.\"</p><p>DuckDuckGo is also up against another hard reality of the online world: If you call up DuckDuckGo on the Chrome browser, for example, Google is still logging your search queries.</p><p> \"It can feel a bit futile as an individual,\" said Liz Coll, the head of digital change at Consumers International, a consumer advocacy group. \"It's quite hard to isolate your search engine as opposed to all the other things you do online.\"</p><p>DuckDuckGo is expanding beyond the search engine. The company's second-most popular product, a free widget that can be installed in any browser, blocks invisible trackers from Google and other companies while providing a privacy and security grade for every website.</p><p> The plug-in gives Google's main website a grade of D, because, DuckDuckGo says, Google tracks you across the web and keeps permanent logs of your activity, which either the government or hackers might exploit.</p><p>Google has said it offers users many settings so they can opt out of data collection. Most people don't, the company said, because the data collection makes online services better and hasn't led to big problems \u2014 at least at Google.</p><p> Weinberg said the challenge of parsing what Google did and did not do was an indication of why it was so important to build alternatives that don't keep any data.</p><p> \"All of these companies were saying you can't make money without tracking your users,\" he said. \"By us existing and getting bigger and being profitable, we serve as the existence proof that it is possible.\"</p><p> Nathaniel Popper is a New York Times writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-3ac5d53c6dda44bd67c3d1431647fa19e30b0a4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKH-30Y1-JBCN-44G8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1317\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The group of eight technology experts in the public and private sectors was moderated by Kara Swisher, a contributing opinion writer on technology at The New York Times and editor at large at Recode. They sought answers to the question: \u201cHow Big Should Big Tech Be?\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cI think we have lived for decades now with no regulation, so to speak, of tech,\u201d said Chris Hughes, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">co-founder of Facebook</url> and now the co-chair of the nonprofit       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">Economic Security Project</url>. \u201cAnd the time\u2019s come due for regulation, for structural solutions and for a general cultural rethinking of how to ensure that these platforms are working for us rather than us working for the platforms.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The challenges include increasing concerns about how private data is collected and used; the spreading of false information that could influence the 2020 election, by both foreign and domestic actors on social media; and whether behemoths like Facebook, Google and Amazon should be split up.</p><p>\u201cI definitely think we need market regulation,\u201d said Gabriel Weinberg, the founder and chief executive of the search engine DuckDuckGo. \u201cI think it\u2019s the only way to correct systemic market failures.\u201d</p><p>But addressing the myriad issues is not a one-time affair. \u201cI\u2019m worried Congress is thinking that we\u2019re going to pass one privacy bill and be done for 20 years,\u201d he added.</p><p>And one tool will not resolve all the different and complex issues, said Noah Phillips, commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. First, \u201cwe need to ask what is the harm that we\u2019re solving and how does the remedy address that harm?\u201d</p><p>If the question is competition, he said, then that\u2019s what antitrust laws are for. Privacy, on the other hand, will require other approaches. And therein, he and others have said, lies the crux of the dilemma.</p><p>For there to be any change in how the big technology companies are operating, most agreed that there must be a confluence of several factors: a strong congressional mandate, leadership to address long-term needs, more resources for agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and a public willingness to lose some of the ease and convenience people now get through companies like Amazon.</p><p>Steve Huffman, the chief executive of Reddit and the only head of a social media company in the room, said: \u201cWhen it comes to regulation it\u2019s the detail that matters. I don\u2019t want to see regulation that\u2019s knee-jerk or comes from a position of fear.\u201d</p><p>But he acknowledged, \u201cThe state of our political discourse is as toxic as it\u2019s ever been in my lifetime.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Huffman said Reddit was not following Twitter\u2019s lead in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">banning political ads</url> \u2014 something Facebook has refused to do. He said he believes such an action favors incumbents, but Reddit is considering enabling comments on all political ads. Currently, those who buy the ads can decide whether or not they are open to comments.</p><p>Such discussion reflects \u201ca healthy debate about how we treat political ads in this country,\u201d Mr. Huffman said. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t agree with their decisions, I also don\u2019t really agree with the status quo.\u201d</p><p>Some said, though, that the workers inside companies can make a bigger difference than government officials coming in from the outside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen more regulation go bad in technology than produce good,\u201d said Craig Newmark, the founder of Craigslist and the head of Craig Newmark Philanthropies. \u201cI\u2019ve been working with line workers, grunts, my fellow nerds in these tech companies who are now actively working to try to get their management to do the right thing, and that\u2019s beginning to bear fruit.\u201d</p><p>For Kate Crawford, a co-founder of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">AI Now Institute</url> at New York University, which aims to understand the social implications of artificial intelligence, it isn\u2019t a matter of choosing between government intervention or worker and public action, but advocating for both.</p><p>\u201cThe question isn\u2019t whether regulation works or do we need it,\u201d Ms. Crawford said. \u201cI think we absolutely need it, but the question we have to ask is \u2018Is it going to be enough?\u2019\u201d</p><p>She said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">collective action by workers</url> at companies like Google, investigations by the news media and institutions like hers were all shining a light on the workings of the major technology companies as never before.</p><p>On the question of whether the big tech companies should be broken up \u2014 as Elizabeth Warren has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytdealbookconference.com/\">advocated</url> in her presidential campaign \u2014 Mr. Hughes said it was now clear that a majority of Americans want that.</p><p>\u201cIn a time when Republicans and Democrats can\u2019t really agree on anything, there seems to be a pretty wide bipartisan consensus that we should be paying more attention to this,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the question is, where does that go, and how does that develop over the next year?\u201d</p><p>But Ms. Crawford warned that breaking technology companies into smaller entities would not necessarily solve the problem.</p><p>\u201cIf we move from 10 major players to 100 but don\u2019t question the underlying business model, is that really going to address this very complex set of problems?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy are we not talking about, essentially, the sort of rapacious excavation of everybody\u2019s biometric information, location data, the use of everything that is available to train A.I. systems? Why are we not looking at labor practices in terms of contract work forces?\u201d</p><p>Or as Alexa von Tobel, the founder and managing partner of Inspired Capital, noted, \u201cYou can be a really small company with incredible A.I. and quantum computing and owning data of enough people and be very, very dangerous.\u201d</p><p>While the challenges can seem overwhelming \u2014 and at times the conversation steered toward the apocalyptic \u2014 Mr. Hughes, for one, was optimistic.</p><p>\u201cWe can get regulation right. We do it with airlines. We do it with pharmaceuticals. We do it with the F.C.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have come to a cultural agreement in the United States that when private industry is crucially important in our lives, we have to ensure that it works for the people.\u201d</p><p>Task force moderator: Kara Swisher.

In fact, the organisers don't really want it either, but we have worked with them for 13 years now and I think we understand each other quite well. We have actually had offers in those 13 years for additional branding at the festival but have always declined, because the presence needs to be handled delicately. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> - Your brand presence seemed to be slightly reduced this year, was that deliberate? </p><p> This year we did ease back a little. Last year there was a big tech showcase, music acts and more branding than usual, but it needed to be simplified. We had three 'Chill n Charge' (phone-charging areas) venues at the festival this year, but no acts and a much subtler brand presence with no music. It's Glastonbury, people go elsewhere on-site for the music; they just want to avoid long queues when they are charging their phones. </p><p> We also felt our VIP area needed changing this year. There has always been an area within the site, but this year we worked with Glastonbury to come up with something slightly more premium. Technically, it was off-site (the Orange area was in a house and garden literally 20 yards outside the gate) but that meant it was discreet. Because it had less footfall it stayed less muddy, which suited the VIPs and media. </p><p> - What have been Orange's most successful brand activations at Glastonbury? </p><p> The Glastonbury 2011 app we produced worked brilliantly. It was something like the Chill n Charge tents, where we found an area that we could add to the festival experience. We also had a T-shirt that charged your phone using sound alone, and the 'Appy Man' competition, which used Twitter. Again, they were simple and functional, but as a result we were the only brand that was mentioned on social networking sites with any sort of influence around the festival itself. </p><p> We are lucky that with Orange we have a distinctive brand. </p><p> I have black wellies with the word 'muddy' on them and people often ask if it's Orange branding, simply because the typeface is the same. You can be subtle and still get the brand recognised. </p><p> - What do you think the future is for technology brands at festivals? </p><p> I think we will move into mobile ticketing and payment, another area in which we can improve people's experience. In ten years everyone will be using payment through mobile, it will be much safer than carrying cash It's tough introducing something new to any festival, the organisers can be wary, so you have to take small steps. </p><p> - Is it possible to ever make sales at festivals as a tech brand? </p><p> It's hard for a brand like Orange to make money directly from a festival, and I don't think it should try. We measure emotional proximity rather than sales. Hopefully, people go away feeling good about Orange and when it comes to making a decision about their next contract they will consider us favourably. It's easier for FMCG brands to make actual sales, and when I was at Budweiser our festival presence was all about just that, but with other brands you have to be more considered. </p><p> Top three tips for a brand at a festival </p><p> 1 Work in partnership with the festival organisers </p><p> 2 Make sure that you have a role and a relevance at the festival </p><p> 3 Keep your presence simple </p><p> THE AGENCY </p><p> Henry Scotland, Joint managing director, Iris's experiential arm </p><p> - What are the best types of festivals for brands to work at? </p><p> Ones where the punters match your target, the vibe matches your brand, and the promoter knows what they're doing and are unlikely to go out of business. Perhaps more importantly, one where you can identify an opportunity to deliver value/entertainment/utility without betraying your consumer or your brand's values. </p><p> - Conversely, what are the best types of brands to work with at festivals? </p><p> Those that join in rather than tag along. You must put as much energy into empathy with the festival goer as you put into concept development; an individual's hopes, fears, needs and interests aren't the same as they are in the real world. The brands that succeed are the ones that ask themselves the simple question: 'Would someone actually give a damn about this?'. </p><p> - How much should the festival organiser be allowed to dictate what you get up to, if at all? </p><p> A fair bit; quality promoters can't exist without a close connection with their audience. If Rob Da Bank or Emily Eavis doesn't like what we propose for Bestival or Glastonbury, it's probably not the right idea. The days where concepts are blocked by promoters for no reason are behind us. </p><p> - Can you give examples where a brand presence has been done well at a festival? </p><p> Rizla has always done a great job, but doesn't have to work very hard to make a connection with the festival goer. Luxury watch brand IWC chose to turn the festival wristband into an elegant replica vintage watch to communicate its sponsorship of Vintage at Goodwood this year. That struck me as an ingenious and non-intrusive way of entering into the spirit of things. </p><p> - Are there any specific health and safety regulations to look out for at festivals? </p><p> Yes, but nowadays you'd be taking an unnecessary risk not to budget for a specialist heath and safety consultant to write bespoke documents for your event. With security it depends on the experience you want - security can be as visible as your promotional staff. We hand-pick individuals if we can. The Specialized crew at Bestival added so much to the vibe in PlayStation's Cocktails &amp; Dreams structure that there were countless mentions on the festival forums and even letters to the head office. </p><p> - The weather is an obvious factor at festivals. What provisions can you make? </p><p> A roof is very useful in the rain, but it's also great not to have one when the sun's out, which is why we made the roof on Cocktails &amp; Dreams retractable. </p><p> Top three tips for activating brands at festivals </p><p> 1 Be true to your values and theirs </p><p> 2 Be very interesting or very useful </p><p> 3 If you build it they won't necessarily come </p><p> THE ORGANISER </p><p> Fiona Stewart, Green Man Festival </p><p> - You've decided you want to produce a festival; what do you do next? </p><p> You have to have a concept and then see whether there is a gap in what is now a very crowded market. You've got to get the right advisors, and, once you've done your research and you feel there is an opportunity, really commit to it. </p><p> - Can you guarantee immediate success? </p><p> Three years is a good period within which to look to make profit. Aim to break even within the first year, and if it's not working within three then the hard reality is it probably won't be a success. Many of the best festivals started off as club nights or small events and grew into something bigger, which meant they arrived on the scene with a fanbase already in place. Without that you have to work harder, and you should look for any festival to have at least a national footprint in terms of reach. Think big. </p><p> - Where can you learn the skills to be successful as a festival organiser? </p><p> The ones I know who have succeeded are usually self-taught. Starting a festival is an entrepreneurial thing; you plan, then deal with problems as they arise. However, even though you are in competition with other organisers, they will be very helpful and give you advice. There are lots of clever and able festival organisers out there. </p><p> - Is sponsorship a sensible route or does it dilute a festival's 'authenticity'? </p><p> It varies. The Big Chill was always highly sponsored, and that works, but equally the Green Man Festival is a brand that wouldn't fit such a high level of sponsorship. The best sponsorships are 'in kind' and enhance the experience of the festival by producing an area that people will enjoy. </p><p> - How do you book the right acts? </p><p> The biggest mistake people make is spending all the money on artistes and forgetting that a licensing officer will need paying, or that you need more than two toilets for 10,00 people. Build relationships with people, because it is more difficult than it was ten years ago to book acts. Not only are there more festivals vying over the same artistes, with less money being earned through record sales the acts have put their costs up. </p><p> Top three tips </p><p> 1 Buy The Purple Guide, which advises on health and safety </p><p> 2 Double-up on toilets </p><p> 3 Make sure that everything hired is covered by the provider's insurance. You don't want to pick up their bills. </p><p> THE SUPPLIER </p><p> Robert Limbrick, Sales and marketing manager, Andyloos </p><p> - How do you build relationships with a festival, and what is the best way to get business? </p><p> Essentially it's a matter of providing quality equipment at the right price, with outstanding service. Quite often it's difficult to break into an existing relationship; people use the same suppliers again and again. You have to keep going and see if they eventually let you quote. </p><p> - Is under-ordering of facilities a big problem or have festivals learnt their lesson now? </p><p> Some will still try to order the absolute minimum number of toilets to keep costs down. Our experience is that if the toilets are fine and there are enough of them, all the festival-goers will just think that everything is as it should be, but if the toilets are poor, that will be the abiding memory of the festival. Start-up festivals don't always do enough research. </p><p> - With the market being so crowded, how do you choose which festivals to work with? </p><p> We cover a wide range of events, not just festivals. It's a very competitive market. We quote a price, subject to availability, and as orders come in the stock is allocated. Some jobs may be booked for a number of years in advance, others are on a year-by-year basis. This policy is also true with regards to the Olympics. Our policy is to supply our existing customers first. </p><p> - What help or advice do you give festivals about positioning and maintaining your equipment? </p><p> Make sure service levels are right on the site. People usually think they can keep toilets clean with fewer attendants than they actually need. We insist they are on a flat spot, for obvious reasons, and a service vehicle needs access to them. Also, where will the footfall be? It's obvious, but always put urinals next to the beer tent. </p><p> - Many organisers say they don't have many toilets due to the cost. Do you think suppliers are over-pricing? </p><p> This is a highly competitive market, and we all have similar transport and labour costs relative to delivering, installing and servicing toilets and showers. If you over-price you don't get the job. </p><p> - What are your top three tips for working at festivals, as a supplier? </p><p> 1 Service, service, service </p><p> 2 Deliver the equipment you agree on </p><p> 3 Constantly check your equipment </p><p> -------------------- </p><p> Did you find this article useful?

Josh Hawley quickly weighed in, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1265444047365312515\"> tweeting </url> on Tuesday night about ending the  special immunity  granted to Twitter under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which prevents websites from being sued over content posted by their users. By Wednesday afternoon, the Missouri Republican had sent a pointed       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2020-05/Hawley-Letter-Twitter-Trump-Tweets.pdf\"> letter </url> to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1265737658082430977\"> announced </url> plans for legislation that would  divest  Twitter and, presumably, other tech platforms of their liability protections.</p><p>Efforts to punish Twitter s fact-checking by altering Section 230 spilled over into the House as well, with Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Trump ally, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/RepMattGaetz/status/1265724465767493637\"> teasing </url> another bill that would  revise Section 230 so we don t have election interference from companies like Twitter. </p><p>Twitter s move even earned new Republican converts in the battle against Section 230. On Tuesday, Sen. Marco Rubio, for what appeared to be the first time, <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1265442093641732096\"> called on </url> social-media platforms to forfeit their legal protections, suggesting that the company  has decided to exercise an editorial role like a publisher\" so \"they should no longer be shielded from liability [and should be] treated as publishers under the law. </p><p>The sudden eruption on the Right which included <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265601611310739456\"> threats </url> from Trump to  strongly regulate  or even  close down  social-media platforms, as well as an executive order  pertaining to social media  that the White House said Trump would sign on Thursday is unlikely to be welcomed by Twitter or the other major tech platforms. A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment on the president s tweets.</p><p>But politicization of big tech s primary legal shield has declined since a <url normalizedValue=\"../../../../../s/670337/house-push-to-tackle-social-media-bias-cuts-against-gop-orthodoxy\"> previous spike </url> in the summer of 2018, when Republicans looking to gin up their base ahead of midterm elections tore into the tech industry for its perceived anti-conservative bias. </p><p>Since then, lawmakers from both parties have come together to push for significant tweaks to Section 230. That includes the EARN IT Act, a joint effort from Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham and Sen. Richard Blumenthal tying big tech s legal protections to efforts to prevent the spread of child-sex-abuse material online. Some experts say a renewed focus by the Right on the politics of Section 230 could poison those bipartisan efforts. </p><p> I think the new right-wing push against Section 230 is going to motivate people in the other direction, to preserve it,  said Mark Jaffe, a partner at TorMark Law who advises tech-industry clients on Section 230.  And not just people on the Left, but anybody disgusted with the idea that our president or U.S. senators can threaten private companies based on speech they like, or force them to stop criticizing the administration. I think we re going to see a lot of resistance to that. </p><p>That resistance was evident in the reaction from Blumenthal, a relentless critic of Section 230, who <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/SenBlumenthal/status/1265686339024011264\"> tweeted </url> Wednesday that Twitter s  milquetoast  move to label Trump s tweets prompted  a horrifying demagogic response  on the part of the president. </p><p> A bill that s based on  bias  becomes politicized enough that it will not pass,  said Riana Pfefferkorn, associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. That s also true, Pfefferkorn added, for any efforts floated by Democrats to require the labeling of misinformation, deepfakes, or foreign propaganda. </p><p> The only coherent position that anybody, in Congress or the White House or among the general public, ever seems to hold about Section 230 is the underlying desire of,  Platforms should be forced to moderate speech I don't like but should be punished for moderating speech I do like,   Pfefferkorn said.</p><p>Of course, any surge in Republican activity around Section 230 may not actually be aimed at passing legislation, particularly in an election year.</p><p> I think they smell blood and are making this political,  said Adam Thierer, senior tech-policy researcher at the libertarian Mercatus Center at George Mason University.  It s part of laying the groundwork for a much broader effort, come election time, to suggest to an electorate that,  Hey, they re all against us. ... It s us versus them.  </p><p>Rachel Bovard, senior adviser at the Internet Accountability Project, a conservative group skeptical of big tech, rejected the notion that Republicans are playing politics.</p><p> Trump is responding to what Twitter did to him,  Bovard said.  It s not like he invented something to yell about. They actually took an action, and he s responding to it. </p><p>Bovard said the fierce response to Twitter s action, including new legislative efforts to strip legal protections from the platforms, instead indicate a slow-but-steady shift in how Republicans view private industry.</p><p> For a long time, people would say, 'These are private companies; leave them alone,'  Bovard said.  We ve now shifted. I think there is a general recognition among Republicans that these companies have outgrown their legal framework on data protection, on speech, if it s still a free market.</p><p> That used to just be a Left issue,  Bovard said.  It is squarely an issue for the Right now as well. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-707103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600W-HS51-DY4X-T013-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"932\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The National Journal Group, Inc.

I'm Bianca Nobilo. Let's get right to our breaking news. Donald Trump has just thrown fuel on a firestorm of controversy over his racist tweets about four Democratic women of color. Not only is the U.S. president attacking the congresswomen again, but he's also attacking the very ideals of American democracy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Trump just accused the lawmakers, all vocal critics of his government, of hating the United States because, quote, \"All they do is complain.\" He said he's not concerned if people think his tweet was racist. It urges the congresswomen -- all American citizens, three of them born in the United States -- to go back to the, quote, \"broken and crime-infested countries they came from.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here's how he put it today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you're not happy here, then you can leave. As far as I'm concerned, if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave. And that's what I say all the time. That's what I said in a tweet, which I guess some people think is controversial. A lot of people love it, by the way. A lot of people love it.</p><p>But if you're not happy in the U.S., if you're complaining all the time, very simply, you can leave. You can leave right now. Come back if you want, don't come back. It's OK too. But if you're not happy, you can leave.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: A handful of Trump's fellow Republicans have criticized his attack on their colleagues. But so far, most of them are remaining silent.</p><p>Let's bring in CNN White House Reporter, Sarah Westwood. We're also joined by Suzanne Malveaux, who's following reaction on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Sarah, let's start with you. It was startling, seeing what the president had to say today. He doubled down. tell us what were the top lines for you?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, Bianca, sources tell CNN that it was President Trump's decision to go out and address these controversial tweets at an event that was supposed to be showcasing American manufacturing.</p><p>But the president, essentially doubling down on those racist attacks on the four freshman House Democrats, accusing them of hating America, mischaracterizing some past statements -- particularly from Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, falsely claiming, for instance, that she's praised terrorist groups -- to make the argument that, again, as he did in his tweets, if they don't like America, they can leave.</p><p>TEXT: Trump Posts Racist Tweets, says progressive Dems should \"go back\" to the countries they came from: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York, born in New York; Rashida Tlaib, Michigan, born in Detroit; Ilhan Omar, Minnesota, born in Mogadishu, Somalia; Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts, born in Cincinnati</p><p>WESTWOOD: Now, this comes after the chief of staff for Vice President Mike Pence, earlier today, tried to argue that the president was only referring to Congresswoman Omar, and specifically to statements that Omar has made in the past that critics have characterized as anti-Semitic.</p><p>But President Trump sort of shattered that argument from one of his own senior staffers by also going after Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York for actions she took toward Amazon headquarters, which also had nothing to do with her patriotism.</p><p>The president, sparking a backlash among some Republicans but, again, many on Capitol Hill, staying silent as the president doubles down on those racist attacks despite the wave of criticism -- Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: Let's go to Capitol Hill now, then, with Suzanne.</p><p>Suzanne, as Sarah was just saying, the response has been predominantly silence. There have been one or two Republicans -- the senator from Pennsylvania and some others -- who have criticized what President Trump said. Talk to us about the mood in Capitol Hill, and what's the perspective on those Republicans and their reaction to this?</p><p>SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Sure, Bianca. I mean, it has been very tense here on Capitol Hill, we have basically been canvassing many of the hallways, looking for members of Congress as well as their Twitter feeds, to see how they are responding. Tremendous amount of support from the Democrats, of course, but very little from the Republicans. Radio silence, just a handful of them weighing on this, this morning.</p><p>I had a chance to catch up with Congressman Will Hurd. He represents Texas' 23rd District. It is on the southern border. He is, from time to time, been a critic of the president regarding immigration as well as the child separation policy.</p><p>He is also the only African-American in the House who is a Republican. And so he has a very unique role in the discussion, in the debate over this. He, without question, came out very strong against the president's comments, against his tweets. Here's what he's told me earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. WILL HURD (R-TX): The tweets are racist and xenophobic. They're also inaccurate because the four women he's referring to are folks that have grown -- they are U.S. citizens. It's behavior that's unbecoming of a president of the United States and the leader of the free world. We should be talking about uniting people, not dividing us.</p><p>[14:05:00] And ultimately, politically, it's hurtful. You are having a civil war going on within the Democratic Party, and now they've all encircled the wagons and are protecting one another, right? So that's my thoughts. And unfortunately for someone like me who's the only black Republican in the House of Representatives, this makes it even harder when I go into communities that most Republicans don't show up to. This makes it harder in order to bring our message.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MALVEAUX: Now, Bianca, there were two things that I asked, follow-up questions to the congressman. First of all, whether or not he expects or hopes that his colleagues, Republican colleagues, will speak out about this. He said that he hopes they certainly will, that he expects that they will. But so far, just a handful of people who have acknowledged and said that this is wrong.</p><p>I also asked him if he thought there was additional -- some sort of punishment that could come to the president, or some way that they could express their displeasure here. He did not believe that that was necessary. He said he believed that the president can tweet anything that he wants, but that it does have long-term consequences in terms of the long-term hurt he addressed (ph).</p><p>Speaker Pelosi, however, said that they will be introducing a resolution on the House floor, and that she certainly hopes that the Republicans join the Democrats in condemning the president's remarks.</p><p>And, Bianca, I have to tell you, the Democrats feel very unified over this. They feel that this is a rallying cry. Whereas last week there was some tension, even some conflict between the House speaker, Pelosi, and these four freshman congresswomen. Now they are all on the same page -- Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: Suzanne Malveaux on Capitol Hill and Sarah Westwood at the White House, thank you both.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump says planned raids to round up as many undocumented immigrants as possible got off to a great start on Sunday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The ICE raids were very successful. People came into our country illegally, illegally. Many were felons, many were convicted of crimes. Many, many were taken out on Sunday. You just didn't know about it --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How many?</p><p>TRUMP: -- in fact, I went to -- I spoke to the head of ICE. I spoke to a couple of people. We had many people. It was a very successful day.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: Agents were to target some 2,000 immigrants under deportation orders in nine cities. But activists say, for the most part, it's been quiet. \"The New York Times\" reports agents opted for a series of smaller- scale arrests over the weekend. The paper says media coverage sent many immigrants into hiding.</p><p>For the latest, let's bring in CNN's Polo Sandoval. He joins us from New York.</p><p>Polo, you spent yesterday in (ph) amongst (ph) some of New York's most vibrant migrant communities. What was the mood there?</p><p>POLO SANDOVAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, there certainly is this fear, Bianca, right? Among many migrants. For example, we spent some time there in Queens, which is one of the most culturally diverse places on the planet here, speaking to not just migrants, but also some of those who support those migrants.</p><p>They say that they have seen very little to no sign of these kinds of operations. So it's interesting, what we hear from the White House -- President Trump, today, calling these operations successful -- when just a little while ago, we heard from the New York City Mayor's Office of Immigrants Rights, saying that they have no confirmed reports of any ICE encounters.</p><p>It doesn't necessarily mean that they did not happen, of course. Oftentimes, they may not necessarily coordinate -- federal authorities may not necessarily coordinate with local and state authorities. But from what we have heard from some of those here in the city of New York, there have been no obvious raids, no obvious operations here.</p><p>And then when you hear from some of those legal aid assistant centers, they say that a bulk of their phone calls have been more people wanting to know their rights, wanting to really understand what they can and can't do, should ICE come knocking on their door.</p><p>So it's really more those calls, versus people who need immediate legal representation because federal agents are potentially going to deport them at any moment. So that's really what we're seeing, not just here in New York City but in many communities across the country as well.</p><p>NOBILO: Polo, I referenced in the introduction, the fact that \"The New York Times\" is reporting that some of these raids have been scaled back. What do we know about the reasons why that would have happened?</p><p>SANDOVAL: Well, we know that the administration has said that one of the main reasons for that was because that -- some information had leaked to the general public, that obviously there would be a concern for officer safety.</p><p>But let's keep in mind, Bianca, that some of the first public reports of these kinds of operations came straight from the commander in chief when he tweeted to his 62 million followers on social media, that these mass deportations would be happening. That was last month. Fast-forward to today. Now, we're still trying to get a better understanding of the scope of these so-called ICE round-ups here.</p><p>I'll tell you what we should be looking out for, though, in the next couple of days, the next couple of months, really -- or weeks, perhaps. Is exactly who are the people that are listed in those statistics, right? The president today said that these operations were successful, that there were many people who were contacted by federal officers.</p><p>[14:10:02] But now, the main question, were those people -- those criminal undocumented immigrants, those people who have committed felonies, perhaps, that have been prioritized by not just this administration but previous ones, or are they actual family units? Which would indicate that Immigration and Customs Enforcement essentially broadening their scope under the president's direction.</p><p>So that's something we're going to have to see, moving forward. Again, perhaps the next few days, perhaps the next few weeks, when ICE releases some of their stats.</p><p>NOBILO: We know you'll keep an eye on it for us. Polo Sandoval in New York, thank you.</p><p>SANDOVAL: Thanks, Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: For more on the Trump administration's policy on undocumented immigrants and the uproar over the president's tweets, let's bring in political analyst Anushay Hossain, as well as CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Doug Heye.</p><p>Thank you both for being with us.</p><p>Anushay, let's start with you. The reaction from the Republican Party has obviously been muted. There's been silence, there's been a few who have come out to condemn the president's remarks. Who is he directing these remarks at and why are they resonating?</p><p>ANUSHAY HOSSAIN, POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, they're resonating because Trump isn't the president of every single American or all of America. He's the president of his base. And Trump is deploying an old, you know, playground tactic. \"Go back to your country,\" is something that he says to strong women of color who oppose him.</p><p>And this isn't new news. This is a pattern. This is a -- being racist is a part of the Trump presidency brand, and it's something that is the feature and not a bug of this Trump administration.</p><p>NOBILO: You mentioned -- you mentioned, there, the exact phrasing, the \"Go back where you came from.\" And it's difficult to sort of conceptualize how that resonates with certain people.</p><p>I was talking to my team today -- I'm not born in this country -- and because I look a certain way and sound a certain way, I would never be told to go back home. So that brings us back to the inescapable racial and ethnocultural element to this.</p><p>HOSSAIN: Exactly, exactly.</p><p>NOBILO: How do you think most Americans would react to that?</p><p>HOSSAIN: Well, it -- first of all, the discussion of whether this or not is racist, is not what the discussion should be. It should be, \"Are we going to continue tolerating it?\" Because Donald Trump, to his credit, has -- this is the way he's -- this has been a part of his strategy of his presidency since before he became president. Let's not forget that he entered the political arena with a massive racist strategy, which was questioning where Barack Obama, the first black president in America, was born.</p><p>And also, it's important to remember that saying things like, \"If you don't like how immigrants are being treated here, go back to where you come from,\" has huge racial implications, but also it suggests that America is only meant for white Americans, not anybody else, people of color.</p><p>NOBILO: Doug, let's go to you next. It seems that as long as the president's popularity amongst his base remains fairly stable, that this pattern is likely to continue, the fact that he is happy to wade into issues that are often avoided by other politicians. Do you agree?</p><p>DOUG HEYE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, absolutely. And his base -- the base support that he has isn't just broad, it's very intense. So members of Congress, Republican members, when they're back in their states and their districts, they don't just hear their voters saying that they approve of Donald Trump, they hear it loudly and they hear it often, everywhere they go.</p><p>I was talking to a member of Congress last week, who told me they were accosted three times as a supermarket while they were grocery-shopping with their wife, for not supporting the president enough. And this is somebody who's a supporter of the president.</p><p>So this is what they hear all the time. So unfortunately, politically, there's not much motivation for them to speak out. You're hearing a few -- Will Hurd, the only African-American Republican member of Congress, was one of the first people to speak up. You'll hear more. But it won't be broad because the party is in fear of what happens to people who cross Donald Trump.</p><p>NOBILO: And speaking of somebody who did not condemn the president today, Lindsey Graham. Let's take a listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): We all know that AOC and this crowd are a bunch of communists, they hate Israel, they hate our own country, they're calling the guards along our border, the Border Patrol agents, \"concentration camp guards.\" They accuse people who support Israel of doing it \"for the Benjamins.\" They're anti-Semitic, they're anti-America. Don't get to (ph) aim higher? We don't need to know anything about them personally. Talk about their policies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: Doug, do you think that in the lead-up to 2020, especially with the Democratic race, you're seeing candidates trying to one-up each other in terms of their policy. Do you think that that is -- do you think that's helping the president in a sense, is their moving further and further to left in some of these debates?</p><p>HEYE: Sure. If you talk to folks who are working at the Republican National Committee or the Trump campaign, they would tell you that those two debates that they -- that the Democrats recently had, were great for the Trump administration, were great for the re-election effort.</p><p>[14:15:09] When every member of Congress is raising their hands on things that are very divisive issues or calling for private health care insurance to be eliminated, that's what Donald Trump wants to be talking about. And it sets up the comparison that would be very favorable for him. He has a very tough re-elect. It's a very narrow path. But what I saw at the previous two debates, makes that path easier for him.</p><p>NOBILO: Anushay, it seems that because politicians, whether in the United Kingdom, where I am, or in the United States, discussing the issue of migration and how to best handle it, is sensitive. And it can be uncomfortable for a lot of politicians in the center, so they do tend to avoid it.</p><p>Now, of course, that presents lots of fertile ground for President Trump and some of his allies, to capitalize on that. Do you think that's an issue, the fact that there isn't much reasoned moderate evidence-based debate when it comes to migration because it isn't a topic that politicians feel that they can wade into without inflaming passions on both sides?</p><p>HOSSAIN: I think that's giving them way too much credit. And, you know, the Lindsey Graham segment that we just saw, I mean, he probably got his talking points straight from the president's mouth.</p><p>Things are so polarized here now, Bianca. They're more polarized than they've ever been in America, and especially over issues such as immigration and race. So I think it's really important to remember that we can't see these as just isolated incidents, we have to see them in the large political strategy of the Trump presidency.</p><p>And now, naturally, an extension of his re-election strategy. We have to see this, the attack on these women of color, U.S. lawmakers, U.S. congresswomen, OK? Who were born in America, I think, all except for Ilhan Omar, who became, you know, a citizen here when she was 17.</p><p>We have to see this, coupled with the raids on immigration communities, with the children in cages, with the women and children who are dying in U.S. detention centers, with the men who were rounded up, not being allowed to shower. I mean, it goes on and on. Children in the same diapers for months.</p><p>I mean, this is a larger part and strategy to dehumanize people of color and immigrants. And you know what, Donald Trump has to count on his base to show up at the voting polls. That is a key part of him coming back and returning to staying in the White House. And so he's flaming the fans of the race card, starting from now. Because he knows that's what he has to rely on.</p><p>NOBILO: It's a very important point on the context there, that this is all developing in. Thank you both, Anushay Hossain and Doug Heye. Appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>HEYE: Thank you.</p><p>NOBILO: Still to come tonight, it was the stuff of dreams for sports fans. We'll discuss a day of sport here in London that had millions on the edge of their seats as two colossal finals made history.</p><p>It's the world's second-largest economy and its growth has slowed to its lowest level since the early '90s. We'll examine what China's latest GDP figures mean for the world.</p><p>[14:20:18] NOBILO: Welcome back. Sometimes, we need a break from stories of tragedy, conflict and political turmoil, which so often dominate the news agenda. And you can sometimes rely on sport to provide that very relief.</p><p>Sunday saw a day of sport that defied the expectations of even the most ardent fans. And London was certainly the place to be on Sunday, playing host to two record-breaking finals playing out simultaneously.</p><p>While Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, two of the greatest tennis players ever to play, battled it out in the longest Wimbledon singles final in history, across the city, England and New Zealand's cricketers produced a once-in-a-lifetime Cricket World Cup Final. The England won by the narrowest of margins.</p><p>It's all anyone can talk about today, and our team is covering both incredible stories from here in London. Christina MacFarlane is at the most famous club in tennis where that epic final took place. But first, Alex Thomas is at The Oval cricket ground, where England have been celebrating that hard-to-believe victory.</p><p>ALEX THOMAS, CNN WORLD SPORTS: Well, Bianca, they used to say cricket's boring. Not on Sunday, when England and New Zealand produced such a spectacular game of cricket, it's been called the greatest match of all time.</p><p>And in fact, one British broadcaster said it attracted more website traffic then even the last general election in this country. So no wonder the victorious England cricket team have been invited to 10 Downing Street to meet the British prime minister. That hasn't happened since their Ashes success over Australia back in 2005.</p><p>Whereas New Zealand, the losers, also had their prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, chip in, joking that it was a traumatic event for the country after a real nail-biter left England as men's Cricket World Cup winners for the first time in their history, 44 years after this event started.</p><p>That happened at Lord's across London. We're here at The Oval, where 6.5 weeks ago, England started their campaign by beating South Africa. And earlier on Monday, a day after their victory over New Zealand, they had friends and family and hundreds of school kids here, cheering them on and joining in the celebrations as they paraded the World Cup trophy around.</p><p>It was an extraordinary sporting Sunday because while that finale was happening at Lord's in northwest London, across town, something equally extraordinary was also taking place.</p><p>CHRISTINA MACFARLANE, CNN WORLD SPORT: At the very point the Cricket World Cup was reaching its climax, so, too, was the men's final here at Wimbledon. After four hours and 57 minutes -- the longest men's final in history -- one mishit from Federer at 12-12, deep into the tiebreak fifth set, not only sealed the match for Novak Djokovic, but could also become a defining moment for the future of men's tennis.</p><p>With this fifth win at the All England Club and his 16th Grand Slam overall, Djokovic now moves within four slams of Roger Federer's Grand Slam record, for the first time with Rafael Nadal sandwiched right in the middle on 18.</p><p>Federer may have missed his chance to become the oldest Grand Slam champion on Sunday, but he proved that at almost 38 years of age, he is still able to compete for the biggest titles in the game. And with just six weeks to go until the U.S. Open, we could well see these two rivals face off again in New York, where Djokovic will be the favorite to seal his third major title this year. Back to you, Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: Thanks to Christina and Alex there.</p><p>So cricket fans here in England definitely have a lot of celebrating to do -- unless you were born in New Zealand, like me -- including one of their biggest fans, Theresa May.</p><p>The prime minister may be out of a job in just a couple of weeks, but she isn't letting that stop her from enjoying the victory. She busted out these now-famous dance moves on Sunday night.</p><p>And in just the last few minutes, Mrs. May welcomed the cricket team to Downing Street for a victory party. Earlier, she said the World Cup win will live forever in our sporting history.</p><p>Now, let's get a check on Wall Street this hour. Here's how the Dow is tracking, slightly lower in afternoon trading. This after China announced its economic growth slumped to its lowest level in almost three decades. Growth of 6.2 percent, the world's second-largest economy apparently feeling the effects of the trade war with the United States.</p><p>CNN's Business Editor-at-Large and anchor of \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS,\" Richard Quest, is here in London and he joins us live now to break this story down for us.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN EDITOR AT LARGE: Right.</p><p>NOBILO: So, Richard, what are the main reasons that we're seeing this slowdown in growth?</p><p>QUEST: Do you know, we know that the Chinese economy has problems. Debt, slowdowns, left, right and center. So a poor situation has been made much worse by the trade battle with the United States, which is why Donald Trump tweeted -- or wasted no time, basically saying, \"I'm winning and I'm causing them pain and they should do a deal that they don't want to do.\"</p><p>[14:25:19] But I think that's telling only half the story. Because China, if you look underneath the headline numbers, you do see room for some optimism. There's a lot more consumption in China. It's not all based on government growth. It's not all based on exports. People are starting to build. The Chinese are building a middle class, unfortunately just too slowly.</p><p>NOBILO: And can we trust the data? Because there's always --</p><p>QUEST: Oh, no (ph). Oh, no (ph).</p><p>NOBILO: -- question marks over that.</p><p>QUEST: No, absolutely not.</p><p>NOBILO: So is it likely to be much worse than this?</p><p>QUEST: Yes, yes, is the short answer. I mean, they say 6.2 percent. Well, bearing in mind President Xi gave a range of 6.1 to 6.8, and he's just come in at the end of the range on the lower end, I mean, is it 5.9, 5.5? I don't think it's anything disastrously lower, or you would have certainly seen that elsewhere in the Chinese numbers. But I would not take this number to the bank and put it on the 3-30 (ph) at Newmarket.</p><p>NOBILO: Is this going to have any impact on how China continues to conduct these trade negotiations with the U.S.? Because they have the luxury of looking far longer-term (INAUDIBLE) the U.S.</p><p>QUEST: That's the -- well -- who, the Chinese?</p><p>NOBILO: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Yes. And the question, of course, is how much pain will they suffer and how -- unlike -- I mean, the harsh reality is, unlike President Trump, that faces an electorate --</p><p>NOBILO: Exactly.</p><p>QUEST: -- next year, President Xi, as best I can tell, is not about to face the voters. What he is, though, going to have to do is keep regional governors happy and a rural angry (ph) elite (ph) happy as well. If he can't do that, then he will have to sue (ph) for peace in terms of a trade deal. But at the moment, it seems like he can contain it and he's able to say to President Trump, \"Fine.\"</p><p>NOBILO: At the moment, will we see any ripple effects from this around the world?</p><p>QUEST: Inevitably. If China's slowing down, all those economies in Southeast Asia that rely on -- Australia, for example, which buys -- China buys raw materials, iron ore and the like, that's going to have an effect. ASEAN countries will have an effect. If China's slowing down, it will not be buying things from other countries.</p><p>Let's remember, China is now an important part of the global economy. Not as important as the U.S. by any means, but it is a significant cog in the wheel, and that cog now has sand in it.</p><p>NOBILO: And what can the Chinese government do to try and lubricate the cog?</p><p>QUEST: Right. Stimulus. That's what you do. You try and do some stimulus. Well, they did in the beginning of the quarter. And you can change the reserve ratios, which is exactly what they're going to try and do again.</p><p>But they can't do too much of that because they have a banking crisis on their doors. They have a lending crisis. They've got a bad debt crisis. So whilst they can certainly have room for maneuverability, the levers that they can pull are by no means as sophisticated or well-oiled -- to use your analogy -- as it would be, for example, in the United States with monetary policy.</p><p>NOBILO: Will you be talking about this more on \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\"?</p><p>QUEST: Well, we thought we might ignore it for the whole program. Yes.</p><p>NOBILO: -- whether or not that's true.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>NOBILO: Tune in for \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" in half an hour.</p><p>[14:28:20] Still to come tonight, more on Donald Trump's racist tweets. Is the outrage and anger just what the president wanted all along?</p><p>[14:30:55] NOBILO: Welcome back. Returning to our top story, the fallout over Donald Trump's racist tweets and his refusal to back down even one inch from his controversial comments. Rather than continue to rehash the back and forth over what the president said and the reaction to it, we've already done that, we want to take a look at a different angle.</p><p>Is the media frenzy, over all of this, exactly what Donald Trump wants? Is it all the talk about the president's tweets distracting our attention from other more substantive issues?</p><p>Joining me now is CNN's chief media correspondent, Brian Stelter, the host of CNN's \"RELIABLE SOURCES.\" Brian, do you think that's what the president's trying to achieve here? Does he realize that his rhetoric is inflammatory, that it's going to cause all of this debate and are we just falling right into the trap?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Well, this would be the 3D chess theory that many political analysts like to subscribe to the idea that the president is calculated in his day-to-day maneuvers, in his tweet storms, that it's all designed to dominate the media economy, to maximize attention onto him and that all press is good press.</p><p>I generally do not subscribe to that theory, Bianca. I look at this and I think the president just reacts every day, every minute, to whatever he sees, whatever he reads, whatever he's angry about, he reacts impulsively, and then tries to spin it in a way that's advantageous.</p><p>So he may look around now and look for political advantages as a result of his angry tweet storm, his racist tweets yesterday. I generally think these are usually not calculated. But that is the grand debate in Washington and in New York and all across the U.S. these days, it has been for two years, how calculated are these rants?</p><p>Often times, I think these rants end up undermining the president and certainly hurting the United States on the world stage, so there's not 3D chess going on.</p><p>But to the extent that he does distract from, let's say, conditions at the border and other scandals and controversies like that, then it can, in some cases, be a win for him. I think the press, however, has learned to walk and chew many pieces of gum at the same time, you know.</p><p>NOBILO: Yes. And, Brian, we had -- have a quote here from the L.A. Times saying, we shouldn't rise to his bait, but how can we not? If we ignore him --</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>NOBILO: We normalize his reckless behavior, and that's even worse. So, Brian, my final question --</p><p>STELTER: This is exactly the issue, yes.</p><p>NOBILO: Exactly. So, it does put the media in a difficult position. We're always walking this tightrope. We don't want to wade willy-nilly into issues that are -- that have moral dimensions. But when there is a clear line crossed, what do you think the moral imperative is for the press?</p><p>STELTER: Right. I think the L.A. Times gets it exactly right. If we are to ignore what he's doing, that contributes to, you know, then that's a problem. If we cover it extensively, that's also a challenge. If every single day, it's raining BS from the sky and we start covering the rain, because we get used to the smell, we get used to the stench, then we are part of the problem.</p><p>The press has to continually point out that Trump is not living up to American values, is not acting presidential on the world stage. It's a daily story for us in the American media and in the international media, even though it can seem repetitive, and even though we end up talking a lot about Trump.</p><p>He is bringing up basic issues about American values and morality. Today, he's talking about what it means to be American, saying to somebody's congresswoman hate America. To him I would say to him what Edward R. Murrow said during the McCarthy scare, he said, we must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. Those words ring really true today.</p><p>NOBILO: Let's leave it there. Thanks, Brian Stelter. Really appreciate it.</p><p>STELTER: Thank you.</p><p>NOBILO: We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. I like it.</p><p>Well, we've covered a lot about what President Trump has said. Now, we want to examine what he's actually trying to do. The Trump administration filed documents that could dramatically limit the ability of migrants to apply for asylum in the U.S.</p><p>Nick Paton Walsh joins us now live from Mexico City. Nick, we have been focusing on the president's rhetoric. There's been more of it in the last couple of hours. But tell us more from the perspective of the people where you are about how these new policy ideas are going to affect migrants.</p><p>[14:35:06] NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, they're going to affect tomorrow. So this is action immediate, possibly, which will have an impact, obviously, on the hundreds of thousands, and thousands, certainly, of people who have tried to leave Central America and head north through Mexico, where I'm standing, up into the United States.</p><p>This will be published tomorrow in the Federal Register. A change to the rules, which basically says, if you're trying to get into the United States and claim asylum, well, you can't do that if you're from Central America, because you've transited through Mexico and really in their belief, you probably should have applied for asylum in Mexico instead.</p><p>They believe, this is legal, the Department of Justice, it will face legal challenges, certainly. But what it really means in practical terms is the Trump administration has got Mexico and to some degree Guatemala as well to put up as many practical challenges as they can for the path of migrants from Central America, where a combination of climate change, massive corruption, and violence leaves many people looking for a better life, well, frankly leaving out of desperation further north.</p><p>They've done all they can to practically slow them down by putting the Mexican National Guard down on the Guatemalan border and slowing the rate at which they listen to asylum cases certainly on border posts as well.</p><p>What this does, this legal change does, if it holds, is essentially say, the trip is pointless. Because once you get to the United States, we simply won't hear your asylum claim, because, frankly, they believe you've transited through a country where you could have claimed asylum instead. So there will be legal challenges, as I say, but essentially, this is about trying to use the Department of Justice's interpretation of U.S. law to basically mean that people trying to get to the U.S. from Central America are wasting their journey, Bianca.</p><p>BIANCA: And, Nick, is there a reason to believe that that will be a very effective deterrent?</p><p>PATON WALSH: Well, what's extraordinary is you've seen the lengths people will go to get to a better life, to get to in their mind safety in the United States. Now, you may possibly see people trying to use sea routes to go from Central America around Mexico and into the U.S. coast. Would that possibly mean this rule doesn't apply to them?</p><p>We know the desperate lengths people will go to. There have been reports of terrible instances in the past week or so, in which people trying to cross from Guatemala to Mexico, went onwards having the fact had to use drug cartels to facilitate that passage and being double crossed, a father found with his throat slit.</p><p>It's clear people will take, basically, any measures they need to, to try and get their families to a better life in the United States. And these increased number of instructions put up, human rights activists and advocates say simply push people into more desperate, dangerous measures. That's really the fear many have from this kind of rule, rather than it will suddenly stop people's need to get out of Central America where they face many deep economic and physical perils, too, simply by erecting another legal barrier. Bianca?</p><p>NOBILO: Nick Paton Walsh in Mexico City for us. Thank you.</p><p>Now, to New York, where federal prosecutors have laid out the reasons why multi-millionaire and accused sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein, should be detained before his trial. Prosecutors say Epstein kept a safe locked in his Manhattan home that contained a foreign passport. The passport was issued in the 1980s and it appeared to have Epstein's photo inside next to a fake name. It also listed his residence as Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Prosecutors say this expired foreign passport and Epstein's wealth make him a flight risk. The judge said he will decide on Thursday whether or not Epstein is released on bail.</p><p>Now, the United Nations is desperately asking for more money to tackle Ebola, as the virus has now spread to a major city on the border of Congo and Rwanda. The U.N. says a big scale up is needed to properly respond to the outbreak. The city of Goma reported its first case Sunday.</p><p>Goma is a major transit hub and home to more than a million people. Health experts are working around the clock to prevent the virus from spreading any further. This is the world's second largest outbreak. It began in August and has killed almost 1,700 people in Congo.</p><p>One young man who survived Ebola spoke to CNN. He tells our David McKenzie the fear around the virus is making the outbreak so much worse. But there is hope that a new treatment center will finally break the cycle of mistrust.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): When Ebola latched on to Roger's Wasakundi's (ph) family, denial came with it.</p><p>\"My sister got it first,\" he says. \"We didn't want to believe it was Ebola. She stayed at home and we buried her.\"</p><p>Through the intimacy of family, the virus spread to his aunt, to his mother, father, to him. It took days to persuade them to seek treatment at a center like this, where doctors told Roger that his father and aunt had died. So when they told me I had Ebola, he says, \"I thought I would die, too.\"</p><p>[14:40:08] In medical terms, stopping the spread of Ebola should be simple. Identify patients quickly, isolate them, trace their contacts. But halting this outbreak has been anything but.</p><p>The epicenter is anchored in a conflict zone, where authority often comes through violence, which breeds fear. \"This fear makes it difficult to stop the chain of transmission,\" says Sylvester Zhongwe (ph). What we needed was to break that fear.</p><p>Zhongwe, a health worker for French medical NGO, ALIMA, says that in the city of Butembo, they wouldn't let outsiders in. \"When responders came to take the sick from their homes, he says, they didn't know who they were. They believed they would take them over there to die. That's what created resistance.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, unknown assailants burnt down two treatment centers. All told, there have been more than 130 attacks on health outposts. ALIMA's solution, integrate an Ebola reception center in something people already knew, an existing clinic.</p><p>MCKENZIE (on-camera): So we're at a center where they receive patients who could have Ebola. But what's incredible about this, it's right inside a hospital. They negotiate with the community, they're hiring youth from the community, and this could be one of the answers.</p><p>MCKENZIE (voice-over): But it's still the only center of its kind. Many victims still die in their homes, refusing to seek treatment. And survivors return to a fearful community.</p><p>\"Many people don't believe Ebola even exists,\" says Roger. \"If people can accept this crisis, then we can end it.\"</p><p>David McKenzie, CNN, Butembo DRC.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: E.U. foreign ministers held crisis talks on the Iran nuclear deal today and said they aren't ready to trigger an official dispute mechanism just yet. The ministers decided to give diplomacy another chance. Even as Britain warns the small window to save the deal is closing.</p><p>Iran says it won't resume full compliance until Europe honors its commitments to shielding Tehran from U.S. sanctions. The E.U. foreign policy chief says Iran's breaches of the deal, so far, are not considered significant.</p><p>Still to come on the program tonight, Amazon Prime Day. There's a lot more than just some bargains going on here. A look at what protesters say Amazon is doing wrong. Stay with us.</p><p>NOBILO: This is one of the biggest shopping days of the year, with bunches of fabulous sales and deals. But if you go to your local store, you won't see any of that, because the shopping and the sales only exist online.</p><p>[14:45:00] Amazon's Prime Day has turned into a multi-billion-dollar global event. And it has also turned into a time for protesters to show their disgust with some of Amazon's policies.</p><p>With more on this, let's bring in CNN Business Correspondent, Clare Sebastian, in New York. So, Clare, it's not just a day for big deals, but it's also a day for protests. Talk us through those. What is it that people object to the most?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Bianca, we've seen protests on Prime Day before, but this year, it's starting to look even bigger. This is really starting to look like some kind of Amazon-specific May Day. A lot of different groups are out, a lot of different grievances, everything from workers' rights to conditions, and the fulfillment centers to Amazon's alleged involvement with the immigration and customs enforcement. Even climate change.</p><p>We're seeing for the first time in the U.S. workers are about to walk off the job, that's starting at the top of the next hour. And we're seeing globally as well, in Germany, 2,000 fulfillment center workers have walked off the job. More were expected to join today. There are protests over where you are over in the U.K.</p><p>And look, this is still expected to be a record-breaking Prime Day for Amazon. It's not like these protests are expected to disrupt the sheer number of purchasing dollars that are going to be spent online. But this was not the kind of marketing the company was looking for.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): When it came to marketing, this year's Prime Day, Amazon did not shop around for the cheapest options.</p><p>TAYLOR SWIFT, AMERICAN SINGER: I want to say thank you so much to Amazon for having us all.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Taylor Swift headlining the live streamed Prime Day concert, celebrities like Will Smith and Mark Wahlberg appearing in ads.</p><p>MARK WAHLBERG, AMERICAN ACTOR: You don't need to go shopping anymore, you just go to Amazon Prime.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Does the day work as an event?</p><p>CEM SIBAY, VICE PRESIDENT, AMAZON PRIME: Absolutely, absolutely. That's why we keep growing it.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Prime Day is now five years old and has grown to a full 48 hours. The deals are exclusive to Prime members, of which there are already more than 100 million across 18 countries.</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, MARKETING PROFESSOR, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY: More people are now in a monogamous relationship, if you will, with Amazon vis-a-vis prime than voted in the 2016 election or attend church.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Prime Day is now Amazon's biggest sales event of the year, bigger than Black Friday or Cyber Monday. But this year, it's not just about the many, many items getting shipped out of centers like this, the company is facing backlash on a number of fronts from its treatment of workers to concerns it's simply gotten too big.</p><p>Give me a sense of how you view that the regulations questions around the company at the moment?</p><p>SIBAY: I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: One thing they are thinking about, this Prime Day brings the first-ever walkout at a U.S. Fulfillment Center. This group of workers in Minnesota, which has protested in the past that employees have set unrealistic targets, leading to stress and injury.</p><p>SIBAY: We have a lot of redundancy in place. We have over 175 fulfillment centers globally to make sure that Prime member experiences are not disrupted during this event, as well. But we take, you know, concerns of our employees, obviously, very, very seriously, as well. But I'm really actually proud of the working conditions in our fulfillment centers.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So why do these concerns keep coming up?</p><p>SIBAY: Most of these are from outside conditions. It's obviously a very hot work environment as well.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: And the backlash is also coming from the competition, even as they launch their own sales to rival Prime Day. Target is advertising summer deal days, emphasizing no membership required. And eBay has gone a step further with a tongue and cheek ad featuring a teenager called --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Alexa?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Even calling their event a crush sale, promising extra deals if Amazon's website crashes, as happened in 2018.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They mostly have deals on a bunch of random stuff nobody really wants.</p><p>BRADFORD SHELLHAMMER, VICE PRESIDENT, EBAY: Unlike some of the other competitors, this time of year, the sales and deals that we are feature are not products that are sitting on our warehouses that are collecting dust that we have to liquidate.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: In an e-commerce market where one company controls almost half of all sales, Amazon's annual shopping festival has made it a pretty big target.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: Clare, you were just saying that by the conveyor belt, you were remarking about Amazon's size. The fact that it is so big. Tech companies are in the spotlight at the moment for that very reason. At what point do you think Amazon's giant size will start to work against it, if any?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, I think it's certainly telling, Bianca, that on the second day of Prime Day, which is tomorrow, Tuesday, Amazon's general counsel will be testifying on Capitol Hill to the House Judiciary Committee, a hearing entitled, online platforms and market power. We are seeing the drumbeat when it comes to potential regulation of this company growing louder.</p><p>We know that last month that the U.S. agencies kind of divvied up control of the big tech companies, Amazon reportedly falling under the federal trade commission. That raised the specter of more regulation. The stock has proved really sensitive to this. We know the company employs a lot of lobbyists in Washington.</p><p>We know that that rumored to be one of the reasons behind choosing Arlington, Virginia, just across the river from Capitol Hill, as the site for their second headquarters. So the company is acutely aware of this, but the drumbeat is growing a lot louder. We're seeing a lot of political pressure when it comes to this.</p><p>[14:50:05] NOBILO: Clare Sebastian in New York, thank you.</p><p>Now, to a long-overdue recognition for a man who was persecuted in life, but celebrated in death. The Bank of England has unveiled its new 50-pound note, with mathematician Alan Turing on the bill. Turing was instrumental in cracking German codes during World War II, inventing a device that many consider the precursor of the modern computer.</p><p>Despite his great contributions to science, Turing was ostracized for being homosexual and took his own life in 1954. Today, the Bank of England described him as a giant who was the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.</p><p>More to come tonight, including months after a devastating fire, there's still anxiety about the future of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. We'll take a rare look inside the restoration of this beloved landmark.</p><p>NOBILO: Welcome back. An unusual-looking pyramid is now open for visitors in Egypt. The bent pyramid is a 4,600-year-old structure. You can see here, how it got its name from those inclines. The pyramid had been closed for repair since 1965. Archaeologists found hidden tombs as well as mummies and mosques during a nearby excavations that began last year.</p><p>Repairing Notre Dame Cathedral is a painstaking process. Just three months after fire damaged this world treasure, engineers and antiquities experts are still sifting through the rubble.</p><p>Our Jim Bittermann got rare access to the early efforts of this massive restoration process.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tourists still make their way to Notre Dame in Paris, but these days, their holiday snapshots might look like they visited a construction site. Whether from an overabundance of caution or because those overseeing Notre Dame's rise from the ashes has never dealt with anything quite like this before, the work site is a high security zone. Few are let in. And given the high concentration of lead from the melted roof, all are required to wear special protective jumpsuits.</p><p>And the roof, a gaping hole where the fire burned most fiercely three months ago. The lead and other debris still litter the parts of the vaulted ceiling which did not give way, leading to worries the extra weight could still bring down parts of the building.</p><p>For the most, the chief architect is concerned about shoring up the flying buttresses, which support the walls and vaulted ceiling. Huge, precisely engineered wooden braces have been put in place beneath the ancient stonework to prevent it from shifting. No one is talking about rebuilding just yet.</p><p>In fact, the restoration of Notre Dame has not yet started. It could be another nine months or more before that gets underway. Right now, the chief architect says the building is in such fragile condition, it could still possibly collapse. And so work proceeds very slowly.</p><p>Debris still remains in the central nave area of the cathedral. The engineer on site says studies need to be made when the walls of Notre Dame are thoroughly dried out to determine how much weight they can bear. Still, he believes President Macron's 2024 deadline for rebuilding Notre Dame is possible.</p><p>[14:55:08] JEAN-MICHEL GUILMENT, PROJECT ENGINEER (through translator): I think by mobilizing everyone and by really committing large teams and major companies, it's doable. It's absolutely doable, but we mustn't waste time.</p><p>BITTERMANN: Meanwhile, the treasures of Notre Dame, like the religious relics which were rescued during and after the fire are safely stored away, many at the Louvre Museum. The stained glass windows are gone, taken away for cleaning and protection. The cultural ministry's conservator on the project says the cathedral's paintings survived surprisingly well.</p><p>MARIE-HELENE DIDIER, CONSERVATOR, FRENCH MINISTRY OF CULTURE (through translator): What reassured us when we made a thorough inspection, we saw the master pieces were all intact. There, we were, delighted, especially compared with the state of the building.</p><p>BITTERMANN: So given the state of the building, Notre Dame's rescue is cautious and slow. The cultural conservator says it's like working on an archaeological dig. Indeed, everything, burnt timber or scorched stone, everything brought out of the cathedral is marked with a grid number to indicate where it was found.</p><p>Even the conservators aren't sure where it will all end up. But they and everyone else working to save Notre Dame, know that from a religious, cultural, and historical point of view, they are part of a monumental project unlike any before.</p><p>Jim Bittermann, CNN, Paris.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: Before we leave you tonight, we just have to show you this image. Take a look at this. It's a giant jelly fish and it appears to be the size of a human. It stunned a diver off the southwestern coast of England. This barrel jelly fish, as it's called, was spotted near Falmouth by broadcaster and biologist, Lizzie Daly. She described the encounter as breathtaking.</p><p>Pyramids, cathedrals, and jelly fish.
