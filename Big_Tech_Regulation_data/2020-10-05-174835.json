THE IMPLICATIONS: How independent will this board really be? What are Facebook's true motivations for setting up this board?</p><p> Given the past history of fact checking and censorship, will this Independent Supreme Court become just another censoring authority?What's behind the Facebook Independent Supreme Court?Facebook has announced[2] the formation of a new Oversight Board which will be in charge of content moderation on the social media giant's platform. The new body was known previously and colloquially as the Facebook Independent Supreme Court. This nickname is apt for many reasons. Facebook is not a private company but a quasi-governmental organization, and I use the word 'quasi' very generously in this context. Facebook has a background of accepting Military Intelligence seed money. Its suspicious inception date suggests it is a continuation of DARPA's LifeLog surveillance program[3]. Like many big companies in the corporatocracy, FB has a revolving door at the top, accepting many former government officials (like Nick Clegg quoted below) into senior management positions. Then, there is its cozy relationship with the Atlantic Council, which is in turn funded by the US Government and is connected to NATO. Facebook unveiled the plan for the board which includes giving it the power to moderate all content - including presumably the ability to demote, censor and ban. But how independent will this board be? What does this mean for free speech and censorship? The Composition of the Facebook Independent Supreme CourtThis Oversight Board will be funded by another body (the Facebook Trust). Initially, Facebook will be doing everything: funding the Trust, choosing the trustees of the Trust and placing all the initial 11 members on the Oversight Board. Independent, you may ask? RT reports: Facebook insists it is 'committed to selecting a diverse and qualified group' - no current or former Facebook employees or spouses thereof, current government officials or lobbyists (former[4] ones are apparently OK), high-ranking officials within political parties (low-ranking is apparently cool), or significant shareholders of Facebook need apply. A law firm will be employed to vet candidates for conflicts of interest, but given Facebook's apparent inability to recognize the conflict of interest inherent in paying 'independent' board members to make binding content decisions, it's hard to tell what would qualify as a conflict.Setting an Industry Standard for Content Moderation, i.e. CensorshipFacebook has been under scrutiny and pressure for years now, especially for its disregard and invasion of privacy, as well as its perceived violation of anti-trust law. CEO Zuckerberg even called for Congress to regulate FB. This move is likely an attempt to self-regulate in the hopes that it avoids heavy-handed governmental regulation. Former British politician and now VP Global Affairs and Communications, Nick Clegg, wrote that the 'Oversight Board will make Facebook more accountable and improve our decision-making This charter is a critical step towards what we hope will become a model for our industry.' Is this Facebook Independent Supreme Court yet another attempt (alongside organizations like the Soros-linked International Fact Checking Network[5], and the Neocon and Atlantic Council-linked NewsGuard[6]) to set up some kind of authoritative body who decides what is true and false, right and wrong, allowed and disallowed for every single online user? Will they begin to 'rule by precedent' in banning certain kinds of speech? How much chance will a small average user have to appeal? Here is RT again: 'For now,' only Facebook-initiated cases will be heard by the board - Facebook users will be able to launch their own appeals by mid-2020 Decisions will not only be binding, but also applicable to other cases not being heard, if they're deemed similar enough - potentially opening a Pandora's box of far-reaching censorship. All the Big Tech giants are trying new ad transparency measures; however, it may mostly be for show, as the article Facebook's New 'Supreme Court' Could Revolutionize Online Speech[7] highlights: Facebook, Google, and Twitter have all recently unveiled ad transparency measures; meanwhile the proposed Honest Ads Act, which would compel these sorts of disclosures, has made little progress in Congress. This is despite extensive[8] reporting [9]about[10] weaknesses in Facebook's ad transparency tools. <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefreedomarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/facebook-privacy.jpg\">https://thefreedomarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/facebook-privacy.jpg</url>Facebook privacy. A contradiction in terms. Rather than making you read the whole guide, I'll sum it up in 3 words: YOU HAVE NONE. Trying to Shift the Censorship BuckIt would be a PR victory for Facebook if it could blame censorship (or in Orwellian language 'difficult content moderation decisions') on an outside and supposedly independent board. The same article describes Facebook's motivations here: There is also the user-relations dimension. When Zuckerberg first floated the idea in April, I analogized Zuckerberg's desire for restraint to the voluntarily segregated hotels and restaurants that counterintuitively supported anti-discrimination legislation during the Civil Rights Movement. They did so because they would earn more profits if they provided their services to everyone, but would pay a social cost in their white communities if they decided to voluntarily stop discriminating. Content moderation decisions on Facebook are hard and any call is likely to upset a proportion of Facebook users. By outsourcing the decision and blame, Facebook can try to wash its hands of controversial decisions.Final ThoughtsFacebook has become the data mining and surveillance arm of the New World Order. Zuckerberg called the people 'dumb fucks'[11] who handed over their personal information to Facebook early on. Earlier this year, Facebook's lawyers[12] argued that Facebook users have no 'reasonable expectation of privacy.' At one point, Facebook promoted the idea of an internet driver's license[13] and wanted to be the one to supply unique internet IDs - just to ensure the tracking and tracing of society went even further. There was the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal where that company harvested the personal and psychographic data from millions of peoples' FB profiles without their consent to used it for political advertising. Just recently, smart TVs were caught sending sensitive user data to Facebook[14]. The scandals truly never end for this privacy-destroying, free-speech squashing, military-intelligence-government-linked company. A Facebook Independent Supreme Court? Don't expect it to be anything other than another tool of censorship and control.Makia Freeman is the editor of alternative media / independent newssiteThe Freedom Articles[15]and senior researcher atToolsForFreedom.com[16].

It also confirmed that although the use of modern methods of payments such as cards has increased, cash remains the preferred way to pay for groceries, consumables, non-consumables, utility bills and wellness services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So although there is a marked increase in online payments, direct debits and prepaid cards, cash still rules the roost. It stands to reason that this high percentage of cash transactions leads to a greater propensity for tax evasion (essentially in VAT). This is confirmed by a recent Eurostat report which reveals that Malta suffers from the highest percentage of tax leakage in Europe. Its revenue loss due to evasion in 2016 amounted to a cool \u20ac230 million or 2.39 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p>The question that follows is: can the encouragement of a more cash-less society mitigate this haemorrhage of tax revenue loss? As an illustration, some Asian countries have been cash-less for many years and people use their mobile phones for everyday purchases. This includes micro payments such as buying newspapers, bus journeys, coffee or tea from cafeterias, etc. Perhaps the quiet revolution to switch to cash-less payments will hit Malta early next year when (and if) Facebook succeeds in its revolutionary coin - called 'Libra'.</p><p>Some brand this coin as a 'cryptocurrency' and if this is true, then Malta is well poised to regulate it. It also spent millions to launch Blockchain and DLT concepts when it actively sponsored Delta Summits and Sigma events. Some argue that, once launched, Libra will be good for the crypto industry while others dislike the fact that Facebook - being a big tech company - appears to be riding roughshod on a DL0T technology that is still not globally regulated.</p><p>The vagaries of Bitcoin values in the market have troubled many investors and those who speculated in its future ascent have burnt their fingers. In addition, accusations that Bitcoin began its trajectory as an anonymous currency habitually used by extortionists and drug cartels have certainly tarnished its image. So far, one may observe that many much-hyped blockchain projects have failed to meet expectations and, despite several attempts, few have been able to convince mainstream consumers to use cryptocurrency to pay for daily purchases.</p><p>Back to Libra coin. It will run on a blockchain, but it will be a far cry from Bitcoin. It has the ambitious goal of bringing financial services to the 1.7 billion people around the world who still do not have bank accounts. It also proudly offers to let users buy items - or send money to others - with nearly zero fees.</p><p>To begin with, it will not be a purely digital asset with fluctuating value but will be engineered to maintain a stable value. In theory, it will also be fully backed with a basket of bank deposits and treasuries lodged with high-quality central banks.</p><p>Back to Bitcoin - a unique advantage of using its network is that it is public, meaning that it can be used by anyone with an internet connection. It can run the network's software, and help validate new transactions. In fact, armed with a powerful computer, devotees can even mine fresh coins by adding new transactions to the chain. In sheer comparison, Libra's network is different since it will be running a 'validator node' that requires permission.</p><p>At the outset, Facebook wanted to have a syndicate of operators so it has signed up a number of collaborators such as Lyft, Spotify and Vodafone to participate in the network - each of which has invested around $10 million in the project - to validate transactions.</p><p>The drawback to Libra when compared to crypto currencies is that Libra networks are more vulnerable due to the centralisation of power and higher vulnerability from hackers to attack the network. Libra blockchain is not decentralised in the way Bitcoin is. Libra's nodes will be only run from the servers of the Libra Association.</p><p>Bitcoins use a more decentralised technology which makes them extremely difficult and expensive to manipulate transaction records in such networks. On the other hand, public blockchains use too much power and, in the advent of a global drive to lower CO\u00b2 emissions from power stations, this is not welcome and is probably the biggest obstacle to the global adoption of cryptocurrencies. According to the Libra white paper, its system will be able to process 1,000 transactions per second, much faster than Bitcoin, which can only process a handful per second.</p><p>Quoting David Marcus, who has overseen the Libra project for Facebook, he reveals that financial and social data will not be \"commingled,\" and that users can keep their digital wallets separate from their Facebook profiles. He also said that Libra's involvement would be handled through a software 'wallet' subsidiary called Calibra, registered in Switzerland. This company will store user funds and act as an initial on-ramp to the Libra coin.</p><p>Critics say that Libra's marketing blast and its big razzamatazz song is simply a smokescreen to offset the firm's appalling record on data privacy. Can Libra users demand that the currency be more decentralised and tamper-proofed?</p><p>Another obstacle is the resistance to Libra from major countries in Europe such as France and Germany, who want to block it - accusing it of challenging the 'monetary sovereignty' of governments.</p><p>Others say that Libra is a surreptitious plot to fish for our data, mostly targeting our financial and health status. Many are sceptical of future monopolistic abuse of the dominant position enjoyed by Facebook. Another hurdle is the tax leakage following millions of Libra transactions if and when this goes mainstream. If all goes well, perhaps Father Christmas will surprise us with gifts of Libra coin stuffed in our season's gifts and hampers.</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>George Mangion is a senior partner of an audit and consultancy firm</p><p><br/> 2019 Standard Publications Ltd.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/542/1594/70/157294863664.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/542/1594/70/157294863664.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MALTAI-158647224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MALTAI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XF5-1CP1-JDJN-610D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">413337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1013\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Standard Publications Ltd Provided by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">Syndigate.info,</url></emphasis></emphasis>an <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://albawaba.com\">Albawaba.com</url></emphasis></emphasis> company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Malta Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"34418\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 5, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>STATISTICAL OFFICE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It also confirmed that although the use of modern methods of payments such as cards has increased, cash remains the preferred way to pay for groceries, consumables, non-consumables, utility bills and wellness services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So although there is a marked increase in online payments, direct debits and prepaid cards, cash still rules the roost. It stands to reason that this high percentage of cash transactions leads to a greater propensity for tax evasion (essentially in VAT). This is confirmed by a recent Eurostat report which reveals that Malta suffers from the highest percentage of tax leakage in Europe. Its revenue loss due to evasion in 2016 amounted to a cool \u20ac230 million or 2.39 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p>The question that follows is: can the encouragement of a more cash-less society mitigate this haemorrhage of tax revenue loss? As an illustration, some Asian countries have been cash-less for many years and people use their mobile phones for everyday purchases. This includes micro payments such as buying newspapers, bus journeys, coffee or tea from cafeterias, etc. Perhaps the quiet revolution to switch to cash-less payments will hit Malta early next year when (and if) Facebook succeeds in its revolutionary coin - called 'Libra'.</p><p>Some brand this coin as a 'cryptocurrency' and if this is true, then Malta is well poised to regulate it. It also spent millions to launch Blockchain and DLT concepts when it actively sponsored Delta Summits and Sigma events. Some argue that, once launched, Libra will be good for the crypto industry while others dislike the fact that Facebook - being a big tech company - appears to be riding roughshod on a DL0T technology that is still not globally regulated.</p><p>The vagaries of Bitcoin values in the market have troubled many investors and those who speculated in its future ascent have burnt their fingers. In addition, accusations that Bitcoin began its trajectory as an anonymous currency habitually used by extortionists and drug cartels have certainly tarnished its image. So far, one may observe that many much-hyped blockchain projects have failed to meet expectations and, despite several attempts, few have been able to convince mainstream consumers to use cryptocurrency to pay for daily purchases.</p><p>Back to Libra coin. It will run on a blockchain, but it will be a far cry from Bitcoin. It has the ambitious goal of bringing financial services to the 1.7 billion people around the world who still do not have bank accounts. It also proudly offers to let users buy items - or send money to others - with nearly zero fees.</p><p>To begin with, it will not be a purely digital asset with fluctuating value but will be engineered to maintain a stable value. In theory, it will also be fully backed with a basket of bank deposits and treasuries lodged with high-quality central banks.</p><p>Back to Bitcoin - a unique advantage of using its network is that it is public, meaning that it can be used by anyone with an internet connection. It can run the network's software, and help validate new transactions. In fact, armed with a powerful computer, devotees can even mine fresh coins by adding new transactions to the chain. In sheer comparison, Libra's network is different since it will be running a 'validator node' that requires permission.</p><p>At the outset, Facebook wanted to have a syndicate of operators so it has signed up a number of collaborators such as Lyft, Spotify and Vodafone to participate in the network - each of which has invested around $10 million in the project - to validate transactions.</p><p>The drawback to Libra when compared to crypto currencies is that Libra networks are more vulnerable due to the centralisation of power and higher vulnerability from hackers to attack the network. Libra blockchain is not decentralised in the way Bitcoin is. Libra's nodes will be only run from the servers of the Libra Association.</p><p>Bitcoins use a more decentralised technology which makes them extremely difficult and expensive to manipulate transaction records in such networks. On the other hand, public blockchains use too much power and, in the advent of a global drive to lower CO\u00b2 emissions from power stations, this is not welcome and is probably the biggest obstacle to the global adoption of cryptocurrencies. According to the Libra white paper, its system will be able to process 1,000 transactions per second, much faster than Bitcoin, which can only process a handful per second.</p><p>Quoting David Marcus, who has overseen the Libra project for Facebook, he reveals that financial and social data will not be \"commingled,\" and that users can keep their digital wallets separate from their Facebook profiles. He also said that Libra's involvement would be handled through a software 'wallet' subsidiary called Calibra, registered in Switzerland. This company will store user funds and act as an initial on-ramp to the Libra coin.</p><p>Critics say that Libra's marketing blast and its big razzamatazz song is simply a smokescreen to offset the firm's appalling record on data privacy. Can Libra users demand that the currency be more decentralised and tamper-proofed?</p><p>Another obstacle is the resistance to Libra from major countries in Europe such as France and Germany, who want to block it - accusing it of challenging the 'monetary sovereignty' of governments.</p><p>Others say that Libra is a surreptitious plot to fish for our data, mostly targeting our financial and health status. Many are sceptical of future monopolistic abuse of the dominant position enjoyed by Facebook. Another hurdle is the tax leakage following millions of Libra transactions if and when this goes mainstream. If all goes well, perhaps Father Christmas will surprise us with gifts of Libra coin stuffed in our season's gifts and hampers.</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>George Mangion is a senior partner of an audit and consultancy firm</p><p><br/> 2019 Standard Publications Ltd.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/542/1594/70/157294863664.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/542/1594/70/157294863664.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MALTAI-158647224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MALTAI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y50-TK71-F11P-X4T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">413337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1013\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Standard Publications Ltd Provided by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">Syndigate.info,</url></emphasis></emphasis>an <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://albawaba.com\">Albawaba.com</url></emphasis></emphasis> company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Malta Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"34418\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 5, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>STATISTICAL OFFICE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It also confirmed that although the use of modern methods of payments such as cards has increased, cash remains the preferred way to pay for groceries, consumables, non-consumables, utility bills and wellness services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So although there is a marked increase in online payments, direct debits and prepaid cards, cash still rules the roost. It stands to reason that this high percentage of cash transactions leads to a greater propensity for tax evasion (essentially in VAT). This is confirmed by a recent Eurostat report which reveals that Malta suffers from the highest percentage of tax leakage in Europe. Its revenue loss due to evasion in 2016 amounted to a cool \u20ac230 million or 2.39 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p>The question that follows is: can the encouragement of a more cash-less society mitigate this haemorrhage of tax revenue loss? As an illustration, some Asian countries have been cash-less for many years and people use their mobile phones for everyday purchases. This includes micro payments such as buying newspapers, bus journeys, coffee or tea from cafeterias, etc. Perhaps the quiet revolution to switch to cash-less payments will hit Malta early next year when (and if) Facebook succeeds in its revolutionary coin - called 'Libra'.</p><p>Some brand this coin as a 'cryptocurrency' and if this is true, then Malta is well poised to regulate it. It also spent millions to launch Blockchain and DLT concepts when it actively sponsored Delta Summits and Sigma events. Some argue that, once launched, Libra will be good for the crypto industry while others dislike the fact that Facebook - being a big tech company - appears to be riding roughshod on a DL0T technology that is still not globally regulated.</p><p>The vagaries of Bitcoin values in the market have troubled many investors and those who speculated in its future ascent have burnt their fingers. In addition, accusations that Bitcoin began its trajectory as an anonymous currency habitually used by extortionists and drug cartels have certainly tarnished its image. So far, one may observe that many much-hyped blockchain projects have failed to meet expectations and, despite several attempts, few have been able to convince mainstream consumers to use cryptocurrency to pay for daily purchases.</p><p>Back to Libra coin. It will run on a blockchain, but it will be a far cry from Bitcoin. It has the ambitious goal of bringing financial services to the 1.7 billion people around the world who still do not have bank accounts. It also proudly offers to let users buy items - or send money to others - with nearly zero fees.</p><p>To begin with, it will not be a purely digital asset with fluctuating value but will be engineered to maintain a stable value. In theory, it will also be fully backed with a basket of bank deposits and treasuries lodged with high-quality central banks.</p><p>Back to Bitcoin - a unique advantage of using its network is that it is public, meaning that it can be used by anyone with an internet connection. It can run the network's software, and help validate new transactions. In fact, armed with a powerful computer, devotees can even mine fresh coins by adding new transactions to the chain. In sheer comparison, Libra's network is different since it will be running a 'validator node' that requires permission.</p><p>At the outset, Facebook wanted to have a syndicate of operators so it has signed up a number of collaborators such as Lyft, Spotify and Vodafone to participate in the network - each of which has invested around $10 million in the project - to validate transactions.</p><p>The drawback to Libra when compared to crypto currencies is that Libra networks are more vulnerable due to the centralisation of power and higher vulnerability from hackers to attack the network. Libra blockchain is not decentralised in the way Bitcoin is. Libra's nodes will be only run from the servers of the Libra Association.</p><p>Bitcoins use a more decentralised technology which makes them extremely difficult and expensive to manipulate transaction records in such networks. On the other hand, public blockchains use too much power and, in the advent of a global drive to lower CO\u00b2 emissions from power stations, this is not welcome and is probably the biggest obstacle to the global adoption of cryptocurrencies. According to the Libra white paper, its system will be able to process 1,000 transactions per second, much faster than Bitcoin, which can only process a handful per second.</p><p>Quoting David Marcus, who has overseen the Libra project for Facebook, he reveals that financial and social data will not be \"commingled,\" and that users can keep their digital wallets separate from their Facebook profiles. He also said that Libra's involvement would be handled through a software 'wallet' subsidiary called Calibra, registered in Switzerland. This company will store user funds and act as an initial on-ramp to the Libra coin.</p><p>Critics say that Libra's marketing blast and its big razzamatazz song is simply a smokescreen to offset the firm's appalling record on data privacy. Can Libra users demand that the currency be more decentralised and tamper-proofed?</p><p>Another obstacle is the resistance to Libra from major countries in Europe such as France and Germany, who want to block it - accusing it of challenging the 'monetary sovereignty' of governments.</p><p>Others say that Libra is a surreptitious plot to fish for our data, mostly targeting our financial and health status. Many are sceptical of future monopolistic abuse of the dominant position enjoyed by Facebook. Another hurdle is the tax leakage following millions of Libra transactions if and when this goes mainstream. If all goes well, perhaps Father Christmas will surprise us with gifts of Libra coin stuffed in our season's gifts and hampers.</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>George Mangion is a senior partner of an audit and consultancy firm</p><p><br/> 2019 Standard Publications Ltd.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/542/1594/70/157294863664.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/542/1594/70/157294863664.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MALTAI-158647224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MALTAI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4J-XYY1-F11P-X2D0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">413337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1013\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Standard Publications Ltd Provided by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">Syndigate.info,</url></emphasis></emphasis>an <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://albawaba.com\">Albawaba.com</url></emphasis></emphasis> company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Malta Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"34418\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 5, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>STATISTICAL OFFICE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While its actual members will be chosen and announced '[i]n the coming months,' Facebook staff did reveal that 'the first Director of Oversight Board Administration will be Thomas Hughes.' </p><p>Hughes was described as the 'former Executive Director for Article 19, an international non-governmental organization with a focus on freedom of expression and digital rights' who will 'lead the board's administrative staff.'According to The Verge[2], Hughes claimed the board will ensure that 'the rights of people are respected.' He also claimed that it will ensure 'accountability and transparency in the application of the community standards.'Can conservatives depend on Hughes to defend their personal liberties, or is he merely the token free speech advocate to help protect Facebook from being regulated? Facebook, like other Silicon Valley Big Tech companies, has an 'intolerant[3]' liberal culture, even according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself. Can such an openly 'intolerant' company be trusted to hire objective members to be on its oversight board?Facebook Director of Governance and Global Affairs Brent Harris claimed that there will be a diverse range of members overseeing content on Facebook and Instagram. 'Almost any person on the planet may not like one or two people who are on the board, and we think that's a feature,' he commented to reporters. 'When we announce, you're going to see that this isn't just a board that looks like Silicon Valley or looks like Facebook.'While it may seem good on the surface to have diversity -- having multiple cultures and nations represented -- many nations have wildly differing standards[4] on freedom of speech and expression. But Facebook, as an American company, serves human dignity far better by having an U.S. Constitution-centric approach to freedom of speech, rather than one that would hold free speaking western nations and foreign authoritarian regimes as equals.In 2019, tech companies such as Blizzard have been brought to shame[5] by caving to the demands of China and censoring their own users amid rebellion in Hong Kong.The moderation decisions made by the board will cover a range of controversial topics in America and around the world. The Verge noted the following in its coverage:'There are also provisions to ensure local representation, an issue Facebook has struggled with when adjudicating ethnic conflicts in countries like Myanmar and Sri Lanka. According to the bylaws, each case will be decided by a panel consisting of four randomly selected board members and one from the region that's primarily affected.'This program was put in place to ensure the board has 'cultural awareness to nuanced local conflicts,' noted The Verge.Let's just see how culturally aware Silicon Valley-types can be to their own conservative, Christian neighbors.

While its actual members will be chosen and announced #8216;[i]n the coming months,#8217; Facebook staff did reveal that #8216;the first Director of Oversight Board Administration will be Thomas Hughes.#8217; Hughes was described as the #8216;former Executive Director for Article 19, an international non-governmental organization with a focus on freedom of expression and digital rights#8217; who will #8216;lead the board's administrative staff.#8217;According to The Verge[2], Hughes claimed the board will ensure that #8216;the rights of people are respected.#8217; He also claimed that it will ensure #8216;accountability and transparency in the application of the community standards.#8217;Can conservatives depend on Hughes to defend their personal liberties, or is he merely the token free speech advocate to help protect Facebook from being regulated?</p><p>Facebook, like other Silicon Valley Big Tech companies, has an #8216;intolerant[3]#8217; liberal culture, even according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself. Can such an openly #8216;intolerant#8217; company be trusted to hire objective members to be on its oversight board?Facebook Director of Governance and Global Affairs Brent Harris claimed that there will be a diverse range of members overseeing content on Facebook and Instagram. #8216;Almost any person on the planet may not like one or two people who are on the board, and we think that's a feature,#8217; he commented to reporters. #8216;When we announce, you're going to see that this isn't just a board that looks like Silicon Valley or looks like Facebook.#8217;While it may seem good on the surface to have diversity -- having multiple cultures and nations represented -- many nations have wildly differing standards[4] on freedom of speech and expression. But Facebook, as an American company, serves human dignity far better by having an U.S. Constitution-centric approach to freedom of speech, rather than one that would hold free speaking western nations and foreign authoritarian regimes as equals.In 2019, tech companies such as Blizzard have been brought to shame[5] by caving to the demands of China and censoring their own users amid rebellion in Hong Kong.The moderation decisions made by the board will cover a range of controversial topics in America and around the world. The Verge noted the following in its coverage:#8216;There are also provisions to ensure local representation, an issue Facebook has struggled with when adjudicating ethnic conflicts in countries like Myanmar and Sri Lanka. According to the bylaws, each case will be decided by a panel consisting of four randomly selected board members and one from the region that's primarily affected.#8217;This program was put in place to ensure the board has #8216;cultural awareness to nuanced local conflicts,#8217; noted The Verge.Let's just see how culturally aware Silicon Valley-types can be to their own conservative, Christian neighbors.

At least that's what the social media giant seems to think. About 100 young people have signed non-disclosure agreements - or, rather, their parents have - while they test a new product Facebook has been quietly working on for months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOL, a feed of popular memes grouped under headings such as \"Fails\", \"Pranks\" and \"Wait for It\", is the latest desperate attempt to address what the research firm eMarketer has dubbed Facebook's \"teen problem\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Only 51% of US teens say they use Facebook, according to the Pew Research Centre. That is a dramatic fall from 2015, when Pew found Facebook was by far the dominant social network, used by 71% of 13 to 17-year-olds. These days, Snapchat, YouTube and Instagram are all more popular. Just 15 years old, the $420bn social media giant has somehow become tragically uncool.</p><p>Facebook's teen problem, however, is a slow burner, an existential challenge overshadowed by pyrotechnic scandals. Last year, Mark Zuckerberg was hauled before Congress and politicians in Brussels over the Cambridge Analytica data-harvesting scandal and Russia's disinformation campaigns. The UN blamed the company for genocide in Burma.</p><p>Its shares suffered the biggest one-day collapse in history after it warned of slowing profits. The founders of WhatsApp and Instagram, both acquired by Facebook, left in a huff. Zuckerberg's former mentor Roger McNamee turned on him, writing in a forthcoming book called Zucked that he is \"disappointed\", \"embarrassed\" and \"ashamed\" for helping to create the social media monster.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the US watchdog, is close to handing down a $22m (\u00a316.7m) fine over privacy failings, and Congress is preparing a data protection crackdown that could be passed this year. The question of where Facebook goes next must be answered with two very different timelines - one more immediate, the other longer-term.</p><p>Zuckerberg's empire has so far shown itself virtually impervious to scandal, as will be displayed on Wednesday when the 34-year-old billionaire announces its annual results. By any measure, they will be fantastic. Consensus net income for 2018 is $21.6bn, a 36% increase on the year, with sales also up 36% to $55bn.</p><p>The investment bank JP Morgan said that, far from stumbling, Facebook had reached \"rarefied air\" and is \"still early in the development of its ad platform\".</p><p>Sheer scale is Facebook's saving grace. Between Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, the company's products are used by 2.6bn people - a third of the planet. The precision with which advertisers can target audiences creates a powerful combination that won't easily be overturned.</p><p>Last week it emerged Zuckerberg is working on plans to merge Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp into a single messaging colossus. The front end of the apps - the interfaces used by consumers - would not change. Yet integrating the underlying infrastructure could offer a powerful new way for brands to reach people. The move could also raise competition concerns.</p><p>Yet there are other factors at work that will slow the Facebook machine. The biggest is security. Last year's events showed its privacy and safety controls to be woeful. In response, Zuckerberg pledged to hire 30,000 staff to filter out abusive and dodgy content, and to plough billions of dollars into machine-learning algorithms that get better at blocking bad actors.</p><p>Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research in New York said this was just the beginning. \"Facebook seems to not be fully aware of its situation,\" he said. \"They seem to think that 30,000 mostly outsourced contractors working on platform safety is sufficient. Try 10 times that.\" To wit: in Brazil, far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro fought and won the presidency on WhatsApp. Researchers found that of the top 50 political images circulating on the messaging service before the October ballot, only four were genuine; the others were hoaxes or fake news.</p><p>Eight years ago, Facebook reached an agreement known as a consent decree with Washington to settle charges that it had \"deceived consumers by failing to keep its privacy promises\". Countless security failures later, it has not been hit with a single fine by US authorities. The FTC, however, is reportedly close to levying the $22m fine over failures to live up to that agreement.</p><p>The Electronic Privacy Information Centre and others wrote an open letter last week arguing the fine should be $2bn - \"well within the agency's scope . . . for violation of a consent decree\". It also called for a break-up of Facebook, claiming it reneged on a commitment when it bought WhatsApp not to undermine the company's strict data privacy policy. Brussels fined Facebook (EURO)110m (then \u00a394m) in 2017 over claims about the sanctity of WhatsApp user data.</p><p>America is not the only country that could follow Europe by rolling out stringent privacy rules. Brazil and India, big markets for Facebook, are considering data regulation that, whether it takes the form of higher opt-in consents or harsh penalties for security breaches, will make it harder and more expensive to operate.</p><p>This is the core of Wieser's argument: Facebook isn't going away but its giant 40% profit margins will fade. The $19bn it spends annually on operations will pale beside what it will need to spend to stay on the right side of the law. \"They might think that building a $19bn nuclear warhead is enough to take on the governments of the world, but they're gonna find it's not enough,\" Wieser warned.</p><p>Facebook may well enter a fallow era, as Microsoft did in the 1990s. Venture capitalist Benedict Evans of Andreessen Horowitz said on The Sunday Times's Danny in the Valley podcast: \"Big tech companies don't tend to remain dominant very long. IBM is still a big company [but] no one is scared of IBM any more. Microsoft is still a great company, but it does not control the agenda in the tech industry. No one is scared of Microsoft, and that happened quite quickly.\"</p><p>Overlying all this is the law of large numbers. Facebook's share of the digital advertising market will have grown to 21% last year, eMarketer estimates, second only to Google's 31%. Wieser says that investors underestimate the limits of digital advertising's potential to grow.</p><p>Zuckerberg's trump card is Instagram. Even if LOL fails and Facebook keeps haemorrhaging young users, Instagram is picking them up. It may not save Facebook, but it will at least extend its reign.</p><p>The picture-sharing app has become Facebook's most vital source of growth. An estimated 1bn people use it, up 13% on the year. Zuckerberg has flooded Instagram with ads - and so far it is working: eMarketer forecasts that Instagram will bring in $14bn in ad revenue this year.</p><p>Yet as it grows, so too will the consequences and visibility of its failures. The father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017, told The Sunday Times this weekend of his conviction that self-harm videos circulating on Instagram helped lead to her suicide.</p><p>Zuckerberg tried to debunk assumptions about Facebook in a 1,100-word essay last week in The Wall Street Journal - explaining that he does not sell users' data and is trying hard to fix Facebook's problems. \"The only reason bad content remains,\" he wrote, \"is because the people and artificial intelligence systems we use to review it are not perfect - not because we have an incentive to ignore it. Our systems are still evolving and improving.\"</p><p>As with LOL, it is unclear whether anyone out there is willing to listen.</p><p>                   Zuckerberg's annus horribilis                   January 11, 2018                   </p><p> After heavy criticism of its role in spreading disinformation, Facebook changes its algorithm, deprioritising news stories and viral videos in favour of posts from friends and families.</p><p>                   January 25                   </p><p> Hedge fund guru George Soros labels Facebook a \"menace\" to society, prompting operations chief Sheryl Sandberg to open a secret investigation into the tycoon.</p><p>                   March 17                   </p><p> The Cambridge Analytica scandal breaks, in which the personal data of tens of millions of people was harvested and then used to send targeted political ads.</p><p>                   April 10                   </p><p> Zuckerberg testifies before Congress, robotically answering questions but largely escaping unscathed. Regarding Russian election meddling via Facebook, he says: \"I'm sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.\"</p><p>                   April 26                   </p><p>Facebook technology head Mike Schroepfer testifies in parliament over the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

At least that's what the social media giant seems to think. About 100 young people have signed non-disclosure agreements - or, rather, their parents have - while they test a new product Facebook has been quietly working on for months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LOL, a feed of popular memes grouped under headings such as \"Fails\", \"Pranks\" and \"Wait for It\", is the latest desperate attempt to address what the research firm eMarketer has dubbed Facebook's \"teen problem\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Only 51% of US teens say they use Facebook, according to the Pew Research Centre. That is a dramatic fall from 2015, when Pew found Facebook was by far the dominant social network, used by 71% of 13 to 17-year-olds. Now Snapchat, You-Tube and Instagram are all more popular. Just 15 years old, the $420bn social media giant has become tragically uncool.</p><p>Facebook's teen problem, however, is a slow burner, an existential challenge overshadowed by pyrotechnic scandals. Last year, Mark Zuckerberg was hauled before Congress and politicians in Brussels over the Cambridge Analytica dataharvesting scandal and Russia's disinformation campaigns. The UN blamed the company for genocide in Burma.</p><p>Its shares suffered the biggest one-day collapse in history after it warned of slowing profits. The founders of WhatsApp and Instagram, both acquired by Facebook, left in a huff. Zuckerberg's former mentor Roger McNamee turned on him, writing in a forthcoming book called Zucked that he is \"disappointed\", \"embarrassed\" and \"ashamed\" for helping to create the social media monster.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the US watchdog, is close to handing down a $22m (\u00a316.7m) fine over privacy failings, and Congress is preparing a data protection crackdown that could be passed this year. The question of where Facebook goes next must be answered with two very different timelines - one more immediate, the other longer-term.</p><p>Zuckerberg's empire has so far shown itself virtually impervious to scandal, as will be displayed on Wednesday when the 34-year-old billionaire announces its annual results. By any measure, they will be fantastic. Consensus net income for 2018 is $21.6bn, a 36% increase on the year, with sales also up 36% to $55bn.</p><p>The investment bank JP Morgan said that, far from stumbling, Facebook had reached \"rarefied air\" and is \"still early in the development of its ad platform\".</p><p>Sheer scale is Facebook's saving grace.</p><p>Between Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, the company's products are used by 2.6bn people - a third of the planet. The precision with which advertisers can target audiences creates a powerful combination that won't easily be overturned. Last week it emerged Zuckerberg is working on plans to merge Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp into a single messaging colossus. The front end of the apps - the interfaces used by consumers - would not change. Yet integrating the underlying infrastructure could offer a powerful new way for brands to reach people. The move could also raise competition concerns.</p><p>Yet other factors will slow Facebook down. The biggest is security. Last year's events showed its privacy and safety controls are woeful. Zuckerberg has pledged to hire 30,000 staff to filter out abusive and dodgy content, and to plough billions into machine-learning algorithms that get better at blocking bad actors.</p><p>Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research in New York said this was just the beginning.</p><p>\"Facebook seems to not be fully aware of its situation,\" he said. \"They seem to think that 30,000 mostly outsourced contractors working on platform safety is sufficient. Try 10 times that.\" To wit: in Brazil, the far-right Jair Bolsonaro fought and won the presidency on WhatsApp. Of the top 50 political images circulating on the messaging service before the October ballot, research found just four were genuine; the rest were hoaxes or fake news. Eight years ago, Facebook reached an agreement known as a consent decree with Washington to settle charges that it had \"deceived consumers by failing to keep its privacy promises\". Countless security failures later, it has not been hit with a single fine by US authorities. The FTC, however, is reportedly close to levying the $22m fine over failures to live up to that agreement.</p><p>The Electronic Privacy Information Centre and others wrote an open letter last week arguing the fine should be $2bn - \"well within the agency's scope \u2026 for violation of a consent decree\". It also called for a break-up of Facebook, claiming it reneged on a commitment when it bought WhatsApp not to undermine the company's strict data privacy policy. Brussels fined Facebook (EURO)110m (then \u00a394m) in 2017 over claims about the sanctity of WhatsApp user data.</p><p>America is not the only country that could follow Europe by rolling out stringent privacy rules. Brazil and India, big markets for Facebook, are considering data regulation that, whether it takes the form of higher opt-in consents or harsh penalties for security breaches, will make it harder and more expensive to operate.</p><p>This is the core of Wieser's argument: Facebook isn't going away but its giant 40% profit margins will fade. The $19bn it spends annually on operations will pale beside what it will need to spend to stay on the right side of the law. \"They might think that building a $19bn nuclear warhead is enough to take on the governments of the world, but they're gonna find it's not enough,\" Wieser warned.</p><p>Facebook may well enter a fallow era, as Microsoft did in the 1990s. Venture capitalist Benedict Evans of Andreessen Horowitz said on The Sunday Times's Danny in the Valley podcast: \"Big tech companies don't tend to remain dominant very long. IBM is still a big company [but] no one is scared of IBM any more. Microsoft is still a great company, but it does not control the agenda in the tech <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.industry.No\">www.industry.No</url> one is scared of Microsoft, and that happened quite quickly.\"</p><p>Overlying all this is the law of large numbers. Facebook's share of the digital advertising market will have grown to 21% last year, eMarketer estimates, second only to Google's 31%. Wieser says that investors underestimate the limits of digital advertising's potential to grow.</p><p>Zuckerberg's trump card is Instagram.</p><p>Even if LOL fails and Facebook keeps haemorrhaging young users, Instagram is picking them up. It may not save Facebook, but it will at least extend its reign. The picture-sharing app has become Facebook's most vital source of growth. An estimated 1bn people use it, up 13% on the year. Zuckerberg has flooded Instagram with ads - and so far it is working: eMarketer forecasts that Instagram will bring in $14bn in ad revenue this year.</p><p>Yet as it grows, so too will the impact of its failures. The father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017, told The Sunday Times this weekend he is convinced self-harm videos on Instagram helped lead to her suicide.</p><p>Zuckerberg tried to debunk assumptions about Facebook in an essay last week in The Wall Street Journal - explaining that he does not sell users' data and is trying hard to fix Facebook's problems. \"The only reason bad content remains,\" he wrote, \"is because the people and artificial intelligence systems we use to review it are not perfect - not because we have an incentive to ignore it. Our systems are still evolving and improving.\" As with LOL, it is unclear whether anyone out there is willing to listen.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG'S ANNUS HORRIBILIS January 11, 2018 After criticism of its role in spreading disinformation, Facebook changes its algorithm, with news stories and videos giving way to posts from friends and families.</p><p>January 25 George Soros labels Facebook a \"menace\" to society, prompting operations chief Sheryl Sandberg to open a secret investigation into the hedge fund guru.</p><p>March 17 The Cambridge Analytica scandal breaks, in which personal data of millions of people was harvested and used to send targeted political ads.</p><p>April 10 Zuckerberg testifies before Congress, but largely escaping unscathed. Regarding Russian election meddling via Facebook, he says: \"I'm sorry.

False certifications will lead to criminal and civil penalties, the commission said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As well as the certifications, the commission ordered Facebook's board to create an independent privacy committee and nominate specialist compliance officers to end Mr Zuckerberg's \"unfettered control\" over user privacy. The US is increasing scrutiny of its largest technology companies. On Tuesday, the Department of Justice announced a wide-ranging competition investigation into the dominance of Big Tech. The justice department and the commission are conducting separate investigations into Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet, the owner of Google.</p><p>Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said yesterday that Amazon had \"destroyed the retail industry\" across the US and there was \"no question\" that the company had hurt competition. Apple shares lost 0.01 per cent and Alphabet shed 0.7 per cent.</p><p>Facebook, one of the world's largest internet companies, owns the social network of the same name, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger messaging services and Instagram, the picture and video-sharing network. Facebook, valued at $575 billion, makes most of its money from digital advertising.</p><p>The commission's $5 billion penalty is by far the largest imposed on a company for consumer privacy violations. Facebook said in April that it expected to pay between $3 billion and $5 billion to settle the investigation and took a $3 billion first-quarter charge to cover the expected costs.</p><p>In its second-quarter report, published last night, Facebook booked a further $2 billion charge to cover the commission's fine and an unrelated $1.1 billion tax expense. Profit fell to $2.6 billion from $5.1 billion a year before as revenue climbed to $16.9 billion from $13.2 billion. The figures beat analysts' forecasts and Facebook shares were up by 3.5 per cent in after-hours trading, having closed at $204.66, up by 1.1 per cent, or $2.30, for the day.</p><p>The overhaul at Facebook marks the culmination of a long-running investigation by the commission into the company's protections for user privacy. It was triggered by the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year, when a whistleblower revealed that the nowdefunct British political consultancy used 87 million profiles harvested from Facebook without its users' consent to target voters with political adverts.</p><p>The commission alleges that Facebook \"repeatedly used deceptive disclosures and settings\" to undermine user privacy, violating an order the commission imposed in 2012. Many users were unaware that Facebook was sharing Continued on page 40, col 4 Continued from page 37 their personal information with third parties, including Cambridge Analytica, the commission said.</p><p>The FTC's commissioners voted by three to two to approve the settlement.

The US is increasing scrutiny of its largest technology companies. On Tuesday, the Department of Justice announced a wide-ranging competition investigation into the dominance of Big Tech. The justice department and the commission are conducting separate investigations into Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet, the owner of Google. Facebook confirmed last night that it is subject to a competition investigation by the FTC.</p><p>Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said yesterday that Amazon had \"destroyed the retail industry\" across the US and there was \"no question\" that the company had hurt competition.</p><p>Apple shares lost 0.01 per cent and Alphabet shed 0.7 per cent.</p><p>Facebook, one of the world's largest internet companies, owns the social network of the same name, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. Facebook, valued at $575 billion, makes most of its money from advertising.</p><p>The commission's $5 billion penalty is by far the largest imposed on a company for consumer privacy violations. Facebook said in April that it expected to pay between $3 billion and $5 billion to settle the investigation and took a $3 billion first-quarter charge to cover the expected costs.</p><p>In its second-quarter report, published last night, Facebook booked a further $2 billion charge to cover the commission's fine and an unrelated $1.1 billion tax expense. Profit fell to $2.6 billion from $5.1 billion a year before as revenue climbed to $16.9 billion from $13.2 billion. The figures beat analysts' forecasts and Facebook shares were up by 3.5 per cent in after-hours trading, having closed at $204.66, up by 1.1 per cent, or $2.30, for the day.</p><p>The overhaul at Facebook marks the culmination of a long-running investigation by the commission into the company's protections for user privacy. It was triggered by the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year, when a whistleblower revealed that the nowdefunct British political consultancy used 87 million profiles harvested from Facebook without its users' consent to target voters with political adverts.</p><p>The commission alleges that Facebook \"repeatedly used deceptive disclosures and settings\" to undermine user privacy, violating an order the commission imposed in 2012. Many users were unaware that Facebook was sharing Continued on page 40, col 4 Continued from page 37 their personal information with third parties, including Cambridge Analytica, the commission said.</p><p>The FTC's commissioners voted by three to two to approve the settlement. The two dissenting commissioners said yesterday that it did not go far enough.</p><p>One, Rohit Chopra, said: \"Facebook's flagrant violations were a direct result of their business model of mass surveillance and manipulation, and this action blesses this model.\" Mr Chopra said that a grant of immunity to Facebook's officers and directors was \"a giveaway\" because they were legally bound to ensure compliance with the 2012 order. The other commissioner, Rebecca Slaughter, said: \"We should have initiated litigation against Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg.\"</p><p>Ms Slaughter said that the $5 billion fine was \"insufficient\" and that she was sceptical that the settlement \"will have a meaningful disciplining effect on how Facebook treats data and privacy\".</p><p>The three other commissioners said: \"The relief we have achieved today solves concrete problems, rather than venting frustration with individuals.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-151390630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-JPV1-JCBW-N0YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 2, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

On Tuesday, the Department of Justice announced a wide-ranging competition investigation into the dominance of Big Tech. The justice department and the commission are conducting separate investigations into Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet, the owner of Google. Facebook confirmed last night that it is subject to a competition investigation by the FTC.</p><p>Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said yesterday that Amazon had \"destroyed the retail industry\" across the US and there was \"no question\" that the company had hurt competition. Apple shares lost 0.01 per cent and Alphabet shed 0.7 per cent.</p><p>Facebook, one of the world's largest internet companies, owns the social network of the same name, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram. Facebook, valued at $575 billion, makes most of its money from advertising.</p><p>The commission's $5 billion penalty is by far the largest imposed on a company for consumer privacy violations. Facebook said in April that it expected to pay between $3 billion and $5 billion to settle the investigation and took a $3 billion first-quarter charge to cover the expected costs.</p><p>In its second-quarter report, published last night, Facebook booked a further $2 billion charge to cover the commission's fine and an unrelated $1.1 billion tax expense. Profit fell to $2.6 billion from $5.1 billion a year before as revenue climbed to $16.9 billion from $13.2 billion. The figures beat analysts' forecasts and Facebook shares were up by 3.5 per cent in after-hours trading, having closed at $204.66, up by 1.1 per cent, or $2.30, for the day.</p><p>The overhaul at Facebook marks the culmination of a long-running investigation by the commission into the company's protections for user privacy.</p><p>It was triggered by the Cambridge Analytica scandal last year, when a whistleblower revealed that the now-defunct British political consultancy used 87 million profiles harvested from Facebook without its users' consent to target voters with political adverts.</p><p>The commission alleges that Facebook \"repeatedly used deceptive disclosures and settings\" to undermine user privacy, violating an order the commission imposed in 2012. Many users were unaware that Facebook was sharing their personal information with third parties, including Cambridge Analytica, the commission said.</p><p>The FTC's commissioners voted by three to two to approve the settlement. The two dissenting commissioners said yesterday that it did not go far enough.</p><p>One, Rohit Chopra, said: \"Facebook's flagrant violations were a direct result of their business model of mass surveillance and manipulation, and this action blesses this model.\" Mr Chopra said that a grant of immunity to Facebook's officers and directors was \"a giveaway\" because they were legally bound to ensure compliance with the 2012 order.</p><p>The other commissioner, Rebecca Slaughter, said: \"We should have initiated litigation against Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg.\"</p><p>Ms Slaughter said that the $5 billion fine was \"insufficient\" and that she was sceptical that the settlement \"will have a meaningful disciplining effect on how Facebook treats data and privacy\".</p><p>The three other commissioners said: \"The relief we have achieved today solves concrete problems, rather than venting frustration with individuals.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-54746646</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN3-SPV1-JCJY-G28F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><timeReceived>11:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The relief is designed not only to punish future violations but, more importantly, to change Facebook\u2019s entire privacy culture to decrease the likelihood of continued violations.\u201d</p><p>The decision has split the FTC internally however, with the two Democratic commissioners voting against the settlement for not going far enough.</p><p>In a\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1536911/chopra_dissenting_statement_on_facebook_7-24-19.pdf\"> dissenting statement</url>, Rohit Chopra, one of the Democratic commissioners, said: \u201cThe proposed settlement does little to change the business model or practices that led to the recidivism.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe settlement imposes no meaningful changes to the company\u2019s structure or financial incentives, which led to these violations. Nor does it include any restrictions on the company\u2019s mass surveillance or advertising tactics.\u201d</p><p>Six key terms of Facebook\u2019s deal with the FTC</p><p>- Facebook must launch an independent privacy committee, which the FTC says will remove the \u201cunfettered control\u201d of chief Mark Zuckerberg over privacy-related decisions. </p><p>- The company must create a team of privacy compliance officers, who must, with Zuckerberg, certify that the company is in compliance with Facebook\u2019s privacy programme on a quarterly basis to the commission. \u201cAny false certification will subject them to individual civil and criminal penalties,\u201d the FTC said.</p><p>- Facebook must document incidents when data of 500 or more users has been compromised and notify the commission within 30 days.</p><p>- The company must \u201cexercise greater oversight\u201d over third-party apps, and cut off app developers that fail to certify that they are in compliance with its policies or justify why they need certain data.</p><p>- Facebook must make clear to users its use of facial recognition technology and gain consent from them if it changes the way it uses this technology.</p><p>- The company must introduce a \u201ccomprehensive data security program\u201d, encrypt users\u2019 passwords and regularly check they are stored in this way.</p><p>As part of the agreement, Facebook will have to report to the FTC within 30 days if there has been any data breach that affects 500 or more users.</p><p>The order also \u201cresolves all consumer-protection claims known by the FTC prior to June 12, 2019\u201d. This means that recent potential data breaches, such as revelations earlier this year that Facebook improperly stored hundreds of millions of its users\u2019 passwords internally in a readable format, will not be pursued. </p><p>It does not impose any restrictions on how much data the company can collect, or how it\u00a0uses it to target advertising at certain groups. Mr Chopra said:\u00a0\u201cThe order allows Facebook to decide for itself how much information it can harvest from users and what it can do with that information, as long as it creates a paper trail.\u201d</p><p>Christine Wilson, one of the FTC\u2019s Republican commissioners, said: \u201cWe do not have the legal authority to remove Mr Zuckerberg from the driver\u2019s seat, but we have imposed a robust system of checks and balances that extinguishes his ability unilaterally to chart the path for consumer privacy at Facebook.\u201d</p><p>A \u2018sharper turn\u2019 towards privacy</p><p>Colin Stretch, Facebook\u2019s general counsel, said\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/07/ftc-agreement/\"> in a blog post</url> that the agreement \u201cwill mark a sharper turn toward privacy, on a different scale than anything we\u2019ve done in the past\u201d.</p><p>In a separate post, Facebook said on Wednesday that it had\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/07/cleaning-up-data-access/\"> cut off access</url> to users\u2019 friend data by Microsoft and Sony. Late last year the company ended a dozen data-sharing agreements with big tech companies following concern that users were unclear how their data were being used and shared. However, Microsoft and Sony had continued to access some friend data by\u00a0\u201cmistake\u201d, Facebook said.\u00a0</p><p>The FTC accused Facebook of three separate violations of a previous agreement with the regulator.\u00a0First, it said that the company incorrectly told consumers that they could limit the sharing of their information to certain groups, whereas it was sharing that information more broadly, with third party app developers.</p><p>Second, Facebook did not adequately assess and address privacy risks posed by third party app developers.</p><p>Third, Facebook told some users they would have to turn on facial recognition technology, even though it was already on by default.</p><p>The FTC also announced on Wednesday that it had filed a complaint against Cambridge Analytica for\u00a0\u201cdeceptive acts and practices to harvest personal information from Facebook users for political and commercial targeted advertising purposes\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>The company, which has now gone bankrupt, has not settled the allegations, the FTC said. However, the FTC settled individual charges with Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica\u2019s chief executive, and app developer and academic Aleksandr Kogan, which will now require them to be more transparent about how and why they handle personal information, and to delete any personal data they collected during the scandal.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-57b2e47cae0f11e98030530adfa879c2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN0-M9D1-JB77-K0X2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1131\"/><timeReceived>4:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SECURITIES &amp;

The FTC's probe has largely focused on whether the sharing of users' data violated a 2011 agreement between the regulator and the company.</p><p>The penalty will mark the largest in the FTC's history by a large margin, according to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Reuters</emphasis>, if agreed by the civil division of the US Department of Justice. It would also set a new bar for privacy enforcement by US regulators, who have hitherto only brought a handful of cases against big tech firms.</p><p>In March 2018, several news outlets reported that Cambridge Analytica had collected the data of millions of Facebook users.</p><p>The company had purchased the data from an academic who had created a quiz app that was also able to collect personal information, not only from consenting users, but also their Facebook friends, without their knowledge.</p><p>The access to data in this was only cut in 2015 after Facebook belatedly amended this feature. </p><p>However, the FTC believes that this contravened a 2011 agreement whereby Facebook had promised not to share users' data with third parties without their knowledge and consent. This had followed earlier data sharing scandals at Facebook. </p><p>According to some reports, the FTC agreed several months ago to impose a sizable fine against Facebook, but the members of the commission had divided opinions about the scope and size of the punishment. One of the contentious issues to address was whether Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg should be held liable for the alleged violation of the 2011 agreement.</p><p>Last week, US President Donald Trump accused Facebook and several other social media companies of being unfair and biased against conservatives. He also criticised Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency project.</p><p>For man, though, the $5 billion fine is still too small for a company the size of Facebook. \"This reported $5 billion penalty is barely a tap on the wrist, not even a slap,\" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, according to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bloomberg</emphasis>.</p><p>\"Such a financial punishment for purposeful, blatant illegality is chump change for a company that makes tens of billions of dollars every year,\" he added.</p><p>Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Centre (EPIC), commented: \"Something clearly has to be done to strengthen the data protection practices of that company.\"</p><p>Rotenberg's complaint against Facebook had led to FTC's 2011 deal with Facebook, addressing several deceiving practices of the social media company.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMPTG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMPTG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK1-TP31-JCDG-R003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172297</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"471\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Incisive Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Computing</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33179\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 15, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Maybe it's a zombie apocalypse, maybe techno-utopia. Who's to say?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Patri Friedman has an idea. He's been working on a radical vision of the future of human civilization the better part of two decades. The self-described anarcho-capitalist, who lives in the mountains above Los Gatos, believes some of us may soon find ourselves living on permanent offshore island-nations \u2014 perhaps ones financed by big tech's FAANG companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"I definitely see that at some point we'll get corporate states, and I know some people find that creepy,\" Friedman says. \"I'm kind of on the fence about whether I'd like living in Apple-topia or Google-topia \u2014 definitely not Facebook-topia or Netflix-topia.\"</p><p> As Friedman sees it, \"sovereignty is fragmenting in the 21st century.\" Countries around the world \u2014 either weary or intrepid \u2014 are beginning to think about ways to create new jurisdictions for the express purpose of tinkering with rules and regulations. Sometimes as a way to dodge rising sea levels, other times as a means of sparking economic opportunities.</p><p> Friedman's interest is in experimenting with new governing structures via seasteading. Built on the premise of constructing autonomous offshore territories in the ocean, the concept allows for the formation of new communities that craft their own governing charters. Prospective citizens would be able to opt in to whichever island-state they may prefer.</p><p> Though not yet in practice, seasteading is gaining interest in pockets across the globe, Friedman says. To pursue this idea, the former Google engineer founded the Seasteading Institute in San Francisco in 2008 with $500,000 of funding from PayPal founder Peter Thiel. The institute is a nonprofit that consults with groups and countries around the world on proposals to design special zones for experimenting with new forms of government.</p><p> To test his seasteading hypothesis, in 2009, Friedman founded an event called Ephemerisle. The annual floating festival of boats and barges draws hundreds of people each summer to a remote estuary in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. They hang out, party and dabble in small-scale world-building. Over the years, it has drawn tech luminaries including Thiel and Google co-founder Sergey Brin.</p><p> Today, Friedman sits on the board of the Seasteading Institute and consults on seasteading pilot projects wherever they may emerge. We're not long from a time when countries jump into this idea with both feet, he says.</p><p> \"What we're seeing today, in 2019, is we're well into the 21st century and countries are realizing that they need to do these kinds of innovations and experiments to succeed,\" Friedman says. \"So that growing interest from countries is why I quit my job at Google and I'm working full-time with these projects.\"</p><p> I called Friedman on the phone recently to discuss the development of seasteading, his current work and the evolution of Ephemerisle. The interview is transcribed below, edited for length and clarity. For the full conversation, listen to the Wild West podcast.</p><p> San Francisco Chronicle: I know you're working on some top secret projects at the moment that you can't discuss in detail, but can you give me the broad strokes?</p><p> Friedman: What I'm working on now is the idea of working with governments to designate an area of the ocean or an area of the land to have somewhat different laws from the rest of the country. And then a group of people \u2014 a community or company \u2014 would create a floating or land-based real estate development there that people would move into if they wanted to have those better laws. So I'm consulting with groups around the world doing this.</p><p> What is the benefit to a government of creating a new zone where people would live outside of that government's control? How does that relationship work?</p><p> You can look at China's special economic zones as an example, or at Dubai. The reason they do it is because, well, to the programmer, this seems perfectly natural to me. When I was at Google, if you were going to roll out a change to Google's web server, you wouldn't roll it out for everyone at once. You'd test it out and then maybe put it online for one out of a million users and then eventually one out of a thousand users and you'd slowly scale it up and test it.</p><p> It's the same thing with laws. Maybe a country wants to try out, as China did, more free-market systems without changing the entire country.</p><p> Another reason is corruption. It's just really hard to root out the culture of corruption. If you start with empty land and have a different group of people \u2014 say, a new company \u2014 create the laws and courts and police, the idea is you can create a bubble of honest courts and non-corrupt officials even in a corrupt country. It might be easier to reform the country by creating these bubbles \u2014 by moving parts of the country into them rather than trying to change the entire culture of the country.</p><p> That touches on the appeal of seasteading. It's the utopian idea that we can do society better if we just had a clean slate to start over. Why should we believe we can do it better than we do it now?</p><p> I think some amount of skepticism is great and that it really depends what the stated goal is. I'm very confident that we can make laws and governments that work better. But at the same time I would say that those laws and governments would have many of the same problems that they do today.</p><p> As a programmer, we know that periodically\u2026 you can improve things. Furthermore, you can improve things a lot more if, every now and then, you start from scratch \u2014 you do a full rewrite \u2014 than you can by just patching existing code that uses existing libraries.</p><p> So the idea that if we can copy best-practice legal systems from around the world, and if we can do some clean-slate rewrites that people opt into that are only parts of the laws initially and test them out, we can definitely improve the rate of progress of legal development. But we'll never get away from the fundamental challenges and tradeoffs that happen in any government.</p><p> Can you give a quick history of the Seasteading Institute?</p><p> It began with my interest in new countries and better systems of government, starting in about the year 2000. Ephermerisle was actually part of the early history because I went to Burning Man and was really impressed at how much energy people put into building their own infrastructure, and at the same time sad that it was all poured into something temporary that was all torn down.</p><p> As I was thinking about this question of, how do you start new countries, I tied it together and thought, maybe you can start this festival where people went out to international waters in boats and spent a week actually contractually living under some different legal system.</p><p> And then in late 2007 some people who worked for Peter Thiel connected us and he was really excited about the idea and gave me a half million-dollar donation to found the nonprofit, which we did in April of 2008.</p><p> Talk about how Ephemerisle got started and how that first year of the festival went.</p><p> Ephemerisle is part of the earliest genesis of seasteading, the idea being, how do we make new countries? Well we gotta get people comfortable with trying out new legal systems and maybe it's easier to do that for a week a year than to get them to move there full-time.</p><p> I imagined this idea of people gathering together in international waters, forming different islands and signing agreements about what the legal system would be for the week. But the ocean is rough and expensive and...there aren't comfortable international waters nearby like there would be in Florida, say. So we said, well let's start out someplace nearby that's much easier but that's connected to the ocean.</p><p> We picked the Sacramento delta. This is a region of the Bay Area which a lot of people don't know about. It's almost like a Louisiana bayou of the bay. We said, alright we're going to go out there and make an island. We hired someone named Chicken John, an early Burner who'd done art raft projects, and we rented out all the houseboats from nearby Paradise Point Marina and spent days hammering and drilling and putting things together \u2014 art projects and platforms.</p><p> We were not able to anchor the platforms and the boats out in the open water. We ended up having to attach to the shore, which was not ideal. But again the whole idea here is to form a learning arc of progress.</p><p> So it was what it was the first year. It was just really incredible. People came from around the world. There were probably 100 to 150 of us to just play with this idea of rules and art on the water. There weren't enough of us for there to be different islands. The focus was much more on just getting floating and being able to eat and sleep, rather than new laws. But everyone kind of came together around the idea.</p><p> How has the festival evolved over the years?</p><p> There's kind of two axes of evolution, one of which has worked really well and one of which hasn't gone at all.</p><p> The (first of the) two axes is the idea of having different rules and culture on different islands \u2014 that anybody can start their own island and choose who joins them and that we have a real diversity. That's gone really well. There's a main island, Elysium, which is quite large and has a bunch of rules, and there's also many, many small islands.</p><p> The other axis is the movement towards this vision of truly testing out new laws for the week as far from the current legal environment as it's possible to get in this world, on the high seas. Part of the idea of the Sacramento delta is it's physically connected to the ocean. We thought, we'll learn to meet the challenges of boating on the delta then we'll move maybe to the Sacramento River, then we'll move into the bay...and then maybe we'll move just offshore \u2014 maybe just outside Half Moon Bay or outside the Golden Gate Bridge. Then we'll find a reef or other protected place in international waters and hold the true high seas Ephemerisle there.</p><p> On that axis, well, I think people have been great at accumulating ships and platforms and experience (but) the festival has not moved in ten years from that initial location. So it's not showing any signs of progressing towards greater legal autonomy.</p><p> When I visited Ephemerisle this summer, one thing I noticed was the constant process of people negotiating and compromising with one another. You told me, \"Rules are to Ephemerisle as art is to Burning Man.\" What did you mean by that?</p><p> That negotiation and compromise and constant discussion of what the rules should be and then most importantly that there are different rules in different places \u2014 that's absolutely critical to the entire philosophy of competitive governments. That is the seasteading nature. And to the degree that that's happening at Ephemerisle, it is realizing the vision. I think that's super exciting.</p><p> What I mean by rules are to Ephemerisle as art is to Burning Man is that Ephemerisle is not just Burning Man on the water. It's about playing with rules and culture and having multiple sets of rules that are hopefully very different in close proximity, and having the experiences of helping create rule systems and experience different rule systems and move during the week to these little floating villages that are very different. The whole idea of seasteading is that we need more diversity and experimentation with rules.</p><p> I personally come from the political philosophy of anarcho-capitalism, which my dad helped to create. People sometimes say, \"Oh, you're an anarchist. That must mean that you want no rules or no cops.\" In truth, it's just the opposite. We think that rules are so important that, rather than just having one set of rules that everyone lives under, we think it's critical to have a bunch of different sets of rules with different pros and cons that nurture different virtues.</p><p> To me, hell is one-world government. No matter what the laws are \u2014 even if it had whatever the closest to what everyone in the world would together choose \u2014 to me, that's hell because it's vulnerable. If everyone does things the same way then one mistake, one weakness, and everybody loses. What's most important to me is seeing a lot of different regions that are truly different. That's the spirit of Ephemerisle.</p><p> What are some of the rules that you have lived by that you would like to change?</p><p> It's hard to briefly answer that question because I feel like the rule set of the United States of America is so far from my ideal that I don't want to pick out just one thing.</p><p> This is something where, often with seasteading, I try to keep things on the meta level. We don't endorse a particular political system or particular set of rules because doing so can distract people from the big idea. And the big idea is not, here's a utopia or here's one set of rules that we think everybody should follow. The entire idea is we need to play with rules more. Rules should be an art \u2014 part of the critical infrastructure of our world.</p><p> It's like code. You can copy and remix laws and bring them from place to place in a way that you can't easily do with buildings and cities and highways. But yet we don't. We just use our locally evolved rules and we have terrible decision-making mechanisms \u2014 like democracy in America, where the government every couple of years collects a few dozen bits of information from me about my preferences. It's terrible. We now have half a century worth of Nobel Prize-winning economists on how democracy tends to produce laws that favor special interests over the masses, even though that's kind of the opposite of its founding philosophy.</p><p> I think the meta rules are so bad\u2026that I feel like much of the content of the laws is bad. Although I will give a shout-out to British common law and say that, inside those hundreds of thousands of pages of regulations, these general ideas of courts and contracts and those precedents I think are quite good.</p><p> Let's say that a new seasteading island is getting underway. Who is tasked with coming up with the new rules?</p><p> There's the democratic analogy, which is the community of initial citizens comes together and uses some collaborative decision-making process to create the initial rules.</p><p> Then there's the sort of start-up model, which is that a small group of founders comes together and their governance is sort of like the prototype or the mission statement or initial product for a company \u2014 that's what they're going to build it around.</p><p> And then there's the special economic zone model where you have a developer who's going to hand things off to an operator \u2014 they're going to create this real estate project\u2026 So there, it's a process of the developer trying to make money and negotiation with the government and with the anchor tenants.</p><p> Do you view this as a scalable alternative to the system of sovereign nations that we have right now?</p><p> As I see it, sovereignty is fragmenting in the 21st century and becoming commoditized. Just look at the large internet companies, for example. They have significant power over information that would traditionally have been held by the sovereign, just from technological changes.</p><p> I do see this as making the system more flexible instead of dividing everything up geographically into 150 units that have these rigid bodies of law that don't learn enough from each other and don't experiment. I just want to see a world that's more like software, where people are regularly trying changes and rewrites and copying new things and using new language and new modules. But then for safety they're trying them out at a small scale \u2014 letting people use them voluntarily and only scaling them up as they prove safe. I think it's absolutely sustainable and scalable.</p><p> So what you're saying is, if in five or six years we see a press release announcing that Mark Zuckerberg has launched a big platform off the Pacific coast as a private retreat center for Facebook's largest shareholders, we shouldn't be surprised.</p><p> I definitely think that large corporations actually operating these is in the future. \u2026 I definitely see that at some point we'll get corporate states, and I know some people find that creepy. I'm kind of on the fence about whether I'd like living in Apple-topia or Google-topia \u2014 definitely not Facebook-topia or Netflix-topia.</p><p> But the idea is that these are alternatives that you go to if you want, and if you don't like it, don't go there. It's really core to our philosophy that these things be opt-in. It's wrong to change people's government out from under them. But it's also really bad if there aren't new governments that you can choose to go to.</p><p> CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated Friedman's political philosophy.

Even as the social media tsar tried to mend fences, Facebook is still trying to get clearance in Ireland to share your WhatsApp personal information across Facebook for advertising purposes.</p><p>To be clear, it is not asking to look at what you type into WhatsApp and then sell ads off it on Facebook. It wants to use your phone number, your name, maybe your photo and one or two other personally identifiable bits to help build a bigger profile for advertisers.</p><p>After the events of the last week, this might become a bigger issue. It's not just the capers over the last week with Cambridge Analytica that will weigh in on the matter.</p><p>When it comes to multinational companies and our privacy, there are some worrying signs in Ireland.</p><p>The most recent tally from the office of the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) shows at least 19 data breaches over the last 12 months among multinational companies that work out of Ireland. (This is probably a very conservative figure, being the number that are officially reported to Helen Dixon's office.) A 'data breach' is anything from a hacking attack to not stopping a commercial partner from abusing customer data to accidentally leaving a sensitive work laptop in the back of a taxi.</p><p>The DPC office didn't name the companies involved, other than to say they are multinationals.</p><p>What she did say is that standards remain sloppy and that the biggest companies operating here may not really be that trustworthy at handling your information.</p><p>In her report, Ms Dixon cited \"poor governance and controls\" that led to a \"failure\" in making sure customer personal data was properly handled.</p><p>She also pointedly highlighted \"over reliance\" on promises and purported security measures given, in some cases, by the partners of multinational companies when they were handling or responsible for the customer information.</p><p>Sound familiar? If so, that's because in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the underlying issue was that Facebook didn't pay enough attention to what a third party (Cambridge Analytica) was doing.</p><p>While there is no direct evidence that the same activity as occurred with Cambridge Analytica has been recorded here, there is ample evidence that the biggest, richest, most tech-savvy companies don't treat your personal details with the full compliance it deserves.</p><p>Take LinkedIn, one of the biggest tech employers in Dublin and now a subsidiary of one of the big five firms, Microsoft. It was one of four multinational firms (along with Adobe, Survey Monkey and AIG) recently audited by the Irish data watchdog.</p><p>The regulatory body found a number of problems.</p><p>These included \"not taking appropriate steps to verify that personal data they hold was secure and processed\" and \"a lack of transparency due to privacy policies that do not adequately inform data subjects as to the processing of their personal data\".</p><p>In other words, the big tech firms make it too hard for ordinary people to understand what their rights are and sometimes don't bother to make sure the data is actually secure.</p><p>As for Facebook and WhatsApp, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner has thus far resisted Facebook's efforts at crossing the data advertising streams with WhatsApp.</p><p>All eyes will be on whether this status changes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-135871673</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RY3-4W71-DY9P-N4GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"600\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 24, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

In March, it expanded its definition of prohibited content to include U.S. white nationalist and white separatist material as well as that from international terrorist groups.

WhatsApp executives and central bank officials had held at least three meetings in the previous 21 months. Two were in the week running up to the launch.</p><p>In the first time he has spoken in detail about the decision, Central Bank President Roberto Campos Neto said the regulator had not determined how to deal with the proposed payment model - a new phenomenon in Brazil, which has no card money-transfer service operated through an app.</p><p>\"Prior to the launch, there was a meeting in which WhatsApp kind of explained its plan, but the central bank was taken by surprise with the launch on June 15,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>The regulator - which said it never received a formal launch request - suspended the service, Facebook Pay, on June 23.</p><p>Mr. Campos Neto and other officials said concerns centred on competition, data privacy - they have not provided details - and continuing deliberations over whether WhatsApp required a licence as a company offering or arranging payment services. WhatsApp said it had answered central bank questions and provided the launch schedule at the final meetings.</p><p>\"We spoke openly about our plans to bring WhatsApp payments to Brazil,\" it said.</p><p>WhatsApp said it did not want to become a financial services company.</p><p>As a way around this, and within existing rules, WhatsApp sought to use Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., which already had central bank licences, to carry out the money transfers.</p><p>\"WhatsApp contacted us roughly two years ago to build a payments solution to bring convenience for their users and also because it did not want to become a financial institution,\" Visa's Brazil chief Fernando Teles said.</p><p>WhatsApp said the service used payment networks from Visa and Mastercard, which are regulated companies in Brazil.</p><p>However, Mr. Campos Neto said a money-transfer service provided by a tech platform had never existed in Brazil, and that the central bank had not yet decided whether WhatsApp itself needed a licence.</p><p>It is not the first time Facebook appears to have misread the regulatory runes as it seeks to enter the data-rich world of finance. A year ago, it unveiled plans for the Libra cryptocurrency, only to be met with a backlash from central banks.</p><p>In Brazilian payments, the prize is large, with a burgeoning market that saw 1.8-trillion reals (about $454-billion) in card transactions last year.</p><p>In the initial stages of its service, WhatsApp was also looking to make use of a provision in payment regulation, allowing companies to start services without a licence until they reached 500 million reals or 25 million transactions over a 12month period, according to a source close to the company.</p><p>This, again, is within the rules. However the provision, Mr. Campos Neto said, was aimed at encouraging small businesses to enter the market as opposed to a big tech network such as WhatsApp, with 120 million Brazilian users.</p><p>\"WhatsApp tried to take advantage of this rule, saying, \u2018We're going to start with very low volumes because once we're in the system, it will be tough to take us out,\u2018\" he said.</p><p>The central bank changed this provision on June 23 to allow it to suspend companies covered by it.</p><p>Three meetings were held between WhatsApp and the central bank about the payment service, according to public central bank records: in October, 2018, plus this year on June 9 and 12 - with one of those final talks attended by Mr. Campos Neto and WhatsApp chief operating officer Matthew Idema.</p><p>WhatsApp said it also presented the central bank with its partnership model in 2019, although Reuters could not independently verify that meeting and the central bank declined to comment on meetings or dates.</p><p>Visa and Mastercard said they did not notify the central bank they planned to perform transfers for WhatsApp because they thought they already had the required licences.</p><p>The setback is the latest blow to Facebook's global payment ambitions, key to boosting revenue in the developing markets that account for most of its user growth and realizing chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's vision to stitch together the infrastructure underlying Facebook's apps, which also include Instagram.</p><p>WhatsApp has been trying to launch payments since 2018 in India, its biggest market, but remains stuck in beta testing.</p><p>The Brazilian service would not charge individual users, but merchants would pay a fee per transaction.</p><p>One competition concern, according to a source close to the central bank, centres on WhatsApp's planned use of Cielo SA as its payments processor - or acquirer - for cards such as Visa and Mastercard. Cielo already has a dominant market share of 40 per cent in Brazil.</p><p>\"I also must see the platform is open, which means that if more acquirers want to be in the platform, they are free to participate,\" Mr. Campos Neto said.</p><p>WhatsApp, which has signed a deal with Cielo, said it did not have an exclusivity arrangement. Cielo declined to comment, but earlier told an antitrust watchdog there was no exclusivity.</p><p>In a further twist, the central bank is itself planning to roll out a fast-payment system in November, Pix, which uses consumers' chequing accounts, a different terrain from Facebook Pay. WhatsApp has said it is open to integrating its service with Pix, which could offer one way to help break the deadlock.</p><p>The future remains uncertain, however. Since Facebook Pay was suspended, central bank officials have met executives from WhatsApp, Mastercard and Visa in an attempt to find a way through.

The first hearing begins at 9:30am ET. The second hearing begins at 2pm ET. Top lawyers from Facebook, Twitter, and Google are testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee and House of Representatives on Wednesday. </p><p>They were also grilled\u00a0on Tuesday[1]\u00a0over exactly what they knew and when they knew it. Neither Facebook, Twitter, nor Google's CEO\u00a0was in attendance at\u00a0the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Wednesday, with each sending their top lawyers instead. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to be heard from during Facebook's quarterly earnings call Wednesday afternoon, which Business Insider will be covering after markets close. The first Wednesday hearing, where general council for Facebook, Twitter, and Google will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee, kicked off at 9:30 am ET. You can watch a livestream of the 9:30am ET Senate Intelligence Committee hearing right here.[2] Facebook's general counsel, Colin Stretch, will be representing Facebook.\u00a0Sean Edgett will be representing Twitter as its acting general counsel.\u00a0Kent Walker, one of Google's general counsels, who reports into Google CEO Sundar Pichai, will be representing Google. The second hearing of the day kicks off at 2:00 pm ET, as top lawyers from Facebook, Twitter, and Google appear before Congress and the House panel investigating election interference. You'll be able to watch the 2 PM hearing live here.[3] For a full recap on Tuesday's hearing, where Facebook's general council, Colin Stretch,\u00a0admitted \"there were signals we missed,\" click here.[4] Opening remarksSenate Intel Committee Vice Chairman Sen. Mark Warner began Wednesday's hearing with some prepared remarks, stressing that \"not one of us is doing enough to stop\" Russian operatives from hijacking the \"national conversation\" in an attempt to \"make Americans angry.\" In this age of social media, you can't afford to waste too much time - or too many characters - in getting the point across, so I'll get straight to the bottom line.\u00a0 Russian operatives are attempting to infiltrate and manipulate American social media to hijack the national conversation and to make Americans angry, to set us against ourselves and to undermine our democracy. They did it during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. They are still doing it now. And not one of us is doing enough to stop it.\u00a0 That is why we are here today. In many ways, this threat is not new. Russians have been conducting information warfare for decades.\u00a0 But what is new is the advent of social media tools with the power to magnify propaganda and fake news on a scale that was unimaginable back in the days of the Berlin Wall. Today's tools seem almost purpose-built for Russian disinformation techniques.\u00a0 Russia's playbook is simple, but formidable. It works like this: Disinformation agents set up thousands of fake accounts, groups and pages across a wide array of platforms.\u00a0 These fake accounts populate content on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, LinkedIn, and others. Each of these fake accounts spend months developing networks of real people to follow and like their content, boosted by tools like paid ads and automated bots. Most of their real-life followers have no idea they are caught up in this web.  These networks are later utilized to push an array of disinformation, including stolen emails, state-led propaganda (like RT and Sputnik), fake news, and divisive content.\u00a0 The goal here is to get this content into the news feeds of as many potentially receptive Americans as possible and to covertly and subtly push them in the direction the Kremlin wants them to go. As one who deeply respects the tech industry and was involved in the tech business for twenty years, it has taken me some time to really understand this threat. Even I struggle to keep up with the language and mechanics. The difference between bots, trolls, and fake accounts. How they generate Likes, Tweets, and Shares. And how all of these players and actions are combined into an online ecosystem.\u00a0 What is clear, however, is that this playbook offers a tremendous bang for the disinformation buck. With just a small amount of money, adversaries use hackers to steal and weaponize data, trolls to craft disinformation, fake accounts to build networks, bots to drive traffic, and ads to target new audiences. They can force propaganda into the mainstream and wreak havoc on our online discourse. That's a big return on investment.  So where do we go from here? It will take all of us - the platform companies, the United States government, and the American people - to deal with this new and evolving threat. Social media and the innovative tools each of you have developed have changed our world for the better. You have transformed the way we do everything from shopping for groceries to growing our small businesses. But Russia's actions are further exposing the dark underbelly of the ecosystem you have created. And there is no doubt that their successful campaign will be replicated by other adversaries - both nation states and terrorists - that wish to do harm to democracies around the globe. As such, each of you here today needs to commit more resources to identifying bad actors and, when possible, preventing them from abusing our social media ecosystem.\u00a0 Thanks in part to pressure from this Committee, each company has uncovered some evidence of the ways Russians exploited their platforms during the 2016 election. For Facebook, much of the attention has been focused on the paid ads Russian trolls targeted to Americans. However, these ads are just the tip of a very large iceberg. The real story is the amount of misinformation and divisive content that was pushed for free on Russian-backed Pages, which then spread widely on the News Feeds of tens of millions of Americans.\u00a0 According to data Facebook has provided, 120 Russian-backed Pages built a network of over 3.3 million real people. From these now-suspended Pages, 80,000 organic unpaid posts reached an estimated 126 million real people. That is an astonishing reach from just one group in St. Petersburg. And I doubt that the so-called Internet Research Agency represents the only Russian trolls out there. Facebook has more work to do to see how deep this goes, including looking into the reach of the IRA-backed Instagram posts, which represent another 120,000 pieces of content. The anonymity provided by Twitter and the speed by which it shares news makes it an ideal tool to spread disinformation. According to one study, during the 2016 campaign, junk news actually outperformed real news in some battleground states in the lead-up to Election Day. Another study found that bots generated one out of every five political messages posted on Twitter over the entire presidential campaign.  I'm concerned that Twitter seems to be vastly under-estimating the number of fake accounts and bots pushing disinformation. Independent researchers have estimated that up to 15% of Twitter accounts - or potentially 48 million accounts - are fake or automated. Despite evidence of significant incursion and outreach from researchers, Twitter has, to date, only uncovered a small percentage of that activity. Though, I am pleased to see that number has been rising in recent weeks.  Google's search algorithms continue to have problems in surfacing fake news or propaganda. Though we can't necessarily attribute to the Russian effort, false stories and unsubstantiated rumors were elevated on Google Search during the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, YouTube has become RT's go-to platform. You have also now uncovered 1100 videos associated with this campaign. Much more of your content was likely spread through other platforms.  It is not just the platforms that need to do more. The U.S. government has thus far proven incapable of adapting to meet this 21st century challenge. Unfortunately, I believe this effort is suffering, in part, because of a lack of leadership at the top. We have a President who remains unwilling to acknowledge the threat that Russia poses to our democracy. President Trump should stop actively delegitimizing American journalism and acknowledge and address this real threat posed by Russian propaganda.\u00a0 Congress, too, must do more. We need to recognize that current law was not built to address these threats. I have partnered with Senators Klobuchar and McCain on a light-touch legislative approach, which I hope my colleagues with review. The Honest Ads Act is a national security bill intended to protect our elections from foreign influence. Finally - but perhaps most importantly - the American people also need to be aware of what is happening on our news feeds. We all need to take a more discerning approach to what we are reading and sharing, and who we are connecting with online. We need to recognize that the person at the other end of that Facebook or Twitter argument may not be a real person at all. The fact is that this Russian weapon has already proven its success and cost effectiveness. We can all be assured that other adversaries, including foreign intelligence operatives and potentially terrorist organizations, are reading their playbook and already taking action. We don't have the luxury of waiting for this Committee's final report before taking action to respond to this threat to our democracy. To our witnesses today, I hope you will detail what you saw in this last election and tell us what steps you will undertake to get ready for the next one. We welcome your participation and encourage your continued commitment to addressing this shared responsibility. Chairman Richard Burr also gave an opening statement, welcoming the general councils from Facebook, Twitter, and Google, and noting that Wednesday's hearing was a chance for them to \"correct the record,\" noting that \"my sense is that not all aspects of those stories have been told accurately.\"\u00a0NOW WATCH: Google Pixel 2 vs iPhone X: The biggest differences between the two[5]See Also:

A House of Lords committee put forward the proposal for film-style ratings system on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TwitterIn their report, 'Regulating the Digital World', the peers warned that social media platforms are rife with 'abuse which big tech companies have failed to eliminate' because their systems for moderating content are 'unacceptably opaque and slow'.They called for Ofcom, the broadcasting watchdog, to have its powers extended immediately to enforce the new age classifications.The ratings would be devised with the tech industry, but they could be like the 'U', 'PG', '15' and '18' ratings that are dished out by the British Board of Film Classification to ensure that children do not see film content that they are too young to cope with, the Lords said.Platforms that regularly show youngsters material that is unsuitable for their age group would be fined for the breaches - potentially costing the tech firms billions of pounds.People who reported problem content on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and other tech platforms could also complain to Ofcom if the social media firms did not action.The Lords report said: 'Too often internet companies have been allowed \"to mark their own homework\" and can fail to uphold even the standards they themselves set in codes of practice.' </p><p>If the proposal goes ahead, platforms that regularly show youngsters material that is unsuitable for their age group would be fined for the breaches - potentially costing the tech firms billions of poundsTheir sweeping proposals also called for:<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Tech firms to have a new, legal 'duty of care' to users, policed by Ofcom;</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The complex terms and conditions on tech websites to be translated into language that children can understand;</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>A new 'Digital Authority' to oversee the 'patchwork' of regulators that currently police parts of the technology industry, and ensure that nothing falls through the gaps;</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>That Digital Authority to be tasked 'horizon scanning', so that it predicts problems that might arise from new tech trends and ensuring the Government is equipped;</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>UK tech firms to face public interest tests when they want to buy up other firms in 'data-driven mergers'.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>US tech firms that buy up other companies could face strict limits on their UK operations.</p><p>Lord Gilbert of Panteg, chairman of the committee, said yesterday: 'We need a horizon scanning capacity, so that we look forward to problems rather than waiting for them to appear on the front page of the Daily Mail.'</p><p>He added: 'Without intervention, the largest tech companies are likely to gain ever more control of technologies which extract personal data and make decisions affecting people's lives.</p><p>'Our proposals will ensure that rights are protected online as they are offline while keeping the internet open to innovation and creativity, with a new culture of ethical behaviour embedded in the design of service.'</p><p>He also called for the Government to ensure regulators have the power to mete out meaningful punishments.</p><p>The biggest fine Ofcom has dished out in the past was a \u00a350million levy for Royal Mail - a sum that would still be small fry to web giants like Facebook.</p><p>But Lord Gilbert said the regulator would be likely to have its fining powers increased so that it can dish out effective punishments to web giants that rake in billions of pounds in profits.</p><p>'A token fine doesn't work,' he said. 'You have to have a sense of proportionality - that you don't fine them for a one off. You fine for systematic failures - but then the fine is consistent.'</p><p>The Lords committee also threw its weight behind plans for the ICO to crack down on web giants that hoover up users' information, with no apparent regard for that person's age.</p><p>The Mail revealed yesterday that the watchdog will ban tech firms from building up a 'profile' of children based on their search history, and then using it to send them suggestions for material such as pornography, hate-speech and self-harm.</p><p>It will also force tech firms to guarantee that privacy settings are automatically switched to the highest level, and that geolocation services are switched off, under a new code due to be published next month, and backed by existing laws.</p><p>Web giants will also be forced to introduce strict age checks on their websites to guarantee they know the age of their users - or simply assume that all of their users are children.</p><p>Tech firms will not be allowed to include features on children's accounts designed to fuel addictive behaviour, such as online videos that automatically start one after the other, notifications that arrive through the night, and prompts nudging children to lower their privacy settings.</p><p>In fact, under the proposals outlined today, tech firms will have to actively nudge children off their websites.</p><p>The Lords said: 'Digital service providers...should keep a record of time spent using their service which may be easily accessed and reviewed by users, with periodic reminders.'</p><p>The recommendations come as the Government prepares to publish its long-awaited White Paper on 'Online Harms', designed to clean up the web giants' platforms.</p><p>It follows another damning report by the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which said last month that social media platforms were behaving like 'digital gangsters' and should be forced to comply with a regulated code of ethics to tackle harmful or illegal content on their sites. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-52433989</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKR-2F31-F021-600S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1035\"/><timeReceived>12:28 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

It also allows these social media apps to moderate    posts published on their sites. Last month, after Twitter posted a fact check of a tweet written by President Donald Trump involving mail-in ballots, the president signed an executive order that    directed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to develop rules that would allow social-media companies to remove content from their sites while remaining protected by Section 230. At the    same time, Trump asked the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to punish companies that engage in  deceptive  communication. The Justice Department (DOJ) said that it would seek reform of Section 230    to weaken the protection it offers to social-media companies.</p><h>Changes to Section 230 might require legislation instead of a court ruling</h><p>The changes that the DOJ wants to impose on Section 230 still have to make it through Congress. If that happens, social-media companies could be held criminally responsible if their apps are    used to arrange illegal activities such as selling illegal drugs, facilitating terrorism, child exploitation, and cyberstalking. CNBC reports that without Section 230 s protection, tech companies    could find themselves in deep water with the Justice Department. Another DOJ proposal would prevent tech firms from using Section 230 to defend themselves against antitrust claims. As it turns    out, the DOJ is reportedly prepping an anti-trust suit against Google while the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) prepares one against Facebook.Attorney General Bill Barr says that Section 230 has been  has been stretched way beyond its original intention.  Back in December, Barr told the told a gathering of the National    Association of Attorneys General that the DOJ was taking a long look at Section 230 and the intended scope of the rule. The regulatory agency plans on suing social media companies. But the courts    have historically upheld Section 230 which means that legislative action will need to take place for the tech firms to lose their protection. The Justice Department would like to see victims of    online scams and child exploitation allowed to file a civil suit against any platform that knew about the illegal activity and did not remove any messages related to it from its site. Two years    ago Congress did pass a reform to Section 230 that removed protection for online ads promoting sex work. Originally praised by members of Congress, the bill did not keep the support of sex worker    advocates because the bills forced platforms to remove websites that allowed sex workers to research potential clients. As a result, sex workers found themselves less safe while doing their jobs.    Facebook says that losing the protection of Section 230 would result in consumers sharing fewer messages online. Nick Clegg, Facebook s vice president of global affairs and communications spoke    with reporters by phone today and said,  Changing significantly the balance of responsibilities and provisions about liability in Section 230 would, in our view, mean less speech of all kinds    appearing online.  That is the typical response that tech companies have when asked about the possibility of losing their legal shield. The White House issued a statement today that said that     President Trump is pleased to see the department following through  on the legislation suggested in the president s executive order. Additionally, Senator Josh Hawley, (R-Mo.), another adversary    of Big Tech and Section 230, introduced a new bill today that would require social media firms to act in good faith. This would expose these companies to lawsuits claiming breaches of contract.    But not all members of Congress agree with Senator Hawley. Senator Mark Warner, (D-Va.), who has criticized Section 230 in the past, said,  While I believe reform of this outdated law is needed,    I have serious concerns that under the supervision of Attorney General Barr this effort has been politicized and will be used by the Trump Administration to cow platforms into allowing Trump,    dark money groups, and right-wing militias to continue to exploit their tools to sow disinformation, engage in targeted harassment, and suppress voter participation. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.phonearena.com/news/doj-action-could-expose-online-firms-to-lawsuits_id125383\">https://www.phonearena.com/news/doj-action-could-expose-online-firms-to-lawsuits_id125383</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Alan Friedman<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2606402</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MS-8HG1-JCTB-F4WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><timeReceived>12:52 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 19, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Because there is no way I have treat 350 patients and counting and nobody is dead.' </p><p>She said she has treated patients with hydroxychloroquine along with zinc, and the antibiotic zithromax. </p><p>Trump's retweets featuring the video were later removed by YouTube and then Twitter. </p><p>Twitter said early Tuesday morning, 'Tweets with the video are in violation of our COVID-19 misinformation policy.' </p><p>The president's Twitter timeline displayed the message: 'This Tweet is no longer available.'</p><p>Immanuel, the doctor featured in the video, latger tweeted a threat to Facebook for removing the video. </p><p>'Hello Facebook put back my profile page and videos up or your computers with start crashing till you do,' she said.</p><p>'You are not bigger that God. I promise you.

He will not, however, be able to tweet, retweet, follow new accounts or like anyone's tweets.</p><p>While Don Jr. and his spokesperson called Twitter's move a suspension from using Twitter, the social media platform clarified in a statement Tuesday: 'We did not suspend the account.'</p><p>'The screenshot shared directly says that Twitter required the Tweet to be deleted because it violated our rules, and that we would limit some account functionality for 12 hours' a Twitter spokesperson said.</p><p>Surabian said he would not accept that explanation.</p><p>                     Trump had gone into a Twitter frenzy on Monday night, retweeting a series of posts - including the Breitbart video. </p><p>In his Twitter spree Trump retweeted a post that claimed Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases, is leading the country in the wrong direction by refusing to endorse the use of the anti-malaria drug in combating COVID-19. </p><p>Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, pushed back on Tuesday morning.</p><p>'I have not been misleading the American public under any circumstances,' he said. </p><p>Trump was a big promoter of hydroxychloroquine and repeatedly pushed it as a therapeutic treatment for the coronavirus, which has infected over 4.2million in the US and killed more than 148,000, even though the Federal Drug Administration warns the drug has harmful side effects.</p><p>'Dr. Fauci has misled the American public on many issues, but in particular, on dismissing #hydroxychloroquine and calling Remdesivir the new gold standard,' the retweet said.</p><p>The president has come under pressure for his handling of the coronavirus crisis and in recent weeks has tried rectify his reputation by holding solo coronavirus briefings, canceling some campaign events, and wearing a mask in public.</p><p>He has returned to preach about the benefits of the drug which he famously took for two weeks as a preventative measure against the virus.</p><p>However, the Federal Drug Administration stopped recommending emergency use of hydroxycholoquine citing safety concerns about harmful side effects.</p><p>In May the World Health Organization stopped its hydroxychloroquine trial. The National Institutes for Health similarly halted their trial in June after determining it provided 'no benefit' in the patients studied. </p><p>Immanuel's claims are contrary to the extensive tests that have been done regarding the drug. </p><p>Video of her fiery speech was shared on Twitter, where it racked up over 14 million views on Monday - partly due to the promotion by far-right news organizations. </p><p>CNN's Oliver Darcy was among the first to notice that the videos have been removed, tweeting: 'Videos Trump shared are now no longer available.'</p><p>'While Twitter reviews the video, it's worth noting that various versions of it have received hundreds of thousands of views on this platform and more than one has been retweeted to the public by the President of the United States,' he added. </p><p>'I have not misled the American public - and I don't read Donald Trump's tweets!' Dr. Fauci dismisses president's tweet storm accusing him of lying about hydroxychloroquine </p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci on Tuesday morning dismissed President Donald Trump's Monday night rant accusing him of 'misleading' Americans regarding antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine.</p><p>'I don't know how to address that,' the nation's top immunologist told Good Morning America regarding the president's Twitter storm. </p><p>'I'm just going to, certainly, continue doing my job.</p><p>'I, you know, I don't tweet, I don't - I don't even read them,' Fauci, 79, told ABC News host George Stephanopoulos. </p><p>'So I don't really want to go there.'</p><p>Trump went on a Twitter frenzy Monday night, including retweets of posts claiming Fauci lied to the country regarding hydroxychloroquine, which the president revealed he has taken as a preventative measure to stop him from contracting coronavirus.</p><p>Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, pushed back Tuesday morning: 'I have not been misleading the American public under any circumstances.'</p><p>The president's Twitter storm included reposts of videos of a doctor who claimed the anti-Malaria drug is a 'cure' for COVID-19.</p><p>Several of the tweets he shared with his 84 million followers, however, were taken down by Twitter citing misinformation regulations.</p><p>Facebook and YouTube also removed video of Dr. Stella Immanuel's speech outside the Capitol. </p><p>The president's insistence that the drug does work come as the Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for controlling and regulating all prescription and over-the-counter medications, pharmaceuticals and vaccines, said hydroxychloroquine is 'unlikely to be effective' in treating the virus.</p><p>'I just will continue to do my job no matter what comes out because I think it's very important,' Fauci said Tuesday. 'We're in the middle of a crisis with regard to an epidemic - a pandemic. This is what I do, this is what I've been trained for my entire professional life and I'll continue to do it.'</p><p>Fauci has advised six presidents since joining the National Institute of Health in 1984.</p><p>In Trump's Twitter spree he shared a post that claims Fauci is leading the country in the wrong direction by refusing to endorse hydroxychloroquine in combating the virus.</p><p>Trump has often promoted the drug, repeatedly pushing it as a therapeutic treatment, even though the FDA warns the drug has harmful side effects and in June revoked an emergency authorization for its use to treat coronavirus.</p><p>'Dr. Fauci has misled the American public on many issues, but in particular, on dismissing #hydroxychloroquine and calling Remdesivir the new gold standard,' the retweet said. </p><p>Fauci, once a fixture at the White House briefing room podium toward the start of the pandemic, has not yet been invited back for Trump's rebooted task force briefings.</p><p>Trump and Fauci have often butted heads over how to respond to the health crisis and eventually, the president sidelined the nation's top immunologist from the press conferences altogether.</p><p>Reports emerged of tensions between the two, and Fauci could be seen physically recoiling from some of the president's remarks - including smirking and face-palming.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-64769636</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FV-42N1-JCJY-G0JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1749\"/><timeReceived>5:26 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Hence, the committee will not issue the subpoenas.<br/> The hearing will focus on section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Social media giants in the past have been accused of leveraging Section 230 to silence conservative viewpoints. The discussions were escalated when Twitter flagged US President Donald Trump's tweet for \"glorifying violence.\" Since then, multiple tweets by the President have been flagged with labels such as \"manipulated media\" in addition to fact-checking labels.<br/> The companies have denied allegations of political bias on multiple occasions.<br/> \"We've made our views clear on reactionary and politicized attempts to erode #Section230. They threaten the future of online speech and Internet freedoms. Reasoned and productive debate is essential,\" said Twitter.<br/> US anti-trust probe concludes Big Tech needs to be broken up and regulated: Here's all you need to know<br/> \"Alleged 'political bias' remains an unsubstantiated allegation that we have refuted on many occasions to Congress. It has also been widely disproven by independent research,\" it added.<br/> \"Technology companies argue that their broad liability shield should remain in place,\" said US Senator Roger Wicker had said on Thursday. \"However, they disproportionately suppress and censor conservative views online. Public testimony from these CEOs is critical as the Committee considers several proposals to reform the Communications Decency Act.\"<br/> The legal proceedings moving forward are also likely to focus on the legal protection enjoyed by the tech companies along with their role in limiting misinformation and ensuring privacy.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-A553403</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6105-9CC1-JBYT-H1X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"440\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 3, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It coincides with social media CEOs preparing to testify Monday before lawmakers on the hotly-contested and related issue of antitrust.Underscoring the stakes, the executive order charges (TWTR), (FB) and its photo-sharing platform , as well as Google\u2019s (GOOG) YouTube with wielding \u201cimmense, if not unprecedented, power to shape the interpretation of public events; to censor, delete, or disappear information; and to control what people see or do not see.\u201dThe order requests that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reinterpret and issue new regulations for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law granting social media giants their special protection. The protection is widely regarded as the tool that made it possible for Big Tech to amass considerable market dominance.By weakening the law\u2019s safeguards, Trump\u2019s maneuver is designed to make it tougher for social media platforms to edit or delete user content, especially politically charged material.That includes his own posts, which recently fueled a feud with over warning labels the company placed on posts that questioned the integrity of mail-in voting, and threatened force against protestors responding to the homicide of George Floyd.How it would be enforcedSAN ANSELMO, CALIFORNIA - MAY 29: In this photo illustration a notification from appears on tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump that the social media platform says violated its policy on May 29, 2020 in San Anselmo, California. has started to flag some of President Trump's tweets that violate the company's terms. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/)Section 230 was originally created to enable online platforms to make good faith efforts to block user content that the platform \u2014 or its users \u2014 consider to be , without exposing them to lawsuits. That latitude gives social media and other platforms that host user content an exemption for editorial decisions not available to traditional publishers.Under the order, the president instructs U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, acting through the department\u2019s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) \u2014 an executive branch agency responsible for advising the president on telecommunications and information policy issues \u2014 to file a petition for rulemaking with the FCC. The NTIA did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance\u2019s request for comment.The order requests that the FCC \u201cexpeditiously propose\u201d new regulations for the online platforms that would further tighten scenarios under which 230 would allow the platforms to edit and delete content \u2014 but the independent agency is under no obligation to do so. And before it can take rule-making steps, the FCC must first be authorized by statute to do so.  Anne Veigle, an FCC representative, told Yahoo Finance that the agency had so far received no petitions in connection with the Trump administration's executive order.Yet Legal experts, including Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, question whether the FCC has any authority at all to engage in rulemaking concerning 230. The agency has never claimed the authority under the law, and no such language extending authority exists in the statute.In a statement Rosenworcel, a Democratic appointee, urged her fellow commissioners to reject the anticipated petition from the administration, saying that the FCC should not become the president\u2019s speech police.Still, FCC Commissioner Bradley Carr, a Republican appointee, defended Trump\u2019s move. He told Yahoo Finance that online platforms should lose the 230 liability shield if they engage in \u201cbad faith\u201d content moderation.  If the NTIA does file a petition with the FCC, and the FCC asserts authority to take action, the administration\u2019s effort could still stop there if the FCC finds the NTIA\u2019s petition deficient.  Alternatively, the agency could move forward by filing an official Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) \u2014 a document that explains the agency\u2019s plans and must be published in the Federal Register. Another option still would be for the FCC to issue an advisory opinion.   Once an NFPR is submitted to the Federal Register, it can be done by either soliciting or declining to solicit public comment. For submissions that do request public comment, a timeframe is set for the comment period, allowing the public and interested parties to raise and document issues of concern.  At the end of the period, which in this case would likely extend into the fall, the FCC evaluates the comments and, based upon them, can choose to terminate the proposed action, or accept it in whole or in part.  Rules are also subject to court challenges, as well as recommendations for legislative changes from the Department of Justice.Alexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

I will speak with the White House National Trade Council Director  Peter Navarro about the fears, later this hour and what the President will  announce today at noon time.  Futures pointing to a lower opening ahead of  the announcement, take a look.  Futures indicating the Dow will open down  160 points, that's 2/3 of one percent.  We got the NASDAQ down better than  one percent right now, 78 points lower.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks settle lower yesterday of course going a mix session when the  federal reserve raised interest rates for the first time this year under  new Chairman Jay Powell.  Yesterday, the market was down across the board  Dow Industrial down 45 points.  NASDAQ Composite down 19, even the S&amp;P 500  down five points.  In Europe, this morning stocks are lower.  Investors  watching the Bank of England in frustrate decision that's due out in about  two hours from now.  We will get you that when the news hit the tape.   That's 200 down one half of one percent of DAX Index Germany and the CAC in  Paris down one percent a piece. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Asia overnight mixed performances.  Take a look.  Mostly lower, although  the NIKKEI average in Japan, up about that one percent.  </p><p>And move over the dollar, while Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey says that Bitcoin  will replace the Greenback for the world currency in the next decade.  </p><p>Then, MIT joining a new type of school.  We've got to look at the fish  robot set to explore the secrets of the deep.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me talk all about  it, Fox Business Network, Dagen McDowell.  PWC partner, Mitch Roschelle.   And the Wall Street Journal Assistant Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman.   Great to see you guys.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be here.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Look at all the news we have today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  I think the biggest headline is now we know at  least one person who's not going to be running for the presidency ever.   Mark Zuckerberg.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Don't be so sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He has the charisma -- well, my shoe has more charisma than Mark  Zuckerberg.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he had just had an apology.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, it's like something out of \"Westworld\".  He's a robot.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, you know we have had a President who did an apology to her.   So, it's happened before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Maybe this could work.  Until we start paying in Bitcoin, the  fact that the rates on borrowing dollars are going up, should have been a  signal for Washington to restrain the spending but didn't happen --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick on the issue with Jack Dorsey, he's talking his own  book, he runs square.  Square pay is basically selling people fractional  Bitcoin shares.  They're advertising that garbage all over Podcast to  millennials, essentially in -- he's running a casino if you will.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bitcoin the world's currency?  Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sorry.  I know it only 6:02.  But, I got to get the big old  raspberry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, you got fire up today.  Spending bill, you're not happy  with the spending?</p><p>FREEMAN:  No, it's the Federal Reserve is telling us, rate is going to  maybe double in the next two years.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- at a cost of that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The cost of borrowing money, right.  And now, Washington's  response is basically blowing more than 100 billion past the sequestered  caps that in 2011, you know, we're in 20 trillion in debt and it's about to  get a lot more expensive --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- to a service like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well look, they have to give to get according to Paul Ryan.   They have to spend more on other things in order to get the agreements on  the military spending, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, I think, I understand the concern about readiness, but I  think, you do have to consider that we need to be ready to fight 10 years  from now, or 20 years from now, 50 years from now.  And, if we are not an  economic superpower, we're not going to be a military superpower, long  term.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do they raise hogs (INAUDIBLE) because that's the slop you throw  in the trough to feed the hogs.  Because that is poppycock whatever the  Republicans is doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will talk about that.  We got a lot on the table this  morning.  Joining the conversation this morning, White House, National  Trade Counsel Director, Peter Navarro, head of what will be a big  afternoon.  The President is going to announce those restrictions against  China at 12:00 noon today.  Also joining the conversation, Utah Senator,  Senate Finance Committee Chairman, Orrin Hatch is going to walk us through  the new spending bill.  Our Intel Congressman and House Budget Committee,  Chair. Steve Womack is going to do the same.  He will explain that spending  bill.  And former presidential candidate, former Arkansas Governor Mike  Huckabee is here.  Former Republican presidential Candidate Herman Cain is  here and the CEO of Overstock.com, Patrick Byrne has a thing or two to say  about Bitcoin as well.  </p><p>Big show ahead, you don't want to miss a moment on that.  We'll take it off  right here with the top story and that is Mark Zuckerberg breaking his  silence.  The Facebook CEO now publicly addressing the growing privacy  scandal that allowed an outside firm, Cambridge Analytica to gain access to  the personal data of more than 50 million Facebook users.  In the new  interview, Zuckerberg said he is willing to testify before Congress.  He  suggested his company may need to be regulated.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This was a major breach of trust and I'm  really sorry that this happened.  You know we have a basic responsibility  to protect people's data. </p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT, CNN MONEY:  Will you testify  before Congress?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  So, the short answer is this, I'm happy to, if it's the right  thing to do.  I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated.  I think in  general technology is an increasing the important trend in the world and I  actually think the question is more, what is the right regulation rather  than yes or no, should it be regulated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the stock extending the recent decline following that  interview is down 1 2/3 percent right now.  Joining us right now, Political  Reporter for Axios, Alexi McCammond.  Alexi, good to see you.  Thanks very  much for weighing in this morning.  What was your reaction to the  interview?</p><p>ALEXI MCCAMMOND, POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS:  It's so -- as you mentioned at  the top of the show, it took Mark Zuckerberg five days to make this  statement and someone else was saying he lacks charisma and I think that is  all fair criticism of him.  My reaction though and this is what we've  reported in Axios is that the statement left out a lot of critical things.   The statement it self didn't include an apology, didn't have an explanation  for why in 2015 when all of this is happening with Cambridge Analytica.  </p><p>They didn't come forward and say anything.  It also left out why they  didn't say anything in any of the conversation or public discussion we've  been having about Facebook's rule with, you know, Donald Trump's campaign  in the 2016 election.  So, there are a lot of key things missing, I think,  that's what was what we're really hoping to be seen in the statement.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you expecting new legislation on the technology companies  as a result of this powerful position and influence that they've never had  -- never as powerful as they are today?</p><p>MCCAMMOND:  That's an interesting thing that we've seen how both sides of  the aisle, Republicans and Democrats sort of agree on, is that they think  there should be more regulations on tech companies and I think as we see  the power that Facebook and Twitter and Google have as well as this almost  lackluster statements saying made, Congress will move forward on  legislation to regulate these companies.  And Mark Zuckerberg said himself  in that statement in that interview just laid, that he's not sure that they  shouldn't be regulated.  So, I think, what we will see is obviously  Congress is calling on him to testify in front of them.  That will help  inform any legislation their considering moving forward.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Alexi, Mitch Roschelle.  One of the things I just want to chill  down a little bit more, and obviously we're not big fans of regulation  here, but if there was regulation, what would it look like?  Because the  regulation of Facebook in companies like that isn't really that new because  the internet's been around for 25 years and there's more privacy issues a  sort of across the internet.  So, what would regulation look like if there  was regulation?</p><p>MCCAMMOND:  I think, that's a great question.  And that's something a lot  of people are curious about as we're getting more information, not only  that the security breaches, but how this platforms can be used as almost  weapon against its their users.  So, I think, what we can expect to see is  regulation that is important side this testimony we're just talking about.   We don't have specifics on what this could like against Facebook.  Because  unfortunately, what we're seeing is that all of this is so new.  There's  more information coming out in the days -- in the five days since this was  announced in Mark Zuckerberg statement and whatever he could possibly  reveal that he hasn't revealed (INAUDIBLE) yet. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This policy was put into place in 2007.  It ended after 2014 and  that allowed opening up these acts to developers and giving them access to  not only the people who use those apps, but the -- all the information of  their friends.  That's what helped the  Facebook grow from 48 million users  to more than two billion users right now.  And time and again, I will just  say, I think that the righteous indignation from the left right now is  laughable because this has been going on for years in terms of Russian  manipulating the platform, they were letting people kill other people and  commit suicide via Facebook live, a fake news.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You can't forget the Barack Obama presidency in the election.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Obama knew exactly how to mind game and capture the  voters and potential voters.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was 2012.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's what the Facebook wanted, come on -- come on in  President Obama.  We wanted you to win. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was perfectly legal and people on the left felt like  Zuckerberg and company were their friends, that they were in their corner  and this is what happened.  It's hilarious the smearing that you see on  other network by these commentators.  It's like they -- hello, we've been  talking about it on FOX News for years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why -- which is why when we spoke with Congress about  this, everybody I asked in the last several weeks said, yes, we're  expecting some kind of legislation.  Just, Chris Collins yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK: I'm confident you will see new  legislation coming out, and where the enforcement where it belongs, the FTC  will be coming down on them.  So, that it's more evident for someone that  you're checking a box.</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R), CALIFORNIA:  I don't want Congress to over act --  overreact without having all the information.  First thing I want Congress  to do is learn everything that happened.  But this is a technology that's  continue to grow this is where a lot of people get their information, even  though it may not be true information.  So, what rules do we see that  should change in there?  First thing that has to happen is, Facebook needs  to come and talk to Congress.  They need to answer the questions and after  we get all the information, we should see what's appropriate and what's  appropriate for the future for the individual going forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There you go, top conversation one, James Freeman.</p><p>FREEMAN:  OK, let's see, as you know, Facebook is in political terms right  now.  Mainly guilty of being useful to the Trump campaign in 2016.  So,  given that this service has allowed a lot of people for free to enjoy a lot  of services in return for trading information about them, I'm wondering  about the downside risks here from regulation.  The fact, that Mark  Zuckerberg doesn't seem to be opposed to it.  We've seen this before, big  companies, big incumbents benefiting from regulation because it means new  competitors have a tougher time competing with them.  Isn't this likely if  we get a new round here to help Facebook because it's going to make it very  expensive for someone to create the next competitor to them?</p><p>MCCAMMOND:  That is a very good question.  And I don't know the exact  specifics of what this could mean for Facebook but I think, that is  something we should be considering.  Because obviously I think, there's a  lot of political calculus going on behind Mark Zuckerberg saying, I'm not  sure that we shouldn't be regulated, right.  Showing his willingness to be  regulated but could benefit him as you just mentioned.  So, I think, all  that remains to be seen.  In terms of regulation back to the earlier  question, I think, the idea of how much data is given and available is  something that Facebook mentioned in their four step plan to sort of taking  action after they admitted to this.  </p><p>They said that they would notify users of apps that are misusing and  cracking their data.  I think that is hugely important and something that  could be considered in legislation.  They said they would give limited  access to apps that they considered to be misusing data, that they would  cut them off in the platform.  I think, that is something that is going to  be concerning these regulations and also this barrowing people from even  joining the platform if they've had previous sort of shady ways of  collecting information.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to be clear.  I sat on this very program for years  now and as more problems developed at Facebook like, not really cracking  down on terrorist content and actual people who committed terrorist acts  and stepping back and trying to wash their hands with that.  I sat in this  present time, and said you better get your arms around what is going on, on  this platform.  You're asking for regulators to come in the front door of  your company and crack down on it.  I said it time and again -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, been calling it for a long time.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and by the way, when they found out in the past, there's been  myriad abuses of data -- of their data.  Cambridge Analytica, is not the  first.  Their way of pleasing it has been like, don't do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You really shouldn't do that.  You need to stop that.  That's  really not good.  That's been their way of enforcing it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes and you've call that actually, by the way.  Real quick,  Alexi, your thoughts on this, you know, effort to avoid a government  shutdown.  $1.3 trillion spending bill.  </p><p>MCCAMMOND:  It's an expensive package but I've heard from law makers and  both sides of the all in Congresses they obviously want to do everything  they can to avoid a government shutdown.  I think, there are couple of  bipartisan wins in there, especially, the opioid epidemic using nearly $3  billion increase in funding as a huge deal.  The (INAUDIBLE) that has  bipartisan support is a huge win for both sides of the aisle.  I think,  that we can expect the government will remain open and that is a good thing  for everyone. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good thing for everybody.  But we are looking at a $1 trillion  deficit for 10 years out and beyond.  Alexi, good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p>MCCAMMOND:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Alexi McCammond there.  Coming up this hour, White House,  National Trade Counsel Director, Peter Navarro.  Getting his take on what  we're going in here today noon time from the President new restrictions and  tariffs against China.  Don't miss it, it's coming up, back in a minute on  that.  And then, new clues in to the Austin bomber.  Officials say, a  reported confession video was left behind by the serial bombing suspect.   We'll tell you what he had to say, up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back now.  The Austin bomber leaves behind a detailed  recording of his deadly plans.  Lauren Simonetti with the headlines now.   Good morning, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Authorities say  they found a trove of bomb materials and a recording in which Mark Anthony  Condit confessed to his crimes.  He also listed future targets he was  intending to blow up before he was stopped.  Authorities say Condit never  mentioned the motive.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN MANLEY, POLICE CHIEF, AUSTIN TEXAS:  On this recording, the suspect  describes the six bombs that he constructed with a level of specificity  that he identified the differences among those six bombs.  It is the outcry  of a very challenged young man talking about challenges in his personal  life.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Police also say there is no further threat from Condit, but at  the community should still remain vigilant.  </p><p>Well, millions of people in the northeast starting to dig out from the  fourth Nor'easter in less than three weeks' time, just a spring gets  underway.  The storm dumping more than a foot of snow in some parts of the  region, knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes.  Airports  cancelling over 5000 flights yesterday.  Another 1500 today and guess what,  a possible fifth Nor'easter could arrive on Sunday.  </p><p>Well, two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut are on their way to  the International Space Station.  The crews successfully blasted off from  the Kazakhstan yesterday and they will dock at the Space Station tomorrow  afternoon.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Lauren, thank you so much.  Let's talk about that in  terms of a lot of headlines around Russia.  Now, I just want to get your  take on this memo that was given to the President with caps saying, do not  congratulate Vladimir Putin.  And then he calls and congratulates him.   What do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, it's disappointing.  I think it was disappointing when  President Obama did it.  I, there's a -- I suppose there's an argument that  it's one of these courtesies you extend in service of a larger long-term  agenda in terms of trying to build a relationship with Putin, but one of  the great weapons that the United States has the Ronald Reagan understood  that I don't think Mr. Trump always does is our moral authority in the  world and we should never give essentially dictators the cover of  legitimacy.  This is not a real election opposition.  People in Russia are  not allowed the rights we have here.  You don't have a free press, so, I  don't think we should ever acknowledge or pretend that Putin is legitimate  similar to the Chinese government. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is what the President tweeted about it yesterday, he  says, \"I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his  election victory.  In the past, Obama called him also.  The Fake News Media  is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him.  They are wrong, getting  along with Russia -- and others -- is a good thing, not a bad thing.  If  they can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran  and even the coming Arms Race.  Bush tried to get along, but did not have  the 'smarts.'  Obama and Clinton tried, but did not have the energy or  chemistry -- remember RESET -- Peace Through Strength!\"  Democrats of  course, slam the President for the call he is not the first to congratulate  Putin as we just said, former President Obama did the same in 2012.  Bad  timing, we know Theresa May is targeting and, you know, going right at  Putin for murdering two people with poison in the U.K. Dagen, and this is  just a few days ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A nerve agent.  A former spy and his daughter, which again even  overstep the most hideous acts of the -- Soviet Union.  But I'll -- let me  quote Mary Kissel, a pair of phrase the great Mary Kissel from --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's good.  Maybe she's watching and mama Kissel might be  watching.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly, so, President Trump went through those areas of we can  help solve problems.  North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the  coming arms race.  They do not share our interest in any way, shape or form  in any of those areas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not a zip code --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Zero zip, not a (INAUDBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly, we'll take a break.  When we come back, crypto  crackdown has assort of regulation is impacting Bitcoin and all the other  digital currencies.</p><p>Then Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, he says Bitcoin is going to be the world's  single currency in the next decade.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We have breaking (AUDIO GAP) President Trump  just Tweeted this.  Here's what he says, Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act  like a tough guy.  Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and  yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault.  He  doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.   Don't threaten people Joe.  Hey, it is a little weird that Joe Biden is out  there he's saying it again, I would have taken him behind the schoolyard  and beating him up, I mean, really.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  This is like a south park cartoon. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's hilarious.  Crazy Joe Biden.  All right, so, the President  says he can take him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Washington, I'm sorry would be a whole heck of a lot more  interesting if Joe Biden wasn't so fair. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  This is a 20-20 preview, get ready for some exciting debates next  time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is pay per view, pay-per-view.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Pay-per-view, all right, we going to keep talking about that.   Meanwhile, interest rates on the rise, we know what happened yesterday.   Federal Reserve announcing it will raise rates.  Jay Powell's first meeting  as Chairman, here's what he said:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAY POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  As you already know, we decided  today to raise the target rate for the federal funds rate by one quarter  percent point bringing it to 1.5 to one and three-quarter percent.  This  decision marks another step in the on-going process of gradually scaling  back monetary policy accommodation, a process that has been underway for  several years now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, one and three quarter's percent.  Markets raised the  gains following the decision we are looking at another day of decline this  morning.  Futures indicating the Dow will open down 150 points.  Joining me  right now, Federated Investors Portfolio Manager, Steven Chiavarone, good  to see you, Steven.  </p><p>STEVEN CHIAVARONE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FEDERATED INVESTORS:  Good morning,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>CHIAVARONE:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you fully invested?</p><p>CHIAVARONE:  We absolutely are.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you were expecting the rate hikes?</p><p>CHIAVARONE:  Look, we thought the number was kind the right down the trail  way.  The Fed's trying to refill their quivered arrows.  Normally, you  can't rates 500 basis points in a recession.  They want to get as much in  terms of rate hikes as they can, but they're trying to go in the phase  that's measured so they don't cut thing off too soon.  They kept three rate  hikes this year, they added one for next year.  And I think the most  important thing, was they forecasted that inflation rate above two percent,  which tells us they're comfortable that this thing run a little hot 19 and  20.  That's savage.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And when markets sold off yesterday, on this.</p><p>CHIAVARONE:  Our thought is that, people weren't necessarily expecting to  move from two hikes to three and 19.  They're trying to understand that.   Look, if people want to give us their shares at the discount on this news,  we'll take them.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  We talked an agreement a little bit so maybe it's the audience  could benefit.  The thing that freak the market out most recently in a big  way was fears of inflation.  They had an earnings report yesterday that  sort of hints about inflation but the supply to ends yet.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rates in Syria, their costs are going up.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes, and they talk about 20 year high in transportation cost,  cost in a supply chain, sanctions tariffs, what's your thought on the  inflation and what that could do to the market?</p><p>CHIAVARONE:  Yes, we think inflations going to build, I mean, it should  build.  We've got a lot stimulates in the system, we've got wager shortages  in certain areas.  But there's also a lot of countervailing trends, right.   You've got the Amazon effect, the Uber effect, you've got things like the  substitution of machines for people.  And wage inflation builds slowly.  We  were talking in the green room, you get your raise in the beginning of the  year, you can't go back three months later and ask your boss for another.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CHIAVARONE:  You've got to go to the next cycle.  So, it takes a while for  that to build.  And every day that a boomer retires, their retiring it a  higher wage when a millennial enters. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.</p><p>CHIAVARONE:  And that holds it back (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Wondering how you look at trade.  Is this a big risk?  Is that a  small risk, do you see President Trump eventually getting lower tariffs out  of other countries or is this a problem that you see as a downside versus  the tax cuts?</p><p>CHIAVARONE:  Look, a tariff is a tax.  Which is another word for tax.   Right now, we're dealing with a series of benefits from tax reform and  repatriation and even the spending bill in the short run that measures in  the trillions.  And we're talking about tariffs that measure in the  billions.  So, the balance is positive.  That said, we're going to see what  we come up with today.  If you hit the Chinese on intellectual property,  that's at the core of their economy, we'll see how they react.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're getting question, what do you do that they steal our  intellectual property?  Is that right?  I mean, this is -- everybody get  back.</p><p>CHIAVARONE:  And I think, the President is trying to force a better deal.   And he's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's negotiating point.</p><p>CHIAVARONE:  So many administrations have gone and try to get a better deal  and got a cigar put out in their forehead.  He's trying to come with a  stick, we'll see if it works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steven, great to see you.  Thank you so much for your good  point.

Time for  tariffs, President Trump set to unveil his trade plan targeting Chinese  imports today, around noon time, U.S. trade Representative Robert  Lighthizer, explaining why intellectual property is at the core of this  action.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, TRADE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES:  We have a  very serious problem of losing our intellectual property which is really  the biggest single advantage of the American economy.  We are losing that  to China, in ways that are not reflective of the underlying economics.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Straight ahead, I'm speaking with Peter Navarro, White House  National Trade Council President.  Stay with us for that.  Fears of a trade  war sparking worries on Wall Street, meanwhile, markets looking at another  down day, Futures indicating a decline of 150 points this morning on the  Dow, down 70 points on the NASDAQ that is one percent, this after modest  losses across the board, yesterday, stocks erased gains when the Federal  Reserve announced it is raising rates by a quarter of a point, as everybody  expected.  </p><p>Global markets this morning, take a look at European indices right now,  declines across the board.

U.S. Trade Representative  Robert Lighthizer says the move aims to curb the theft on American  technology.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LIGHTHIZER:  Our view is that we have a very serious problem of losing our  intellectual property which is really the biggest single advantage of the  American economy and we are losing it to China in ways that are not  reflective of the underlying economics.  The remedies, in my judgment, at  least, would be one, doing something on the tariff front, and two, doing  something on the investment front.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the White House National Trade Council  Director Peter Navarro.  Peter, it's good to see you this morning, welcome.  </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  Hey, good  morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the President's going to announce this today at noontime.   Now, we know that in China, there are restrictions in terms of investing in  China.  Does the President want see a reciprocal situation here in terms of  investing in U.S. companies?  NAVARRO:  No, I mean, the big picture here, is that in December, the  National Security Strategy, this government recognize for the first time  that China is a strategic competitor, engage in economic aggression against  the U.S and some of the worst kinds of aggression is Ambassador Lighthizer  said in that clip, is how they, basically, force American companies to  transfer their technology in exchange for market access, even as they're  stealing our intellectual property through things like cyber-theft and  traditional espionage.  So, what the President wants to do is to have the  Chinese stop doing that stuff.  </p><p>And we're going to see today, in the Oval or the Roosevelt Room, is a  package, as Ambassador Lighthizer indicated that will likely contain  tariffs which are designed, basically, as a compensatory mechanism to,  basically, get back the damages that China is causing to our economy and  investment restrictions, basically, to prevent the Chinese as a matter of  their own industrial policy and strategy from coming into America and  robbing us of our seed corn, the technology we need for the future.  So,  this is a courageous day for the President, a visionary day and promises  made, promises kept, which my favorite President likes to do.  And this is  a big one he made on the campaign trail.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, we've got a $375 billion deficit with China.  What's the  goal here?  Does the President want to get that number lower?</p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, the tariff package, I don't want to steal the thunder of  the President today, but the tariff package will be designed to lower that  deficit and also compensate us for the tremendous harm that China does by  taking our intellectual property.  But, don't -- the investment  restrictions are every bit as important.  We have, trillions of dollars of  state finance money coming into America, plucking the best over the best in  Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, in terms of high-tech and these are these  kinds of things that threaten our future.  </p><p>If we allow China to, basically, capture the energy -- the industry of the  future.  We won't have a future, so that is what this is about.  And it's a  historic day, this is a fundamental shift in American policy towards China  after, literally, decades of economic dialogue.  And you know, talk is not  cheap with the Chinese.  It's actually been very expensive been because  while we've been talking with them 2003.  They've been robbing our  technology, blind.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but what about the fact that we know that there's going to  be something that will be a retaliatory move.  I mean, there's this growing  concern that any tariffs will stoke China to do something back and create a  global trade war.  The Wall Street Journal is reporting.  Beijing is ready  to respond with tariffs targeting President Trump support against us  farmers.  Is there a plan in place to mitigate the retaliatory measures  that are coming?</p><p>NAVARRO:  Sure.  I mean, there are a couple things to say.  First of all,  this policy on behalf of the President that has been developed is literally  a whole of government approach.  We've had hundreds of people working on  this for many months, looking at the strategy, the contingencies, but, you  know, this talk like this, I think  and contingencies but, you know, this  talk like this, I think is irresponsible in some sense because if you look  at the chessboard, I think it is clear that all we want is to defend  ourselves against economic aggression and I see this as bullish for  corporate America.  </p><p>I mean, look at the typical company that had goes over to China.  They want  to get access to that market.  This is the biggest growing, fastest-growing  market in the world.  You want to get access to that for some term profits.   But in exchange for that, they have to surrender their long growth.  They  surrendered their technology to a Chines competitor and within three to  five years that competitors, basically, knocking them out of the market.  </p><p>So, just, you know, from a bottom line, stock market perspective, long term  profits are going to be a lot better for American companies under this kind  of policy.  The second that you say, Maria, look, China's doing a lot  better with this trade relationship than we are.  It's $370 billion trade  surplus in goods that they ran with this, every year.  So I don't see them  wanting to jeopardize that.  They know -- they know what they've been doing  and taking from us and actually, they're probably surprised that, finally,  a President is willing to stand up for the American people and for American  companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Maybe, but isn't this going to result in higher prices for  consumers?  I mean, let's talk about the impact on the economy and on  people, because one of the beauties of having this cheap stuff coming from  China, is it ends up being really affordable for American consumers.  How  significant will we see prices go up?</p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, I think that's a false narrative in a lot of ways, what's  going to happen here is modest. minimal kinds of price effects if at all.   What we've seen, for example, with the solar and washing machine tariffs,  is not rising prices.  What we've seen is a flood of new investment into  this country creating American jobs.  </p><p>And remember, since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001,  their economy has grown from $1 trillion-$12 trillion, that's an 800  percent growth rate.  It's phenomenal but it's been on the backs of the  American people, the American workers.  We went through 15 years of  stagnant wages, slow growth and now, we have a president in President  Trump, who has during the first year in office, had the most remarkable  year of the economy of any president, in any recent memory going back a  very long time.    BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAVARRO:  So, I see nothing but bullish signs on the horizon.  I see higher  wages, strong economic growth, and this kind of policy, Maria, is  absolutely fundamental to our future.  We should make no mistake about  that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We should point out that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve J.  Powell, was asked about it yesterday.  And he too, is not expecting an  impact on the economy.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL:  A number of participants in the FOMC did bring up the issue on  tariffs, and if I could summarize what came out of that, it was first that  there's no thought, I think, that changes in trade policy should have any  effect on the current outlook.  Second thing is, I would say, is that a  number of participants reported in about their conversations with business  leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a  concern going forward.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So that was -- that was a good comment in terms of  no impact in the economy.  Peter, we got to take your take, though, on the  aluminum and steel tariffs, as well, they're going to go into effect, what,  Friday?  How many exemptions will we see?  Will Europe be exempt?</p><p>NAVARRO:  So, there will be an announcement this afternoon, I don't want  to, again, pre-empt Ambassador Lighthizer, Secretary Ross or the President.   Let me just say this, the proposal that's going to come out today in terms  of implementation, will have absolutely strong for the goal of protecting  our aluminum and steel industries from this flood of imports, so we're  going to have a system --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but people are worried about 25 percent tariff retaliation  from Europe, that's the issue here, Peter.</p><p>NAVARRO:  Well, again, Maria, this kind of talk, I think, doesn't serve  anybody.  If you look at the chessboard, OK, let's take Europe, they run  $150 billion a year surplus in manufactured goods with this country.  At  6,000 jobs we lose for every billion dollars a deficit that we create with  Europe, that over 1 million jobs that are created over in Europe, Belgium,  Germany, where ever, instead of right here in America.  </p><p>Now, if they want to jeopardize that, that wouldn't be a rational act.  So,  we can expect some chest thumping, I would assume, for politics.  But at  the end of the day, President Trump has said this repeatedly, every country  in the world ripping us off with these -- with these high trade surpluses.   All we want -- all we want, Maria, is fair and reciprocal trade, and I  think the American people deserve that and they finally have a president  who's going to give that to them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and real quick, before you go, Peter, I know you were  there in the room when the President Trump was talking with the Crown  Prince in Saudi -- from Saudi, yesterday.  Big deal in terms of arm sails  that the U.S. is selling to the Saudis.</p><p>NAVARRO:  Yes, that was a great day and i love watching the President with  lord leaders.  He's just so smart and the friendship between the Crown  Prince and the President is just so visible.  But at the end of the day,  that Saudi deal is over 40,000 jobs America.  And they're high-paying good  manufacturing jobs.  And guess what, when Saudi Arabia buys a weapon system  to defend themselves, that means fewer soldiers of America in harm's way.   It means more jobs in America and it means we strengthen our defense  industrial base, which what's I do at the White House, every day, trying to  make that happen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter, good to see you Sir, thanks so much.</p><p>NAVARRO:  Take care, Maria.</p><p>NAVARRO:  Peter Navarro.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news this morning: President Trump just  tweeted this, \"Remember when they were saying during the campaign that  Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowd but he is  spending much less money and not using social media as well as crooked  Hillary's large and highly sophisticated staff?  Well, not saying that  anymore.\"  The president obviously referring to what's happening at  Facebook.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll just add that the problem that we're hearing about  Facebook, at Cambridge Analytica issue, all of this happened 2014-15.  So,  Facebook ended the policy; the policy that was used by the Barack Obama  campaign, 2012, that was all over -- that was essentially ended, and there  was an abuse of the data and Facebook essentially didn't do anything about  it, and now they're embarrassed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  They didn't do anything about it, because I guess they  wanted it, they wanted to help President Obama.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can't believe it.  You're abusing people's data.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We got the use of this.  We got stunning dashcam footage -- we  want to show you; it shows the deadly collapse of a pedestrian bridge last  week at Florida International University.  Lauren Simonetti with all the  details right now, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hey, Maria, the video is posted on YouTube.  It captures the  moment the bridge crashes to the ground, crushing cars below and killing  six people.  It was a new bridge.  It was installed March 10th, five days  before it collapsed, still investigating the cause of the collapse.   However, but, many fatalities -- the sad story and that is new video.  </p><p>Well, Meredith Corporation plans to lay off 1000 people at Time Inc. all  part of the company's effort to save up to $5 million in the next two  years.  Meredith also considering selling some magazines, talking a look at  shares of the company, they're down 20 percent this year.  </p><p>And check out what the folks at MIT have been doing underwater.  They've  built a robot fish, Sophie, that could be used to study real fish and other  creatures of the deep.  These robots are so sophisticated, Maria, that they  can swim with schools of real fish in open water for up 40 minutes, and  they're being used to explore the parts of the ocean we've never seen  before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is incredible.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really cool stuff.  Thanks, Lauren.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PETER THIEL, CO-FOUNDER, PAYPAL:  I'm not exactly sure what I would  encourage people to run out right now and buy these cryptocurrencies, but  the technology that people like to talk about is the block chain  technology.  I'm somewhat skeptical about how well that translates into  good investments.  I would be sort of long Bitcoin and neutral to skeptical  of just about everything else at this point.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was the Co-Founder of PayPal, Peter Thiel, speaking to me  about blockchain and Bitcoin in an exclusive interview last night.  Twitter  CEO, Jack Dorsey, also said, he sees incredible promise in Bitcoin.  Dorsey  saying that -- here's what he told the Times of London: \"The world  ultimately will have a single currency.  The Internet will have a single  currency, I personally believe that it will be Bitcoin.\"  Joining us right  now to weight in on that is Overstock.com CEO, Patrick Byrne.  And Patrick,  obviously, you've been on the show a lot and talked about the wonder of  Bitcoin.  OK, we're going to get to this -- but that's the first time that  I ever heard anybody say they don't trust blockchain but they trust Bitcoin  -- Peter Thiel.</p><p>PATRICK BYRNE, CEO, OVERSTOCK.COM:  Peter Thiel, interesting.  He's  normally a very smart guy -- Peter Thiel.  I didn't think that was the  smartest comment he's made, but he made me think, I mean, I haven't, which  it wouldn't be the first time.  I think the blockchain, the underlying  blockchain, the technology has this unbelievable promise to reshape  civilization.  I think Bitcoin is something that may happen or may not  happen, whatever.  But so, I think, the main event of this all is  blockchain.  It's very curious to me that he said that.  I wonder -- I'm  going to look that up and try to understand what he means.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've been using Bitcoin, and you believe it is going to be  used more --  </p><p>BYRNE:  Well, to me, the main event of Bitcoin is not Bitcoin, it's the  underlying ledger technology, which is called blockchain. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is blockchain.</p><p>BYRNE:  And it's this -- it's like you have a ledger like your granddad ran  his hardware store out of it; it's cryptographically protected and it's a  magic ledger, it's immutable, and sort of had all these magic properties,  there are all these things you can do with it.  So, that blockchain is  what's really going to change the world.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  I think it does have some magic potential, but I wonder how  many people are actually using that magic right? </p><p>BYRNE:  Oh, we are in the very early stages of adoption.  We're introducing  a blockchain version of Wall Street called tZero.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, let's talk about why you have the hat today?  Because this  craze in exchange commission is cracking down the cryptocurrency.  This  increase scrutiny is impacting -- is this impacting your plan for the coin  offering? </p><p>BYRNE:  They have sent us a letter about this.  I understand I have a  meeting on my calendar next week with some ladies and gentlemen from the  SEC and I'm sure we'll have a -- I'll have a report afterwards, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to wear the hat to the meeting?  </p><p>BYRNE:  I think.  Well, I think they wouldn't expect anything less other  than my malice jacket that I wear on this show with you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  By the way, men shouldn't wear hats indoors.  That's just a  general rule.  Air on the side of that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  There's nothing else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it also might ruin your beautiful hair.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, thank you.  You wouldn't have had it at the SEC.  </p><p>BYRNE:  But I actually think this is quite legitimate, I think that is  actually overdue.  I was wondering last year, kind of, where they were,  it's been kind of surprising, they bet how slow they've been to react to.   Last year, there was this explosion of something called the ICO -- Initial  Coin Offerings -- billions and billions was raised.  It sure looked to me  like it was way outside the law, and I'm kind of surprised the SEC took so  much time.  But finally, around July, they made one opinion: the Dow  decision where they started hinting it was outside the law, and then  nudging and nudging.  Now, a week or two ago, the SEC chairman came out and  said, all that stuff is, you know, (INAUDIBLE) treated securities.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  OK.  So, if you buy the security, what exactly are you buying?   What do you have ownership in?  </p><p>BYRNE:  Well, if you buy a token, if you buy a security token, just like a  share of stock, but when you -- it's a slice of the company.  It's a piece  of the company.  If you buy a security token, the big coin explosion, we're  talking about last year initial coin offerings, most of them were things  called utility tokens, utility coins.  Now, it was as far as I could tell - - a real way to pretzel around the federal regulations regarding the  offering of securities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Patrick, are you going to sell the business stock moves on this  speculation?  </p><p>BYRNE:  Well, everybody seems to know what the stock; they know what the  stock moves on.  If we are in discussions, and I think I have a shock  collar tides under my collar if I say the wrong thing.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Futures indicating  a decline of about 200 points at the start of trading this morning.  Stocks  settled lower yesterday and that momentum is continuing in a big way this  morning.  The Nasdaq is down 80 points right now.</p><p>The Federal Reserve, of course, raised interest rates yesterday for first  time this year under new Chairman Jay Powell.

Great to see you.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Good to be here -- thanks.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So much on the table to talk about.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  There's a ton and we've got the China  sanctions release later today.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, we've got restrictions on investment as well as  tariffs.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, it's both ways, right.  It's trade tariffs and perhaps  prohibitions on their investment in the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Fed raised interest rates yesterday -- no big deal, I  mean 1.75 percent.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  And the Fed thinks the economy can grow faster and they finally  realized that there are people in the economy who can come in to the labor  market.  So these are good things.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  At the same time those smart gentlemen  and ladies down in D.C. are spending that much more money, driving up the  deficit that much more in the face of higher interest rates -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and a Fed that's winding down its balance sheet and will not  stand at the ready to buy the debt that the federal government will be  trying to sell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That's right.  </p><p>We'll coming up this morning, we've got all that on the table.  Senate  Finance Committee chairman, Orrin Hatch.  We'll talk about that coming up.   Also, former presidential candidate, Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee is  here.  Former presidential candidate Herman Cain is joining us.  And the  host of \"VARNEY AND COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighing in as well.</p><p>All that coming up this morning.</p><p>But first, House Republicans have finally unveiled their whopping $1.3  trillion spending bill ahead of the looming government shutdown.  President  Trump endorsed the bill last night.  He tweeted this, \"That $1.6 billion to  start wall on southern border, rest will be forthcoming.  Most importantly  got $700 billion to rebuild our military; $716 billion next year -- most  ever of; had to waste money on Democratic giveaways in order to take care  of military pay increase and new equipment.</p><p>The funding measure needs to make it through the House Rules Committee  before a floor vote.  Some conservative members in the chamber not happy  with this bill -- too much money.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  We continue to fund sanctuary  cities.  We continue to fund Planned Parenthood.  We don't build the wall  but yet we put money in for a tunnel.  The last time I checked, when the  President was campaigning, he wasn't campaigning for a tunnel between New  Jersey and New York.  But I'm not very optimistic that there will be  conservative wins in this.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Arkansas congressman House Budget  Committee chairman, Steve Womack.  Chairman Womack -- thanks so much for  joining us this morning.  </p><p>REP. STEVE WOMACK (R-AR), HOUSE BUDGET COMMITTEE:  Maria -- it's great to  be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that?  Planned Parenthood, sanctuary cities -- all  of this extra spending has us looking at trillion dollar deficits 10 years  out and beyond -- how do you justify that?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well look, let's first of all understand what we're doing in this  bill and again, this bill is not across the finish line yet but we went  into these negotiations with the express intent of primarily fixing our  military.</p><p>And in order to do that, like any other negotiation, understand that the  other side gets a vote in this thing.  We don't have 60 votes in the  Senate.  So in this four corners negotiation, when you've got members of  the Senate, the minority leader in the senate, the minority leader in the  House and the two majority leaders in the House and Senate on the  Republican side negotiating, they're going to get a vote.</p><p>So in order to beef up the Defense, there were certain things, other  concessions that had to be made and that's just what's going to happen in  negotiation.</p><p>It's a 2,000-page bill.  Members are still sorting through it.  We've got a  short time line that we're being asked to consider this thing, so there's a  lot of activity going on in the nation's capitol today with regard to this  omni-package.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, I understand the need to fund the military and we talk  about that all the time, given the fact that our aging fleet in the Navy  has 50 percent of the planes unable to even fly.  I get all of that.  We're  seeing accidents.</p><p>But did you need to go to that number?  Did you need that much in terms of  military?  Could you have scaled back a bit so that you weren't handcuffed  to put all of this other spending on domestic issues?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well, they wanted dollar for dollar -- Maria.  Remember, the  Democrats expected dollar for dollar and we didn't go dollar for dollar.</p><p>But we took our cues from the leadership in the Pentagon.  Secretary Mattis  was very emphatic as to the numbers that he needed to hit in order to be  able to meet the demands that are created by the threat that is expanding  around the globe.</p><p>And this is not the time for us to be taking a pass on taking care of our  men and women in uniform.  We've got fundamental issues in the Pentagon.   We've got inner (ph) strength (ph) problems.  We've got four structure  problems.  We've got acquisition program problems.</p><p>And we've got an expanding threat around the globe.  It was necessary for  us to take the steps that we've taken in this bill to beef up our military.</p><p>And now, when you do that, you have to make concessions on the other side  and while they didn't get dollar for dollar, there were things in that  bill, there are things in this bill that we'd prefer not to have to do.   But that's what happens when you sit down at the table and have to  negotiate the way we do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman, will you get enough votes for this massive bill?  </p><p>WOMACK:  To be determined.  I'm on the Whip team but I'm not aware of the  Whip count last night.  I know there will be a lot of undecided voters or  undecided members.  We have a 2,000-page bill to sort through.  We know  pretty much what's in it from a numbers perspective but what we don't know  are some of the other things that have been added onto this bill that are  unrelated to the spending provision.</p><p>So that's what members will be going through today to try to figure out  exactly what else is in the bill and whether they can muster, you know, the  votes necessary to be able to put it across the finish line.  We still have  to go through the rule process and there might be some concerns about  whether we can even pass the rule.  But sometime today we'll have that in  clarity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is there a plan to face off against trillion dollar  deficits?  When does that become a priority?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well look, part of what we've got to do in order to be able to fix  the fiscal glide path of this country, we've taken some steps already.  We  worked on the tax code by lowering tax rates.  We think that's part and  parcel to try to grow this economy because you're going to have to grow the  economy to be able to fix -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WOMACK:  -- the deficits and the debt as we know them today.</p><p>We've gone after a lot of the over-regulation that happened in the last  several years.  We're beginning to take steps to be able to rid the private  sector of a lot of this over-regulation.  But growing this economy has to  be a central focal point; a growth model is what's going to fix what ails  this country right now.  So cutting taxes is doing that, cutting  regulations.</p><p>And then we eventually are going to have to deal with the elephant in the  room and that is the mandatory side of spending, about 70 percent of  federal dollars go out to programs that are on auto pilot.  And I believe  you will see this Congress and the next Congress pivot quickly to doing  things that go right to the heart of what's driving the deficits and the  debt in this country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's what I'm saying.</p><p>WOMACK:  And that's on the mandatory side.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I'm saying, sir.  I mean at some point it has to  become a priority.  But now what I hear being talked about is not that, but  phase two of the tax cuts.</p><p>Here's Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy with me yesterday when I asked him  about that, the next step in tax reform.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  I want to see the  individuals made permanent.  But like any big bill when you go through it,  there are going to be other aspects that you didn't think about.  Let's see  where we need to go there.  Let's see how this bill has transferred and  changed the economy.</p><p>Is there places we missed?  Let's listen to the economy and let's go back  and analyze that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, Mr. Chairman?  What do you want to see in  terms of phase two in the tax cuts?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well, certainly we'd like to make the individual cuts permanent.   And there's no question about that.  I mean that's just part of giving  certainty to the economy and certainty to American households. </p><p>But it's still I think a bit early for us to be able to with clarity  understand exactly what this Tax Cut and Jobs Act proposal and law has  actually done.  I think it will take us for the rest of the year to figure  out exactly how it's going to impact businesses, impact families.</p><p>And so if there are tweaks that need to be made, we're all in about that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let ask you -- </p><p>WOMACK:  There was a tweak that we took care of yesterday or at least in  the announcement with the grain farmers.  So we're going to find out a  little bit more about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as we move through the  year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- I want to ask you about Facebook but before I  get to that, I want to read you Governor Mike Huckabee's tweet.  He's  tweeting that he's going to be on this program.  We're going to talk to him  in a few minutes after you.</p><p>He says \"I will be on @MariaBartiromo and will let loose on GOP for  collapsing and surrendering to Pelosi and Schumer on a disgusting spending  bill.  It's not a compromise, it's capitulation.  To borrow a phrase from  Nancy Reagan, \"Just say no\".  What do you want to say to Mike Huckabee?  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well look, Mike Huckabee's a great friend of mine.  I was a mayor  in the town of Arkansas when he was my governor.  He was my commander in  chief.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But he says the bill is disgusting.</p><p>WOMACK:  He can say it's disgusting.  And that's easy to say from the  outside looking in.  But as I said before, I believe strongly that we have  a mandate to provide for the security of this country.  And in order to be  able to get the gains that we did for the Pentagon and for the national  security apparatus, there were concessions that had to be made.</p><p>That's going to happen in any negotiation.  You can call it disgusting all  day long.  And there are things in this bill that I would prefer not to  have to vote for.  That's why we're sorting through it today to figure out  are there any other issues that have popped up in this bill that will make  it distasteful enough that we can't support it.</p><p>And look, we've got until tomorrow to fix it.  If not, we'll be looking at  a short-term CR and back to the negotiating table.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- what about Facebook and what we have seen.   These companies are more powerful than they ever have been.</p><p>Zuckerberg -- Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook broke his silence yesterday  on the data mining scandal that affected more than 50 million users in a  new interview.  He hinted of regulation and he said that he's willing to  testify.  Here's what he said, sir.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This was a major breach of trust and I'm  really sorry that this happened.  We need to make sure there aren't any  other Cambridge Analyticas out there, right; or folks who have improperly  accessed data.  So we're going to go now and investigate every app that has  access to a large amount of information.  </p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Will you testify before Congress?  </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  So the short answer is I'm happy to if it's the right thing to  do.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of legislation would you like to see or not see?   Tell me what you're thinking in terms of new regulation coming on  technology.  </p><p>WOMACK:  Well, as somebody who pushes back against a lot of federal  regulation because I think we he have a lot of it already, I think where it  concerns the privacy of people, particularly given Internet and the expanse  of the worldwide web and all of the potential problems associated with the  stealing of intellectual property and the stealing of personal identity --  those kinds of things, that Congress does have a role in this and Congress  must address at a minimum issues that protect the privacy of everyday  citizens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So in other words, we will see new regulation, you think?  </p><p>WOMACK:  I think you're going to see some regulation.  You're going to see  hearings here in Washington and you're obviously going to have a regulatory  response to it for sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  This from people who don't want to see big government but  there's clearly an issue here.  </p><p>WOMACK:  Yes.  But you have to understand that even though people push back  against regulations in general, that doesn't mean we're a no-regulation  type body.  We just feel like they've got to be smart regulations and I  think that Congress will get there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks very  much.</p><p>WOMACK:  Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching -- </p><p>WOMACK:  All the best.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- the developments today.  Chairman Womack there.</p><p>Still ahead -- stoking fears of a trade war, President Trump set to  announce up to $60 billion in stiff tariffs on Chinese imports and  restrictions on Chinese investments.  What White House Trade Council  director Peter Navarro had to say about the concerns of retaliation.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We're looking at markets right now.  Markets are expected to open down.   We're expecting a 200-point selloff right out of the gate this morning,  extending yesterday's losses after the Federal Reserve raised interest  rates yesterday by a quarter of a point.</p><p>Meanwhile the Trump administration set to announce punitive measures  against China today for the country's unfair trade practices.  We're  expecting tariffs as well as restrictions on investment.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details right now and headlines -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, we are -- Maria.</p><p>And these measures are expected to include those restrictions on China's  investments and pretty steep tariffs on Chinese goods.  China has been  accused of violating intellectual property rights, pressuring U.S.  companies to transfer our technology and our trade secrets.  The White  House National Trade Council director Peter Navarro -- on this show a bit  ago.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAVARRO:  It's an historic day.  This is a fundamental shift in American  policy towards China after literally decades of economic dialogue.  And you  know, talk is not cheap with the Chinese.  It's actually been very  expensive because while we've been talking with them since 2003, they've  been robbing our technology blind.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Beijing is expected to retaliate.  The \"Wall Street Journal\"  reporting that China is looking to impose tariffs on U.S. agricultural  exports like soybeans and hogs.  That would target the farm belt and a good  part of Donald Trump's base.</p><p>Massive recall of smoke detectors -- Kidde calling back about half a  million of them because a flaw can interfere with the device's ability to  detect smoke.  The recall includes Kidde dual sensor smoke detectors sold  at retailers including Home Depot, Wal-Mart as well as amazon.com.  If you  have one of these defective models, please contact Kidde for a free  replacement.</p><p>And shocking body camera footage shows the crucial moments.  An Ohio police  officer saved a choking baby.  The officers say they saw the baby's mother  stop her car in traffic as her two-month-old baby girl had milk clogging  her nose and mouth. </p><p>That's when the officer jumped into action.  He administered back thrusts  to eventually clear her airway.  The officer said being a dad of four  helped him know what to do and the baby girl is ok.  Liquidation sales at  Toys R Us, they are set to begin today at most of the company's 700  bankrupt stores.  Shoppers are looking for bargains.  They're being advised  to act fast because the popular toys are expected to sell out pretty  quickly.  The company is hoping inventory is cleared by June.  Toys R Us,  as you know, fell victim to competition from online retailers but also the  discount chains and the debt from a leveraged buyout years ago -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Lauren -- thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, an interest rate hike sending markets lower this morning.   Futures indicated down 200 points right now.  The aftermath from newly  appointed Fed chair Jay Powell's first policy meeting -- that and worries  over trade.</p><p>Then the best around, \"The Karate Kid\" dusts off his bandanna for a YouTube  original series with a preview of the new take on a classic series, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL RESERVE:  As you all would now We decided  today to raise the target rate for the federal funds rate by one quarter of  a percentage point, bring it to 1.75 percent.  This decision marks another  step in the ongoing process of gradually scaling back monetary policy  accommodation, a process that has been under way for several years now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell after the Fed's  move to raise interest rates yesterday, first move this year.  Markets  under pressure this morning on the heels of that after being weaker  yesterday as well; not a significant move yesterday but nonetheless on the  downside.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that Nuveen Asset Management chief  equity strategist, senior portfolio manager Bob Doll.  Bob -- good to see  you.  </p><p>BOB DOLL, CHIEF EQUITY STRATEGIST, NUVEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT:  Thank you --  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You were expecting an interest rate hike.  </p><p>DOLL:  Absolutely -- like everybody else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this market -- you're not a fan?  What?  </p><p>DOLL:  Neutral.  I think we're in a trading range.  We're going to flop  around here.  Maybe the high in 2875 in January and the low 2532 and the  correction -- that could be the measure we have for months to come.  We're  just going to bounce around.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  So if you're an investor and you're watching the show, you want  to be a little defensive in a market like this, what do you rotate into  right now?  </p><p>DOLL:  Higher quality.  Just make sure the companies you own have decent  balance sheets and have decent earnings and are not overly priced because  valuation matters as interest rates and inflation creep higher.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Bob -- the Fed was saying yesterday essentially that they think  the economy can grow a little more over the next year, a little faster than  they thought it could.  But they still have a very pessimistic long-term  view that we're kind of stuck in the new normal below 2 percent.  Do you  think they're wrong about that?  </p><p>DOLL:  I hope they're wrong about that.  And look, this tax bill doesn't  solve all our problems but for the first time the tax bill we got a couple  of months ago gives us a chance to get productivity moving.</p><p>We've been stuck at 1 percent productivity.  If we can get some intelligent  capital expenditures, which this bill promotes, we can get productivity  back toward 2 and then we have a higher growth rate than they're looking  at, in my opinion.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about headline risk and regulation risk?  Deregulation has  been a critical theme for this economy from the Trump administration over  the last more than a year.  But you see what's going on with Facebook, just  irresponsible management with really some systemic problems at that company  that investors are just noticing.</p><p>In a market like this which looks a little bit rich, are some stocks more  at risk of these kind of negative headlines?  </p><p>DOLL:  That's absolutely true.  We've been in an environment, thankfully,  where we haven't had to worry about regulation because there have been no  new ones and some of the old ones haven't been enforced, if you will.</p><p>But now we're in a position, Facebook is a good example, where we're going  to have to take a look.  And that will cast a bit of a gray cloud over  those kinds of companies and perhaps the market as a whole.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tech stocks?  </p><p>DOLL:  The big tech stocks that have grown like a weed and aren't domiciled  anywhere and don't pay taxes anywhere, this is a place where the government  is going to look.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you allocate capital then right now?  </p><p>DOLL:  So in my view you de-emphasize some of those stocks.  You can still  own tech but you own Mastercard and Visa and Cisco on the value side.  You  be a little more value-oriented in tech.</p><p>I think you still have to own some financials, Maria.  I wouldn't give up  on the consumer, selected places are still good as a result of the tax bill  we talked about.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you worried about trade?  </p><p>DOLL:  You have to be worried about trade.  When you put -- a tariff is a  tax.  Look, I'm -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DOLL:  -- period, period, period.</p><p>Now, I know we've got to find a way to go after China because they don't  play by the right rules.  Everybody sees that, even the free traders.  So  we've got to find out a way to do that.  So, you know, we started with a  tariff on steel and aluminum for everybody.</p><p>Wait a minute, Mexico and Canada, you're our friends.  We won't go there,  maybe not Europe.  Maybe this will get down to China.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's how I see it.  I talk about Facebook -- that  potential regulation.  I see these tariffs and now companies have to ask  for exemptions or even countries.  That's additional regulation.  You're  putting up hurdles and who does that hurt?  It hurts small business.  This  is something that President Trump knows.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, even those countries that will be exempt, there  will be quotas in place.  So you will say ok, Canada, you're exempt from  the tariffs but here's the amount of product we will take in terms of  imports.  There will be quotas instituted.  They don't want over-capacity.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And some of those countries are also talking about taxing those  tech companies in Europe as well.  So that's a headline that dovetails with  what Dagen had to say.  I agree with that.  So that's a little -- another  little gray cloud over there that we didn't have before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bob -- great to see you.</p><p>DOLL:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Bob Doll there.  </p><p>Coming up, new scrutiny over self-driving cars, the very latest as police  release a dash-cam video of that deadly crash involving one of Uber's  autonomous vehicles.</p><p>Then, behind the mask, comedian Jim Carrey showing his true colors with a  controversial painting believed to be White House press secretary Sarah  Huckabee Sanders.  Her father is with us, former Arkansas Governor Mike  Huckabee will weigh in on an unflattering portrayal of his daughter.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back good Tuesday - - good Thursday morning to you  (inaudible).  Thanks for joining us everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it  is Thursday, March 22nd.  Your top stories right now at 7:30 a.m. on the  east coast.  Fears of a trade war sparking worries on Wall Street this  morning.  Ahead of the President's announcement on China tariffs and  restrictions to investment here in the U.S.  Futures indicating a decline  of almost 200 points this morning, down 3/4 of a percent.  </p><p>This after modest losses yesterday after the Federal Reserve raised  interest rates for the first time this year.  As you can see, yesterday's  close was down fractional across the board.  Markets across the globe  mixed.  FTSE 100 down 3/4 of a percent.  The CAC (inaudible) and the DAX  index goes down better than 1 percent.  We did have some manufacturing data  out.  The Flash Purchasing Management Index out of Europe and that is one  of the reasons that markets turned lower and the losses are accelerating  this morning.  </p><p>Also Japan Flash Manufacturing also under pressure.  Asia over night as you  can see also weaker although the NIKKEI average reported economic data came  out was up about 1 percent.  A new twist in the firing of Andrew McCabe.   Reports say that the former FBI Deputy Director authorized an investigation  into Attorney General Jeff Sessions for possible perjury.  Plus the  subpoena loans the House Judiciary Committee set to demand documents on the  Hilary Clinton email investigation as you hear her first.  We have the very  latest there.  New developments in the Uber self-driving crash  investigation.  Police releasing new video showing the moments just before  the collision. </p><p>And Jim Carrey not quite Picasso.  The actor turned painter under fire over  his portrait of a woman who looks very similar to White House Press  Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.  An unbelievable moment in Kosovo's  parliament.  The opposition party sets off tear gas to disrupt the vote.   Ralph Macchio is returning.  The original Karate Kid making his comeback in  a new YouTube series.  All that coming up this morning.  But first, the  aspired FBI official Andrew McCabe reported oversaw a Federal criminal  probe of Attorney General Jeff Sessions according to ABC News.  </p><p>McCabe reportedly authorized an investigation into whether the Attorney  General lacked candor during his Congressional testimony last year about  contact with Russian operatives.  Sessions long time personal lawyer  responded in a statement which reads, \"The Special Counsel's Office has  informed me that after interviewing the Attorney General and conducting an  additional investigation.  The Attorney General is not under investigation  for false statements or perjury in his confirmation hearing testimony and  related written submissions to Congress.\"  </p><p>Joining us now is former presidential candidate from Arkansas Governor Mike  Huckabee.  Governor Huckabee, I find this really rich.  I mean, you know,  here's a guy who basically in spying on Michael Flynn and then releasing  that to the press committed perjury right there.  And - - and that is a  felony for - - for what he did and he also lacked candor himself and  apparently he was investigating Sessions.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  There's a statement Maria, something about karma being, gee I  can't remember the rest of the phrase.  But I would say that it applies  here.  It's just remarkable.  I - - I think it's fine that he wanted to  take a look to see was Jeff Sessions dishonest.  But for all the people who  are just crying big crocodile tears because Andrew McCabe got fired, my  gosh get over it.  Andrew McCabe deserved to be fired according the Office  of Professional Responsibility.  It wasn't Donald Trump who fired him.  It  was his own FBI organization who said he had to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And why should he get a pension.  If he violated the basic  fundamental code of ethics that he supposedly clearly understood.</p><p>BARITROMO:  Yes.  I mean - - we - - we want to move on to the spending and  your tweet earlier.  But - - but I find it really incredible that there are  1.2 million documents that the House Oversight and House Judiciary  Committees have requested from the FBI and they've only sent 3,000  documents, 3,000 documents.  That's why they are subpoenaing those  documents this week.  But, how does that happen?  How do you blow off and  stonewall the committees that have jurisdiction over you for so long?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well that's part of the problem when there's so much power that  has been accumulated at the top of the FBI.  And I think everybody tries to  make the point, this isn't about the rank and file.  This isn't about the  organization but this is about the leadership and the corruption that has  so permeated that organization that they think they have the right to slow  walk getting documents over to the Oversight committee.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  That they are constitutionally required to be accountable for.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's absurd and I'm glad Bob Goodlatte is saying, here's a  subpoena.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Cough up - - cough up the stuff. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, by the way, Jason Chavitz tried that too and they - - they  - - he didn't get anywhere either.  He - - he - - remember when he  interrupted a meeting and said you are served.  But anyway, let me switch  gears because Arkansas Congressman and House Budget Committee Chairman  Steve Womack responded to your tweet.  Your tweet called out Republicans  about the Federal spending bill and you - - you called it a disgusting  bill.  Just say no to Pelosi.  Here's what he said earlier right here on  the program.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They needed to make concessions to pay for the military  governor.  </p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well look, Steve is a good friend and I love him.  He's a great  Congressman but I'm going to just say this.  Not one Republican in that  body got elected to fund Planned Parenthood, not fund the Border Wall, give  up for sanctuary cities, trash the 2nd Amendment.  They were elected to go  and do a job that stopped that kind of funding but it did fund the  military.  So lay it on the table and tell the Democrats.  We're going to  fund the military but we're not going to fund some of your pet projects and  you can either be the ones that keep us from having a strong military or  you can join us.  And if you think that we're wrong than you go get elected  to the majorities.  </p><p>These guys have got to start learning to play some hardball.  They have  surrendered to Schumer and Pelosi and to a minority, and there is just no  excuse for just giving up this quickly.  And if the government has to  shutdown in order to push that point, then maybe that's what has to happen  and lay it around the necks of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and Democrats  who think that killing unborn children is more important than being able to  preserve the boarders and the security of the United States of America.   That's what's at stake and it's time for them to stand up and do what they  sent them there to do and if they can't, get some more people and let them  have a shot at it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Governor, Mitch Roschelle.  One of the things when I talk to  business leaders I hear a lot of this fear about the mid-term elections and  how that could shift policy for the balance of this Administration's first  term.  How could this budget issue play out in the mid-terms and be used as  sort of fodder for beating up some Republican candidates?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  I - - I'll be very blunt.  If the Republicans surrender on this  bill and spend that kind of money on stuff that Republicans find immoral  and just absolutely unacceptable, then Republicans will lose.  They will  deserve to lose.  We're going to have a lousy government under Democrats  when Pelosi goes back in as Speaker.  But it won't be the fault of the  President and it won't be the fault of rank and file Republicans.  It will  be the fault of this Congress for not having the courage to stand up to  these guys and say, we got elected.  Why don't they just say what Obama  did.  Elections have consequences and roll that tape over and over and over  again.  Because I'll guarantee you the Democrats certainly didn't  compromise with Republicans when they had the whole show.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Governor, you make some good points on policies that Washington  shouldn't be funding.  But isn't the big problem here also the overall  level of spending?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Of course it is.  Yes, James it is.  And I think that's another  issue that Republicans went to Congress to cut this runaway spending.  The  - - the - - scenarios where Republicans are willing to spend.  We're  willing to spend to build a border wall, willing to fund the military but  we're not willing to just say let's have a grab bag and everybody gets to  throw in what they want.  $1.3 trillion is - - is way beyond what is should  be and the Republicans act like they don't have a choice.  </p><p>And they're wringing their hands and they're sweating blood.  Well it's  time for them to stand up and say, nope.  Again, we got elected - - we got  elected to do some specific things, here are the specific things and if you  don't want to vote for it we're going to tell the whole country that you  thought that killing unborn babies and running up a huge deficit was more  important to you than making sure that we had security and border  protection.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Governor, let me switch gears, ask you about this crazy photo.   Look, I know that as a father you're incredibly proud of Sarah, your  daughter.  She has to deal with constant everyday pushback from skeptics.   Jim Carrey painted this.  He - - the black lash is incredible after posting  this photo.  It's believed to be Sarah - - Sarah Huckabee Sanders, your  daughter.  Last week he tweeted out this picture with a caption that reads,  this is the portrait of a so-called Christian who's only purpose in life is  to lie for the wicked monstrous.  So, the actor has drawn pictures  criticizing President Trump as well.  What do you say governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well first of all I think as far as his political leanings,  we're going to just mark him down as undecided.  He just hasn't been that  clear where he stands. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  But if he wants to paint some ridiculous looking cartoons,  that's what political cartoonists do.  That's one thing.  I - - I'm not as  so much offended by that.  I think it's unfair and unflattering but my  daughter's a beautiful person inside and out.  Here's what I find and take  offense to.  It is the fact that he calls her a so-called Christian and  accusing her of lies without listing what those lies are.  And - - and to  question someone's faith, you don't hear him talk about a so-called Muslim  or a so-called Jew or a so-called Buddhist.  I think it's just something  that the left takes in vogue as to be able to attack people of the  Christian faith and somehow believe that they become judge and jury as if  they are the Father, Son and Holy Ghost when it comes to determining the  authenticity of a person's faith.  That's what I find most offensive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So rude, offensive.  You're right.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  He doesn't know her faith.  That's offensive. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And - - now I'll just add one thing.  These people on the left,  these spew.  They spew hate at me all day long.  If they spent a little  more time trying to get HRC elected, they wouldn't be so doggone angry.   Again, it's asymmetric rage.  Angry at something, angry at something in a  way that doesn't even make any sense.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's all - - that's all they do is shame people and name  call.  It's - - it's - - it's not even a fair fight.  It's - - it's nothing  of substance.  It's just name calling, painting a picture of someone. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  To be fair though, people - - ardent Trump supporters who are  100 percent on board with everything the President does like tariffs.  I've  gotten as much hate from Trump supporters when I talk about tariffs being a  tax.  So I think everybody needs to check their soul.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The governor's daughter is earning all the right enemies here. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Well said.  Sometimes you're known by your friends.  Sometimes  you're known by your enemies  And I think, you know, if - - if those are  her enemies than she's in very good shape.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  Governor, good to see you sir.  Thanks so  much.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thanks a bunch.  Good to be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Huckabee there.  Coming up a vote takes a violent turn in  Kosovo.  Look at this, the chaos after a tear gas grenade is set off in the  middle of the tense debate.</p><p>Welcome back.  Police releasing a disturbing video from last Sunday's  accident when an Uber self driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in  Tempe - - in Tempe, Arizona.  Lauren Simonetti with the details.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hello Maria.  This is video we want to warn you that is pretty  tough to watch.  It shows the safety driver, the minder not looking at the  road in the final moments before he hit - - hit a 49 year old Elaine  Herzberg.  This is believed to be the first fatal crash that involves the  self-driving vehicle and a pedestrian.  Uber has suspended testing of it's  self-driving vehicles.  Toyota has also halted it's tests on - - on public  roads.  But it begs the question, if you're minding the vehicle, do you  have to pay attention at all times even though it's autonomous?  </p><p>All right, take a look at this one.  Some opposition lawmakers in Kosovo  firing tear gas in the parliament chamber.  They wanted to block a vote on  a border deal with Montenegro.  Despite this attack, the - - the measure  was approved in an 80 to 11 vote.  The border deal is set as a pre- condition by the European Union for Kosovo citizens to travel within it's  visa free zone.  So that's what some opposition leaders did there.  And  let's have - - let's lighten if up.  Thirty-four years since Daniel LaRusso  learned to wax on, wax off and his rivalry with Johnny Lawrence lives on in  the YouTube Red series Cobra Kai.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  This is my childhood.

Come on. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I knew you were going to say that. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, bidding like it is 1999.  Your chance to buy a piece  of Prince and other music legends.  A first hand look at the iconic items  hitting the auction block next.</p><p>From Michael Jackson to Elvis Presley and Prince, iconic celebrity items  are coming to the auction block this weekend at GWS Auctions, Legends of  Hollywood and Music Auction.  We have some of the big items right here on  set.  And here joining me to tell us all about it is - - is Brigitte Kruse.   She is owner and chief auctioneer of GWS Auction in Los Angeles.  Brigitte,  good to see you.</p><p>KRUSE:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.  I love that you - - that you  brought all this stuff.  We're going to go through it.  How did you get  into this auction business?</p><p>KRUSE:  You know what?  It was a family business.  I'm actually 5th  generation so I don't think I had much choice to get into this business.   It's - - it's a labor of love.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, you must love it.  Because you've got all of  these beautiful things and you - - what - - what moves the price in terms  of some of these items?</p><p>KRUSE:  That is a great question.  It's mostly trends, what's popular,  what's not.  You know, you just kind of have to follow it.  It changes from  time to time.  And then there's things, there's certain asset categories  that just are timeless and always are popular.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes they sure are.  So let's start with the Prince.  The purple  overcoat used by the late Prince during the filming of \"Purple Rain\".  Tell  us about this item. </p><p>KRUSE:  This piece actually came from the daughter-in-law of one of the set  designers from \"Purple Rain\".  And with it being such an iconic film for  that time, you know, I believe it grossed over $80 million in 1984 which  was unheard of.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>KRUSE:  So, you know, with the lace detail and little pearl inserts, it's  just a lovely piece.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KRUSE:  We're really excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think this will go for?</p><p>KRUSE:  You know what, we're predicting somewhere conservatively in the  $3,500 to $5,000 range.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  OK.  And - - and when people buy these items, they do  it to collect and put them somewhere where they will just save them and  cherish them and make sure that the value stays.  You're not going to like  wear it.</p><p>KRUSE:  Definitely.  And that's something that we do that's just a little  bit different.  We actually make sure that these pieces are perfect by the  time they get to the bidder's hands.  So if we have a successful bidder, we  want to make sure that they receive the most pristine asset possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's look at this one.  One of the rare left-handed version of  Michael Jackson's trademark glove.  Tell me about that one.</p><p>KRUSE:  So, this is what they consider the second generation Michael  Jackson glove.  There is the Bill Witten (ph) glove who is, you know, he is  infamous for helping Michael Jackson create the first generation.  And this  is the Michael Bush-Dennis Tompkins era, which is kind of the second  generation glove.  So this was more during the time, right when he married  Lisa Marie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  And then the other one that we wanted to see, Michael  Jackson item is the fedora owned by the King of Pop.  Tell me about that  one.</p><p>KRUSE:  Oh yes.  He made an empire out of fedoras.  So - - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're both his?</p><p>KRUSE:  Yes.  They're both his.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Go ahead.</p><p>KRUSE:  And the neat story with these is there was a gentleman who made a  donation by way of an art piece to one of Michael Jackson's charitable  foundations.  And in - - in time he gave them three fedoras.  So these are  two of those three fedoras and they actually are - - they have great  providence.  They come with a letter of authenticity from MJJ Productions  which is as solid as it gets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So cool.  And this bid starts at $500.</p><p>KRUSE:  Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So let's go through this one, speaking of kings.   You have an Army book owned and autographed by Elvis Presley himself.  </p><p>KRUSE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>KRUSE:  This is one of my favorite items because at the time, in 1958 when  he went to Germany, a lot of people think that that was kind of a turning  point for his career.  Because they say that he never quite came back the  same.  But what makes this piece so special is this was when he met  Priscilla over in Germany when he was stationed there.  And this Army book  actually belonged to someone who served with him and he got so excited when  he saw him, will you please sign it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How fantastic.</p><p>KRUSE:  And it's - - it's never been offered at auction before.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where do you think that starts at?</p><p>KRUSE:  You know what, the bid is currently at $3,300 and I'm going to tell  you.  I am surprised by that.  So, you know, I think we might end up in the  $5,000 range by the time we have auction (inaudible).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's an interesting item.  That's - - that's history right  there. </p><p>KRUSE:  It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The blue fir smock worn by Lady Gaga on American Horror Story.   This is just fabulous.</p><p>KRUSE:  It is actually what we call a bi-lateral celebrity piece.  Because  it was also worn by Halle Barry in \"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\", the Frankie  Limon story. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>KRUSE:  So, this has got a really cool back story.  And this came from one  of our wardrobe houses in Hollywood.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So where - - where - - where - - why do you have it?  I mean,  after - - after those two celebrities wore it?</p><p>KRUSE:  A lot of these places have to do asset management.  You know, they  have to take care of these assets, get them in, get them out after they've  been used so many times.  So we were just fortunate enough to be the one in  line.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick.  The big pair of sunglasses owned by the late Steve  McQueen. </p><p>KRUSE:  Yes.  Oh my gosh, the Versoles (ph).  I mean, he was known for the  folding sunglasses.  So we're excited about those and the bid is already  over $5,000.  So - - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.  Brigitte, thank you.  The auction begins - - </p><p>KRUSE:  On Saturday, 10 a.m. Pacific. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be checking it out.  Thanks so much.    </p><p>KRUSE:  Thank you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Brigitte Kruse.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good Thursday morning,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is  Thursday, March 22nd.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  Apology status, Facebook CEO Zuckerberg finally speaking out over  the company's growing privacy scandal he called it a major breach of trust.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  This is a major breach of trust.  And I'm  really sorry that this happened.  You know, we have a basic responsibility  to protect people's data and if we can't do that then we don't deserve to  have the opportunity to serve people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The fallout for the technology sector as Zuckerberg says he is  willing to testify before Congress if necessary.  The race to avoid a  shutdown lawmakers reaching a tentative agreement on $1.3 trillion spending  bill to keep the government running, but do they have the votes?  The  latest as Congress scrambles to pass a bill before midnight tomorrow.   Concerns over trade, weighing on stocks this morning, futures down 200  points, this right here, this is the lows of the morning right here down  almost one percent.  The Bank of England is leaving rates unchanged right  now, we're getting that headline.  The NASDAQ is down 80 points.  </p><p>We're going to see a tough opening this morning after a weakness yesterday  on Federal Reserve's move to raise interest rates for the first time this  year under new chairman Jay Powell.  That was expected but markets traded  down anyway.  In Europe this morning breaking news, the Bank of England has  left interest rates unchange as you can see the markets are down across the  board.  </p><p>There is a weak purchasing managers' index earlier, the European Union  slashed PMIs came out.  They were weaker than expected.  That was the first  thing to really set the tone for weakness and now the Bank of England  coming out and leaving interest rates unchanged, that was as expected.  In  Asia overnight, mix performances, take a look.  The worst performer was  Hong Kong, Hang Seng down better than one percent.  In Japan, the Nikkei  was up about one percent.</p><p>Joe Biden on the attack, the former vice president has harsh words for  President Trump saying he would have beaten him up in high school.  The  strong response from our Commander-in-Chief this morning.  Ad then forget  the car.  Elon Musk can have -- can now charge anything he wants.  The  massive pay package.  Tesla's board just approved to the technology  pioneer. </p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC partner, Mitch  Roschelle, and the Wall Street Journal's assistant editorial page editor,  James Freeman.  Great to see you.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good show so far.  We got a lot on the table.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  The market is down and we've  heard it three times this morning in the show, tariffs are tax and that's  what the market -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have heard it three times, everybody says the same thing.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes.  So anybody who has already prewritten  hate tweets at me for thinking that, you can direct it right to Mitch  Roschelle.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Four of the other guests just said the same thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, by the way, the Wall Street Journal editorial board has  had an opinion on these -- on these tariffs, James Freeman.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I see a lot of downside here but I would say that the theft  of American technology is the business model of China, and so if you are  going to address the trade issue, that's the one.  I hope they focus on  that, I hope they can talk to Europeans out of this new tax on tech  revenues but that demands a response, I think first step you take the case  of the WTO. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are -- there are sectors, 10 sectors in China that are  deemed off limits to foreigners.  You can't even invest things like  defense, financial services.  Do you think we're going to see that kind of  reciprocal move when the president announces this at 12?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, certainly they're now threatening the Trump states, they  want to tax live hogs, soy beans, the agriculture products coming into  China.  I think -- I think it's a reasonable expectation when you start  this effort that there is going to be a response but in the case of China  stealing our technology, I think they have a better taste than they do when  they talk generally about trade deficits, which don't matter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Because everybody gets it, which one it does.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Right, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or when you -- or when you talk around the actual numbers and  talk about having a trade deficit with like Canada only if you -- if you  excluded services which there is service academy, they want to focus on the  goods.  The Trump administration has a problem that they treat like the  only decent job in this country is the manufacturing job.  There are a lot  of folks who voted for the president who don't work in manufacturing.  I  think that that's a problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We'll talk about that this morning.  Joining  the conversation is Utah Senator and Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch  with us this morning.  Former Republican presidential candidate, Herman  Cain is here and the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighs in as  well.  Big hour ahead, don't miss a moment of it.  We kick off right here  with this look at the White House agenda.  President Trump will announce  trade actions against China today.  Adam Shapiro is at White House live  with the details.  Good morning to you, Adam.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN REPORTER:  Good morning to you, Maria.  The President  expected to sign a memorandum to address Chinese economic aggression at  12:30 this afternoon.  Let's take a look at what's at stake here for both  sides.  U.S. exports to China more than $15 billion dollars in grain seeds  and fruit, aircraft Boeing and aircraft parts, $15 billion, electrical  machinery vehicles, you see the numbers there, 12 billion and 11 billion.  </p><p>Now we import from China, more than $129 billion worth of machinery as well  as furniture and bedding, $29 billion.  Toys, sports equipment, $24 billion  and footwear, $15 billion.  The Chinese are expected to outline potential  retaliation that would hit the ag sector specifically.  What's going on  here?  Well, USTR Lighthizer was testifying on Capitol Hill yesterday and  he was saying that we need to stop the economic aggression against the  United States, he is expected to give that same message today, when he  testifies before the Senate Finance Committee but here he is in his own  words.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  Our view is that we  have a very serious problem of losing our intellectual property which is  really the biggest single advantage of the American economy in my opinion.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Then there is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  Kevin Brady who was chairing the hearing yesterday by Lighthizer.  Here  Lighthizer, here is what he had to say about these tariffs.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R), TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  We  have to make sure we don't punish American families and workers for China's  misbehaviors.  Oftentimes indiscriminate tariffs are not the right  approach.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  Ad the Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has already responded to this  potential tariff and trade war.  He has said what I hope is that we can act  rationally rather than being led by emotions in order to avoid a trade war.   One last thing that's going to happen here at the White House after 2:00,  Maria, the President will meet with millennials with generation next to  listen to concerns about future.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will watch that.  Thank you, Adam.  Adam Shapiro  with the latest there.  We're also going to hear on the aluminum and steel  tariffs later as well in terms of these exemptions.  We're waiting on an  announcement of that as Peter Navarro suggested earlier.  Joining us right  now is former presidential candidate and Fox News Contributor Herman Cain.   Herman, it's good to see you, sir.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the new tariff and restrictions coming on  China? </p><p>CAIN:  The first thing I would suggest is everybody take a chill pill.   This is how you get the Chinese to the table.  We have been trying to play  nice and said, would you please come to the table so we can talk? Well,  when you impose the a tariff which I agree with others on your panel, it is  a tax, this is how you get them to the table, this is how you have serious  talks about leveling the playing field but take a chill pill, the sky is  not falling.  We don't all know what's going to happen but I think this is  an excellent tactic to get people to the table to talk. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It -- Herman, it's Dagen McDowell.  It all goes back to us being  in debt to the Chinese in terms of us as a nation needing them to continue  buying our debt.  And so, we can talk as much as we want but at the end of  the day, when you have Republicans and Democrats in Washington passing a  budget that's going to now send us into the territory of running $1  trillion deficits every year, you know what?  Our talk is cheap, our debt  more expensive.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me just before you answer that.  Let me just say that we  have news here, the House Freedom Caucus has now officially gone against  the spending bill.  So we got that.  They are now pushing back and saying  they will not vote for the spending bill.  Please go ahead, Herman.  </p><p>CAIN:  I agree with the Freedom Caucus.  I would vote against it also.   Secondly, since we are talking about the budget, if I were President Trump,  I would shut the government down if that's what it took, because here is  what will happen.  It will give us an opportunity even though we know the  media is going to lean one way to show what's wrong with that budget.  I  agree.  It is absolutely too much money the Republicans are giving in to  too much and I believe the only way for the American people to know how bad  some of the bad things in it is to shut the government down.  </p><p>Now, Dagen, you are exactly right.  With the Chinese (INAUDIBLE) money,  that gives them leverage.  With the Chinese having a major surplus coming  from the United States, we have a deficit that gives them leverage.  So  we've got to establish some leverage and in order to establish a leverage,  sometimes you have to take risk, and I believe that this administration is  taking some calculated risks in order to get them to the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Money talks and blah, blah, blah walks.  That's all I have to  say.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAIN:  Dagen, I'm agreeing with you.  OK?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I know but you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That was -- that was an exclamation point, Herman.  That's all.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Herman, James Freeman here at The Wall Street Journal, I want get  your thoughts on Joe Biden's approach to Donald Trump, potential 2020  rivals here.  Biden is talking about how he would have beaten up Mr. Trump  in high school.  He claims, you know, you watched the last presidential go  around where a lot of people couldn't figure out how to deal with Donald  Trump, didn't know how to respond.  Do you think Biden is on the right  track here? </p><p>CAIN:  It's not even worth talking about.  Let's talk about the stock  market.  Let's talk about the lowest unemployment rate in a long, long  time.  Let's talk about the regulatory rollback, let's talk about the fact  that this economy is booming, let's talk about the fact that in January, 16  percent more open jobs were there than a year ago.  See?  This is what I  call a shift to subject tactic on the part of the Democrats.  When they  have nothing to talk about, they shift the subject.  So what V.P. -- former  Vice President Biden wants to do is shift the subject to stuff that does  not matter.  And there will be no backyard brawl, and if it were, we know  who would win, it's not even worth discussing.  Let's talk about the  substance, that's where I come down.   </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, look, President Trump responded to Joe Biden's remarks by  a tweet this morning and here is what he says, Herman, crazy Joe Biden is  trying to act like a tough guy, actually he is weak, both mentally and  physically and yet threatens me.  For the second time with physical  assault, he does not know me but he would go down fast and hard, crying all  the way.  Don't threaten people, Joe.  So you know, the President is just  right there.  I mean, he is, you know, fighting back with a tweet.  What do  you think?</p><p>FREEMAN:  He's a counterpuncher.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's a counterpuncher.</p><p>CAIN:  He's a counterpuncher and I think that his tweet says it all in  terms of what would actually happen.  But we all know that is not going to  happen.  So this is why I'm saying, I don't even want to talk about it.   Here is what I want to talk about, you know, when I mentioned the 16,000,  16 percent more jobs, open jobs were created in January and only 2.3  percent of them were filled, why?  We have a skills gap.  So, Joe Biden,  talk about filling the skills hap.  OK? That's what we ought to be focusing  on, getting people ready for this robust economy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to add that make the suggestion that instead of one  of the Presidential debates in 2020, that we have like fisticuffs between  the two candidates.  And get all the money to charity.  </p><p>CAIN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Give it all -- if Joe Biden is a nominee give it all to cancer  research.  I guarantee he would do it.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  A pay-per-view of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Pay-per-view.  Exactly.  </p><p>CAIN:  Well, Dagen, the one thing, the ratings would be through the roof.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  </p><p>CAIN:  But the American people won't learn a theme.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Is there anything --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, you've got the leader of the free world in a, you know,  tweet storm with Joe Biden.  I mean, should the average guy or gal out  there say to themselves what -- let's talk about important things and why  am I watching this take place here?  Should we be worried about this kind  of behavior?</p><p>CAIN:  Well, I would agree, this is why I say it's not even worth  discussing at length which is why I try to move on to talk about substance.   I'm more concerned about this bad budget that they are about to pass  because the Republicans are scared to death that they are going to get  blamed for it.  And as I suggested, the president ought to veto it, so the  American people would have time to see all of the bad stuff in this budget.   I understand the process and this is why the Republicans are essentially  caving but the American people won't know all the bad stuff that go along  with the good stuff unless we shut it down for a while.  That's what I  would do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Thoughts?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Now, I was just going to say a congratulatory call to Vladimir  Putin as a little more disturbing than potential fisticuffs talked about on  Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Herman, good to see you, sir.</p><p>CAIN:  Protocol.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Herman Cain.  Coming up.  The Federal Reserve vote to raise  interest rates to break down investor reaction on the heels of Jay Powell's  first meeting as chairman of the Fed.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The Austin bomber leaves behind a detailed  recording of his deadly plan. Lauren Simonetti with all the details.   Lauren, good morning.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Authorities say they  found a trove of bomb materials and a recording in which Mark Antonio  Conditt confessed to his crime.  He also listed future targets, he was  intending to blow up before he was stopped.  Authorities say Coditt never  mentioned a motive. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN MANLEY, CHIEF, AUSTIN TEXAS POLICE DEPARTMENT:  I know everybody is  interested in a motive and understanding why and we are never going to be  able to put a ration behind these acts.  He does not at all mention  anything about terrorism nor does he mention anything about hate.  But  instead, it is the outcry of a very challenged young man.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Police say there is no further threat from Conditt but add that  the community should still remain vigilant.  </p><p>Well, millions of people right here in the northeast starting to dig out  from the fourth nor'easter in less than three weeks' time.  Just as spring  gets under way, the storm dumping more than a foot of snow in some parts of  the area knocking out power to tens of thousands.  Airports are canceling  over 5,000 flights yesterday, another 1600 today.  And I don't want to tell  you this but I guess I have to, a possible fifth nor'easter could arrive on  Sunday.</p><p>Well, Tesla shareholders approving a massive pay package for Elon Musk.   The package valued at $2.6 billion dollars to start but it could grow to  deliver more than $50 billion dollars to Musk.  Under the plan, Tesla's  market value needs to skyrocket to $650 billion over a decade.  Right now,  Tesla's value is about 54 billion.  And Musk has to stay on Tesla either as  a CEO or executive chairman and chief product officer in order to get the  payout.  Taking a look at Tesla shares up about 25 percent from a year ago.  </p><p>Finally, lovers of Taco Bell's mild and fire sauces have this to mull on.   They have announced that they're selling chips inspired by the popular hot  sauces.  Taco Bell tortilla chips are rolling out to grocery stories  starting in May.  I don't know, they could be really good.  Take a look at  shares of Yum! Brands, the parent company, they look pretty good too up  over 30 percent.  I'm not into too spicy though, so maybe dip in guacamole.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look good.  They do.  Thank you so much, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up.  A price hike to your breakfast, why consumers could  start paying up for cereals including Cheerios.  Lots about the cereals.   Plus, Dwight Howard dominates.  Details on the history-making performance  for the basketball player last night later this hour.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>Participants' projections of the appropriate path to the Federal funds rate  reflect our gradual approach.  The medium projection for the Federal funds  rate is 2.1 percent the end of this year.  2.9 percent end of 2019, and 3.4  percent the end of 2020.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell yesterday laying  out the goal for his rate increases through 2020.  Futures are edging  lower, actually we're looking at a decline of 200 points today, down almost  one percent on the Dow Industrials, following the meeting concerns on trade  also weighing on markets this morning.  Joining us now to weigh in is  Mainstay Capital Management founder, CEO, and chief investment strategist,  David Kudla.  David, good to see.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, CEO, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on markets.  Your take on the Fed and its impact  on markets?  </p><p>KUDLA:  Well, we -- yesterday, we -- I think we got what we expected.  We  got confirmation that the FOMC sees our economy as strong and strengthening  and, you know, the rate hike that we got was expected, we expected two or  three more this year.  What the news that maybe concerns some market  participants is more aggressive stance as we get into next year and the  year after.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  One of the things that I was expecting to hear more about is  the Fed's balance sheet and what they're going to do about that and what  the plan to unwind is and especially as investors have sort of chased  yields is the unwinding of balance sheets going to mix up the way investors  are behaving in the years to come.  </p><p>KUDLA:  Yes.  The, you know, the unwind -- great, great point, the unwind  of the balance sheet maybe as important or more important than the interest  rate hikes.  The unwind started last October and as we continue there is  two problems, there is an unwinding a balance sheet and we have a  increasing need for more borrowing by the government.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Trillion dollars.  </p><p>KUDLA:  Right.  So, you know, we have been calling for higher interest  rates, interest rates clearly going higher as a result of the Fed.  This  year, quantitative easing around the world, net quantitative easing goes to  quantitative tightening, so we're going to see global interest rates  rising.  So the interest path is clear, domestically and abroad rates are  going higher.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Now, you I think still like technologies.  </p><p>KUDLA:  I do.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Now, is that because you think this talked about regulation is  not really going to happen or it's not going to be that heavy or because  you think it actually ends up benefiting the heavyweights?  </p><p>KUDLA:  I think that, you know, we're looking at a small slice of the  technology sector really even small slice overall E-commerce and internet  stocks.  Facebook has a problem, has a serious problem.  Dagen talked about  earlier on the show.  The stock is down 8-1/2 percent, it will probably be  down 10 percent this week when the market opens.  But take a need to  (INAUDIBLE) like Arcweb that is the same type of stocks, high-tech, it's  positive on the week.  And we think that the second or growth story for  technology broadly still wins out even with a problem with specifically  Facebook and maybe some regulation coming and maybe a tax from the E.U. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So would you -- would you buy it here on this 10 percent  decline that you're expecting on the week?  </p><p>KUDLA:  I would wait on Facebook.  I think we really need to see where this  goes.  You know, we've talked about, you know, Mark Zuckerberg said, maybe  we should be regulated.  Hey, start with some soft regulation. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have been saying that for years and years and years and more  and more of these problems developed and this is not in the last 18 months,  this is going on for years in terms of them not protecting the people who  use the service and not protecting their information and ignoring like  launching products for these users and not thinking about the consequences.   I said hey, you're asking the government to come in your front door and the  backdoor and through the -- through your garage.  And that's exactly what's  going to happen.  </p><p>KUDLA:  And they just haven't done enough in self-regulation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>KUDLA:  They really should start there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, in terms of the backdrop, you agree that earnings will  still be up 18 percent for 2018.  </p><p>KUDLA:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, most analysts are expecting that because of the  tax overhaul because of the fundamental backdrop and the rollback in  regulations.  So what ETFs do you like in terms of benefiting from that or  individual names?  </p><p>KUDLA:  Yes.  So, we talked about technology, the secular growth story in  technology, we also like financials, you can play that through the ETF XLF  with interest rates rising, deregulation being rolled back for saying a  softening of the Dodd-Frank provisions and other regulations on the banks.   So we like the financial services sector.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  David, great to see you.</p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much, David Kudla.  Coming up.  Utah Senator and  Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch joins me.  He will we weigh in on  President Trump's agenda, the Federal Reserve b ill and the spending bill.   A lot more.  Then Best Buy reportedly cuts ties with the Chinese phone  maker.  Why the retail giant will stop selling the mobile devices.  Back in  a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Thursday morning, everybody.  Thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 22nd.   Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  It is time for  tariffs, President Trump set to unveil his trade plan targeting Chinese  imports, putting in place restrictions on investments by China.  White  House National Trade Counsel President Peter Navarro explained why the  administration is also focusing on investments, not just products.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  The  investment restrictions, every bit is important.  We have literally a  trillions of dollars of state financed money coming into America, plucking  the best of the best in Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin in terms of high- tech, and easier kind of things that threaten our future.  If we allow  China to basically capture the -- the industries of the future, we won't  have a future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But fears of a trade war sparking worries on Wall Street.   Markets looking at another tough day at the office.  Dow Industrials set to  open down 200 points right out of the gate this morning, down three- quarters of one percent.  The NASDAQ is down better than one percent right  now.  73 points lower.  That after modest losses yesterday across the board  when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates.  The Fed of course raised  rates by a quarter of a point, the Dow yesterday closed down 45.  S&amp;P was  down five, and the NASDAQ down 19.  Global markets this morning are mixed  mostly lower.  Take a look, FT-100 down 80 points.  That here, this is the  low of the morning, down 80 points, one percent lower.  CAC quarante in  Paris down 1-1/3 percent and the DAX Index in Germany also down better than  one percent.  We did have a weaker-than-expected Eurozone purchasing  managers' index out this morning.  In Asia overnight, mixed performances,  take a look, the Nikkei Average was up in Japan  up one percent but the  other majors down across the board.</p><p>Best Buy taking its own stance on China.  The company reportedly says it  will no longer sell smartphones made by Huawei.  And then inflation fears  coming to your breakfast table.  General Mills warning of higher prices for  customer favorites including cheerios among others. And unexpected hit from  the spending bill, Minor League Baseball players may lose their rights to  the minimum wage.  </p><p>Plus, Dwight Howard goes 30 to 30.  It is not the ESPN documentary.   Howard's historic night on the court last night.  </p><p>First this, targeting China, the president is expected to announce up to  $60 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese imports this afternoon as part of a  major effort to curb the theft of American technology and intellectual  property.  It's something White House National Trade Counsel Director Peter  Navarro told me this morning is long overdue.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAVARRO:  It's an historic day, this is a fundamental shift in American  policy towards China after literally decades of economic dialogue and, you  know, talk is not cheap for the Chinese, it's actually been very expensive  because while we've been talking with them since 2003, they have been  robbing our technology blind.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that is Senate Finance  Chairman Senator Orrin Hatch.  Senator, it's good to have you on the  program this morning.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R-UT), CHAIRMAN, SENATE FINANCE CHAIRMAN:  Nice to be  with you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I want to talk about this.  You're convening a Senate  Finance Committee meeting with Mr.  Lighthizer to talk about this.  You  disagree with the President on his steel and aluminum tariffs.  </p><p>HATCH:  I really do.  The people are going to pay for that, it's going to  be the American citizens.  It's not going to do us any good in the  international trade wars.  I think we've got to outcompete them and you  can't do it just by raising tariffs and it's never worked before, I don't  know why it's going to work now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean -- yes.</p><p>HATCH:  I just don't -- I just don't agree with Peter Navarro.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You go through some of the, you know, the list of our partners  across the world and there are deficits across the board.  $375-billion  deficit with China, $150-billion deficits with Europe, just, you know,  Germany alone, 70 billion.  Is that -- does that not matter?  </p><p>HATCH:  Well, of course, it matters but we've got to -- we've got to do a  better job of competing with those people.  Of course, one of the problems  is that the government subsidized their trade and that makes it very, very  difficult for us.  So, it's not fair, it's certainly not free and fair  trade but I'm not sure that you help setting up tariffs but I don't think  it's going to work and I think in the end it will hurt us pretty badly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how much of this do you believe is the President  negotiating?  Because we know that first it was OK.  Aluminum and steel  tariffs are across the board and then it became well, there are going to be  a lot of exemptions, Canada exempted, Europe will be exempt, a number of  other countries, Argentina, Australia.  So, what do you think about that?   I mean, that's where Peter Navarro and company will push back on the  negativity around it.  </p><p>HATCH:  I remember when they came out -- when they came out with these  ideas, I thought what loony ideas that really upset about it and so I'm  pleased that the president is backing off to a degree.  Look, I don't agree  with Mr. Navarro.  I don't think that he is living in the real world and  frankly, I think he is misleading the President, but the President buys off  on some of this too because he is I tired of being, you know, being pushed  around by the rest of the world and I don't blame him but this is not the  way to beat them, the best way to beat them is for us to outcompete them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you do that and what do you want to hear from Robert  Lighthizer today testifying before your committee, the Senate Finance  Committee?  </p><p>HATCH:  Well, Bob Lighthizer is a really fine man but he's going to do  whatever the administration wants him to do and I expect that he'll try and  back this type of thing and we'll see what happens but I don't think -- I  don't think he is going to have a really, you know, really soft reception  if this is the type of trade approach they're going to take.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What will be the impact to the economy?  Let's say we do have  they tariffs that are going to be implemented beginning tomorrow by the  way.  Do you expect that there will be an impact?  What's the biggest  impact, higher prices for goods, for consumers, higher prices for business  or what?  What is your big worry in terms of the practical --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HATCH:  All of the above.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  </p><p>HATCH:  Because these other countries are not going to put up with it, it's  - I think it's ridiculous between you and me.  We should outcompete them,  we can do it, we have the ability to do it.  We just have to get the  government off the backs of a lot of our businesses so that they can really  compete.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So having -- </p><p>HATCH:  And we need to -- go ahead.  I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, please.  Finish your thought, sir.  </p><p>HATCH:  Well, we need to -- we need to compete well and we need to -- where  they're using bad trade practices against us, we ought to hit them where it  hurts.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Having said that, you do agree with some pushback on China,  right?  Today the President will come out with we are expecting to be not  just tariffs against China but restrictions in terms of Chinese -- the  Chinese ability to invest in American businesses.  </p><p>HATCH:  Well, I do agree with some pushback.  I'm not sure those are the  right ones but the fact is that, you know, I'm very supportive of the  president normally and I want to support him and probably will.  But I'm  very concerned about getting into trade wars that really put us at a  tremendous disadvantage.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you expecting a retaliation from China once these are  announced today?  Because you say you're -- you agree with targeting the  bad actors like China with tools that we already have in place.  </p><p>HATCH:  Right.  Well, yes.  I expect some push back from China.  I don't  think there is any question about that.  And the question is, are we in a  position economically to really fight them?  And we've been going downhill  in the last number of years and we've got to pull our country back up, get  it on seat and get the, you know, get these bad things out of our economic  system and I -- I'm counting on the President to lead that fight and get  that done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, just to be clear, sir, what should be done with regard to  China and I want to point your attention to the fact the markets are really  roiled over this where right now with the lows of the morning, Senator  Hatch.  The Dow Industrials are going to open down 250 points -- or 230  points is where we are right now.  So, tell me what specific moves you'd  like to see with regards to China if not,  what we're talking about here.</p><p>HATCH:  Well, I'd be the last to tell the administration what to do.  I  think Bob Lighthizer does understand this pretty well as our trade  representative and I would hope that he would weigh in more heavily than  he's doing right now.  And I do believe that the President has good  intentions.  He wants to pull us out to some of these messes that we're in  and -- but I'm not sure you do it by starting a trade war with China.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator, let me switch gears and ask you about the spending  bill, obviously Congressional leaders reaching a tentative agreement on a  $1.3 trillion spending bill, a vote has yet to come but we're expecting a  vote in the next two days to avoid a shutdown.  House Freedom Caucus  members are opposing the bill.  Are we headed for a shutdown?</p><p>HATCH:  Well, I hope not but I'll tell you one thing, we've got to find  some way of curtailing this excessive spending that we're doing and we've  got to find some way boosting an American economy and businesses all over  the world and you don't do it by the tariffs and the uncompetitive type  approaches.  We have to compete, it's just that simple and I think we can  but we can't just sit back and act like it isn't going to happen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Senator, Governor Mike Huckabee tweeted out something  earlier and he said this, he said, I'm going to go on MORNINGS WITH MARIA  and I'm going to let loose on the GOP for collapsing and surrendering to  Pelosi and Schumer on this disgusting spending bill.  It's not a  compromise, it's capitulation to borrow a phrase from Nancy Reagan, he  says, just say no.  What should Congress be doing?  I mean, if you are  handcuffed in terms of $700 billion for defense spending, you want to have  that money, but you are handcuffed in terms of lots of other domestic  spending that your colleagues on the left want.  How do you -- how do you  square that circle?  </p><p>HATCH:  Well, good for Governor Huckabee, he's raising a very, very  important point.  And frankly until we get tough around here and -- the  problem is we don't have the votes, we don't have the strength of the  voting to be able to turn this mess around.  We just really need to elect  more conservatives in this country who are willing to do the tough voting  that we have to do to bring this country back and to get our economy back  on its feet.  Right now, all of the incentives are more spending, more  government, more regulations, more approaches like that literally are  killing us and I think we've got to -- we've got to start fighting back but  unless the American people are going to elect enough people to really fight  back, like this, we're going to -- we're going to put up with this kind of  stuff for the next 10 years and I don't want to do it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So should you just let the government shut down?  Then I mean,  how do you fight back?   You need the 60 votes.  </p><p>HATCH:  Well, I tried.  I mean, I'm not real enthusiast about government  shutdowns but I am enthusiast about letting the administration know that  there are ways of doing things and ways not to do things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>HATCH:  Then I do think that it's up to American people. If they're going  to continue to keep Congress at a competing equal level with liberals and  conservatives so that we've got three or four more liberal Republicans  going with the all-liberal Democrats so that we can't get anything done,  then we're going to have trouble.  We've got to elect more conservative  Republicans and if we do that then I would put all the blame on Republicans  for not turning it around if we have enough votes to be able to do it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, are you going to be able to do that coming into the  midterm elections?  I mean, you got a midterm election in the next several  months in November, do you think you'll get more conservative members?</p><p>HATCH:  Well, if we don't, we're not going to get these things under  control because it's just too easy for the moderates and the Republican  Party to go with the Democrats and to keep the spending going the way it's  been going for all these years.  We sooner or later got to face these  problems and the only way you're going to do it is to get some tough  conservatives there and willing to stand up and make the right decisions.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Well, do you have a plan in terms of getting your  arms around the entitlements?  Do you have a plan in terms of reining in  the debt and lowering the spending?  </p><p>HATCH:  Of course, I do but it does take votes and right now we don't have  the votes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator, it's good to have you on the program this morning.  </p><p>HATCH:  Great to be with you, Maria.  You do such a good job.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I so appreciate that, sir.  Thank you very much.  We will see  you soon, Senator.</p><p>HATCH:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator Orrin Hatch.  Coming, Cheerios could soon cost more.   Why General Mills is raising prices on some of its products, that's next.   And then Facebook fallout, Stuart Varney weighs in on the backlash of the  social media company.  Back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We have breaking news.  The House Freedom Caucus  are sending a letter to President Trump, asking him to reject the $1.3  trillion spending bill.  Here's what the letters says in part, \"Mr.  President, we urge you to remember the countless forgotten men and women of  America who placed their faith in you to change business as usual in  Washington, D.C.  We urge you to join us and reject the omnibus.\"  </p><p>And we want to show you markets which actually as this news is coming out.   Hitting the tape markets are worsening right now.  We are expecting a sell- off of 300 points at the opening of trading this morning.  The concerns  over trade weighing on investors.  We also have the Federal Reserve,  obviously, beginning this interest rate string of hikes we're expecting.   The Fed raised rates quarter point yesterday as expected, but it is  definitely the trade story that is worsening markets this morning.</p><p>There is General Mills under pressure as well rising costs and logistics  and inflation, eating into profit there.  That means your grocery bill may  go up.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange  watching all of the above.  Tough day at the office today, Nichole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes, indeed.  Right.  We're looking down  almost 300 points on the Dow as you mentioned with General Mills.   Yesterday, we stood right here, we talked about their quarterly report and  we've talked about freight costs on the rise.  Just the shortage of trucks  and drivers, shipping costs going up not only for General Mills but also  for many of the others such as Tyson and also Hormel and BMG.  And they've  been translating the rising cost for food and freight to their customers  and it'll be interesting to see whether or not General Mills will do much  of the same.  It saying that it's raising prices on some meals and snacks  to reflect the higher ingredient and shipping costs that they are facing.   The stock hit a 5-year low yesterday.  You could see it's down one-tenth of  one percent this morning.  </p><p>A different story on Best Buy.  It's cutting ties with China's Huawei,  which is the third largest smartphone vendor behind Apple and Samsung and  this is all about the U.S. scrutiny of Chinese tech firms, and we've seen  AT&amp;T and Verizon actually stepping theirs as well, so, stepping back on  that deal.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nichole.  Thanks so much, Nicole Petallides.  I want  to look at Facebook because the CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he's sorry he is  not helping the stock though.  The stock is down another 2-1/2 percent this  morning.  We just heard it could be down 10 percent on the week.  He  finally addressed the growing privacy scandal that allow an outside firm  Cambridge Analytica to gain access to the personal data of more than 50  million Facebook users.</p><p>Joining us now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.   Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Good morning, Maria.  I think this is one more  negative contributing to the 300 point loss for the Dow Industrials, which  we are likely to see at the opening bell.  It wasn't much of an apology.   Really didn't go very far, and he is saying look, he could be OK with some  form of regulation.  That's interesting.  That opens the door.  </p><p>It's kind of (INAUDIBLE) mission but there ain't that much regulation right  now and maybe some more is required.  What he said yesterday with this so- called apology, I think is contributing towards a downside move for all of  the big name tech stocks.  And when you throw in this trade possibility of  a trade war, chuck that in.  And also from the Federal Reserve yesterday,  which is hinting at a very strong economy.  I think you've got the makings  of a downside move and half when the market opens this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.  Looking at 300 point sell-off.  Stu, I know you're  going to be navigating that at the open.  We'll see you in 10 minutes, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  We will.  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour  right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

This could leave some Minor  Leaguers earning as little as $1100 per month, to play baseball, trying to  make it to the big leagues.</p><p>Bidding to buy the NFL's Carolina Panthers from Jerry Richardson has  reportedly reached a figure never before paid for an American pro sports  franchise, $2.5 billion.  Among four potential ownership groups, still in  the mix, steel and mining industry exec Alan Kestenbaum, who has the third  richest man in Canada, Jim Pattison, in his group, as part of a team trying  to buy the Panthers.  This high bidding is reportedly not Michael Rubin's  group out of the mix.  A group that may include Warriors all-star Steph  Curry and also rapper Diddy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Any of these bidders will be able to take the Panthers to the  Super Bowl?</p><p>MAX:  It's all about the players who get to Super Bowl.  It's going to be  interesting times the more you look at this figure, 2.5 billion.  Forbes  valued the Panthers at 2.3 billion last year.  So we're getting to see a  little bit of maybe the inflation of the NFL, what's the team worth, and is  this a time to be overpaying for an NFL franchise.  We're going to have  three professional football leagues by 2020.  And of course, you throw in  the other side of football, a lot of people saying how far can football go  with all that we know about the brain injuries that go with it?  So  interesting to track where the money goes on this sale.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike Rubin has been a guest on this program.  He's the guy who  owns and operates Fanatics.

Good to be back.   Anyway, we've got a brief jumping session right now all over the place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news, everyone, we've got Dow that's swinging back and forth, in  and out in negative territory.  It was up quite a bit earlier in the  session, more than 200 now.  Down to the flat line and now back up 50.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors are continuing to weigh basically the impact of the Trump  administration's aggressive approach to China.  They're not sure how it's  all been to turn out.  We're going to dive in to that over the next hour.   So you can think about how you should be interpreting this news and what is  going to mean for the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am Trish Regan.  Welcome to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.  It is great to be  back all the way from Hawaii.  I'll have a little more on that at the end  of the show.</p><p>But meanwhile, let's talk about this trade war that everybody is so fearful  about.  I'll tell you, they're starting to basically come to grips with it.   You've got fears are starting to ease.  You're starting to see that the  U.S. and China begin negotiations to address the tensions that had rocked  global markets in recent weeks.</p><p>Investors are still trying to digest of the news at last to record sell- off, which is followed by a sharp rebound, nice to see yesterday.  And  we're going to be watching here all this drama that's unfolding right up  until the closing bell.  But I will ask yet again, are these markets  overreacting?  I think so.  We've got some intel.</p><p>Plus, Facebook woes continue to pile on as U.S. officials say they are  investigating the social network over its controversial privacy policies.   And Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg out there finally feeling a little bit of  heat.  Now reports say he will testify before Congress.  Is this beginning  or the end for this company, for the Facebook founder?  We have more coming  up.</p><p>But first, back to our top story, this trade dispute with China.  Will  investors give President Trump a fair deal in terms of these markets?  Will  China give him a fair deal in terms of trade?</p><p>Joining me right now, Hudson Institute Senior Fellow, Michael Pillsbury,  along with our very own Charles Payne.  It's good to see you both.</p><p>Michael, I'll start with you.  You know, look, people say the Trump  administration is anti-free trade.  It seems like kind of a drastic,  drastic criticism, especially, I think, if you allow China to continue on  the path it is you're going to wake up a decade from now, we're going to be  the next France.  They're going to be the hegemonic power in the world  taking the place of the USA.  So, with that in mind, what needs to happen  so that things start to shake out in a more fair way?</p><p>MICHAEL PILLSBURY, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE:  Well, the first thing  is China has got to take President Trump seriously, and they've done that.   I think they've made some fairly major concessions in the last few days.   That's probably why the market is calming down.</p><p>President Trump did not really declare a trade war at all.  He had very,  very limited measures, measures that were talked about for many years.  The  only thing is he's actually doing it, instead of just talking about it.   But I don't see a really harsh pushback from the Chinese.</p><p>Their turnoffs against the steel and aluminum tariffs were very small, $3  billion to match $3 billion.  They haven't only replied to this yet.  But  they have certainly offered to negotiate, and so some very conciliatory  things almost an apology, Trish, where they say, \"We were willing to open  up our market, we're willing to open up some more sectors to foreign  investment.\"  So, I think, as you say, it's been really exaggerated.</p><p>And President Trump, he's probably showing that he's a master negotiator  here.  He's preserving his ties with China, which he needs for North Korea  and getting their attention to start these negotiations.  So, overall, I  think, it's a pretty optimistic outcome over the last three or four days.   It could have gone much differently.</p><p>REGAN:  Charles, one of the things that frustrated me about China and has  over the last number of years since I've, frankly, been following all of  this is that China really does take advantage of us and U.S. companies.   And you know what?  The CEOs, they don't care because they want access to  that Chinese market because it's going to be great for their quarterly  results.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  And, frankly, President Obama didn't really care so much either  because, I think, there's been such a concentration by so many in  Washington on the next election, much like CEOs are focused on the next  quarter's results that they don't appreciate the context of what's going on  here.  They don't appreciate how this is all going to affect our population  down the road, our kids, Charles, if we allow China to continue stealing  our technology and making such onerous demands on our companies.</p><p>PAYNE:  You know, I agree with you 1000 percent.  Now, listen, everyone  gives a lip service.  You know, there are endless articles where Jack Lew,  you know, was livid about the circumstances and he talked about them --</p><p>PILLSBURY:  That's right.</p><p>PAYNE:  -- but they never offered solutions.  They never had any sort of  real threat against China that will make China curb their predatory  actions.  And let's face it, when China joined the World Trade Organization  that was going to make them a legitimate player and follow all the rules.   Of course, they didn't follow the rules.  And who can blame China?  They  are.</p><p>You started to show up talking about their grand ambitions.  They do have  grand ambitions.  And right now, by 2026, their economy could be bigger  than ours.</p><p>And, you know, couple India and other Asian nations, and America starts to  falls into the sort of zone where Europe is.  And Europe can't turn around.   They're done unfortunately.  And so, if we're going to make a stand, we  have to make a stand at this very point.</p><p>And, you know, one example I like to use Trish, is a G.M. Buick division  has an SUV, the Envision.  The Envision is only made in Singapore, right,  in Shanghai, rather.  And it's exported to this country.  It was a big hit  last year.</p><p>Now, that's great for General Motors and their shareholders.  It's great  for the American consumers who probably get a pretty good car at a pretty  good price.  And it's great for the Chinese worker who made it.  There's  one person missing from the equation and that's the American factory  worker, auto worker who might have otherwise had made this product.  And  that's why there's a different bifurcation.</p><p>You know, China hasn't pushed back but Wall Street has pushed back.  Last  week, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, every day at 2:00, approximately  2:00, a gigantic sell program went off.  Ultimately it took 1200 Dow points  out of the market.  There was no new news at 2:00.</p><p>Every single day at that point we saw the markets fell off dramatically.  I  think Wall Street has been pushing back on this a lot harder than China  has.</p><p>REGAN:  Look, you know, Michael, I get Wall Street, but what I think is a  critical here is that we not look at the day-to-day, and I would remind  traders not to look at the day-to-day because I'll tell you, 10 years from  now you're going to wake up and had a heck of a problem on your hand if you  don't deal with the China stuff now.  So if we tick a little pain along the  way, we will be better off.  It is mind-boggling to me.</p><p>I mean, they're out creating their version of the WTO.  They're investing  in many economies in Latin America, in Pakistan, in Iran --</p><p>PILLSBURY:  Africa.</p><p>REGAN:  -- or Russia, Africa as well, places that they can seek commodity  resources in.  I mean, they have a very definite plan to be the world's  largest economic power and quite perhaps possibly the world's largest  military power.  So, if we don't wake up and deal with that at some point,  Michael, I think we're going to have much bigger problems on our hands than  600-point drop in the Dow.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  I agree.  I agree with Charles, too.  As you know, I wrote a  book about this three years ago, which is widely criticized as being  alarmist.</p><p>And now President Trump has not only accepted some of the premises, he's  released a much better report, if I may say so, than my book just last  week.  It's 250 pages long.  Example after example after example of what  President Obama used to call the \"gangsterization\" of our companies.   That's why President Trump is moving forward on several fronts.  It's not  just tariffs.  It's this new suit at the WTO in Geneva.</p><p>There's number of other measures.  And, frankly, there is bipartisan  support for what he is doing.  Senator Chuck Schumer is often seen as enemy  of the President, very quickly endorsed President Trump last Thursday on  the tightening up on technology purchases here in the United States.</p><p>The bill has attracted the co-sponsorship of Dianne Feinstein who would be  happy to call a progressive liberal, I think.  So this problem has gone on  for so long that just these limited steps seems to be producing a lot of  bipartisan support.  That's why the day-to-day fluctuation in the market  really kind of a shortsighted.  And some people who didn't listen are  probably losing money now.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  Well, they'll make it up.  Very quickly, Charles, there are  some examples, I think, out there of Chinese companies now looking to  invest in the U.S. because, look, we're not going to continue with the  current status quo.</p><p>PAYNE:  Absolutely.  Well, you know, two news items today.  One is a  smaller company, but it's really important, JinkoSolar, the fourth largest  solar manufacturer in the world that Chinese company probably will be  breaking ground here.  It becomes official today in Jacksonville, $50  million project, 400,000 square feet.</p><p>Here is the most important thing.  This comes after President Trump levied  the 30 percent tariff on their product.  So now they're going to bring and  manufacturing here and of course --</p><p>REGAN:  They're going to bring it here?</p><p>PAYNE:  -- we know Foxconn, of course, is building out big time.  They made  an acquisition today.  And while there are pros and cons to it, people need  to pay attention.</p><p>REGAN:  Michael, Charles, good to see you guys.</p><p>PAYNE:  You got it.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you so much.  Good perspective.  And make sure, everyone,  watch Charles on \"Making Money\" tonight, 6:00 p.m. Eastern right here on  Fox Business.</p><p>Turning to our other top story, Facebook says it will not confirm reports  that CEO, Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress about how Facebook  collects and stores user data.  But Mr. Zuckerberg says he will not appear  before the U.K. parliament.  All of this as we have uncovered video from  eight years ago of Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, warning Mark Zuckerberg  and other tech CEOs about user privacy.</p><p>For the latest, let's go right now to Deirdre Bolton who has been following  the story from day one.  Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Trish, Facebook is under  pressure.  It is facing investigations from 37 states attorneys general,  including tech-heavy states California, Massachusetts, New York.  It is  also now facing specific lawsuits just this morning from counties, such as  IllinoisCook County, that includes Chicago and surrounding areas.</p><p>So, basically those areas are just joining this legal fight against  Facebook and Cambridge Analytica over the misuse of data scraped from  social media profiles claiming that both companies violated state fraud  law.  So that is the paperwork from Cook County, Illinois.  So this lawsuit  claims that Cambridge Analytica tricked Facebook users with quizzes and  that Facebook knew, this is really serious, Trish, this accusation, and did  nothing to stop it.</p><p>Now, as you point it out, Steve Jobs, seemed to have a premonition about  this relationship between tech and privacy getting more cloudy.  Here is  what he said eight years ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE JOBS, CO-FOUNDER, APPLE:  The Silicon Valley is not monolithic.   We've always had a very different view of privacy than some of our  colleagues in the Valley.  We take privacy extremely seriously.  And some  people want to share more data than other people do.</p><p>Ask them.  Ask them every time.  Make them tell you to stop asking them, if  they get tired of you asking them.  Let them know precisely what you're  going to do with their data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg wishes he had seen that or heard that or  paid attention because that Cook County lawsuit specifically states  \"Facebook is not a social media company, it is the largest data mining  operation in existence.\"  It further claims that Facebook worked to keep  developers on its platform plying them with sensitive data at the expense  of its users' privacy.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission also investigating Facebook.  It signaled  today that its probe of the company is broad.  So that's a key word because  it's never what a company wants to hear.  It implies impending regulation.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg may also testify on Capitol Hill not clear yet.  He has  been invited to a hearing on April 10th.  If he goes, he's going to be  asked questions about Facebook's policies regarding protection and  monitoring of consumer data.</p><p>Senator Grassley is the one who issue the invitation, also extended the  same to Google's CEO and Twitter's CEO.  But essentially, Trish, this opens  up huge questions for big tech, for privacy, for potential regulation.  All  of these companies right away, they have to spend more money on their legal  teams.  Probably Mark Zuckerberg has an extra direct report because of this  and it is certainly going to be a distraction to the way that they are  trying to run their normal businesses.</p><p>Trish, back to you.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's their fault.  Thank you very much, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  Joining me right now for more analysis, \"Bullseye Brief\" Publisher  and Founder and Author, Adam Johnson, along with Belpointe Chief  Strategist, David Nelson.</p><p>Is this going to be the end of Mark Zuckerberg?</p><p>ADAM JOHNSON, AUTHOR, \"BULLSEYE BRIEF\" PUBLISHER AND AUTHOR:  It's starting  to look like it.  And I tell you something, Trish, there's a real trust  problem which Zuckerberg himself said when he went on CNN in his t-shirt  looking all dough-eyed for all of us to try to sound contrite.  The problem  is we don't necessarily trust that our data is safe.  That's number one.</p><p>Number two, we don't necessarily trust that what's in our news feed is  accurate because of the fake news.  And number three, it's kind of hard for  me, and I would imagine a lot of other people, to necessarily trust a  company that takes all our data, all our hard work, our intellectual  capital, all the effort that we put into posting, sells that to other  people for billions of dollars, and all we get back in return is likes.   I'm sorry, but that doesn't breed trust.</p><p>REGAN:  You have a plan for that.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  You have some suggestions to Mr. Zuckerberg.</p><p>JOHNSON:  I do.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's get to that in a second.  But first of all, in terms of this  company, you know, look, I was on vacation this week.  And I used Facebook  more than I would on a regular basis because, you know, I'm posting  pictures of the kids.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Sure.</p><p>REGAN:  And all of that good stuff.  And I thought, you know, I don't know  if I want to be on this right now.  I don't know if anybody wants to be on  this right now because of these violations into our privacy, which, you  know, he's a little contrite there, saying, \"Oh, yes, shouldn't happen.   It's our responsibility.\"</p><p>This is a company, David, that makes money off being able to target ads so  specifically.  They're going to want to know everything they can about  Trish Regan, Adam Johnson, and David Nelson.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  So that they can target those ads.  And I don't know if any of us  should be OK with that.</p><p>NELSON:  Sure.  Big data is big money and that's what this is about.  And I  think what we're finding out is there's nothing social in that social  media.  This is a data mining operation like --</p><p>JOHNSON:  It's one-sided, right?</p><p>NELSON:  -- it's kind of one-sided.  They have the data and they use it.   And for Mark Zuckerberg not, you know, agreeing to appear, he obviously has  aspirations for something beyond Facebook.  He did a tour in the country,  almost in campaign style.</p><p>And nobody looks good in front of the Senate subcommittee.  You start to  look like Michael Corleone and you try to explain that you're just a CEO of  an olive oil company.  He's trying to deflect this, putting the CTO, those  Chief Technology Officers, in front of Congress or parliament.  That's not  going to cut it.  People want some answers.</p><p>And I think there are going to be some solutions.  I was wrong last week  when I thought that with the genie out of the bottle, this business model  wouldn't change.  Obviously it's going to change.  Regulation is going to  change it.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, yes, I mean, it has to change.  And you're right, I mean, the  news feed being fake, our information being compromised.  You think there's  a way for them to fix this so that their \"users,\" you wouldn't even call  them that, would actually have some skin in the game?</p><p>JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  How would you change that?</p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, I cut a video yesterday and I posted out on Twitter and  Facebook and link.  Then it got a little bit of traction.  I said, \"Stop  calling us users for starters, Mark.  Why don't you start calling us  partners and actually make us partners by giving us the same kind of upside  that the cryptocurrency markets give us.\"  In other words, they in all  their brilliance over at Facebook have all these algorithms.</p><p>\"So why don't you use your algorithms, Mark, to figure out what makes a  great post?  Maybe it's a number of likes, cute puppies, thoughtful social  commentary.  Whatever it is, use all of that to award our posts with face  coins and then let us redeem face coin on Facebook for goods and services.   And by the way, if we don't want to do that let's trade it, the same way we  trade bitcoin and get money for it.\"  In other words, create a rewards  point system so that we are partners.  And that is interesting --</p><p>REGAN:  But that would cost some money.</p><p>JOHNSON:  -- yes, exactly.</p><p>REGAN:  It would cost some money if they're the ones putting the good and  services.</p><p>JOHNSON:  That's right.</p><p>REGAN:  But the membership, you know, you think about --</p><p>NELSON:  But regulations cost money.</p><p>REGAN:  -- right, they give you membership rewards or these credit card  companies, or hotel companies, airline companies, if you spend a certain  amount of money with them, or fly with them, or travel with them you get  something in return.</p><p>JOHNSON:  And Facebook doesn't give us anything.</p><p>REGAN:  They use all our contact.</p><p>NELSON:  In fact, they're stealing and that's it and we're not getting a  dime for it.</p><p>JOHNSON:  All we get are likes.</p><p>NELSON:  We're giving it to them.  I don't know if they're stealing it.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>NELSON:  But I don't know a face coin is going to work.  But certainly, you  know, a rewards program something like that could work.  There's actually  some business models out there, seeking out.</p><p>There's a place where financial advisors go out and put outposts.  And if  they have enough viewers on that they actually get paid for that.  They  would get paid for our likes.  And maybe as of dislike, maybe you get some  points taken away.  Maybe that would eliminate some of those occupy  Democrat political, you know, hand grenades that I see post in my Facebook  page.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Now you're talking like the SAT test where you get penalized for  random answers.  But they can figure this stuff out.  They have the  algorithms</p><p>REGAN:  Well, yes, they certainly can.  I don't think there has been any  willingness to.  We haven't even started about how the, you know, ISIS  terrorists want to use social media.</p><p>NELSON:  The ramifications beyond Facebook are pretty large.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.</p><p>NELSON:  This affects Google and so many others.</p><p>REGAN:  Good stuff.  Adam, David, thank you so much.</p><p>NELSON:  Thanks, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Kim Jong-un reportedly making a secret trip to China,  his first foreign trip since taking power of the kingdom there in 2011.   What does this visit mean for the U.S.?  We're on it.  Stay with us.  We'll  see you here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Everyone, get this, a heavily guarded mysterious train  rolled into Beijing on Monday.  And officials believe that it may have been  carrying none other than North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.  A visit to  the Chinese capital would mark Kim's first trip beyond North Korean borders  since taking power back in 2011.  So if these reports are true, why did he  make the trip?  Why did he make it now?</p><p>Joining me with analysis, \"Nuclear Showdown\" Author, Gordon Chang.  Gordon,  always good to see you.  You are the guy to talk to about North Korea and  China.  So what your take on this?  Did it happen and why did he do it?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN\":  Yes, I think it certainly  happened.  And I think the reason why Kim went to Beijing was because  Beijing demanded that he go there.</p><p>You got to remember that Kim was going to make his first foreign trip to  South Korea, to go south of the military demarcation line in the  demilitarize zone to the peace house, which is in South Korea.  And then  his second foreign trip was going to be seeing President Trump.  The  Chinese realized they were being marginalized.  And so, essentially what  they said to Kim was, \"You come to Beijing or else.\"</p><p>REGAN:  What do you think will come of this?</p><p>CHANG:  I don't know what's going to happen with the Trump-Kim summit.  But  I think that it was very good for President Trump to do that because he is  cutting out the Chinese.  And the Chinese over this century have really  been a maligned influence.  They have been helping the North Korean nuclear  weapons effort as well as ballistic missile program.</p><p>And what Trump decided to do is he was not going to put up with that, he  was going to talk to Kim Jong-un directly.  And you've got to remember,  Trish, this is occurring at the same time as the trade disputes.</p><p>Now, the Chinese have heard American Presidents threaten trade actions, but  they haven't really seen anyone carry through.  And President Trump is  carrying through.  And the Chinese right now are probably pretty  bewildered.  They got both Kim and Trump giving them a hard time.</p><p>REGAN:  Simultaneously, you have John Bolton now as part of the  administration as well and he, Ambassador Bolton has made very clear,  certainly to me in the past, he would like to see the reunification of the  North Korean peninsula and one would have to assume that Kim Jong-un would  be on the losing side of that deal.  So, are the Chinese now being caught  off guard or a bit more nervous?  How does that affect everything that's  going on because they may be looking at it and saying, \"Gosh, you know, the  U.S. is playing tough now on trade?\"  Maybe somehow trying to court Kim  Jong-un in a way that we don't understand, and in fact, the U.S. may wind  up having a much bigger presence right next door to us than we anticipated,  Gordon?</p><p>CHANG:  Yes, you know, John Bolton as National security advisor and Mike  Pompeo as Secretary of State really round out of the war Cabinet.  And, you  know, you look at what Bolton said about the main problem in the world,  it's China and Russia.  And so, Beijing right now has got to understand  that they've got a new sheriff in town, and that Bolton is going to push  Trump in directions that Trump would go anyway.</p><p>You know, Trump started out his administration by trying to placate the  Chinese, bringing them on board, getting them to help on North Korea.  They  didn't do that.  So, you know, right now, you have to a consensus --</p><p>REGAN:  And he said he was a little disappointed in that.  That he had  hoped to get more cooperation from China.</p><p>CHANG:  -- yes.  And we know from the President's tweets that he is not  only -- of course, he was first disappointed but now angry and frustrated.   You have Bolton coming in, Pompeo coming in.  It's a new landscape for the  Chinese.</p><p>And right now, they're seeing something that they have never faced before.</p><p>REGAN:  Meaning?</p><p>CHANG:  Well, meaning that there's now an administration that is willing to  hold them responsible for really predatory mercantilist and dangerous  activities around the world.  And so, you know, they're seeing that the  U.S. is going to impose costs on China and deal with China as well as  Moscow in a way that we haven't seen since the end of the Cold War.  So I  think you have now in Beijing, people are saying who lost America, as a  \"Washington Post\" correspondent recently wrote about a week ago.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's about time.  They've been getting away with a whole lot  for much too long.</p><p>CHANG:  It's a about time.</p><p>REGAN:  Anyway, Gordon Chang, it's good to see you.  Appreciate your  analysis.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  For the first time in 70 years, the 2020 census is going to include  a question about citizenship.  Democrats are blasting this move, but is it  legal?  We have some intel as the market trades up 25 points right now on  the Dow.  See you right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  And on the market, it took a dip into negative territory.  So,  we're watching it very carefully.  It's been a rather volatile session all  over the place here.</p><p>Investors are still trying to come to grips with what's exactly this trade  dispute with China will mean.</p><p>In the mean time, we're watching another story here and that's the 2020  census, which is now expected to include a question about citizenship  status.  The population count take in every 10 years is required by the  Constitutions and it is use to determine the number of seats each state has  in the House.  So, it's important from that perspective as well as how  federal funds are distributed.</p><p>Democrats are condemning this move saying it would actually discourage  immigrants from responding, which would cause a population undercount and  therefore they wouldn't able to have as many representatives, say, from  state like California.  California's attorney general is suing the Trump  Administration saying and \"including a citizenship question on the 2020  census is not a bad idea, it is illegal.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano, with his sense of whether it is, in fact, legal or not.  Where  do you come out?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  It is legal to  ask because the federal government has a legitimate interest in knowing  that but the government cannot compel the answer from the person asked  because we have the right to remain silent.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  So then the California A.G. really doesn't have much of a  case.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  First of all, it's premature because Congress hasn't decided  this yet.  This is just a proposal from the Commerce Department, which must  file its proposal by the end of this week and they filed it last night.</p><p>Congress is not in session for the next two weeks.  They're going to debate  this all over again when Congress is back there.  But the only thing under  the Constitution of the government can compel any answer to is how many  human beings lives in this house and how many bathrooms you have?  What is  your education, what is your nationality, and what is your citizenship?   Again, it can ask but it can't punish him for not answering.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  So, it seems to me then, it's fair to ask the question and  it's obviously an individual decision as to whether or not they want to  respond.  But assuming that California is right and all the people that are  here illegally decline to answer the question, does population count go  down and therefore does the number of representatives coming from a state  like California go down?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That is a great question.  And that would be exquisitely  unfair to the rest of the country if California where to get more  representatives in the House of Representatives because of more illegal or  undocumented persons living in California.  That is not the intent of the  census and that is not the purpose of the headcount.  So the Federal  Government is going to have to find some other way to determine who is  legitimately, lawfully residing in California without compelling people to  answer.</p><p>Now, I think a lot of people will answer anyway.  I don't know if they'll  answer truthfully or not.  I think the Democrats do have an argument to  make the people here unlawfully are not going to answer truthfully because  they'll think it's going to trigger their deportation although this  questionnaires are anonymous.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  Different then, let's say, it was back when, you know,  during World War II and you were making a point to me off-camera that there  were times in history that we have used the census --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  -- to actually find people?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  The Roosevelt Administration in the census of 1940 not  only asked if you're a citizen and asked your nationality.  And then when  FDR and his colleagues decided to incarcerate Japanese-Americans, they had  the data to find them.</p><p>Congress was so outraged by this.  But in 1947, FDR is dead, the war is  over.  That it enacted legislation prohibiting asking nationality but did  not prohibit asking citizenship.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, let's see what happens.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you, Judge.  Good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Good to see you.  Welcome back.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you.  It's good to be back.  Wow, lots of news going on.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  You could say that.  Any day, any week, Russia is vowing to  retaliate after President Trump expels 60 diplomats from the United States.   What will that include and will this finally put an end to talk that Trump  is too soft on Vladmir Putin?</p><p>Plus, we are following these markets.  We can see we've been all over the  place now, up 13 points, just straddling really the flat line here.  What  is driving this?  Is it really concerns about a trade war with China?   We've got more after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  This is an interesting story, everyone.  Russia vowing to respond  harshly to the U.S. expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats.  Their foreign  ministry even accusing the U.S. of blackmailing other countries to expel  Russian diplomat.</p><p>Our Ashley Webster has been all over the story, of course, it starts in the  U.K. --</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  It does.</p><p>REGAN:  -- with nerve gas in an ex-Russian spy.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I mean, on outrageous attack of a nerve agent on British soil,  that's a Russian nerve agent.  I think what's come out of this is a couple  things.  I think Vladmir Putin has totally miscalculated what's happened  here.</p><p>The Brits, I think there is a theory out there, Trish, that Britain is  leaving the E.U., that there's a perception that Theresa May is a weakened  leader and that that has propelled the Russians to take these kinds of  steps, to test the resolve.  If that is the case, terrible mistake because  look what happened, 27 countries now have kicked out more than 140 Russian  diplomats.  The U.N. expelling seven Russian diplomats, we just heard in  reaction to this.  And I think it is certainly hurt Putin in certain ways.</p><p>There are those in Moscow that when they're going to look him, they're  going to say, \"Hmm, that wasn't a very good move.\"</p><p>REAGAN:  He wants to be -- right, on the world international stage and  basically he's losing that starring role by getting all of his diplomats  expelled but one would understand.  I mean, why do you want people in your  country that are capable of --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Spying?</p><p>REGAN:  -- doing what these people did in the U.K.?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Of course, everybody does it.  And the U.K., especially we've had  like 12 deaths in the U.K. that have Russian links.</p><p>REGAN:  And we also know that more than 100 people were exposed to this  nerve gas agent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, in this small town in the West of England, in Salisbury,  which, you know, the health authorities said, \"No, you'll be OK.\"  Then  they said, \"You may want to stop wiping your cell phones and washing your  clothing.\"  It was amid to this day, there very, you know, there are quite  a few people just say, \"Well, I don't know.  What are the health risks of  this?\"</p><p>But the bottom line is the other point I wanted to make about Putin and  Russia is this is the biggest blow to their spy network on the west,  multinational blows since the Cold War.  I mean, that has severely hurt  their spy network.</p><p>Look at the U.S., 60 diplomats gone, 48.  The closing of consulate in  Seattle, because it's close to Boeing, it's close to a submarine base  there.  That hurts.  That definitely hurts Russia's spy network.  It's not  going to kill it but it's going to make it pretty painful.</p><p>REGAN:  Now, they're trying to retaliate.</p><p>WEBSTER:  They will.</p><p>REGAN:  Meaning?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Meaning that they'll do it tit-to-tat.  The bottom line is Russia  is the big loser here.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  I would say and, you know, I wonder how this sits with some  members of the Democratic Party that keeps saying this administration is an  easy on Russia.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  You're telling me this is the biggest hit to their spy network --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Since the Cold War.</p><p>REGAN:  -- since the Cold War.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  It is significant and I think Putin totally did not expect  the United States to kick out 60 diplomats.  That's a high number.</p><p>The U.K. kicked out 23.  That was a very aggressive move.  It was  appropriate, I believe.  But it certainly was, I think, a shot to Moscow.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  And more and more countries are following the same way,  Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, good.  Good.</p><p>REGAN:  Good.  Ashley, thank you so much.</p><p>We got the markets mixed right now although we are trading higher by about  57 points there on the Dow.  Stocks swinging around here rather wildly but  doesn't this always happen right around 2:00?</p><p>Nicole Petallides has more, down at the New York Stock Exchange for us.</p><p>Hey, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  As you said,  we've seen the volatility this afternoon, the most afternoons around this  time gets pretty wild.  Right now, we're up 41 points, off our earlier  highs but it's nice to see some arrows up, with up arrow after last week  where we saw the big sell-off of more than 1400 points.</p><p>Yesterday, nearly 700 point gain and we're holding on to the green just for  the Dow.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 have moved into the red.</p><p>Tech stocks, also financial stocks are coming under some pressure.  Well,  financials are mixed, I should say, tech, energy, and industrials are under  pressure.</p><p>I wanted to get to general electric.  The Buffett bounce.  There is  speculation that Warren Buffett's Berkshire has a way may be getting back  into G.E. after jumping out last year.</p><p>Of course, G.E., over the last 12 months down 56 percent.  It's been a big  dog.  And now there is word that they might be back in in amassing a big  stake.</p><p>Now, of course, General Electric, no comment.  Nobody is commenting.  But  look at the stock, though, it's up 5.5 percent today.  So, we'll see what  happens there but it's certainly getting a nice big boost for today. It's  the worst performer on the Dow this year.</p><p>And then just take a pick at that winners of Dow Jones Industrial Average  today, at this moment and that would be Nike, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Verizon,  Pfizer.  You see some up arrows here as everybody just takes a breather  about those trade war worries at least for the moment.</p><p>Back to you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  I encourage them to take a big breather, a big one because we have  to deal with this now, head-on, or we're going to see a real problem 10  years from now that we don't want.</p><p>Anyway, Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.</p><p>Paul Ryan, everyone, is forced to deny that he is stepping down as House  Speaker after a resignation rumor goes rampant.  It does open the door to  this big question, are both parties in need of new blood, new leadership,  as we head into the midterms?</p><p>Our panel debates it for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Ryan's office said the Speaker is not resigning.  This, after  reports surface last night the Republican leader may be stepping down.  One  Congressman even suggested that Whip Steve Scalise would be elected to  replace.</p><p>All these rumors out there and, well, they're just rumors but they give beg  the question.  Is it time for a shake-up in leadership for both parties?</p><p>Joining me right now, Fox News Contributor, Jessica Tarlov, and American  Majority CEO, Ned Ryun.  I think you two are going to be in agreement on  this one</p><p>JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's will the first time.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.</p><p>NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO:  Maybe.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, let me start with you, Jessica.  The Democratic Party, and I  think this is obvious to everyone given all the Marie Antoinette-like  comments Nancy Pelosi has been making, do they need a shake-up? </p><p>TARLOV:  I think they're going to end up with a shake-up.  I am a big fan  of Nancy Pelosi.  I think she has been long-term wonderful for the party.</p><p>REGAN:  You're one and only?</p><p>TARLOV:  What?  No, no, there are like 10 of us.  No, what she did was  getting the ACA passed and she's also done a prolific fund-raiser for the  party, which we all know is incredibly important.  Says a lot about that.   But with the leadership challenge the last time around from Tim Ryan and  with people like Conor Lamb getting elected all over the country, I think  there is going to be shift and a lot of pressure to go younger and more  progressive.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  I think that we are seeing that and it's probably the healthy  thing for that party.  Now, in terms of the Republicans, one of the biggest  complaints, I know you have had, Ned, is that Republicans ala Paul Ryan,  are not fully on board with the Trump administration's agenda and they're  very reluctant to come around on a lot of things.  With that in mind, do  they also need a change in leadership?</p><p>RYUN:  Well, I will say this, I mean, these rumors of Paul Ryan resigning  are fake news.  I talked with multiple members of Congress and they said  fake news.</p><p>One of them asked him point-blank, \"Are you going to resign?\"  And he said,  \"Absolutely not.\"  So, I don't think you're going to see a leadership  change anytime soon on the House side.</p><p>But, Trish, I think this whole omnibus bill is a sign that Congress is  broken.  And if you want to talk about leadership that needs to change,  Congress is broken because Mitch McConnell is basically letting the  Democrats help run the Senate with him.</p><p>I honestly think some days, Trish, that we have joint majority leaders with  Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell and one ruling class swamp party.   Because let's face it, a lot of GOP Senators they quite frankly like this  broken Congress.  They can help out their crony special interests buddies  and tuck away the special earmarks in 2200 page bills that nobody reads.   And all of a sudden, look what happens, we have 1.3 trillion omnibus bills.</p><p>So, if you were to ask me, is leadership change needed?  Yes, absolutely.</p><p>The House actually has been operating like it should be.  The Senate is  completely broken and I blame Mitch McConnell for it.</p><p>REGAN:  You do.  Do you think that the Democrats should also make a shift  then?</p><p>RYUN:  No, please, dear God.  Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.</p><p>TARLOV:  That's always what Republican say.</p><p>RYUN:  Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.  She is great for us.   She is writing our attack ads.  Between she and Hillary with crumbs,  deplorable, backwards Trump voters.  I mean, this, in all seriousness,  though Trish, this is a problem for Democrat in those 10 red states where  you have Democrat's Senators running for re-election.</p><p>Hillary and Nancy Pelosi and are writing Republican attack ads for the  midterms.</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes, I would add to that, and I agree with you when you said  Claire McCaskill being incredibly outspoken about Hillary Clinton's  comments.</p><p>RYUN:  Yes.</p><p>TARLOV:  And saying you shouldn't insult anybody but certainly don't be  insulting anyone in my state.  You know, it's just in a deep red state.   And we do have 10 up for re-election.</p><p>I would ask this on the Paul Ryan side of things that there are kind of two  sides to this coin.  Yes, you ask him point-blank what's he is going to do  but there have been a lot of surprise resignations.</p><p>Jason Chaffetz, I don't -- Trey Gowdy not going to run for re-election.   There are a lot committee heads on the Republican side who are not going to  run again.  And we are forgetting as well, Paul Ryan didn't even want this  job.</p><p>REGAN:  That's right.</p><p>TARLOV:  Remember, when he begrudgingly took in and he was like, well, I  want to make sure that I can spend time with me family.  So, under these  circumstances when he's pushing forward an agenda that the President really  doesn't have much interest in it, I can see why he might want to bow out  gracefully before.</p><p>REGAN:  It's kind of thankless job, right, Ned?  I mean, you know, you  either, you know, buy into what the President is doing, I think it's been  hard for him.  I think it's been hard for a lot of Republican there because  they're kind of, \"I don't know if I like this.  I don't know if I like  where it's going.\"  And I worry, much as you do, I think, Ned, it's the  swamp influence that they have --</p><p>RYUN:  It is.</p><p>TARLOV:  -- the ear of many corporations and lobbyists that have their own  interests at stake.  And so, suddenly everybody is saying, \"Whoa, we have a  huge trade war coming, thanks to President Trump and his administration.\"   And so, they're fighting back against that.  When we all know that if we  don't start to confront the reality of what China is doing now, it's going  to be our kids that are paying the price, Ned.</p><p>RYUN:  Absolutely.  You know, I think we're already -- China has already  declared economic warfare on us.  I think people just wake up to that fact.   But no, you're right and, Trish, you've kind of alluded to this just now.</p><p>The interests of Corporate America in the American people, the American  working class are not always aligns and the problem here that you see in  Republican politics and I know even in Democrat politics, a lot of the big  donors to these parties are from corporate interests.  They are not aligned  with American voter.  So, there's no alignment between Trump with the  outside devolve power from D.C., drain the swamp.</p><p>I mean, again, this omnibus bill had nothing to do with draining the swamp.   It was actually feeding the swamp.  It was a triumph from the swamp but it  goes back to some of the structural problems with in party politics of  who's actually footing the bill, who's funding things </p><p>And I tell you want?  When it comes down to the down to leadership, there  are a lot of people with corporate interests, special interests that are  right there in your ear whispering, \"You want to do this, you want next big  check, you need to do this.\"  And sadly, this is what continues to happen  in D.C. year after year.</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes, that is interesting, though, that you point that out about  Corporate America not being on the same page as the American voter.  When  you saw the Republican bill with big slashes to the corporate tax rate but  not to the individual --</p><p>REGAN:  They gave individuals a great, great deal, too.  The only  individuals that --</p><p>TARLOV: -- a lot of people are not benefiting from that.</p><p>REGAN:  -- we are high earner in New York and California.</p><p>RYUN:  Jessica, no complaints.</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  But I would say, we need to do that on the corporate side.  And  they did give a pretty big one to the -- that's a story for another day.</p><p>TARLOV:  Another segment.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you, Jessica. </p><p>TARLOV:  Thanks, Trish.  Welcome back.</p><p>REGAN:  It's good to see you guys.  It's good to be back.</p><p>Anyway, we're going to look at this because the court battle underway right  now to decide the fate of AT&amp;T and Time Warner is heating up.  We're going  to have some details for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Department of Justice is attempting to block the potential $85  billion merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner.  They're in court today, right  now.</p><p>For more, we're going to Connell McShane.  Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Well, hey, Trish.  We have  quite a face-off in the courtroom earlier today between Warren Schlichting,  is a guys and Executive at Sling T.V., which own by Dish network, and an  attorney for the company Daniel Petrocelli is representing AT&amp;T and Time  Warner.</p><p>Schlichting is a government witness.  He testified yesterday here in court  that Turner program and all the networks' Turner control, DCO, AT&amp;T, CNN,  all the rest, that it's a must for Sling and for Dish Network.  But today,  there was a challenge to that.  That's the real question, coming up on the  screen is, are these Turner Networks really must have programming?</p><p>Petrocelli was interesting in the way he did it.  He used the quote from  Charlie Ergen, the founder, kind of against his own employe saying, that he  had said Ergen, \"CNN may and must have programming in 20 years ago but it's  not anymore.  Schlichting response that, \"I call that negotiating in the  press.\"  And they kind of have similar conversation, Trish, about sports  programming and back and forth and went between the two.</p><p>As we move now into the afternoon session as Schlichting wraps up, we  expect to hear from the government's next witness in this trial, which  could be a very interesting witness and expected to be a hostile one, the  Turner Chairman, John Martin.  We'll see if any of his past words  particularly in contract negotiations can be used against him.</p><p>That still to come report back later.  But for now, back to you.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, interesting stuff.  Connell, Thank you so much.</p><p>I have to say, it's pretty good to be back.  It's great to be back in FBN.   I had a wonderful week off, a vacation with my family.  We went all the way  to Hawaii, believe or not and I wanted to show this because this is my  daughter, Alexandra, and she begged us for surfing lessons.</p><p>She's only eight years old.  You may have seen her on the show.  She talked  about her Brownie, Girl Scout cookie sales recently.  Well, she was on that  surfboard.  Oh my goodness.</p><p>She got up on this thing and we thought ourselves, \"Are we really good  parents.\"  She is quite a kid.</p><p>The other two were not as enthused about the surfing thing, I totally get  it, Elizabeth and Jamie.  I don't think you could get me on one of those  things either, I'll be honest.  People asked me if I took that video.  I'm  like, \"Are you kidding me?  Me on a surfboard?</p><p>That will be the day.  Liz Claman, over to you.  Down, gosh, 109.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  I know, exactly.  So, we have more  than 250-point gain earlier gone.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good to be back.   Anyway, we've got a brief jumping session right now all over the place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking news, everyone, we've got Dow that's swinging back and forth, in  and out in negative territory.  It was up quite a bit earlier in the  session, more than 200 now.  Down to the flat line and now back up 50.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Investors are continuing to weigh basically the impact of the Trump  administration's aggressive approach to China.  They're not sure how it's  all been to turn out.  We're going to dive in to that over the next hour.   So you can think about how you should be interpreting this news and what is  going to mean for the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I am Trish Regan.  Welcome to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.  It is great to be  back all the way from Hawaii.  I'll have a little more on that at the end  of the show.</p><p> But meanwhile, let's talk about this trade war that everybody is so fearful  about.  I'll tell you, they're starting to basically come to grips with it.   You've got fears are starting to ease.  You're starting to see that the  U.S. and China begin negotiations to address the tensions that had rocked  global markets in recent weeks.</p><p> Investors are still trying to digest of the news at last to record sell- off, which is followed by a sharp rebound, nice to see yesterday.  And  we're going to be watching here all this drama that's unfolding right up  until the closing bell.  But I will ask yet again, are these markets  overreacting?  I think so.  We've got some intel.</p><p> Plus, Facebook woes continue to pile on as U.S. officials say they are  investigating the social network over its controversial privacy policies.   And Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg out there finally feeling a little bit of  heat.  Now reports say he will testify before Congress.  Is this beginning  or the end for this company, for the Facebook founder?  We have more coming  up.</p><p> But first, back to our top story, this trade dispute with China.  Will  investors give President Trump a fair deal in terms of these markets?  Will  China give him a fair deal in terms of trade?</p><p> Joining me right now, Hudson Institute Senior Fellow, Michael Pillsbury,  along with our very own Charles Payne.  It's good to see you both.</p><p> Michael, I'll start with you.  You know, look, people say the Trump  administration is anti-free trade.  It seems like kind of a drastic,  drastic criticism, especially, I think, if you allow China to continue on  the path it is you're going to wake up a decade from now, we're going to be  the next France.  They're going to be the hegemonic power in the world  taking the place of the USA.  So, with that in mind, what needs to happen  so that things start to shake out in a more fair way?</p><p> MICHAEL PILLSBURY, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE:  Well, the first thing  is China has got to take President Trump seriously, and they've done that.   I think they've made some fairly major concessions in the last few days.   That's probably why the market is calming down.</p><p> President Trump did not really declare a trade war at all.  He had very,  very limited measures, measures that were talked about for many years.  The  only thing is he's actually doing it, instead of just talking about it.   But I don't see a really harsh pushback from the Chinese.</p><p> Their turnoffs against the steel and aluminum tariffs were very small, $3  billion to match $3 billion.  They haven't only replied to this yet.  But  they have certainly offered to negotiate, and so some very conciliatory  things almost an apology, Trish, where they say, \"We were willing to open  up our market, we're willing to open up some more sectors to foreign  investment.\"  So, I think, as you say, it's been really exaggerated.</p><p> And President Trump, he's probably showing that he's a master negotiator  here.  He's preserving his ties with China, which he needs for North Korea  and getting their attention to start these negotiations.  So, overall, I  think, it's a pretty optimistic outcome over the last three or four days.   It could have gone much differently.</p><p> REGAN:  Charles, one of the things that frustrated me about China and has  over the last number of years since I've, frankly, been following all of  this is that China really does take advantage of us and U.S. companies.   And you know what?  The CEOs, they don't care because they want access to  that Chinese market because it's going to be great for their quarterly  results.</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  And, frankly, President Obama didn't really care so much either  because, I think, there's been such a concentration by so many in  Washington on the next election, much like CEOs are focused on the next  quarter's results that they don't appreciate the context of what's going on  here.  They don't appreciate how this is all going to affect our population  down the road, our kids, Charles, if we allow China to continue stealing  our technology and making such onerous demands on our companies.</p><p> PAYNE:  You know, I agree with you 1000 percent.  Now, listen, everyone  gives a lip service.  You know, there are endless articles where Jack Lew,  you know, was livid about the circumstances and he talked about them --</p><p>PILLSBURY:  That's right.</p><p> PAYNE:  -- but they never offered solutions.  They never had any sort of  real threat against China that will make China curb their predatory  actions.  And let's face it, when China joined the World Trade Organization  that was going to make them a legitimate player and follow all the rules.   Of course, they didn't follow the rules.  And who can blame China?  They  are.</p><p> You started to show up talking about their grand ambitions.  They do have  grand ambitions.  And right now, by 2026, their economy could be bigger  than ours.</p><p> And, you know, couple India and other Asian nations, and America starts to  falls into the sort of zone where Europe is.  And Europe can't turn around.   They're done unfortunately.  And so, if we're going to make a stand, we  have to make a stand at this very point.</p><p> And, you know, one example I like to use Trish, is a G.M. Buick division  has an SUV, the Envision.  The Envision is only made in Singapore, right,  in Shanghai, rather.  And it's exported to this country.  It was a big hit  last year.</p><p> Now, that's great for General Motors and their shareholders.  It's great  for the American consumers who probably get a pretty good car at a pretty  good price.  And it's great for the Chinese worker who made it.  There's  one person missing from the equation and that's the American factory  worker, auto worker who might have otherwise had made this product.  And  that's why there's a different bifurcation.</p><p> You know, China hasn't pushed back but Wall Street has pushed back.  Last  week, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, every day at 2:00, approximately  2:00, a gigantic sell program went off.  Ultimately it took 1200 Dow points  out of the market.  There was no new news at 2:00.</p><p> Every single day at that point we saw the markets fell off dramatically.  I  think Wall Street has been pushing back on this a lot harder than China  has.</p><p> REGAN:  Look, you know, Michael, I get Wall Street, but what I think is a  critical here is that we not look at the day-to-day, and I would remind  traders not to look at the day-to-day because I'll tell you, 10 years from  now you're going to wake up and had a heck of a problem on your hand if you  don't deal with the China stuff now.  So if we tick a little pain along the  way, we will be better off.  It is mind-boggling to me.</p><p> I mean, they're out creating their version of the WTO.  They're investing  in many economies in Latin America, in Pakistan, in Iran --</p><p>PILLSBURY:  Africa.</p><p> REGAN:  -- or Russia, Africa as well, places that they can seek commodity  resources in.  I mean, they have a very definite plan to be the world's  largest economic power and quite perhaps possibly the world's largest  military power.  So, if we don't wake up and deal with that at some point,  Michael, I think we're going to have much bigger problems on our hands than  600-point drop in the Dow.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  I agree.  I agree with Charles, too.  As you know, I wrote a  book about this three years ago, which is widely criticized as being  alarmist.</p><p> And now President Trump has not only accepted some of the premises, he's  released a much better report, if I may say so, than my book just last  week.  It's 250 pages long.  Example after example after example of what  President Obama used to call the \"gangsterization\" of our companies.   That's why President Trump is moving forward on several fronts.  It's not  just tariffs.  It's this new suit at the WTO in Geneva.</p><p> There's number of other measures.  And, frankly, there is bipartisan  support for what he is doing.  Senator Chuck Schumer is often seen as enemy  of the President, very quickly endorsed President Trump last Thursday on  the tightening up on technology purchases here in the United States.</p><p> The bill has attracted the co-sponsorship of Dianne Feinstein who would be  happy to call a progressive liberal, I think.  So this problem has gone on  for so long that just these limited steps seems to be producing a lot of  bipartisan support.  That's why the day-to-day fluctuation in the market  really kind of a shortsighted.  And some people who didn't listen are  probably losing money now.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  Well, they'll make it up.  Very quickly, Charles, there are  some examples, I think, out there of Chinese companies now looking to  invest in the U.S. because, look, we're not going to continue with the  current status quo.</p><p> PAYNE:  Absolutely.  Well, you know, two news items today.  One is a  smaller company, but it's really important, JinkoSolar, the fourth largest  solar manufacturer in the world that Chinese company probably will be  breaking ground here.  It becomes official today in Jacksonville, $50  million project, 400,000 square feet.</p><p> Here is the most important thing.  This comes after President Trump levied  the 30 percent tariff on their product.  So now they're going to bring and  manufacturing here and of course --</p><p> REGAN:  They're going to bring it here?</p><p> PAYNE:  -- we know Foxconn, of course, is building out big time.  They made  an acquisition today.  And while there are pros and cons to it, people need  to pay attention.</p><p> REGAN:  Michael, Charles, good to see you guys.</p><p> PAYNE:  You got it.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you so much.  Good perspective.  And make sure, everyone,  watch Charles on \"Making Money\" tonight, 6:00 p.m. Eastern right here on  Fox Business.</p><p> Turning to our other top story, Facebook says it will not confirm reports  that CEO, Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress about how Facebook  collects and stores user data.  But Mr. Zuckerberg says he will not appear  before the U.K. parliament.  All of this as we have uncovered video from  eight years ago of Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, warning Mark Zuckerberg  and other tech CEOs about user privacy.</p><p> For the latest, let's go right now to Deirdre Bolton who has been following  the story from day one.  Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Trish, Facebook is under  pressure.  It is facing investigations from 37 states attorneys general,  including tech-heavy states California, Massachusetts, New York.  It is  also now facing specific lawsuits just this morning from counties, such as  IllinoisCook County, that includes Chicago and surrounding areas.</p><p> So, basically those areas are just joining this legal fight against  Facebook and Cambridge Analytica over the misuse of data scraped from  social media profiles claiming that both companies violated state fraud  law.  So that is the paperwork from Cook County, Illinois.  So this lawsuit  claims that Cambridge Analytica tricked Facebook users with quizzes and  that Facebook knew, this is really serious, Trish, this accusation, and did  nothing to stop it.</p><p> Now, as you point it out, Steve Jobs, seemed to have a premonition about  this relationship between tech and privacy getting more cloudy.  Here is  what he said eight years ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVE JOBS, CO-FOUNDER, APPLE:  The Silicon Valley is not monolithic.   We've always had a very different view of privacy than some of our  colleagues in the Valley.  We take privacy extremely seriously.  And some  people want to share more data than other people do.</p><p> Ask them.  Ask them every time.  Make them tell you to stop asking them, if  they get tired of you asking them.  Let them know precisely what you're  going to do with their data.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg wishes he had seen that or heard that or  paid attention because that Cook County lawsuit specifically states  \"Facebook is not a social media company, it is the largest data mining  operation in existence.\"  It further claims that Facebook worked to keep  developers on its platform plying them with sensitive data at the expense  of its users' privacy.</p><p> The Federal Trade Commission also investigating Facebook.  It signaled  today that its probe of the company is broad.  So that's a key word because  it's never what a company wants to hear.  It implies impending regulation.</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg may also testify on Capitol Hill not clear yet.  He has  been invited to a hearing on April 10th.  If he goes, he's going to be  asked questions about Facebook's policies regarding protection and  monitoring of consumer data.</p><p> Senator Grassley is the one who issue the invitation, also extended the  same to Google's CEO and Twitter's CEO.  But essentially, Trish, this opens  up huge questions for big tech, for privacy, for potential regulation.  All  of these companies right away, they have to spend more money on their legal  teams.  Probably Mark Zuckerberg has an extra direct report because of this  and it is certainly going to be a distraction to the way that they are  trying to run their normal businesses.</p><p> Trish, back to you.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's their fault.  Thank you very much, Deirdre.</p><p> BOLTON:  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  Joining me right now for more analysis, \"Bullseye Brief\" Publisher  and Founder and Author, Adam Johnson, along with Belpointe Chief  Strategist, David Nelson.</p><p> Is this going to be the end of Mark Zuckerberg?</p><p> ADAM JOHNSON, AUTHOR, \"BULLSEYE BRIEF\" PUBLISHER AND AUTHOR:  It's starting  to look like it.  And I tell you something, Trish, there's a real trust  problem which Zuckerberg himself said when he went on CNN in his t-shirt  looking all dough-eyed for all of us to try to sound contrite.  The problem  is we don't necessarily trust that our data is safe.  That's number one.</p><p> Number two, we don't necessarily trust that what's in our news feed is  accurate because of the fake news.  And number three, it's kind of hard for  me, and I would imagine a lot of other people, to necessarily trust a  company that takes all our data, all our hard work, our intellectual  capital, all the effort that we put into posting, sells that to other  people for billions of dollars, and all we get back in return is likes.   I'm sorry, but that doesn't breed trust.</p><p> REGAN:  You have a plan for that.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  You have some suggestions to Mr. Zuckerberg.</p><p> JOHNSON:  I do.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's get to that in a second.  But first of all, in terms of this  company, you know, look, I was on vacation this week.  And I used Facebook  more than I would on a regular basis because, you know, I'm posting  pictures of the kids.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Sure.</p><p> REGAN:  And all of that good stuff.  And I thought, you know, I don't know  if I want to be on this right now.  I don't know if anybody wants to be on  this right now because of these violations into our privacy, which, you  know, he's a little contrite there, saying, \"Oh, yes, shouldn't happen.   It's our responsibility.\"</p><p> This is a company, David, that makes money off being able to target ads so  specifically.  They're going to want to know everything they can about  Trish Regan, Adam Johnson, and David Nelson.</p><p> DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  So that they can target those ads.  And I don't know if any of us  should be OK with that.</p><p> NELSON:  Sure.  Big data is big money and that's what this is about.  And I  think what we're finding out is there's nothing social in that social  media.  This is a data mining operation like --</p><p> JOHNSON:  It's one-sided, right?</p><p> NELSON:  -- it's kind of one-sided.  They have the data and they use it.   And for Mark Zuckerberg not, you know, agreeing to appear, he obviously has  aspirations for something beyond Facebook.  He did a tour in the country,  almost in campaign style.</p><p> And nobody looks good in front of the Senate subcommittee.  You start to  look like Michael Corleone and you try to explain that you're just a CEO of  an olive oil company.  He's trying to deflect this, putting the CTO, those  Chief Technology Officers, in front of Congress or parliament.  That's not  going to cut it.  People want some answers.</p><p> And I think there are going to be some solutions.  I was wrong last week  when I thought that with the genie out of the bottle, this business model  wouldn't change.  Obviously it's going to change.  Regulation is going to  change it.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, yes, I mean, it has to change.  And you're right, I mean, the  news feed being fake, our information being compromised.  You think there's  a way for them to fix this so that their \"users,\" you wouldn't even call  them that, would actually have some skin in the game?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  How would you change that?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, I cut a video yesterday and I posted out on Twitter and  Facebook and link.  Then it got a little bit of traction.  I said, \"Stop  calling us users for starters, Mark.  Why don't you start calling us  partners and actually make us partners by giving us the same kind of upside  that the cryptocurrency markets give us.\"  In other words, they in all  their brilliance over at Facebook have all these algorithms.</p><p> \"So why don't you use your algorithms, Mark, to figure out what makes a  great post?  Maybe it's a number of likes, cute puppies, thoughtful social  commentary.  Whatever it is, use all of that to award our posts with face  coins and then let us redeem face coin on Facebook for goods and services.   And by the way, if we don't want to do that let's trade it, the same way we  trade bitcoin and get money for it.\"  In other words, create a rewards  point system so that we are partners.  And that is interesting --</p><p> REGAN:  But that would cost some money.</p><p> JOHNSON:  -- yes, exactly.</p><p> REGAN:  It would cost some money if they're the ones putting the good and  services.</p><p> JOHNSON:  That's right.</p><p> REGAN:  But the membership, you know, you think about --</p><p> NELSON:  But regulations cost money.</p><p> REGAN:  -- right, they give you membership rewards or these credit card  companies, or hotel companies, airline companies, if you spend a certain  amount of money with them, or fly with them, or travel with them you get  something in return.</p><p> JOHNSON:  And Facebook doesn't give us anything.</p><p> REGAN:  They use all our contact.</p><p> NELSON:  In fact, they're stealing and that's it and we're not getting a  dime for it.</p><p> JOHNSON:  All we get are likes.</p><p> NELSON:  We're giving it to them.  I don't know if they're stealing it.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> NELSON:  But I don't know a face coin is going to work.  But certainly, you  know, a rewards program something like that could work.  There's actually  some business models out there, seeking out.</p><p> There's a place where financial advisors go out and put outposts.  And if  they have enough viewers on that they actually get paid for that.  They  would get paid for our likes.  And maybe as of dislike, maybe you get some  points taken away.  Maybe that would eliminate some of those occupy  Democrat political, you know, hand grenades that I see post in my Facebook  page.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Now you're talking like the SAT test where you get penalized for  random answers.  But they can figure this stuff out.  They have the  algorithms</p><p> REGAN:  Well, yes, they certainly can.  I don't think there has been any  willingness to.  We haven't even started about how the, you know, ISIS  terrorists want to use social media.</p><p> NELSON:  The ramifications beyond Facebook are pretty large.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.</p><p> NELSON:  This affects Google and so many others.</p><p> REGAN:  Good stuff.  Adam, David, thank you so much.</p><p> NELSON:  Thanks, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Kim Jong-un reportedly making a secret trip to China,  his first foreign trip since taking power of the kingdom there in 2011.   What does this visit mean for the U.S.?  We're on it.  Stay with us.  We'll  see you here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Everyone, get this, a heavily guarded mysterious train  rolled into Beijing on Monday.  And officials believe that it may have been  carrying none other than North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.  A visit to  the Chinese capital would mark Kim's first trip beyond North Korean borders  since taking power back in 2011.  So if these reports are true, why did he  make the trip?  Why did he make it now?</p><p> Joining me with analysis, \"Nuclear Showdown\" Author, Gordon Chang.  Gordon,  always good to see you.  You are the guy to talk to about North Korea and  China.  So what your take on this?  Did it happen and why did he do it?</p><p> GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN\":  Yes, I think it certainly  happened.  And I think the reason why Kim went to Beijing was because  Beijing demanded that he go there.</p><p> You got to remember that Kim was going to make his first foreign trip to  South Korea, to go south of the military demarcation line in the  demilitarize zone to the peace house, which is in South Korea.  And then  his second foreign trip was going to be seeing President Trump.  The  Chinese realized they were being marginalized.  And so, essentially what  they said to Kim was, \"You come to Beijing or else.\"</p><p> REGAN:  What do you think will come of this?</p><p> CHANG:  I don't know what's going to happen with the Trump-Kim summit.  But  I think that it was very good for President Trump to do that because he is  cutting out the Chinese.  And the Chinese over this century have really  been a maligned influence.  They have been helping the North Korean nuclear  weapons effort as well as ballistic missile program.</p><p> And what Trump decided to do is he was not going to put up with that, he  was going to talk to Kim Jong-un directly.  And you've got to remember,  Trish, this is occurring at the same time as the trade disputes.</p><p> Now, the Chinese have heard American Presidents threaten trade actions, but  they haven't really seen anyone carry through.  And President Trump is  carrying through.  And the Chinese right now are probably pretty  bewildered.  They got both Kim and Trump giving them a hard time.</p><p> REGAN:  Simultaneously, you have John Bolton now as part of the  administration as well and he, Ambassador Bolton has made very clear,  certainly to me in the past, he would like to see the reunification of the  North Korean peninsula and one would have to assume that Kim Jong-un would  be on the losing side of that deal.  So, are the Chinese now being caught  off guard or a bit more nervous?  How does that affect everything that's  going on because they may be looking at it and saying, \"Gosh, you know, the  U.S. is playing tough now on trade?\"  Maybe somehow trying to court Kim  Jong-un in a way that we don't understand, and in fact, the U.S. may wind  up having a much bigger presence right next door to us than we anticipated,  Gordon?</p><p> CHANG:  Yes, you know, John Bolton as National security advisor and Mike  Pompeo as Secretary of State really round out of the war Cabinet.  And, you  know, you look at what Bolton said about the main problem in the world,  it's China and Russia.  And so, Beijing right now has got to understand  that they've got a new sheriff in town, and that Bolton is going to push  Trump in directions that Trump would go anyway.</p><p> You know, Trump started out his administration by trying to placate the  Chinese, bringing them on board, getting them to help on North Korea.  They  didn't do that.  So, you know, right now, you have to a consensus --</p><p> REGAN:  And he said he was a little disappointed in that.  That he had  hoped to get more cooperation from China.</p><p> CHANG:  -- yes.  And we know from the President's tweets that he is not  only -- of course, he was first disappointed but now angry and frustrated.   You have Bolton coming in, Pompeo coming in.  It's a new landscape for the  Chinese.</p><p> And right now, they're seeing something that they have never faced before.</p><p> REGAN:  Meaning?</p><p> CHANG:  Well, meaning that there's now an administration that is willing to  hold them responsible for really predatory mercantilist and dangerous  activities around the world.  And so, you know, they're seeing that the  U.S. is going to impose costs on China and deal with China as well as  Moscow in a way that we haven't seen since the end of the Cold War.  So I  think you have now in Beijing, people are saying who lost America, as a  \"Washington Post\" correspondent recently wrote about a week ago.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's about time.  They've been getting away with a whole lot  for much too long.</p><p> CHANG:  It's a about time.</p><p> REGAN:  Anyway, Gordon Chang, it's good to see you.  Appreciate your  analysis.</p><p> CHANG:  Thanks, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  For the first time in 70 years, the 2020 census is going to include  a question about citizenship.  Democrats are blasting this move, but is it  legal?  We have some intel as the market trades up 25 points right now on  the Dow.  See you right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  And on the market, it took a dip into negative territory.  So,  we're watching it very carefully.  It's been a rather volatile session all  over the place here.</p><p> Investors are still trying to come to grips with what's exactly this trade  dispute with China will mean.</p><p> In the mean time, we're watching another story here and that's the 2020  census, which is now expected to include a question about citizenship  status.  The population count take in every 10 years is required by the  Constitutions and it is use to determine the number of seats each state has  in the House.  So, it's important from that perspective as well as how  federal funds are distributed.</p><p> Democrats are condemning this move saying it would actually discourage  immigrants from responding, which would cause a population undercount and  therefore they wouldn't able to have as many representatives, say, from  state like California.  California's attorney general is suing the Trump  Administration saying and \"including a citizenship question on the 2020  census is not a bad idea, it is illegal.\"</p><p> Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano, with his sense of whether it is, in fact, legal or not.  Where  do you come out?</p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  It is legal to  ask because the federal government has a legitimate interest in knowing  that but the government cannot compel the answer from the person asked  because we have the right to remain silent.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  So then the California A.G. really doesn't have much of a  case.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  First of all, it's premature because Congress hasn't decided  this yet.  This is just a proposal from the Commerce Department, which must  file its proposal by the end of this week and they filed it last night.</p><p>Congress is not in session for the next two weeks.  They're going to debate  this all over again when Congress is back there.  But the only thing under  the Constitution of the government can compel any answer to is how many  human beings lives in this house and how many bathrooms you have?  What is  your education, what is your nationality, and what is your citizenship?   Again, it can ask but it can't punish him for not answering.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  So, it seems to me then, it's fair to ask the question and  it's obviously an individual decision as to whether or not they want to  respond.  But assuming that California is right and all the people that are  here illegally decline to answer the question, does population count go  down and therefore does the number of representatives coming from a state  like California go down?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  That is a great question.  And that would be exquisitely  unfair to the rest of the country if California where to get more  representatives in the House of Representatives because of more illegal or  undocumented persons living in California.  That is not the intent of the  census and that is not the purpose of the headcount.  So the Federal  Government is going to have to find some other way to determine who is  legitimately, lawfully residing in California without compelling people to  answer.</p><p> Now, I think a lot of people will answer anyway.  I don't know if they'll  answer truthfully or not.  I think the Democrats do have an argument to  make the people here unlawfully are not going to answer truthfully because  they'll think it's going to trigger their deportation although this  questionnaires are anonymous.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  Different then, let's say, it was back when, you know,  during World War II and you were making a point to me off-camera that there  were times in history that we have used the census --</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  -- to actually find people?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  The Roosevelt Administration in the census of 1940 not  only asked if you're a citizen and asked your nationality.  And then when  FDR and his colleagues decided to incarcerate Japanese-Americans, they had  the data to find them.</p><p>Congress was so outraged by this.  But in 1947, FDR is dead, the war is  over.  That it enacted legislation prohibiting asking nationality but did  not prohibit asking citizenship.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Well, let's see what happens.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you, Judge.  Good to see you.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Good to see you.  Welcome back.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you.  It's good to be back.  Wow, lots of news going on.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  You could say that.  Any day, any week, Russia is vowing to  retaliate after President Trump expels 60 diplomats from the United States.   What will that include and will this finally put an end to talk that Trump  is too soft on Vladmir Putin?</p><p> Plus, we are following these markets.  We can see we've been all over the  place now, up 13 points, just straddling really the flat line here.  What  is driving this?  Is it really concerns about a trade war with China?   We've got more after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  This is an interesting story, everyone.  Russia vowing to respond  harshly to the U.S. expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats.  Their foreign  ministry even accusing the U.S. of blackmailing other countries to expel  Russian diplomat.</p><p> Our Ashley Webster has been all over the story, of course, it starts in the  U.K. --</p><p> ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  It does.</p><p> REGAN:  -- with nerve gas in an ex-Russian spy.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I mean, on outrageous attack of a nerve agent on British soil,  that's a Russian nerve agent.  I think what's come out of this is a couple  things.  I think Vladmir Putin has totally miscalculated what's happened  here.</p><p> The Brits, I think there is a theory out there, Trish, that Britain is  leaving the E.U., that there's a perception that Theresa May is a weakened  leader and that that has propelled the Russians to take these kinds of  steps, to test the resolve.  If that is the case, terrible mistake because  look what happened, 27 countries now have kicked out more than 140 Russian  diplomats.  The U.N. expelling seven Russian diplomats, we just heard in  reaction to this.  And I think it is certainly hurt Putin in certain ways.</p><p> There are those in Moscow that when they're going to look him, they're  going to say, \"Hmm, that wasn't a very good move.\"</p><p> REAGAN:  He wants to be -- right, on the world international stage and  basically he's losing that starring role by getting all of his diplomats  expelled but one would understand.  I mean, why do you want people in your  country that are capable of --</p><p> WEBSTER:  Spying?</p><p> REGAN:  -- doing what these people did in the U.K.?</p><p> WEBSTER:  Of course, everybody does it.  And the U.K., especially we've had  like 12 deaths in the U.K. that have Russian links.</p><p> REGAN:  And we also know that more than 100 people were exposed to this  nerve gas agent.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, in this small town in the West of England, in Salisbury,  which, you know, the health authorities said, \"No, you'll be OK.\"  Then  they said, \"You may want to stop wiping your cell phones and washing your  clothing.\"  It was amid to this day, there very, you know, there are quite  a few people just say, \"Well, I don't know.  What are the health risks of  this?\"</p><p> But the bottom line is the other point I wanted to make about Putin and  Russia is this is the biggest blow to their spy network on the west,  multinational blows since the Cold War.  I mean, that has severely hurt  their spy network.</p><p> Look at the U.S., 60 diplomats gone, 48.  The closing of consulate in  Seattle, because it's close to Boeing, it's close to a submarine base  there.  That hurts.  That definitely hurts Russia's spy network.  It's not  going to kill it but it's going to make it pretty painful.</p><p> REGAN:  Now, they're trying to retaliate.</p><p> WEBSTER:  They will.</p><p> REGAN:  Meaning?</p><p> WEBSTER:  Meaning that they'll do it tit-to-tat.  The bottom line is Russia  is the big loser here.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  I would say and, you know, I wonder how this sits with some  members of the Democratic Party that keeps saying this administration is an  easy on Russia.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  You're telling me this is the biggest hit to their spy network --</p><p> WEBSTER:  Since the Cold War.</p><p> REGAN:  -- since the Cold War.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  It is significant and I think Putin totally did not expect  the United States to kick out 60 diplomats.  That's a high number.</p><p> The U.K. kicked out 23.  That was a very aggressive move.  It was  appropriate, I believe.  But it certainly was, I think, a shot to Moscow.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  And more and more countries are following the same way,  Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, good.  Good.</p><p> REGAN:  Good.  Ashley, thank you so much.</p><p> We got the markets mixed right now although we are trading higher by about  57 points there on the Dow.  Stocks swinging around here rather wildly but  doesn't this always happen right around 2:00?</p><p> Nicole Petallides has more, down at the New York Stock Exchange for us.</p><p> Hey, Nicole.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  As you said,  we've seen the volatility this afternoon, the most afternoons around this  time gets pretty wild.  Right now, we're up 41 points, off our earlier  highs but it's nice to see some arrows up, with up arrow after last week  where we saw the big sell-off of more than 1400 points.</p><p> Yesterday, nearly 700 point gain and we're holding on to the green just for  the Dow.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 have moved into the red.</p><p> Tech stocks, also financial stocks are coming under some pressure.  Well,  financials are mixed, I should say, tech, energy, and industrials are under  pressure.</p><p> I wanted to get to general electric.  The Buffett bounce.  There is  speculation that Warren Buffett's Berkshire has a way may be getting back  into G.E. after jumping out last year.</p><p> Of course, G.E., over the last 12 months down 56 percent.  It's been a big  dog.  And now there is word that they might be back in in amassing a big  stake.</p><p> Now, of course, General Electric, no comment.  Nobody is commenting.  But  look at the stock, though, it's up 5.5 percent today.  So, we'll see what  happens there but it's certainly getting a nice big boost for today. It's  the worst performer on the Dow this year.</p><p> And then just take a pick at that winners of Dow Jones Industrial Average  today, at this moment and that would be Nike, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Verizon,  Pfizer.  You see some up arrows here as everybody just takes a breather  about those trade war worries at least for the moment.</p><p> Back to you, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  I encourage them to take a big breather, a big one because we have  to deal with this now, head-on, or we're going to see a real problem 10  years from now that we don't want.</p><p> Anyway, Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.</p><p> Paul Ryan, everyone, is forced to deny that he is stepping down as House  Speaker after a resignation rumor goes rampant.  It does open the door to  this big question, are both parties in need of new blood, new leadership,  as we head into the midterms?</p><p> Our panel debates it for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Ryan's office said the Speaker is not resigning.  This, after  reports surface last night the Republican leader may be stepping down.  One  Congressman even suggested that Whip Steve Scalise would be elected to  replace.</p><p> All these rumors out there and, well, they're just rumors but they give beg  the question.  Is it time for a shake-up in leadership for both parties?</p><p> Joining me right now, Fox News Contributor, Jessica Tarlov, and American  Majority CEO, Ned Ryun.  I think you two are going to be in agreement on  this one</p><p> JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's will the first time.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.</p><p> NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO:  Maybe.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, let me start with you, Jessica.  The Democratic Party, and I  think this is obvious to everyone given all the Marie Antoinette-like  comments Nancy Pelosi has been making, do they need a shake-up? </p><p> TARLOV:  I think they're going to end up with a shake-up.  I am a big fan  of Nancy Pelosi.  I think she has been long-term wonderful for the party.</p><p> REGAN:  You're one and only?</p><p> TARLOV:  What?  No, no, there are like 10 of us.  No, what she did was  getting the ACA passed and she's also done a prolific fund-raiser for the  party, which we all know is incredibly important.  Says a lot about that.   But with the leadership challenge the last time around from Tim Ryan and  with people like Conor Lamb getting elected all over the country, I think  there is going to be shift and a lot of pressure to go younger and more  progressive.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  I think that we are seeing that and it's probably the healthy  thing for that party.  Now, in terms of the Republicans, one of the biggest  complaints, I know you have had, Ned, is that Republicans ala Paul Ryan,  are not fully on board with the Trump administration's agenda and they're  very reluctant to come around on a lot of things.  With that in mind, do  they also need a change in leadership?</p><p> RYUN:  Well, I will say this, I mean, these rumors of Paul Ryan resigning  are fake news.  I talked with multiple members of Congress and they said  fake news.</p><p> One of them asked him point-blank, \"Are you going to resign?\"  And he said,  \"Absolutely not.\"  So, I don't think you're going to see a leadership  change anytime soon on the House side.</p><p> But, Trish, I think this whole omnibus bill is a sign that Congress is  broken.  And if you want to talk about leadership that needs to change,  Congress is broken because Mitch McConnell is basically letting the  Democrats help run the Senate with him.</p><p> I honestly think some days, Trish, that we have joint majority leaders with  Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell and one ruling class swamp party.   Because let's face it, a lot of GOP Senators they quite frankly like this  broken Congress.  They can help out their crony special interests buddies  and tuck away the special earmarks in 2200 page bills that nobody reads.   And all of a sudden, look what happens, we have 1.3 trillion omnibus bills.</p><p> So, if you were to ask me, is leadership change needed?  Yes, absolutely.</p><p> The House actually has been operating like it should be.  The Senate is  completely broken and I blame Mitch McConnell for it.</p><p> REGAN:  You do.  Do you think that the Democrats should also make a shift  then?</p><p> RYUN:  No, please, dear God.  Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.</p><p> TARLOV:  That's always what Republican say.</p><p> RYUN:  Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.  She is great for us.   She is writing our attack ads.  Between she and Hillary with crumbs,  deplorable, backwards Trump voters.  I mean, this, in all seriousness,  though Trish, this is a problem for Democrat in those 10 red states where  you have Democrat's Senators running for re-election.</p><p> Hillary and Nancy Pelosi and are writing Republican attack ads for the  midterms.</p><p> TARLOV:  Yes, I would add to that, and I agree with you when you said  Claire McCaskill being incredibly outspoken about Hillary Clinton's  comments.</p><p> RYUN:  Yes.</p><p> TARLOV:  And saying you shouldn't insult anybody but certainly don't be  insulting anyone in my state.  You know, it's just in a deep red state.   And we do have 10 up for re-election.</p><p> I would ask this on the Paul Ryan side of things that there are kind of two  sides to this coin.  Yes, you ask him point-blank what's he is going to do  but there have been a lot of surprise resignations.</p><p> Jason Chaffetz, I don't -- Trey Gowdy not going to run for re-election.   There are a lot committee heads on the Republican side who are not going to  run again.  And we are forgetting as well, Paul Ryan didn't even want this  job.</p><p> REGAN:  That's right.</p><p> TARLOV:  Remember, when he begrudgingly took in and he was like, well, I  want to make sure that I can spend time with me family.  So, under these  circumstances when he's pushing forward an agenda that the President really  doesn't have much interest in it, I can see why he might want to bow out  gracefully before.</p><p> REGAN:  It's kind of thankless job, right, Ned?  I mean, you know, you  either, you know, buy into what the President is doing, I think it's been  hard for him.  I think it's been hard for a lot of Republican there because  they're kind of, \"I don't know if I like this.  I don't know if I like  where it's going.\"  And I worry, much as you do, I think, Ned, it's the  swamp influence that they have --</p><p> RYUN:  It is.</p><p> TARLOV:  -- the ear of many corporations and lobbyists that have their own  interests at stake.  And so, suddenly everybody is saying, \"Whoa, we have a  huge trade war coming, thanks to President Trump and his administration.\"   And so, they're fighting back against that.  When we all know that if we  don't start to confront the reality of what China is doing now, it's going  to be our kids that are paying the price, Ned.</p><p> RYUN:  Absolutely.  You know, I think we're already -- China has already  declared economic warfare on us.  I think people just wake up to that fact.   But no, you're right and, Trish, you've kind of alluded to this just now.</p><p> The interests of Corporate America in the American people, the American  working class are not always aligns and the problem here that you see in  Republican politics and I know even in Democrat politics, a lot of the big  donors to these parties are from corporate interests.  They are not aligned  with American voter.  So, there's no alignment between Trump with the  outside devolve power from D.C., drain the swamp.</p><p> I mean, again, this omnibus bill had nothing to do with draining the swamp.   It was actually feeding the swamp.  It was a triumph from the swamp but it  goes back to some of the structural problems with in party politics of  who's actually footing the bill, who's funding things </p><p> And I tell you want?  When it comes down to the down to leadership, there  are a lot of people with corporate interests, special interests that are  right there in your ear whispering, \"You want to do this, you want next big  check, you need to do this.\"  And sadly, this is what continues to happen  in D.C. year after year.</p><p> TARLOV:  Yes, that is interesting, though, that you point that out about  Corporate America not being on the same page as the American voter.  When  you saw the Republican bill with big slashes to the corporate tax rate but  not to the individual --</p><p> REGAN:  They gave individuals a great, great deal, too.  The only  individuals that --</p><p> TARLOV: -- a lot of people are not benefiting from that.</p><p> REGAN:  -- we are high earner in New York and California.</p><p> RYUN:  Jessica, no complaints.</p><p> TARLOV:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  But I would say, we need to do that on the corporate side.  And  they did give a pretty big one to the -- that's a story for another day.</p><p> TARLOV:  Another segment.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you, Jessica. </p><p> TARLOV:  Thanks, Trish.  Welcome back.</p><p> REGAN:  It's good to see you guys.  It's good to be back.</p><p> Anyway, we're going to look at this because the court battle underway right  now to decide the fate of AT&amp;T and Time Warner is heating up.  We're going  to have some details for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Department of Justice is attempting to block the potential $85  billion merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner.  They're in court today, right  now.</p><p> For more, we're going to Connell McShane.  Hey, Connell.</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Well, hey, Trish.  We have  quite a face-off in the courtroom earlier today between Warren Schlichting,  is a guys and Executive at Sling T.V., which own by Dish network, and an  attorney for the company Daniel Petrocelli is representing AT&amp;T and Time  Warner.</p><p> Schlichting is a government witness.  He testified yesterday here in court  that Turner program and all the networks' Turner control, DCO, AT&amp;T, CNN,  all the rest, that it's a must for Sling and for Dish Network.  But today,  there was a challenge to that.  That's the real question, coming up on the  screen is, are these Turner Networks really must have programming?</p><p> Petrocelli was interesting in the way he did it.  He used the quote from  Charlie Ergen, the founder, kind of against his own employe saying, that he  had said Ergen, \"CNN may and must have programming in 20 years ago but it's  not anymore.  Schlichting response that, \"I call that negotiating in the  press.\"  And they kind of have similar conversation, Trish, about sports  programming and back and forth and went between the two.</p><p> As we move now into the afternoon session as Schlichting wraps up, we  expect to hear from the government's next witness in this trial, which  could be a very interesting witness and expected to be a hostile one, the  Turner Chairman, John Martin.  We'll see if any of his past words  particularly in contract negotiations can be used against him.</p><p> That still to come report back later.  But for now, back to you.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, interesting stuff.  Connell, Thank you so much.</p><p> I have to say, it's pretty good to be back.  It's great to be back in FBN.   I had a wonderful week off, a vacation with my family.  We went all the way  to Hawaii, believe or not and I wanted to show this because this is my  daughter, Alexandra, and she begged us for surfing lessons.</p><p> She's only eight years old.  You may have seen her on the show.  She talked  about her Brownie, Girl Scout cookie sales recently.  Well, she was on that  surfboard.  Oh my goodness.</p><p> She got up on this thing and we thought ourselves, \"Are we really good  parents.\"  She is quite a kid.</p><p> The other two were not as enthused about the surfing thing, I totally get  it, Elizabeth and Jamie.  I don't think you could get me on one of those  things either, I'll be honest.  People asked me if I took that video.  I'm  like, \"Are you kidding me?  Me on a surfboard?</p><p> That will be the day.  Liz Claman, over to you.  Down, gosh, 109.</p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  I know, exactly.  So, we have more  than 250-point gain earlier gone.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good to be back.   Anyway, we've got a brief jumping session right now all over the place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news, everyone, we've got Dow that's swinging back and forth, in  and out in negative territory.  It was up quite a bit earlier in the  session, more than 200 now.  Down to the flat line and now back up 50.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors are continuing to weigh basically the impact of the Trump  administration's aggressive approach to China.  They're not sure how it's  all been to turn out.  We're going to dive in to that over the next hour.   So you can think about how you should be interpreting this news and what is  going to mean for the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am Trish Regan.  Welcome to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.  It is great to be  back all the way from Hawaii.  I'll have a little more on that at the end  of the show.</p><p>But meanwhile, let's talk about this trade war that everybody is so fearful  about.  I'll tell you, they're starting to basically come to grips with it.   You've got fears are starting to ease.  You're starting to see that the  U.S. and China begin negotiations to address the tensions that had rocked  global markets in recent weeks.</p><p>Investors are still trying to digest of the news at last to record sell- off, which is followed by a sharp rebound, nice to see yesterday.  And  we're going to be watching here all this drama that's unfolding right up  until the closing bell.  But I will ask yet again, are these markets  overreacting?  I think so.  We've got some intel.</p><p>Plus, Facebook woes continue to pile on as U.S. officials say they are  investigating the social network over its controversial privacy policies.   And Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg out there finally feeling a little bit of  heat.  Now reports say he will testify before Congress.  Is this beginning  or the end for this company, for the Facebook founder?  We have more coming  up.</p><p>But first, back to our top story, this trade dispute with China.  Will  investors give President Trump a fair deal in terms of these markets?  Will  China give him a fair deal in terms of trade?</p><p>Joining me right now, Hudson Institute Senior Fellow, Michael Pillsbury,  along with our very own Charles Payne.  It's good to see you both.</p><p>Michael, I'll start with you.  You know, look, people say the Trump  administration is anti-free trade.  It seems like kind of a drastic,  drastic criticism, especially, I think, if you allow China to continue on  the path it is you're going to wake up a decade from now, we're going to be  the next France.  They're going to be the hegemonic power in the world  taking the place of the USA.  So, with that in mind, what needs to happen  so that things start to shake out in a more fair way?</p><p>MICHAEL PILLSBURY, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE:  Well, the first thing  is China has got to take President Trump seriously, and they've done that.   I think they've made some fairly major concessions in the last few days.   That's probably why the market is calming down.</p><p>President Trump did not really declare a trade war at all.  He had very,  very limited measures, measures that were talked about for many years.  The  only thing is he's actually doing it, instead of just talking about it.   But I don't see a really harsh pushback from the Chinese.</p><p>Their turnoffs against the steel and aluminum tariffs were very small, $3  billion to match $3 billion.  They haven't only replied to this yet.  But  they have certainly offered to negotiate, and so some very conciliatory  things almost an apology, Trish, where they say, \"We were willing to open  up our market, we're willing to open up some more sectors to foreign  investment.\"  So, I think, as you say, it's been really exaggerated.</p><p>And President Trump, he's probably showing that he's a master negotiator  here.  He's preserving his ties with China, which he needs for North Korea  and getting their attention to start these negotiations.  So, overall, I  think, it's a pretty optimistic outcome over the last three or four days.   It could have gone much differently.</p><p>REGAN:  Charles, one of the things that frustrated me about China and has  over the last number of years since I've, frankly, been following all of  this is that China really does take advantage of us and U.S. companies.   And you know what?  The CEOs, they don't care because they want access to  that Chinese market because it's going to be great for their quarterly  results.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  And, frankly, President Obama didn't really care so much either  because, I think, there's been such a concentration by so many in  Washington on the next election, much like CEOs are focused on the next  quarter's results that they don't appreciate the context of what's going on  here.  They don't appreciate how this is all going to affect our population  down the road, our kids, Charles, if we allow China to continue stealing  our technology and making such onerous demands on our companies.</p><p>PAYNE:  You know, I agree with you 1000 percent.  Now, listen, everyone  gives a lip service.  You know, there are endless articles where Jack Lew,  you know, was livid about the circumstances and he talked about them --</p><p>PILLSBURY:  That's right.</p><p>PAYNE:  -- but they never offered solutions.  They never had any sort of  real threat against China that will make China curb their predatory  actions.  And let's face it, when China joined the World Trade Organization  that was going to make them a legitimate player and follow all the rules.   Of course, they didn't follow the rules.  And who can blame China?  They  are.</p><p>You started to show up talking about their grand ambitions.  They do have  grand ambitions.  And right now, by 2026, their economy could be bigger  than ours.</p><p>And, you know, couple India and other Asian nations, and America starts to  falls into the sort of zone where Europe is.  And Europe can't turn around.   They're done unfortunately.  And so, if we're going to make a stand, we  have to make a stand at this very point.</p><p>And, you know, one example I like to use Trish, is a G.M. Buick division  has an SUV, the Envision.  The Envision is only made in Singapore, right,  in Shanghai, rather.  And it's exported to this country.  It was a big hit  last year.</p><p>Now, that's great for General Motors and their shareholders.  It's great  for the American consumers who probably get a pretty good car at a pretty  good price.  And it's great for the Chinese worker who made it.  There's  one person missing from the equation and that's the American factory  worker, auto worker who might have otherwise had made this product.  And  that's why there's a different bifurcation.</p><p>You know, China hasn't pushed back but Wall Street has pushed back.  Last  week, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, every day at 2:00, approximately  2:00, a gigantic sell program went off.  Ultimately it took 1200 Dow points  out of the market.  There was no new news at 2:00.</p><p>Every single day at that point we saw the markets fell off dramatically.  I  think Wall Street has been pushing back on this a lot harder than China  has.</p><p>REGAN:  Look, you know, Michael, I get Wall Street, but what I think is a  critical here is that we not look at the day-to-day, and I would remind  traders not to look at the day-to-day because I'll tell you, 10 years from  now you're going to wake up and had a heck of a problem on your hand if you  don't deal with the China stuff now.  So if we tick a little pain along the  way, we will be better off.  It is mind-boggling to me.</p><p>I mean, they're out creating their version of the WTO.  They're investing  in many economies in Latin America, in Pakistan, in Iran --</p><p>PILLSBURY:  Africa.</p><p>REGAN:  -- or Russia, Africa as well, places that they can seek commodity  resources in.  I mean, they have a very definite plan to be the world's  largest economic power and quite perhaps possibly the world's largest  military power.  So, if we don't wake up and deal with that at some point,  Michael, I think we're going to have much bigger problems on our hands than  600-point drop in the Dow.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  I agree.  I agree with Charles, too.  As you know, I wrote a  book about this three years ago, which is widely criticized as being  alarmist.</p><p>And now President Trump has not only accepted some of the premises, he's  released a much better report, if I may say so, than my book just last  week.  It's 250 pages long.  Example after example after example of what  President Obama used to call the \"gangsterization\" of our companies.   That's why President Trump is moving forward on several fronts.  It's not  just tariffs.  It's this new suit at the WTO in Geneva.</p><p>There's number of other measures.  And, frankly, there is bipartisan  support for what he is doing.  Senator Chuck Schumer is often seen as enemy  of the President, very quickly endorsed President Trump last Thursday on  the tightening up on technology purchases here in the United States.</p><p>The bill has attracted the co-sponsorship of Dianne Feinstein who would be  happy to call a progressive liberal, I think.  So this problem has gone on  for so long that just these limited steps seems to be producing a lot of  bipartisan support.  That's why the day-to-day fluctuation in the market  really kind of a shortsighted.  And some people who didn't listen are  probably losing money now.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  Well, they'll make it up.  Very quickly, Charles, there are  some examples, I think, out there of Chinese companies now looking to  invest in the U.S. because, look, we're not going to continue with the  current status quo.</p><p>PAYNE:  Absolutely.  Well, you know, two news items today.  One is a  smaller company, but it's really important, JinkoSolar, the fourth largest  solar manufacturer in the world that Chinese company probably will be  breaking ground here.  It becomes official today in Jacksonville, $50  million project, 400,000 square feet.</p><p>Here is the most important thing.  This comes after President Trump levied  the 30 percent tariff on their product.  So now they're going to bring and  manufacturing here and of course --</p><p>REGAN:  They're going to bring it here?</p><p>PAYNE:  -- we know Foxconn, of course, is building out big time.  They made  an acquisition today.  And while there are pros and cons to it, people need  to pay attention.</p><p>REGAN:  Michael, Charles, good to see you guys.</p><p>PAYNE:  You got it.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you so much.  Good perspective.  And make sure, everyone,  watch Charles on \"Making Money\" tonight, 6:00 p.m. Eastern right here on  Fox Business.</p><p>Turning to our other top story, Facebook says it will not confirm reports  that CEO, Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress about how Facebook  collects and stores user data.  But Mr. Zuckerberg says he will not appear  before the U.K. parliament.  All of this as we have uncovered video from  eight years ago of Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, warning Mark Zuckerberg  and other tech CEOs about user privacy.</p><p>For the latest, let's go right now to Deirdre Bolton who has been following  the story from day one.  Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Trish, Facebook is under  pressure.  It is facing investigations from 37 states attorneys general,  including tech-heavy states California, Massachusetts, New York.  It is  also now facing specific lawsuits just this morning from counties, such as  IllinoisCook County, that includes Chicago and surrounding areas.</p><p>So, basically those areas are just joining this legal fight against  Facebook and Cambridge Analytica over the misuse of data scraped from  social media profiles claiming that both companies violated state fraud  law.  So that is the paperwork from Cook County, Illinois.  So this lawsuit  claims that Cambridge Analytica tricked Facebook users with quizzes and  that Facebook knew, this is really serious, Trish, this accusation, and did  nothing to stop it.</p><p>Now, as you point it out, Steve Jobs, seemed to have a premonition about  this relationship between tech and privacy getting more cloudy.  Here is  what he said eight years ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE JOBS, CO-FOUNDER, APPLE:  The Silicon Valley is not monolithic.   We've always had a very different view of privacy than some of our  colleagues in the Valley.  We take privacy extremely seriously.  And some  people want to share more data than other people do.</p><p>Ask them.  Ask them every time.  Make them tell you to stop asking them, if  they get tired of you asking them.  Let them know precisely what you're  going to do with their data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg wishes he had seen that or heard that or  paid attention because that Cook County lawsuit specifically states  \"Facebook is not a social media company, it is the largest data mining  operation in existence.\"  It further claims that Facebook worked to keep  developers on its platform plying them with sensitive data at the expense  of its users' privacy.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission also investigating Facebook.  It signaled  today that its probe of the company is broad.  So that's a key word because  it's never what a company wants to hear.  It implies impending regulation.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg may also testify on Capitol Hill not clear yet.  He has  been invited to a hearing on April 10th.  If he goes, he's going to be  asked questions about Facebook's policies regarding protection and  monitoring of consumer data.</p><p>Senator Grassley is the one who issue the invitation, also extended the  same to Google's CEO and Twitter's CEO.  But essentially, Trish, this opens  up huge questions for big tech, for privacy, for potential regulation.  All  of these companies right away, they have to spend more money on their legal  teams.  Probably Mark Zuckerberg has an extra direct report because of this  and it is certainly going to be a distraction to the way that they are  trying to run their normal businesses.</p><p>Trish, back to you.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's their fault.  Thank you very much, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  Joining me right now for more analysis, \"Bullseye Brief\" Publisher  and Founder and Author, Adam Johnson, along with Belpointe Chief  Strategist, David Nelson.</p><p>Is this going to be the end of Mark Zuckerberg?</p><p>ADAM JOHNSON, AUTHOR, \"BULLSEYE BRIEF\" PUBLISHER AND AUTHOR:  It's starting  to look like it.  And I tell you something, Trish, there's a real trust  problem which Zuckerberg himself said when he went on CNN in his t-shirt  looking all dough-eyed for all of us to try to sound contrite.  The problem  is we don't necessarily trust that our data is safe.  That's number one.</p><p>Number two, we don't necessarily trust that what's in our news feed is  accurate because of the fake news.  And number three, it's kind of hard for  me, and I would imagine a lot of other people, to necessarily trust a  company that takes all our data, all our hard work, our intellectual  capital, all the effort that we put into posting, sells that to other  people for billions of dollars, and all we get back in return is likes.   I'm sorry, but that doesn't breed trust.</p><p>REGAN:  You have a plan for that.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  You have some suggestions to Mr. Zuckerberg.</p><p>JOHNSON:  I do.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's get to that in a second.  But first of all, in terms of this  company, you know, look, I was on vacation this week.  And I used Facebook  more than I would on a regular basis because, you know, I'm posting  pictures of the kids.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Sure.</p><p>REGAN:  And all of that good stuff.  And I thought, you know, I don't know  if I want to be on this right now.  I don't know if anybody wants to be on  this right now because of these violations into our privacy, which, you  know, he's a little contrite there, saying, \"Oh, yes, shouldn't happen.   It's our responsibility.\"</p><p>This is a company, David, that makes money off being able to target ads so  specifically.  They're going to want to know everything they can about  Trish Regan, Adam Johnson, and David Nelson.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  So that they can target those ads.  And I don't know if any of us  should be OK with that.</p><p>NELSON:  Sure.  Big data is big money and that's what this is about.  And I  think what we're finding out is there's nothing social in that social  media.  This is a data mining operation like --</p><p>JOHNSON:  It's one-sided, right?</p><p>NELSON:  -- it's kind of one-sided.  They have the data and they use it.   And for Mark Zuckerberg not, you know, agreeing to appear, he obviously has  aspirations for something beyond Facebook.  He did a tour in the country,  almost in campaign style.</p><p>And nobody looks good in front of the Senate subcommittee.  You start to  look like Michael Corleone and you try to explain that you're just a CEO of  an olive oil company.  He's trying to deflect this, putting the CTO, those  Chief Technology Officers, in front of Congress or parliament.  That's not  going to cut it.  People want some answers.</p><p>And I think there are going to be some solutions.  I was wrong last week  when I thought that with the genie out of the bottle, this business model  wouldn't change.  Obviously it's going to change.  Regulation is going to  change it.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, yes, I mean, it has to change.  And you're right, I mean, the  news feed being fake, our information being compromised.  You think there's  a way for them to fix this so that their \"users,\" you wouldn't even call  them that, would actually have some skin in the game?</p><p>JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  How would you change that?</p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, I cut a video yesterday and I posted out on Twitter and  Facebook and link.  Then it got a little bit of traction.  I said, \"Stop  calling us users for starters, Mark.  Why don't you start calling us  partners and actually make us partners by giving us the same kind of upside  that the cryptocurrency markets give us.\"  In other words, they in all  their brilliance over at Facebook have all these algorithms.</p><p>\"So why don't you use your algorithms, Mark, to figure out what makes a  great post?  Maybe it's a number of likes, cute puppies, thoughtful social  commentary.  Whatever it is, use all of that to award our posts with face  coins and then let us redeem face coin on Facebook for goods and services.   And by the way, if we don't want to do that let's trade it, the same way we  trade bitcoin and get money for it.\"  In other words, create a rewards  point system so that we are partners.  And that is interesting --</p><p>REGAN:  But that would cost some money.</p><p>JOHNSON:  -- yes, exactly.</p><p>REGAN:  It would cost some money if they're the ones putting the good and  services.</p><p>JOHNSON:  That's right.</p><p>REGAN:  But the membership, you know, you think about --</p><p>NELSON:  But regulations cost money.</p><p>REGAN:  -- right, they give you membership rewards or these credit card  companies, or hotel companies, airline companies, if you spend a certain  amount of money with them, or fly with them, or travel with them you get  something in return.</p><p>JOHNSON:  And Facebook doesn't give us anything.</p><p>REGAN:  They use all our contact.</p><p>NELSON:  In fact, they're stealing and that's it and we're not getting a  dime for it.</p><p>JOHNSON:  All we get are likes.</p><p>NELSON:  We're giving it to them.  I don't know if they're stealing it.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>NELSON:  But I don't know a face coin is going to work.  But certainly, you  know, a rewards program something like that could work.  There's actually  some business models out there, seeking out.</p><p>There's a place where financial advisors go out and put outposts.  And if  they have enough viewers on that they actually get paid for that.  They  would get paid for our likes.  And maybe as of dislike, maybe you get some  points taken away.  Maybe that would eliminate some of those occupy  Democrat political, you know, hand grenades that I see post in my Facebook  page.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Now you're talking like the SAT test where you get penalized for  random answers.  But they can figure this stuff out.  They have the  algorithms</p><p>REGAN:  Well, yes, they certainly can.  I don't think there has been any  willingness to.  We haven't even started about how the, you know, ISIS  terrorists want to use social media.</p><p>NELSON:  The ramifications beyond Facebook are pretty large.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.</p><p>NELSON:  This affects Google and so many others.</p><p>REGAN:  Good stuff.  Adam, David, thank you so much.</p><p>NELSON:  Thanks, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Kim Jong-un reportedly making a secret trip to China,  his first foreign trip since taking power of the kingdom there in 2011.   What does this visit mean for the U.S.?  We're on it.  Stay with us.  We'll  see you here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Everyone, get this, a heavily guarded mysterious train  rolled into Beijing on Monday.  And officials believe that it may have been  carrying none other than North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.  A visit to  the Chinese capital would mark Kim's first trip beyond North Korean borders  since taking power back in 2011.  So if these reports are true, why did he  make the trip?  Why did he make it now?</p><p>Joining me with analysis, \"Nuclear Showdown\" Author, Gordon Chang.  Gordon,  always good to see you.  You are the guy to talk to about North Korea and  China.  So what your take on this?  Did it happen and why did he do it?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN\":  Yes, I think it certainly  happened.  And I think the reason why Kim went to Beijing was because  Beijing demanded that he go there.</p><p>You got to remember that Kim was going to make his first foreign trip to  South Korea, to go south of the military demarcation line in the  demilitarize zone to the peace house, which is in South Korea.  And then  his second foreign trip was going to be seeing President Trump.  The  Chinese realized they were being marginalized.  And so, essentially what  they said to Kim was, \"You come to Beijing or else.\"</p><p>REGAN:  What do you think will come of this?</p><p>CHANG:  I don't know what's going to happen with the Trump-Kim summit.  But  I think that it was very good for President Trump to do that because he is  cutting out the Chinese.  And the Chinese over this century have really  been a maligned influence.  They have been helping the North Korean nuclear  weapons effort as well as ballistic missile program.</p><p>And what Trump decided to do is he was not going to put up with that, he  was going to talk to Kim Jong-un directly.  And you've got to remember,  Trish, this is occurring at the same time as the trade disputes.</p><p>Now, the Chinese have heard American Presidents threaten trade actions, but  they haven't really seen anyone carry through.  And President Trump is  carrying through.  And the Chinese right now are probably pretty  bewildered.  They got both Kim and Trump giving them a hard time.</p><p>REGAN:  Simultaneously, you have John Bolton now as part of the  administration as well and he, Ambassador Bolton has made very clear,  certainly to me in the past, he would like to see the reunification of the  North Korean peninsula and one would have to assume that Kim Jong-un would  be on the losing side of that deal.  So, are the Chinese now being caught  off guard or a bit more nervous?  How does that affect everything that's  going on because they may be looking at it and saying, \"Gosh, you know, the  U.S. is playing tough now on trade?\"  Maybe somehow trying to court Kim  Jong-un in a way that we don't understand, and in fact, the U.S. may wind  up having a much bigger presence right next door to us than we anticipated,  Gordon?</p><p>CHANG:  Yes, you know, John Bolton as National security advisor and Mike  Pompeo as Secretary of State really round out of the war Cabinet.  And, you  know, you look at what Bolton said about the main problem in the world,  it's China and Russia.  And so, Beijing right now has got to understand  that they've got a new sheriff in town, and that Bolton is going to push  Trump in directions that Trump would go anyway.</p><p>You know, Trump started out his administration by trying to placate the  Chinese, bringing them on board, getting them to help on North Korea.  They  didn't do that.  So, you know, right now, you have to a consensus --</p><p>REGAN:  And he said he was a little disappointed in that.  That he had  hoped to get more cooperation from China.</p><p>CHANG:  -- yes.  And we know from the President's tweets that he is not  only -- of course, he was first disappointed but now angry and frustrated.   You have Bolton coming in, Pompeo coming in.  It's a new landscape for the  Chinese.</p><p>And right now, they're seeing something that they have never faced before.</p><p>REGAN:  Meaning?</p><p>CHANG:  Well, meaning that there's now an administration that is willing to  hold them responsible for really predatory mercantilist and dangerous  activities around the world.  And so, you know, they're seeing that the  U.S. is going to impose costs on China and deal with China as well as  Moscow in a way that we haven't seen since the end of the Cold War.  So I  think you have now in Beijing, people are saying who lost America, as a  \"Washington Post\" correspondent recently wrote about a week ago.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's about time.  They've been getting away with a whole lot  for much too long.</p><p>CHANG:  It's a about time.</p><p>REGAN:  Anyway, Gordon Chang, it's good to see you.  Appreciate your  analysis.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  For the first time in 70 years, the 2020 census is going to include  a question about citizenship.  Democrats are blasting this move, but is it  legal?  We have some intel as the market trades up 25 points right now on  the Dow.  See you right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  And on the market, it took a dip into negative territory.  So,  we're watching it very carefully.  It's been a rather volatile session all  over the place here.</p><p>Investors are still trying to come to grips with what's exactly this trade  dispute with China will mean.</p><p>In the mean time, we're watching another story here and that's the 2020  census, which is now expected to include a question about citizenship  status.  The population count take in every 10 years is required by the  Constitutions and it is use to determine the number of seats each state has  in the House.  So, it's important from that perspective as well as how  federal funds are distributed.</p><p>Democrats are condemning this move saying it would actually discourage  immigrants from responding, which would cause a population undercount and  therefore they wouldn't able to have as many representatives, say, from  state like California.  California's attorney general is suing the Trump  Administration saying and \"including a citizenship question on the 2020  census is not a bad idea, it is illegal.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano, with his sense of whether it is, in fact, legal or not.  Where  do you come out?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  It is legal to  ask because the federal government has a legitimate interest in knowing  that but the government cannot compel the answer from the person asked  because we have the right to remain silent.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  So then the California A.G. really doesn't have much of a  case.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  First of all, it's premature because Congress hasn't decided  this yet.  This is just a proposal from the Commerce Department, which must  file its proposal by the end of this week and they filed it last night.</p><p>Congress is not in session for the next two weeks.  They're going to debate  this all over again when Congress is back there.  But the only thing under  the Constitution of the government can compel any answer to is how many  human beings lives in this house and how many bathrooms you have?  What is  your education, what is your nationality, and what is your citizenship?   Again, it can ask but it can't punish him for not answering.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  So, it seems to me then, it's fair to ask the question and  it's obviously an individual decision as to whether or not they want to  respond.  But assuming that California is right and all the people that are  here illegally decline to answer the question, does population count go  down and therefore does the number of representatives coming from a state  like California go down?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That is a great question.  And that would be exquisitely  unfair to the rest of the country if California where to get more  representatives in the House of Representatives because of more illegal or  undocumented persons living in California.  That is not the intent of the  census and that is not the purpose of the headcount.  So the Federal  Government is going to have to find some other way to determine who is  legitimately, lawfully residing in California without compelling people to  answer.</p><p>Now, I think a lot of people will answer anyway.  I don't know if they'll  answer truthfully or not.  I think the Democrats do have an argument to  make the people here unlawfully are not going to answer truthfully because  they'll think it's going to trigger their deportation although this  questionnaires are anonymous.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  Different then, let's say, it was back when, you know,  during World War II and you were making a point to me off-camera that there  were times in history that we have used the census --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  -- to actually find people?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  The Roosevelt Administration in the census of 1940 not  only asked if you're a citizen and asked your nationality.  And then when  FDR and his colleagues decided to incarcerate Japanese-Americans, they had  the data to find them.</p><p>Congress was so outraged by this.  But in 1947, FDR is dead, the war is  over.  That it enacted legislation prohibiting asking nationality but did  not prohibit asking citizenship.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, let's see what happens.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you, Judge.  Good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Good to see you.  Welcome back.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you.  It's good to be back.  Wow, lots of news going on.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  You could say that.  Any day, any week, Russia is vowing to  retaliate after President Trump expels 60 diplomats from the United States.   What will that include and will this finally put an end to talk that Trump  is too soft on Vladmir Putin?</p><p>Plus, we are following these markets.  We can see we've been all over the  place now, up 13 points, just straddling really the flat line here.  What  is driving this?  Is it really concerns about a trade war with China?   We've got more after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  This is an interesting story, everyone.  Russia vowing to respond  harshly to the U.S. expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats.  Their foreign  ministry even accusing the U.S. of blackmailing other countries to expel  Russian diplomat.</p><p>Our Ashley Webster has been all over the story, of course, it starts in the  U.K. --</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  It does.</p><p>REGAN:  -- with nerve gas in an ex-Russian spy.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I mean, on outrageous attack of a nerve agent on British soil,  that's a Russian nerve agent.  I think what's come out of this is a couple  things.  I think Vladmir Putin has totally miscalculated what's happened  here.</p><p>The Brits, I think there is a theory out there, Trish, that Britain is  leaving the E.U., that there's a perception that Theresa May is a weakened  leader and that that has propelled the Russians to take these kinds of  steps, to test the resolve.  If that is the case, terrible mistake because  look what happened, 27 countries now have kicked out more than 140 Russian  diplomats.  The U.N. expelling seven Russian diplomats, we just heard in  reaction to this.  And I think it is certainly hurt Putin in certain ways.</p><p>There are those in Moscow that when they're going to look him, they're  going to say, \"Hmm, that wasn't a very good move.\"</p><p>REAGAN:  He wants to be -- right, on the world international stage and  basically he's losing that starring role by getting all of his diplomats  expelled but one would understand.  I mean, why do you want people in your  country that are capable of --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Spying?</p><p>REGAN:  -- doing what these people did in the U.K.?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Of course, everybody does it.  And the U.K., especially we've had  like 12 deaths in the U.K. that have Russian links.</p><p>REGAN:  And we also know that more than 100 people were exposed to this  nerve gas agent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, in this small town in the West of England, in Salisbury,  which, you know, the health authorities said, \"No, you'll be OK.\"  Then  they said, \"You may want to stop wiping your cell phones and washing your  clothing.\"  It was amid to this day, there very, you know, there are quite  a few people just say, \"Well, I don't know.  What are the health risks of  this?\"</p><p>But the bottom line is the other point I wanted to make about Putin and  Russia is this is the biggest blow to their spy network on the west,  multinational blows since the Cold War.  I mean, that has severely hurt  their spy network.</p><p>Look at the U.S., 60 diplomats gone, 48.  The closing of consulate in  Seattle, because it's close to Boeing, it's close to a submarine base  there.  That hurts.  That definitely hurts Russia's spy network.  It's not  going to kill it but it's going to make it pretty painful.</p><p>REGAN:  Now, they're trying to retaliate.</p><p>WEBSTER:  They will.</p><p>REGAN:  Meaning?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Meaning that they'll do it tit-to-tat.  The bottom line is Russia  is the big loser here.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  I would say and, you know, I wonder how this sits with some  members of the Democratic Party that keeps saying this administration is an  easy on Russia.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  You're telling me this is the biggest hit to their spy network --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Since the Cold War.</p><p>REGAN:  -- since the Cold War.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  It is significant and I think Putin totally did not expect  the United States to kick out 60 diplomats.  That's a high number.</p><p>The U.K. kicked out 23.  That was a very aggressive move.  It was  appropriate, I believe.  But it certainly was, I think, a shot to Moscow.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  And more and more countries are following the same way,  Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, good.  Good.</p><p>REGAN:  Good.  Ashley, thank you so much.</p><p>We got the markets mixed right now although we are trading higher by about  57 points there on the Dow.  Stocks swinging around here rather wildly but  doesn't this always happen right around 2:00?</p><p>Nicole Petallides has more, down at the New York Stock Exchange for us.</p><p>Hey, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  As you said,  we've seen the volatility this afternoon, the most afternoons around this  time gets pretty wild.  Right now, we're up 41 points, off our earlier  highs but it's nice to see some arrows up, with up arrow after last week  where we saw the big sell-off of more than 1400 points.</p><p>Yesterday, nearly 700 point gain and we're holding on to the green just for  the Dow.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 have moved into the red.</p><p>Tech stocks, also financial stocks are coming under some pressure.  Well,  financials are mixed, I should say, tech, energy, and industrials are under  pressure.</p><p>I wanted to get to general electric.  The Buffett bounce.  There is  speculation that Warren Buffett's Berkshire has a way may be getting back  into G.E. after jumping out last year.</p><p>Of course, G.E., over the last 12 months down 56 percent.  It's been a big  dog.  And now there is word that they might be back in in amassing a big  stake.</p><p>Now, of course, General Electric, no comment.  Nobody is commenting.  But  look at the stock, though, it's up 5.5 percent today.  So, we'll see what  happens there but it's certainly getting a nice big boost for today. It's  the worst performer on the Dow this year.</p><p>And then just take a pick at that winners of Dow Jones Industrial Average  today, at this moment and that would be Nike, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Verizon,  Pfizer.  You see some up arrows here as everybody just takes a breather  about those trade war worries at least for the moment.</p><p>Back to you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  I encourage them to take a big breather, a big one because we have  to deal with this now, head-on, or we're going to see a real problem 10  years from now that we don't want.</p><p>Anyway, Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.</p><p>Paul Ryan, everyone, is forced to deny that he is stepping down as House  Speaker after a resignation rumor goes rampant.  It does open the door to  this big question, are both parties in need of new blood, new leadership,  as we head into the midterms?</p><p>Our panel debates it for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Ryan's office said the Speaker is not resigning.  This, after  reports surface last night the Republican leader may be stepping down.  One  Congressman even suggested that Whip Steve Scalise would be elected to  replace.</p><p>All these rumors out there and, well, they're just rumors but they give beg  the question.  Is it time for a shake-up in leadership for both parties?</p><p>Joining me right now, Fox News Contributor, Jessica Tarlov, and American  Majority CEO, Ned Ryun.  I think you two are going to be in agreement on  this one</p><p>JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's will the first time.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.</p><p>NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO:  Maybe.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, let me start with you, Jessica.  The Democratic Party, and I  think this is obvious to everyone given all the Marie Antoinette-like  comments Nancy Pelosi has been making, do they need a shake-up? </p><p>TARLOV:  I think they're going to end up with a shake-up.  I am a big fan  of Nancy Pelosi.  I think she has been long-term wonderful for the party.</p><p>REGAN:  You're one and only?</p><p>TARLOV:  What?  No, no, there are like 10 of us.  No, what she did was  getting the ACA passed and she's also done a prolific fund-raiser for the  party, which we all know is incredibly important.  Says a lot about that.   But with the leadership challenge the last time around from Tim Ryan and  with people like Conor Lamb getting elected all over the country, I think  there is going to be shift and a lot of pressure to go younger and more  progressive.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  I think that we are seeing that and it's probably the healthy  thing for that party.  Now, in terms of the Republicans, one of the biggest  complaints, I know you have had, Ned, is that Republicans ala Paul Ryan,  are not fully on board with the Trump administration's agenda and they're  very reluctant to come around on a lot of things.  With that in mind, do  they also need a change in leadership?</p><p>RYUN:  Well, I will say this, I mean, these rumors of Paul Ryan resigning  are fake news.  I talked with multiple members of Congress and they said  fake news.</p><p>One of them asked him point-blank, \"Are you going to resign?\"  And he said,  \"Absolutely not.\"  So, I don't think you're going to see a leadership  change anytime soon on the House side.</p><p>But, Trish, I think this whole omnibus bill is a sign that Congress is  broken.  And if you want to talk about leadership that needs to change,  Congress is broken because Mitch McConnell is basically letting the  Democrats help run the Senate with him.</p><p>I honestly think some days, Trish, that we have joint majority leaders with  Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell and one ruling class swamp party.   Because let's face it, a lot of GOP Senators they quite frankly like this  broken Congress.  They can help out their crony special interests buddies  and tuck away the special earmarks in 2200 page bills that nobody reads.   And all of a sudden, look what happens, we have 1.3 trillion omnibus bills.</p><p>So, if you were to ask me, is leadership change needed?  Yes, absolutely.</p><p>The House actually has been operating like it should be.  The Senate is  completely broken and I blame Mitch McConnell for it.</p><p>REGAN:  You do.  Do you think that the Democrats should also make a shift  then?</p><p>RYUN:  No, please, dear God.  Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.</p><p>TARLOV:  That's always what Republican say.</p><p>RYUN:  Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.  She is great for us.   She is writing our attack ads.  Between she and Hillary with crumbs,  deplorable, backwards Trump voters.  I mean, this, in all seriousness,  though Trish, this is a problem for Democrat in those 10 red states where  you have Democrat's Senators running for re-election.</p><p>Hillary and Nancy Pelosi and are writing Republican attack ads for the  midterms.</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes, I would add to that, and I agree with you when you said  Claire McCaskill being incredibly outspoken about Hillary Clinton's  comments.</p><p>RYUN:  Yes.</p><p>TARLOV:  And saying you shouldn't insult anybody but certainly don't be  insulting anyone in my state.  You know, it's just in a deep red state.   And we do have 10 up for re-election.</p><p>I would ask this on the Paul Ryan side of things that there are kind of two  sides to this coin.  Yes, you ask him point-blank what's he is going to do  but there have been a lot of surprise resignations.</p><p>Jason Chaffetz, I don't -- Trey Gowdy not going to run for re-election.   There are a lot committee heads on the Republican side who are not going to  run again.  And we are forgetting as well, Paul Ryan didn't even want this  job.</p><p>REGAN:  That's right.</p><p>TARLOV:  Remember, when he begrudgingly took in and he was like, well, I  want to make sure that I can spend time with me family.  So, under these  circumstances when he's pushing forward an agenda that the President really  doesn't have much interest in it, I can see why he might want to bow out  gracefully before.</p><p>REGAN:  It's kind of thankless job, right, Ned?  I mean, you know, you  either, you know, buy into what the President is doing, I think it's been  hard for him.  I think it's been hard for a lot of Republican there because  they're kind of, \"I don't know if I like this.  I don't know if I like  where it's going.\"  And I worry, much as you do, I think, Ned, it's the  swamp influence that they have --</p><p>RYUN:  It is.</p><p>TARLOV:  -- the ear of many corporations and lobbyists that have their own  interests at stake.  And so, suddenly everybody is saying, \"Whoa, we have a  huge trade war coming, thanks to President Trump and his administration.\"   And so, they're fighting back against that.  When we all know that if we  don't start to confront the reality of what China is doing now, it's going  to be our kids that are paying the price, Ned.</p><p>RYUN:  Absolutely.  You know, I think we're already -- China has already  declared economic warfare on us.  I think people just wake up to that fact.   But no, you're right and, Trish, you've kind of alluded to this just now.</p><p>The interests of Corporate America in the American people, the American  working class are not always aligns and the problem here that you see in  Republican politics and I know even in Democrat politics, a lot of the big  donors to these parties are from corporate interests.  They are not aligned  with American voter.  So, there's no alignment between Trump with the  outside devolve power from D.C., drain the swamp.</p><p>I mean, again, this omnibus bill had nothing to do with draining the swamp.   It was actually feeding the swamp.  It was a triumph from the swamp but it  goes back to some of the structural problems with in party politics of  who's actually footing the bill, who's funding things </p><p>And I tell you want?  When it comes down to the down to leadership, there  are a lot of people with corporate interests, special interests that are  right there in your ear whispering, \"You want to do this, you want next big  check, you need to do this.\"  And sadly, this is what continues to happen  in D.C. year after year.</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes, that is interesting, though, that you point that out about  Corporate America not being on the same page as the American voter.  When  you saw the Republican bill with big slashes to the corporate tax rate but  not to the individual --</p><p>REGAN:  They gave individuals a great, great deal, too.  The only  individuals that --</p><p>TARLOV: -- a lot of people are not benefiting from that.</p><p>REGAN:  -- we are high earner in New York and California.</p><p>RYUN:  Jessica, no complaints.</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  But I would say, we need to do that on the corporate side.  And  they did give a pretty big one to the -- that's a story for another day.</p><p>TARLOV:  Another segment.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you, Jessica. </p><p>TARLOV:  Thanks, Trish.  Welcome back.</p><p>REGAN:  It's good to see you guys.  It's good to be back.</p><p>Anyway, we're going to look at this because the court battle underway right  now to decide the fate of AT&amp;T and Time Warner is heating up.  We're going  to have some details for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Department of Justice is attempting to block the potential $85  billion merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner.  They're in court today, right  now.</p><p>For more, we're going to Connell McShane.  Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Well, hey, Trish.  We have  quite a face-off in the courtroom earlier today between Warren Schlichting,  is a guys and Executive at Sling T.V., which own by Dish network, and an  attorney for the company Daniel Petrocelli is representing AT&amp;T and Time  Warner.</p><p>Schlichting is a government witness.  He testified yesterday here in court  that Turner program and all the networks' Turner control, DCO, AT&amp;T, CNN,  all the rest, that it's a must for Sling and for Dish Network.  But today,  there was a challenge to that.  That's the real question, coming up on the  screen is, are these Turner Networks really must have programming?</p><p>Petrocelli was interesting in the way he did it.  He used the quote from  Charlie Ergen, the founder, kind of against his own employe saying, that he  had said Ergen, \"CNN may and must have programming in 20 years ago but it's  not anymore.  Schlichting response that, \"I call that negotiating in the  press.\"  And they kind of have similar conversation, Trish, about sports  programming and back and forth and went between the two.</p><p>As we move now into the afternoon session as Schlichting wraps up, we  expect to hear from the government's next witness in this trial, which  could be a very interesting witness and expected to be a hostile one, the  Turner Chairman, John Martin.  We'll see if any of his past words  particularly in contract negotiations can be used against him.</p><p>That still to come report back later.  But for now, back to you.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, interesting stuff.  Connell, Thank you so much.</p><p>I have to say, it's pretty good to be back.  It's great to be back in FBN.   I had a wonderful week off, a vacation with my family.  We went all the way  to Hawaii, believe or not and I wanted to show this because this is my  daughter, Alexandra, and she begged us for surfing lessons.</p><p>She's only eight years old.  You may have seen her on the show.  She talked  about her Brownie, Girl Scout cookie sales recently.  Well, she was on that  surfboard.  Oh my goodness.</p><p>She got up on this thing and we thought ourselves, \"Are we really good  parents.\"  She is quite a kid.</p><p>The other two were not as enthused about the surfing thing, I totally get  it, Elizabeth and Jamie.  I don't think you could get me on one of those  things either, I'll be honest.  People asked me if I took that video.  I'm  like, \"Are you kidding me?  Me on a surfboard?</p><p>That will be the day.  Liz Claman, over to you.  Down, gosh, 109.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  I know, exactly.  So, we have more  than 250-point gain earlier gone.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good to be back.   Anyway, we've got a brief jumping session right now all over the place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking news, everyone, we've got Dow that's swinging back and forth, in  and out in negative territory.  It was up quite a bit earlier in the  session, more than 200 now.  Down to the flat line and now back up 50.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Investors are continuing to weigh basically the impact of the Trump  administration's aggressive approach to China.  They're not sure how it's  all been to turn out.  We're going to dive in to that over the next hour.   So you can think about how you should be interpreting this news and what is  going to mean for the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I am Trish Regan.  Welcome to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.  It is great to be  back all the way from Hawaii.  I'll have a little more on that at the end  of the show.</p><p> But meanwhile, let's talk about this trade war that everybody is so fearful  about.  I'll tell you, they're starting to basically come to grips with it.   You've got fears are starting to ease.  You're starting to see that the  U.S. and China begin negotiations to address the tensions that had rocked  global markets in recent weeks.</p><p> Investors are still trying to digest of the news at last to record sell- off, which is followed by a sharp rebound, nice to see yesterday.  And  we're going to be watching here all this drama that's unfolding right up  until the closing bell.  But I will ask yet again, are these markets  overreacting?  I think so.  We've got some intel.</p><p> Plus, Facebook woes continue to pile on as U.S. officials say they are  investigating the social network over its controversial privacy policies.   And Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg out there finally feeling a little bit of  heat.  Now reports say he will testify before Congress.  Is this beginning  or the end for this company, for the Facebook founder?  We have more coming  up.</p><p> But first, back to our top story, this trade dispute with China.  Will  investors give President Trump a fair deal in terms of these markets?  Will  China give him a fair deal in terms of trade?</p><p> Joining me right now, Hudson Institute Senior Fellow, Michael Pillsbury,  along with our very own Charles Payne.  It's good to see you both.</p><p> Michael, I'll start with you.  You know, look, people say the Trump  administration is anti-free trade.  It seems like kind of a drastic,  drastic criticism, especially, I think, if you allow China to continue on  the path it is you're going to wake up a decade from now, we're going to be  the next France.  They're going to be the hegemonic power in the world  taking the place of the USA.  So, with that in mind, what needs to happen  so that things start to shake out in a more fair way?</p><p> MICHAEL PILLSBURY, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE:  Well, the first thing  is China has got to take President Trump seriously, and they've done that.   I think they've made some fairly major concessions in the last few days.   That's probably why the market is calming down.</p><p> President Trump did not really declare a trade war at all.  He had very,  very limited measures, measures that were talked about for many years.  The  only thing is he's actually doing it, instead of just talking about it.   But I don't see a really harsh pushback from the Chinese.</p><p> Their turnoffs against the steel and aluminum tariffs were very small, $3  billion to match $3 billion.  They haven't only replied to this yet.  But  they have certainly offered to negotiate, and so some very conciliatory  things almost an apology, Trish, where they say, \"We were willing to open  up our market, we're willing to open up some more sectors to foreign  investment.\"  So, I think, as you say, it's been really exaggerated.</p><p> And President Trump, he's probably showing that he's a master negotiator  here.  He's preserving his ties with China, which he needs for North Korea  and getting their attention to start these negotiations.  So, overall, I  think, it's a pretty optimistic outcome over the last three or four days.   It could have gone much differently.</p><p> REGAN:  Charles, one of the things that frustrated me about China and has  over the last number of years since I've, frankly, been following all of  this is that China really does take advantage of us and U.S. companies.   And you know what?  The CEOs, they don't care because they want access to  that Chinese market because it's going to be great for their quarterly  results.</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  And, frankly, President Obama didn't really care so much either  because, I think, there's been such a concentration by so many in  Washington on the next election, much like CEOs are focused on the next  quarter's results that they don't appreciate the context of what's going on  here.  They don't appreciate how this is all going to affect our population  down the road, our kids, Charles, if we allow China to continue stealing  our technology and making such onerous demands on our companies.</p><p> PAYNE:  You know, I agree with you 1000 percent.  Now, listen, everyone  gives a lip service.  You know, there are endless articles where Jack Lew,  you know, was livid about the circumstances and he talked about them --</p><p> PILLSBURY:  That's right.</p><p> PAYNE:  -- but they never offered solutions.  They never had any sort of  real threat against China that will make China curb their predatory  actions.  And let's face it, when China joined the World Trade Organization  that was going to make them a legitimate player and follow all the rules.   Of course, they didn't follow the rules.  And who can blame China?  They  are.</p><p> You started to show up talking about their grand ambitions.  They do have  grand ambitions.  And right now, by 2026, their economy could be bigger  than ours.</p><p> And, you know, couple India and other Asian nations, and America starts to  falls into the sort of zone where Europe is.  And Europe can't turn around.   They're done unfortunately.  And so, if we're going to make a stand, we  have to make a stand at this very point.</p><p> And, you know, one example I like to use Trish, is a G.M. Buick division  has an SUV, the Envision.  The Envision is only made in Singapore, right,  in Shanghai, rather.  And it's exported to this country.  It was a big hit  last year.</p><p> Now, that's great for General Motors and their shareholders.  It's great  for the American consumers who probably get a pretty good car at a pretty  good price.  And it's great for the Chinese worker who made it.  There's  one person missing from the equation and that's the American factory  worker, auto worker who might have otherwise had made this product.  And  that's why there's a different bifurcation.</p><p> You know, China hasn't pushed back but Wall Street has pushed back.  Last  week, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, every day at 2:00, approximately  2:00, a gigantic sell program went off.  Ultimately it took 1200 Dow points  out of the market.  There was no new news at 2:00.</p><p> Every single day at that point we saw the markets fell off dramatically.  I  think Wall Street has been pushing back on this a lot harder than China  has.</p><p> REGAN:  Look, you know, Michael, I get Wall Street, but what I think is a  critical here is that we not look at the day-to-day, and I would remind  traders not to look at the day-to-day because I'll tell you, 10 years from  now you're going to wake up and had a heck of a problem on your hand if you  don't deal with the China stuff now.  So if we tick a little pain along the  way, we will be better off.  It is mind-boggling to me.</p><p> I mean, they're out creating their version of the WTO.  They're investing  in many economies in Latin America, in Pakistan, in Iran --</p><p> PILLSBURY:  Africa.</p><p> REGAN:  -- or Russia, Africa as well, places that they can seek commodity  resources in.  I mean, they have a very definite plan to be the world's  largest economic power and quite perhaps possibly the world's largest  military power.  So, if we don't wake up and deal with that at some point,  Michael, I think we're going to have much bigger problems on our hands than  600-point drop in the Dow.</p><p> PILLSBURY:  I agree.  I agree with Charles, too.  As you know, I wrote a  book about this three years ago, which is widely criticized as being  alarmist.</p><p> And now President Trump has not only accepted some of the premises, he's  released a much better report, if I may say so, than my book just last  week.  It's 250 pages long.  Example after example after example of what  President Obama used to call the \"gangsterization\" of our companies.   That's why President Trump is moving forward on several fronts.  It's not  just tariffs.  It's this new suit at the WTO in Geneva.</p><p> There's number of other measures.  And, frankly, there is bipartisan  support for what he is doing.  Senator Chuck Schumer is often seen as enemy  of the President, very quickly endorsed President Trump last Thursday on  the tightening up on technology purchases here in the United States.</p><p> The bill has attracted the co-sponsorship of Dianne Feinstein who would be  happy to call a progressive liberal, I think.  So this problem has gone on  for so long that just these limited steps seems to be producing a lot of  bipartisan support.  That's why the day-to-day fluctuation in the market  really kind of a shortsighted.  And some people who didn't listen are  probably losing money now.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  Well, they'll make it up.  Very quickly, Charles, there are  some examples, I think, out there of Chinese companies now looking to  invest in the U.S. because, look, we're not going to continue with the  current status quo.</p><p> PAYNE:  Absolutely.  Well, you know, two news items today.  One is a  smaller company, but it's really important, JinkoSolar, the fourth largest  solar manufacturer in the world that Chinese company probably will be  breaking ground here.  It becomes official today in Jacksonville, $50  million project, 400,000 square feet.</p><p> Here is the most important thing.  This comes after President Trump levied  the 30 percent tariff on their product.  So now they're going to bring and  manufacturing here and of course --</p><p> REGAN:  They're going to bring it here?</p><p> PAYNE:  -- we know Foxconn, of course, is building out big time.  They made  an acquisition today.  And while there are pros and cons to it, people need  to pay attention.</p><p> REGAN:  Michael, Charles, good to see you guys.</p><p> PAYNE:  You got it.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you so much.  Good perspective.  And make sure, everyone,  watch Charles on \"Making Money\" tonight, 6:00 p.m. Eastern right here on  Fox Business.</p><p> Turning to our other top story, Facebook says it will not confirm reports  that CEO, Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress about how Facebook  collects and stores user data.  But Mr. Zuckerberg says he will not appear  before the U.K. parliament.  All of this as we have uncovered video from  eight years ago of Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, warning Mark Zuckerberg  and other tech CEOs about user privacy.</p><p> For the latest, let's go right now to Deirdre Bolton who has been following  the story from day one.  Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Trish, Facebook is under  pressure.  It is facing investigations from 37 states attorneys general,  including tech-heavy states California, Massachusetts, New York.  It is  also now facing specific lawsuits just this morning from counties, such as  Illinois Cook County, that includes Chicago and surrounding areas.</p><p> So, basically those areas are just joining this legal fight against  Facebook and Cambridge Analytica over the misuse of data scraped from  social media profiles claiming that both companies violated state fraud  law.  So that is the paperwork from Cook County, Illinois.  So this lawsuit  claims that Cambridge Analytica tricked Facebook users with quizzes and  that Facebook knew, this is really serious, Trish, this accusation, and did  nothing to stop it.</p><p> Now, as you point it out, Steve Jobs, seemed to have a premonition about  this relationship between tech and privacy getting more cloudy.  Here is  what he said eight years ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVE JOBS, CO-FOUNDER, APPLE:  The Silicon Valley is not monolithic.   We've always had a very different view of privacy than some of our  colleagues in the Valley.  We take privacy extremely seriously.  And some  people want to share more data than other people do.</p><p> Ask them.  Ask them every time.  Make them tell you to stop asking them, if  they get tired of you asking them.  Let them know precisely what you're  going to do with their data.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg wishes he had seen that or heard that or  paid attention because that Cook County lawsuit specifically states  \"Facebook is not a social media company, it is the largest data mining  operation in existence.\"  It further claims that Facebook worked to keep  developers on its platform plying them with sensitive data at the expense  of its users' privacy.</p><p> The Federal Trade Commission also investigating Facebook.  It signaled  today that its probe of the company is broad.  So that's a key word because  it's never what a company wants to hear.  It implies impending regulation.</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg may also testify on Capitol Hill not clear yet.  He has  been invited to a hearing on April 10th.  If he goes, he's going to be  asked questions about Facebook's policies regarding protection and  monitoring of consumer data.</p><p> Senator Grassley is the one who issue the invitation, also extended the  same to Google's CEO and Twitter's CEO.  But essentially, Trish, this opens  up huge questions for big tech, for privacy, for potential regulation.  All  of these companies right away, they have to spend more money on their legal  teams.  Probably Mark Zuckerberg has an extra direct report because of this  and it is certainly going to be a distraction to the way that they are  trying to run their normal businesses.</p><p> Trish, back to you.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's their fault.  Thank you very much, Deirdre.</p><p> BOLTON:  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  Joining me right now for more analysis, \"Bullseye Brief\" Publisher  and Founder and Author, Adam Johnson, along with Belpointe Chief  Strategist, David Nelson.</p><p> Is this going to be the end of Mark Zuckerberg?</p><p> ADAM JOHNSON, AUTHOR, \"BULLSEYE BRIEF\" PUBLISHER AND AUTHOR:  It's starting  to look like it.  And I tell you something, Trish, there's a real trust  problem which Zuckerberg himself said when he went on CNN in his t-shirt  looking all dough-eyed for all of us to try to sound contrite.  The problem  is we don't necessarily trust that our data is safe.  That's number one.</p><p> Number two, we don't necessarily trust that what's in our news feed is  accurate because of the fake news.  And number three, it's kind of hard for  me, and I would imagine a lot of other people, to necessarily trust a  company that takes all our data, all our hard work, our intellectual  capital, all the effort that we put into posting, sells that to other  people for billions of dollars, and all we get back in return is likes.   I'm sorry, but that doesn't breed trust.</p><p> REGAN:  You have a plan for that.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  You have some suggestions to Mr. Zuckerberg.</p><p> JOHNSON:  I do.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's get to that in a second.  But first of all, in terms of this  company, you know, look, I was on vacation this week.  And I used Facebook  more than I would on a regular basis because, you know, I'm posting  pictures of the kids.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Sure.</p><p> REGAN:  And all of that good stuff.  And I thought, you know, I don't know  if I want to be on this right now.  I don't know if anybody wants to be on  this right now because of these violations into our privacy, which, you  know, he's a little contrite there, saying, \"Oh, yes, shouldn't happen.   It's our responsibility.\"</p><p> This is a company, David, that makes money off being able to target ads so  specifically.  They're going to want to know everything they can about  Trish Regan, Adam Johnson, and David Nelson.</p><p> DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  So that they can target those ads.  And I don't know if any of us  should be OK with that.</p><p> NELSON:  Sure.  Big data is big money and that's what this is about.  And I  think what we're finding out is there's nothing social in that social  media.  This is a data mining operation like --</p><p> JOHNSON:  It's one-sided, right?</p><p> NELSON:  -- it's kind of one-sided.  They have the data and they use it.   And for Mark Zuckerberg not, you know, agreeing to appear, he obviously has  aspirations for something beyond Facebook.  He did a tour in the country,  almost in campaign style.</p><p> And nobody looks good in front of the Senate subcommittee.  You start to  look like Michael Corleone and you try to explain that you're just a CEO of  an olive oil company.  He's trying to deflect this, putting the CTO, those  Chief Technology Officers, in front of Congress or parliament.  That's not  going to cut it.  People want some answers.</p><p> And I think there are going to be some solutions.  I was wrong last week  when I thought that with the genie out of the bottle, this business model  wouldn't change.  Obviously it's going to change.  Regulation is going to  change it.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, yes, I mean, it has to change.  And you're right, I mean, the  news feed being fake, our information being compromised.  You think there's  a way for them to fix this so that their \"users,\" you wouldn't even call  them that, would actually have some skin in the game?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  How would you change that?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, I cut a video yesterday and I posted out on Twitter and  Facebook and link.  Then it got a little bit of traction.  I said, \"Stop  calling us users for starters, Mark.  Why don't you start calling us  partners and actually make us partners by giving us the same kind of upside  that the cryptocurrency markets give us.\"  In other words, they in all  their brilliance over at Facebook have all these algorithms.</p><p> \"So why don't you use your algorithms, Mark, to figure out what makes a  great post?  Maybe it's a number of likes, cute puppies, thoughtful social  commentary.  Whatever it is, use all of that to award our posts with face  coins and then let us redeem face coin on Facebook for goods and services.   And by the way, if we don't want to do that let's trade it, the same way we  trade bitcoin and get money for it.\"  In other words, create a rewards  point system so that we are partners.  And that is interesting --</p><p> REGAN:  But that would cost some money.</p><p> JOHNSON:  -- yes, exactly.</p><p> REGAN:  It would cost some money if they're the ones putting the good and  services.</p><p> JOHNSON:  That's right.</p><p> REGAN:  But the membership, you know, you think about --</p><p> NELSON:  But regulations cost money.</p><p> REGAN:  -- right, they give you membership rewards or these credit card  companies, or hotel companies, airline companies, if you spend a certain  amount of money with them, or fly with them, or travel with them you get  something in return.</p><p> JOHNSON:  And Facebook doesn't give us anything.</p><p> REGAN:  They use all our contact.</p><p> NELSON:  In fact, they're stealing and that's it and we're not getting a  dime for it.</p><p> JOHNSON:  All we get are likes.</p><p> NELSON:  We're giving it to them.  I don't know if they're stealing it.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> NELSON:  But I don't know a face coin is going to work.  But certainly, you  know, a rewards program something like that could work.  There's actually  some business models out there, seeking out.</p><p> There's a place where financial advisors go out and put outposts.  And if  they have enough viewers on that they actually get paid for that.  They  would get paid for our likes.  And maybe as of dislike, maybe you get some  points taken away.  Maybe that would eliminate some of those occupy  Democrat political, you know, hand grenades that I see post in my Facebook  page.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Now you're talking like the SAT test where you get penalized for  random answers.  But they can figure this stuff out.  They have the  algorithms</p><p> REGAN:  Well, yes, they certainly can.  I don't think there has been any  willingness to.  We haven't even started about how the, you know, ISIS  terrorists want to use social media.</p><p> NELSON:  The ramifications beyond Facebook are pretty large.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.</p><p> NELSON:  This affects Google and so many others.</p><p> REGAN:  Good stuff.  Adam, David, thank you so much.</p><p> NELSON:  Thanks, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Kim Jong-un reportedly making a secret trip to China,  his first foreign trip since taking power of the kingdom there in 2011.   What does this visit mean for the U.S.?  We're on it.  Stay with us.  We'll  see you here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Everyone, get this, a heavily guarded mysterious train  rolled into Beijing on Monday.  And officials believe that it may have been  carrying none other than North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.  A visit to  the Chinese capital would mark Kim's first trip beyond North Korean borders  since taking power back in 2011.  So if these reports are true, why did he  make the trip?  Why did he make it now?</p><p> Joining me with analysis, \"Nuclear Showdown\" Author, Gordon Chang.  Gordon,  always good to see you.  You are the guy to talk to about North Korea and  China.  So what your take on this?  Did it happen and why did he do it?</p><p> GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN\":  Yes, I think it certainly  happened.  And I think the reason why Kim went to Beijing was because  Beijing demanded that he go there.</p><p> You got to remember that Kim was going to make his first foreign trip to  South Korea, to go south of the military demarcation line in the  demilitarize zone to the peace house, which is in South Korea.  And then  his second foreign trip was going to be seeing President Trump.  The  Chinese realized they were being marginalized.  And so, essentially what  they said to Kim was, \"You come to Beijing or else.\"</p><p> REGAN:  What do you think will come of this?</p><p> CHANG:  I don't know what's going to happen with the Trump-Kim summit.  But  I think that it was very good for President Trump to do that because he is  cutting out the Chinese.  And the Chinese over this century have really  been a maligned influence.  They have been helping the North Korean nuclear  weapons effort as well as ballistic missile program.</p><p> And what Trump decided to do is he was not going to put up with that, he  was going to talk to Kim Jong-un directly.  And you've got to remember,  Trish, this is occurring at the same time as the trade disputes.</p><p> Now, the Chinese have heard American Presidents threaten trade actions, but  they haven't really seen anyone carry through.  And President Trump is  carrying through.  And the Chinese right now are probably pretty  bewildered.  They got both Kim and Trump giving them a hard time.</p><p> REGAN:  Simultaneously, you have John Bolton now as part of the  administration as well and he, Ambassador Bolton has made very clear,  certainly to me in the past, he would like to see the reunification of the  North Korean peninsula and one would have to assume that Kim Jong-un would  be on the losing side of that deal.  So, are the Chinese now being caught  off guard or a bit more nervous?  How does that affect everything that's  going on because they may be looking at it and saying, \"Gosh, you know, the  U.S. is playing tough now on trade?\"  Maybe somehow trying to court Kim  Jong-un in a way that we don't understand, and in fact, the U.S. may wind  up having a much bigger presence right next door to us than we anticipated,  Gordon?</p><p> CHANG:  Yes, you know, John Bolton as National security advisor and Mike  Pompeo as Secretary of State really round out of the war Cabinet.  And, you  know, you look at what Bolton said about the main problem in the world,  it's China and Russia.  And so, Beijing right now has got to understand  that they've got a new sheriff in town, and that Bolton is going to push  Trump in directions that Trump would go anyway.</p><p> You know, Trump started out his administration by trying to placate the  Chinese, bringing them on board, getting them to help on North Korea.  They  didn't do that.  So, you know, right now, you have to a consensus --</p><p> REGAN:  And he said he was a little disappointed in that.  That he had  hoped to get more cooperation from China.</p><p> CHANG:  -- yes.  And we know from the President's tweets that he is not  only -- of course, he was first disappointed but now angry and frustrated.   You have Bolton coming in, Pompeo coming in.  It's a new landscape for the  Chinese.</p><p> And right now, they're seeing something that they have never faced before.</p><p> REGAN:  Meaning?</p><p> CHANG:  Well, meaning that there's now an administration that is willing to  hold them responsible for really predatory mercantilist and dangerous  activities around the world.  And so, you know, they're seeing that the  U.S. is going to impose costs on China and deal with China as well as  Moscow in a way that we haven't seen since the end of the Cold War.  So I  think you have now in Beijing, people are saying who lost America, as a  \"Washington Post\" correspondent recently wrote about a week ago.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's about time.  They've been getting away with a whole lot  for much too long.</p><p> CHANG:  It's a about time.</p><p> REGAN:  Anyway, Gordon Chang, it's good to see you.  Appreciate your  analysis.</p><p> CHANG:  Thanks, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  For the first time in 70 years, the 2020 census is going to include  a question about citizenship.  Democrats are blasting this move, but is it  legal?  We have some intel as the market trades up 25 points right now on  the Dow.  See you right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  And on the market, it took a dip into negative territory.  So,  we're watching it very carefully.  It's been a rather volatile session all  over the place here.</p><p> Investors are still trying to come to grips with what's exactly this trade  dispute with China will mean.</p><p> In the mean time, we're watching another story here and that's the 2020  census, which is now expected to include a question about citizenship  status.  The population count take in every 10 years is required by the  Constitutions and it is use to determine the number of seats each state has  in the House.  So, it's important from that perspective as well as how  federal funds are distributed.</p><p> Democrats are condemning this move saying it would actually discourage  immigrants from responding, which would cause a population undercount and  therefore they wouldn't able to have as many representatives, say, from  state like California.  California's attorney general is suing the Trump  Administration saying and \"including a citizenship question on the 2020  census is not a bad idea, it is illegal.\"</p><p> Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano, with his sense of whether it is, in fact, legal or not.  Where  do you come out?</p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  It is legal to  ask because the federal government has a legitimate interest in knowing  that but the government cannot compel the answer from the person asked  because we have the right to remain silent.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  So then the California A.G. really doesn't have much of a  case.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  First of all, it's premature because Congress hasn't decided  this yet.  This is just a proposal from the Commerce Department, which must  file its proposal by the end of this week and they filed it last night.</p><p>Congress is not in session for the next two weeks.  They're going to debate  this all over again when Congress is back there.  But the only thing under  the Constitution of the government can compel any answer to is how many  human beings lives in this house and how many bathrooms you have?  What is  your education, what is your nationality, and what is your citizenship?   Again, it can ask but it can't punish him for not answering.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  So, it seems to me then, it's fair to ask the question and  it's obviously an individual decision as to whether or not they want to  respond.  But assuming that California is right and all the people that are  here illegally decline to answer the question, does population count go  down and therefore does the number of representatives coming from a state  like California go down?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  That is a great question.  And that would be exquisitely  unfair to the rest of the country if California where to get more  representatives in the House of Representatives because of more illegal or  undocumented persons living in California.  That is not the intent of the  census and that is not the purpose of the headcount.  So the Federal  Government is going to have to find some other way to determine who is  legitimately, lawfully residing in California without compelling people to  answer.</p><p> Now, I think a lot of people will answer anyway.  I don't know if they'll  answer truthfully or not.  I think the Democrats do have an argument to  make the people here unlawfully are not going to answer truthfully because  they'll think it's going to trigger their deportation although this  questionnaires are anonymous.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  Different then, let's say, it was back when, you know,  during World War II and you were making a point to me off-camera that there  were times in history that we have used the census --</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  -- to actually find people?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  The Roosevelt Administration in the census of 1940 not  only asked if you're a citizen and asked your nationality.  And then when  FDR and his colleagues decided to incarcerate Japanese-Americans, they had  the data to find them.</p><p>Congress was so outraged by this.  But in 1947, FDR is dead, the war is  over.  That it enacted legislation prohibiting asking nationality but did  not prohibit asking citizenship.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Well, let's see what happens.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you, Judge.  Good to see you.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Good to see you.  Welcome back.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you.  It's good to be back.  Wow, lots of news going on.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  You could say that.  Any day, any week, Russia is vowing to  retaliate after President Trump expels 60 diplomats from the United States.   What will that include and will this finally put an end to talk that Trump  is too soft on Vladmir Putin?</p><p> Plus, we are following these markets.  We can see we've been all over the  place now, up 13 points, just straddling really the flat line here.  What  is driving this?  Is it really concerns about a trade war with China?   We've got more after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  This is an interesting story, everyone.  Russia vowing to respond  harshly to the U.S. expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats.  Their foreign  ministry even accusing the U.S. of blackmailing other countries to expel  Russian diplomat.</p><p> Our Ashley Webster has been all over the story, of course, it starts in the  U.K. --</p><p> ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  It does.</p><p> REGAN:  -- with nerve gas in an ex-Russian spy.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I mean, on outrageous attack of a nerve agent on British soil,  that's a Russian nerve agent.  I think what's come out of this is a couple  things.  I think Vladmir Putin has totally miscalculated what's happened  here.</p><p> The Brits, I think there is a theory out there, Trish, that Britain is  leaving the E.U., that there's a perception that Theresa May is a weakened  leader and that that has propelled the Russians to take these kinds of  steps, to test the resolve.  If that is the case, terrible mistake because  look what happened, 27 countries now have kicked out more than 140 Russian  diplomats.  The U.N. expelling seven Russian diplomats, we just heard in  reaction to this.  And I think it is certainly hurt Putin in certain ways.</p><p> There are those in Moscow that when they're going to look him, they're  going to say, \"Hmm, that wasn't a very good move.\"</p><p> REAGAN:  He wants to be -- right, on the world international stage and  basically he's losing that starring role by getting all of his diplomats  expelled but one would understand.  I mean, why do you want people in your  country that are capable of --</p><p> WEBSTER:  Spying?</p><p> REGAN:  -- doing what these people did in the U.K.?</p><p> WEBSTER:  Of course, everybody does it.  And the U.K., especially we've had  like 12 deaths in the U.K. that have Russian links.</p><p> REGAN:  And we also know that more than 100 people were exposed to this  nerve gas agent.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, in this small town in the West of England, in Salisbury,  which, you know, the health authorities said, \"No, you'll be OK.\"  Then  they said, \"You may want to stop wiping your cell phones and washing your  clothing.\"  It was amid to this day, there very, you know, there are quite  a few people just say, \"Well, I don't know.  What are the health risks of  this?\"</p><p> But the bottom line is the other point I wanted to make about Putin and  Russia is this is the biggest blow to their spy network on the west,  multinational blows since the Cold War.  I mean, that has severely hurt  their spy network.</p><p> Look at the U.S., 60 diplomats gone, 48.  The closing of consulate in  Seattle, because it's close to Boeing, it's close to a submarine base  there.  That hurts.  That definitely hurts Russia's spy network.  It's not  going to kill it but it's going to make it pretty painful.</p><p> REGAN:  Now, they're trying to retaliate.</p><p> WEBSTER:  They will.</p><p> REGAN:  Meaning?</p><p> WEBSTER:  Meaning that they'll do it tit-to-tat.  The bottom line is Russia  is the big loser here.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  I would say and, you know, I wonder how this sits with some  members of the Democratic Party that keeps saying this administration is an  easy on Russia.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  You're telling me this is the biggest hit to their spy network --</p><p> WEBSTER:  Since the Cold War.</p><p> REGAN:  -- since the Cold War.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  It is significant and I think Putin totally did not expect  the United States to kick out 60 diplomats.  That's a high number.</p><p> The U.K. kicked out 23.  That was a very aggressive move.  It was  appropriate, I believe.  But it certainly was, I think, a shot to Moscow.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  And more and more countries are following the same way,  Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, good.  Good.</p><p> REGAN:  Good.  Ashley, thank you so much.</p><p> We got the markets mixed right now although we are trading higher by about  57 points there on the Dow.  Stocks swinging around here rather wildly but  doesn't this always happen right around 2:00?</p><p> Nicole Petallides has more, down at the New York Stock Exchange for us.</p><p> Hey, Nicole.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  As you said,  we've seen the volatility this afternoon, the most afternoons around this  time gets pretty wild.  Right now, we're up 41 points, off our earlier  highs but it's nice to see some arrows up, with up arrow after last week  where we saw the big sell-off of more than 1400 points.</p><p> Yesterday, nearly 700 point gain and we're holding on to the green just for  the Dow.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 have moved into the red.</p><p> Tech stocks, also financial stocks are coming under some pressure.  Well,  financials are mixed, I should say, tech, energy, and industrials are under  pressure.</p><p> I wanted to get to general electric.  The Buffett bounce.  There is  speculation that Warren Buffett's Berkshire has a way may be getting back  into G.E. after jumping out last year.</p><p> Of course, G.E., over the last 12 months down 56 percent.  It's been a big  dog.  And now there is word that they might be back in in amassing a big  stake.</p><p> Now, of course, General Electric, no comment.  Nobody is commenting.  But  look at the stock, though, it's up 5.5 percent today.  So, we'll see what  happens there but it's certainly getting a nice big boost for today. It's  the worst performer on the Dow this year.</p><p> And then just take a pick at that winners of Dow Jones Industrial Average  today, at this moment and that would be Nike, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Verizon,  Pfizer.  You see some up arrows here as everybody just takes a breather  about those trade war worries at least for the moment.</p><p> Back to you, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  I encourage them to take a big breather, a big one because we have  to deal with this now, head-on, or we're going to see a real problem 10  years from now that we don't want.</p><p> Anyway, Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.</p><p> Paul Ryan, everyone, is forced to deny that he is stepping down as House  Speaker after a resignation rumor goes rampant.  It does open the door to  this big question, are both parties in need of new blood, new leadership,  as we head into the midterms?</p><p>Our panel debates it for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Ryan's office said the Speaker is not resigning.  This, after  reports surface last night the Republican leader may be stepping down.  One  Congressman even suggested that Whip Steve Scalise would be elected to  replace.</p><p> All these rumors out there and, well, they're just rumors but they give beg  the question.  Is it time for a shake-up in leadership for both parties?</p><p> Joining me right now, Fox News Contributor, Jessica Tarlov, and American  Majority CEO, Ned Ryun.  I think you two are going to be in agreement on  this one</p><p> JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's will the first time.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.</p><p> NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO:  Maybe.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, let me start with you, Jessica.  The Democratic Party, and I  think this is obvious to everyone given all the Marie Antoinette-like  comments Nancy Pelosi has been making, do they need a shake-up? </p><p> TARLOV:  I think they're going to end up with a shake-up.  I am a big fan  of Nancy Pelosi.  I think she has been long-term wonderful for the party.</p><p> REGAN:  You're one and only?</p><p> TARLOV:  What?  No, no, there are like 10 of us.  No, what she did was  getting the ACA passed and she's also done a prolific fund-raiser for the  party, which we all know is incredibly important.  Says a lot about that.   But with the leadership challenge the last time around from Tim Ryan and  with people like Conor Lamb getting elected all over the country, I think  there is going to be shift and a lot of pressure to go younger and more  progressive.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  I think that we are seeing that and it's probably the healthy  thing for that party.  Now, in terms of the Republicans, one of the biggest  complaints, I know you have had, Ned, is that Republicans ala Paul Ryan,  are not fully on board with the Trump administration's agenda and they're  very reluctant to come around on a lot of things.  With that in mind, do  they also need a change in leadership?</p><p> RYUN:  Well, I will say this, I mean, these rumors of Paul Ryan resigning  are fake news.  I talked with multiple members of Congress and they said  fake news.</p><p> One of them asked him point-blank, \"Are you going to resign?\"  And he said,  \"Absolutely not.\"  So, I don't think you're going to see a leadership  change anytime soon on the House side.</p><p> But, Trish, I think this whole omnibus bill is a sign that Congress is  broken.  And if you want to talk about leadership that needs to change,  Congress is broken because Mitch McConnell is basically letting the  Democrats help run the Senate with him.</p><p> I honestly think some days, Trish, that we have joint majority leaders with  Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell and one ruling class swamp party.   Because let's face it, a lot of GOP Senators they quite frankly like this  broken Congress.  They can help out their crony special interests buddies  and tuck away the special earmarks in 2200 page bills that nobody reads.   And all of a sudden, look what happens, we have 1.3 trillion omnibus bills.</p><p> So, if you were to ask me, is leadership change needed?  Yes, absolutely.</p><p> The House actually has been operating like it should be.  The Senate is  completely broken and I blame Mitch McConnell for it.</p><p> REGAN:  You do.  Do you think that the Democrats should also make a shift  then?</p><p> RYUN:  No, please, dear God.  Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.</p><p> TARLOV:  That's always what Republican say.</p><p> RYUN:  Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.  She is great for us.   She is writing our attack ads.  Between she and Hillary with crumbs,  deplorable, backwards Trump voters.  I mean, this, in all seriousness,  though Trish, this is a problem for Democrat in those 10 red states where  you have Democrat's Senators running for re-election.</p><p> Hillary and Nancy Pelosi and are writing Republican attack ads for the  midterms.</p><p> TARLOV:  Yes, I would add to that, and I agree with you when you said  Claire McCaskill being incredibly outspoken about Hillary Clinton's  comments.</p><p> RYUN:  Yes.</p><p> TARLOV:  And saying you shouldn't insult anybody but certainly don't be  insulting anyone in my state.  You know, it's just in a deep red state.   And we do have 10 up for re-election.</p><p> I would ask this on the Paul Ryan side of things that there are kind of two  sides to this coin.  Yes, you ask him point-blank what's he is going to do  but there have been a lot of surprise resignations.</p><p> Jason Chaffetz, I don't -- Trey Gowdy not going to run for re-election.   There are a lot committee heads on the Republican side who are not going to  run again.  And we are forgetting as well, Paul Ryan didn't even want this  job.</p><p> REGAN:  That's right.</p><p> TARLOV:  Remember, when he begrudgingly took in and he was like, well, I  want to make sure that I can spend time with me family.  So, under these  circumstances when he's pushing forward an agenda that the President really  doesn't have much interest in it, I can see why he might want to bow out  gracefully before.</p><p> REGAN:  It's kind of thankless job, right, Ned?  I mean, you know, you  either, you know, buy into what the President is doing, I think it's been  hard for him.  I think it's been hard for a lot of Republican there because  they're kind of, \"I don't know if I like this.  I don't know if I like  where it's going.\"  And I worry, much as you do, I think, Ned, it's the  swamp influence that they have --</p><p> RYUN:  It is.</p><p> TARLOV:  -- the ear of many corporations and lobbyists that have their own  interests at stake.  And so, suddenly everybody is saying, \"Whoa, we have a  huge trade war coming, thanks to President Trump and his administration.\"   And so, they're fighting back against that.  When we all know that if we  don't start to confront the reality of what China is doing now, it's going  to be our kids that are paying the price, Ned.</p><p> RYUN:  Absolutely.  You know, I think we're already -- China has already  declared economic warfare on us.  I think people just wake up to that fact.   But no, you're right and, Trish, you've kind of alluded to this just now.</p><p> The interests of Corporate America in the American people, the American  working class are not always aligns and the problem here that you see in  Republican politics and I know even in Democrat politics, a lot of the big  donors to these parties are from corporate interests.  They are not aligned  with American voter.  So, there's no alignment between Trump with the  outside devolve power from D.C., drain the swamp.</p><p> I mean, again, this omnibus bill had nothing to do with draining the swamp.   It was actually feeding the swamp.  It was a triumph from the swamp but it  goes back to some of the structural problems with in party politics of  who's actually footing the bill, who's funding things </p><p> And I tell you want?  When it comes down to the down to leadership, there  are a lot of people with corporate interests, special interests that are  right there in your ear whispering, \"You want to do this, you want next big  check, you need to do this.\"  And sadly, this is what continues to happen  in D.C. year after year.</p><p> TARLOV:  Yes, that is interesting, though, that you point that out about  Corporate America not being on the same page as the American voter.  When  you saw the Republican bill with big slashes to the corporate tax rate but  not to the individual --</p><p> REGAN:  They gave individuals a great, great deal, too.  The only  individuals that --</p><p> TARLOV: -- a lot of people are not benefiting from that.</p><p> REGAN:  -- we are high earner in New York and California.</p><p> RYUN:  Jessica, no complaints.</p><p> TARLOV:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  But I would say, we need to do that on the corporate side.  And  they did give a pretty big one to the -- that's a story for another day.</p><p> TARLOV:  Another segment.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you, Jessica. </p><p> TARLOV:  Thanks, Trish.  Welcome back.</p><p> REGAN:  It's good to see you guys.  It's good to be back.</p><p> Anyway, we're going to look at this because the court battle underway right  now to decide the fate of AT&amp;T and Time Warner is heating up.  We're going  to have some details for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Department of Justice is attempting to block the potential $85  billion merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner.  They're in court today, right  now.</p><p> For more, we're going to Connell McShane.  Hey, Connell.</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Well, hey, Trish.  We have  quite a face-off in the courtroom earlier today between Warren Schlichting,  is a guys and Executive at Sling T.V., which own by Dish network, and an  attorney for the company Daniel Petrocelli is representing AT&amp;T and Time  Warner.</p><p> Schlichting is a government witness.  He testified yesterday here in court  that Turner program and all the networks' Turner control, DCO, AT&amp;T, CNN,  all the rest, that it's a must for Sling and for Dish Network.  But today,  there was a challenge to that.  That's the real question, coming up on the  screen is, are these Turner Networks really must have programming?</p><p> Petrocelli was interesting in the way he did it.  He used the quote from  Charlie Ergen, the founder, kind of against his own employe saying, that he  had said Ergen, \"CNN may and must have programming in 20 years ago but it's  not anymore.  Schlichting response that, \"I call that negotiating in the  press.\"  And they kind of have similar conversation, Trish, about sports  programming and back and forth and went between the two.</p><p> As we move now into the afternoon session as Schlichting wraps up, we  expect to hear from the government's next witness in this trial, which  could be a very interesting witness and expected to be a hostile one, the  Turner Chairman, John Martin.  We'll see if any of his past words  particularly in contract negotiations can be used against him.</p><p> That still to come report back later.  But for now, back to you.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, interesting stuff.  Connell, Thank you so much.</p><p> I have to say, it's pretty good to be back.  It's great to be back in FBN.   I had a wonderful week off, a vacation with my family.  We went all the way  to Hawaii, believe or not and I wanted to show this because this is my  daughter, Alexandra, and she begged us for surfing lessons.</p><p> She's only eight years old.  You may have seen her on the show.  She talked  about her Brownie, Girl Scout cookie sales recently.  Well, she was on that  surfboard.  Oh my goodness.</p><p> She got up on this thing and we thought ourselves, \"Are we really good  parents.\"  She is quite a kid.</p><p> The other two were not as enthused about the surfing thing, I totally get  it, Elizabeth and Jamie.  I don't think you could get me on one of those  things either, I'll be honest.  People asked me if I took that video.  I'm  like, \"Are you kidding me?  Me on a surfboard?</p><p> That will be the day.  Liz Claman, over to you.  Down, gosh, 109.</p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  I know, exactly.  So, we have more  than 250-point gain earlier gone.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good to be back.   Anyway, we've got a brief jumping session right now all over the place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Breaking news, everyone, we've got Dow that's swinging back and forth, in  and out in negative territory.  It was up quite a bit earlier in the  session, more than 200 now.  Down to the flat line and now back up 50.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Investors are continuing to weigh basically the impact of the Trump  administration's aggressive approach to China.  They're not sure how it's  all been to turn out.  We're going to dive in to that over the next hour.   So you can think about how you should be interpreting this news and what is  going to mean for the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I am Trish Regan.  Welcome to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.  It is great to be  back all the way from Hawaii.  I'll have a little more on that at the end  of the show.</p><p> But meanwhile, let's talk about this trade war that everybody is so fearful  about.  I'll tell you, they're starting to basically come to grips with it.   You've got fears are starting to ease.  You're starting to see that the  U.S. and China begin negotiations to address the tensions that had rocked  global markets in recent weeks.</p><p> Investors are still trying to digest of the news at last to record sell- off, which is followed by a sharp rebound, nice to see yesterday.  And  we're going to be watching here all this drama that's unfolding right up  until the closing bell.  But I will ask yet again, are these markets  overreacting?  I think so.  We've got some intel.</p><p> Plus, Facebook woes continue to pile on as U.S. officials say they are  investigating the social network over its controversial privacy policies.   And Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg out there finally feeling a little bit of  heat.  Now reports say he will testify before Congress.  Is this beginning  or the end for this company, for the Facebook founder?  We have more coming  up.</p><p> But first, back to our top story, this trade dispute with China.  Will  investors give President Trump a fair deal in terms of these markets?  Will  China give him a fair deal in terms of trade?</p><p> Joining me right now, Hudson Institute Senior Fellow, Michael Pillsbury,  along with our very own Charles Payne.  It's good to see you both.</p><p> Michael, I'll start with you.  You know, look, people say the Trump  administration is anti-free trade.  It seems like kind of a drastic,  drastic criticism, especially, I think, if you allow China to continue on  the path it is you're going to wake up a decade from now, we're going to be  the next France.  They're going to be the hegemonic power in the world  taking the place of the USA.  So, with that in mind, what needs to happen  so that things start to shake out in a more fair way?</p><p> MICHAEL PILLSBURY, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE:  Well, the first thing  is China has got to take President Trump seriously, and they've done that.   I think they've made some fairly major concessions in the last few days.   That's probably why the market is calming down.</p><p> President Trump did not really declare a trade war at all.  He had very,  very limited measures, measures that were talked about for many years.  The  only thing is he's actually doing it, instead of just talking about it.   But I don't see a really harsh pushback from the Chinese.</p><p> Their turnoffs against the steel and aluminum tariffs were very small, $3  billion to match $3 billion.  They haven't only replied to this yet.  But  they have certainly offered to negotiate, and so some very conciliatory  things almost an apology, Trish, where they say, \"We were willing to open  up our market, we're willing to open up some more sectors to foreign  investment.\"  So, I think, as you say, it's been really exaggerated.</p><p> And President Trump, he's probably showing that he's a master negotiator  here.  He's preserving his ties with China, which he needs for North Korea  and getting their attention to start these negotiations.  So, overall, I  think, it's a pretty optimistic outcome over the last three or four days.   It could have gone much differently.</p><p> REGAN:  Charles, one of the things that frustrated me about China and has  over the last number of years since I've, frankly, been following all of  this is that China really does take advantage of us and U.S. companies.   And you know what?  The CEOs, they don't care because they want access to  that Chinese market because it's going to be great for their quarterly  results.</p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  And, frankly, President Obama didn't really care so much either  because, I think, there's been such a concentration by so many in  Washington on the next election, much like CEOs are focused on the next  quarter's results that they don't appreciate the context of what's going on  here.  They don't appreciate how this is all going to affect our population  down the road, our kids, Charles, if we allow China to continue stealing  our technology and making such onerous demands on our companies.</p><p> PAYNE:  You know, I agree with you 1000 percent.  Now, listen, everyone  gives a lip service.  You know, there are endless articles where Jack Lew,  you know, was livid about the circumstances and he talked about them --</p><p> PILLSBURY:  That's right.</p><p> PAYNE:  -- but they never offered solutions.  They never had any sort of  real threat against China that will make China curb their predatory  actions.  And let's face it, when China joined the World Trade Organization  that was going to make them a legitimate player and follow all the rules.   Of course, they didn't follow the rules.  And who can blame China?  They  are.</p><p> You started to show up talking about their grand ambitions.  They do have  grand ambitions.  And right now, by 2026, their economy could be bigger  than ours.</p><p> And, you know, couple India and other Asian nations, and America starts to  falls into the sort of zone where Europe is.  And Europe can't turn around.   They're done unfortunately.  And so, if we're going to make a stand, we  have to make a stand at this very point.</p><p> And, you know, one example I like to use Trish, is a G.M. Buick division  has an SUV, the Envision.  The Envision is only made in Singapore, right,  in Shanghai, rather.  And it's exported to this country.  It was a big hit  last year.</p><p> Now, that's great for General Motors and their shareholders.  It's great  for the American consumers who probably get a pretty good car at a pretty  good price.  And it's great for the Chinese worker who made it.  There's  one person missing from the equation and that's the American factory  worker, auto worker who might have otherwise had made this product.  And  that's why there's a different bifurcation.</p><p> You know, China hasn't pushed back but Wall Street has pushed back.  Last  week, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, every day at 2:00, approximately  2:00, a gigantic sell program went off.  Ultimately it took 1200 Dow points  out of the market.  There was no new news at 2:00.</p><p> Every single day at that point we saw the markets fell off dramatically.  I  think Wall Street has been pushing back on this a lot harder than China  has.</p><p> REGAN:  Look, you know, Michael, I get Wall Street, but what I think is a  critical here is that we not look at the day-to-day, and I would remind  traders not to look at the day-to-day because I'll tell you, 10 years from  now you're going to wake up and had a heck of a problem on your hand if you  don't deal with the China stuff now.  So if we tick a little pain along the  way, we will be better off.  It is mind-boggling to me.</p><p> I mean, they're out creating their version of the WTO.  They're investing  in many economies in Latin America, in Pakistan, in Iran --</p><p> PILLSBURY:  Africa.</p><p> REGAN:  -- or Russia, Africa as well, places that they can seek commodity  resources in.  I mean, they have a very definite plan to be the world's  largest economic power and quite perhaps possibly the world's largest  military power.  So, if we don't wake up and deal with that at some point,  Michael, I think we're going to have much bigger problems on our hands than  600-point drop in the Dow.</p><p> PILLSBURY:  I agree.  I agree with Charles, too.  As you know, I wrote a  book about this three years ago, which is widely criticized as being  alarmist.</p><p> And now President Trump has not only accepted some of the premises, he's  released a much better report, if I may say so, than my book just last  week.  It's 250 pages long.  Example after example after example of what  President Obama used to call the \"gangsterization\" of our companies.   That's why President Trump is moving forward on several fronts.  It's not  just tariffs.  It's this new suit at the WTO in Geneva.</p><p> There's number of other measures.  And, frankly, there is bipartisan  support for what he is doing.  Senator Chuck Schumer is often seen as enemy  of the President, very quickly endorsed President Trump last Thursday on  the tightening up on technology purchases here in the United States.</p><p> The bill has attracted the co-sponsorship of Dianne Feinstein who would be  happy to call a progressive liberal, I think.  So this problem has gone on  for so long that just these limited steps seems to be producing a lot of  bipartisan support.  That's why the day-to-day fluctuation in the market  really kind of a shortsighted.  And some people who didn't listen are  probably losing money now.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  Well, they'll make it up.  Very quickly, Charles, there are  some examples, I think, out there of Chinese companies now looking to  invest in the U.S. because, look, we're not going to continue with the  current status quo.</p><p> PAYNE:  Absolutely.  Well, you know, two news items today.  One is a  smaller company, but it's really important, JinkoSolar, the fourth largest  solar manufacturer in the world that Chinese company probably will be  breaking ground here.  It becomes official today in Jacksonville, $50  million project, 400,000 square feet.</p><p> Here is the most important thing.  This comes after President Trump levied  the 30 percent tariff on their product.  So now they're going to bring and  manufacturing here and of course --</p><p> REGAN:  They're going to bring it here?</p><p> PAYNE:  -- we know Foxconn, of course, is building out big time.  They made  an acquisition today.  And while there are pros and cons to it, people need  to pay attention.</p><p> REGAN:  Michael, Charles, good to see you guys.</p><p> PAYNE:  You got it.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you so much.  Good perspective.  And make sure, everyone,  watch Charles on \"Making Money\" tonight, 6:00 p.m. Eastern right here on  Fox Business.</p><p> Turning to our other top story, Facebook says it will not confirm reports  that CEO, Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress about how Facebook  collects and stores user data.  But Mr. Zuckerberg says he will not appear  before the U.K. parliament.  All of this as we have uncovered video from  eight years ago of Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, warning Mark Zuckerberg  and other tech CEOs about user privacy.</p><p> For the latest, let's go right now to Deirdre Bolton who has been following  the story from day one.  Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Trish, Facebook is under  pressure.  It is facing investigations from 37 states attorneys general,  including tech-heavy states California, Massachusetts, New York.  It is  also now facing specific lawsuits just this morning from counties, such as  Illinois Cook County, that includes Chicago and surrounding areas.</p><p> So, basically those areas are just joining this legal fight against  Facebook and Cambridge Analytica over the misuse of data scraped from  social media profiles claiming that both companies violated state fraud  law.  So that is the paperwork from Cook County, Illinois.  So this lawsuit  claims that Cambridge Analytica tricked Facebook users with quizzes and  that Facebook knew, this is really serious, Trish, this accusation, and did  nothing to stop it.</p><p> Now, as you point it out, Steve Jobs, seemed to have a premonition about  this relationship between tech and privacy getting more cloudy.  Here is  what he said eight years ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVE JOBS, CO-FOUNDER, APPLE:  The Silicon Valley is not monolithic.   We've always had a very different view of privacy than some of our  colleagues in the Valley.  We take privacy extremely seriously.  And some  people want to share more data than other people do.</p><p> Ask them.  Ask them every time.  Make them tell you to stop asking them, if  they get tired of you asking them.  Let them know precisely what you're  going to do with their data.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BOLTON:  I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg wishes he had seen that or heard that or  paid attention because that Cook County lawsuit specifically states  \"Facebook is not a social media company, it is the largest data mining  operation in existence.\"  It further claims that Facebook worked to keep  developers on its platform plying them with sensitive data at the expense  of its users' privacy.</p><p> The Federal Trade Commission also investigating Facebook.  It signaled  today that its probe of the company is broad.  So that's a key word because  it's never what a company wants to hear.  It implies impending regulation.</p><p> Mark Zuckerberg may also testify on Capitol Hill not clear yet.  He has  been invited to a hearing on April 10th.  If he goes, he's going to be  asked questions about Facebook's policies regarding protection and  monitoring of consumer data.</p><p> Senator Grassley is the one who issue the invitation, also extended the  same to Google's CEO and Twitter's CEO.  But essentially, Trish, this opens  up huge questions for big tech, for privacy, for potential regulation.  All  of these companies right away, they have to spend more money on their legal  teams.  Probably Mark Zuckerberg has an extra direct report because of this  and it is certainly going to be a distraction to the way that they are  trying to run their normal businesses.</p><p> Trish, back to you.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's their fault.  Thank you very much, Deirdre.</p><p> BOLTON:  Thank you.</p><p> REGAN:  Joining me right now for more analysis, \"Bullseye Brief\" Publisher  and Founder and Author, Adam Johnson, along with Belpointe Chief  Strategist, David Nelson.</p><p> Is this going to be the end of Mark Zuckerberg?</p><p> ADAM JOHNSON, AUTHOR, \"BULLSEYE BRIEF\" PUBLISHER AND AUTHOR:  It's starting  to look like it.  And I tell you something, Trish, there's a real trust  problem which Zuckerberg himself said when he went on CNN in his t-shirt  looking all dough-eyed for all of us to try to sound contrite.  The problem  is we don't necessarily trust that our data is safe.  That's number one.</p><p> Number two, we don't necessarily trust that what's in our news feed is  accurate because of the fake news.  And number three, it's kind of hard for  me, and I would imagine a lot of other people, to necessarily trust a  company that takes all our data, all our hard work, our intellectual  capital, all the effort that we put into posting, sells that to other  people for billions of dollars, and all we get back in return is likes.   I'm sorry, but that doesn't breed trust.</p><p> REGAN:  You have a plan for that.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  You have some suggestions to Mr. Zuckerberg.</p><p> JOHNSON:  I do.</p><p> REGAN:  Let's get to that in a second.  But first of all, in terms of this  company, you know, look, I was on vacation this week.  And I used Facebook  more than I would on a regular basis because, you know, I'm posting  pictures of the kids.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Sure.</p><p> REGAN:  And all of that good stuff.  And I thought, you know, I don't know  if I want to be on this right now.  I don't know if anybody wants to be on  this right now because of these violations into our privacy, which, you  know, he's a little contrite there, saying, \"Oh, yes, shouldn't happen.   It's our responsibility.\"</p><p> This is a company, David, that makes money off being able to target ads so  specifically.  They're going to want to know everything they can about  Trish Regan, Adam Johnson, and David Nelson.</p><p> DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  So that they can target those ads.  And I don't know if any of us  should be OK with that.</p><p> NELSON:  Sure.  Big data is big money and that's what this is about.  And I  think what we're finding out is there's nothing social in that social  media.  This is a data mining operation like --</p><p> JOHNSON:  It's one-sided, right?</p><p> NELSON:  -- it's kind of one-sided.  They have the data and they use it.   And for Mark Zuckerberg not, you know, agreeing to appear, he obviously has  aspirations for something beyond Facebook.  He did a tour in the country,  almost in campaign style.</p><p> And nobody looks good in front of the Senate subcommittee.  You start to  look like Michael Corleone and you try to explain that you're just a CEO of  an olive oil company.  He's trying to deflect this, putting the CTO, those  Chief Technology Officers, in front of Congress or parliament.  That's not  going to cut it.  People want some answers.</p><p> And I think there are going to be some solutions.  I was wrong last week  when I thought that with the genie out of the bottle, this business model  wouldn't change.  Obviously it's going to change.  Regulation is going to  change it.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, yes, I mean, it has to change.  And you're right, I mean, the  news feed being fake, our information being compromised.  You think there's  a way for them to fix this so that their \"users,\" you wouldn't even call  them that, would actually have some skin in the game?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  How would you change that?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well, I cut a video yesterday and I posted out on Twitter and  Facebook and link.  Then it got a little bit of traction.  I said, \"Stop  calling us users for starters, Mark.  Why don't you start calling us  partners and actually make us partners by giving us the same kind of upside  that the cryptocurrency markets give us.\"  In other words, they in all  their brilliance over at Facebook have all these algorithms.</p><p> \"So why don't you use your algorithms, Mark, to figure out what makes a  great post?  Maybe it's a number of likes, cute puppies, thoughtful social  commentary.  Whatever it is, use all of that to award our posts with face  coins and then let us redeem face coin on Facebook for goods and services.   And by the way, if we don't want to do that let's trade it, the same way we  trade bitcoin and get money for it.\"  In other words, create a rewards  point system so that we are partners.  And that is interesting --</p><p> REGAN:  But that would cost some money.</p><p> JOHNSON:  -- yes, exactly.</p><p> REGAN:  It would cost some money if they're the ones putting the good and  services.</p><p> JOHNSON:  That's right.</p><p> REGAN:  But the membership, you know, you think about --</p><p> NELSON:  But regulations cost money.</p><p> REGAN:  -- right, they give you membership rewards or these credit card  companies, or hotel companies, airline companies, if you spend a certain  amount of money with them, or fly with them, or travel with them you get  something in return.</p><p> JOHNSON:  And Facebook doesn't give us anything.</p><p> REGAN:  They use all our contact.</p><p> NELSON:  In fact, they're stealing and that's it and we're not getting a  dime for it.</p><p> JOHNSON:  All we get are likes.</p><p> NELSON:  We're giving it to them.  I don't know if they're stealing it.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> NELSON:  But I don't know a face coin is going to work.  But certainly, you  know, a rewards program something like that could work.  There's actually  some business models out there, seeking out.</p><p> There's a place where financial advisors go out and put outposts.  And if  they have enough viewers on that they actually get paid for that.  They  would get paid for our likes.  And maybe as of dislike, maybe you get some  points taken away.  Maybe that would eliminate some of those occupy  Democrat political, you know, hand grenades that I see post in my Facebook  page.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Now you're talking like the SAT test where you get penalized for  random answers.  But they can figure this stuff out.  They have the  algorithms</p><p> REGAN:  Well, yes, they certainly can.  I don't think there has been any  willingness to.  We haven't even started about how the, you know, ISIS  terrorists want to use social media.</p><p> NELSON:  The ramifications beyond Facebook are pretty large.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.</p><p> NELSON:  This affects Google and so many others.</p><p> REGAN:  Good stuff.  Adam, David, thank you so much.</p><p> NELSON:  Thanks, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Kim Jong-un reportedly making a secret trip to China,  his first foreign trip since taking power of the kingdom there in 2011.   What does this visit mean for the U.S.?  We're on it.  Stay with us.  We'll  see you here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Everyone, get this, a heavily guarded mysterious train  rolled into Beijing on Monday.  And officials believe that it may have been  carrying none other than North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.  A visit to  the Chinese capital would mark Kim's first trip beyond North Korean borders  since taking power back in 2011.  So if these reports are true, why did he  make the trip?  Why did he make it now?</p><p> Joining me with analysis, \"Nuclear Showdown\" Author, Gordon Chang.  Gordon,  always good to see you.  You are the guy to talk to about North Korea and  China.  So what your take on this?  Did it happen and why did he do it?</p><p> GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN\":  Yes, I think it certainly  happened.  And I think the reason why Kim went to Beijing was because  Beijing demanded that he go there.</p><p> You got to remember that Kim was going to make his first foreign trip to  South Korea, to go south of the military demarcation line in the  demilitarize zone to the peace house, which is in South Korea.  And then  his second foreign trip was going to be seeing President Trump.  The  Chinese realized they were being marginalized.  And so, essentially what  they said to Kim was, \"You come to Beijing or else.\"</p><p> REGAN:  What do you think will come of this?</p><p> CHANG:  I don't know what's going to happen with the Trump-Kim summit.  But  I think that it was very good for President Trump to do that because he is  cutting out the Chinese.  And the Chinese over this century have really  been a maligned influence.  They have been helping the North Korean nuclear  weapons effort as well as ballistic missile program.</p><p> And what Trump decided to do is he was not going to put up with that, he  was going to talk to Kim Jong-un directly.  And you've got to remember,  Trish, this is occurring at the same time as the trade disputes.</p><p> Now, the Chinese have heard American Presidents threaten trade actions, but  they haven't really seen anyone carry through.  And President Trump is  carrying through.  And the Chinese right now are probably pretty  bewildered.  They got both Kim and Trump giving them a hard time.</p><p> REGAN:  Simultaneously, you have John Bolton now as part of the  administration as well and he, Ambassador Bolton has made very clear,  certainly to me in the past, he would like to see the reunification of the  North Korean peninsula and one would have to assume that Kim Jong-un would  be on the losing side of that deal.  So, are the Chinese now being caught  off guard or a bit more nervous?  How does that affect everything that's  going on because they may be looking at it and saying, \"Gosh, you know, the  U.S. is playing tough now on trade?\"  Maybe somehow trying to court Kim  Jong-un in a way that we don't understand, and in fact, the U.S. may wind  up having a much bigger presence right next door to us than we anticipated,  Gordon?</p><p> CHANG:  Yes, you know, John Bolton as National security advisor and Mike  Pompeo as Secretary of State really round out of the war Cabinet.  And, you  know, you look at what Bolton said about the main problem in the world,  it's China and Russia.  And so, Beijing right now has got to understand  that they've got a new sheriff in town, and that Bolton is going to push  Trump in directions that Trump would go anyway.</p><p> You know, Trump started out his administration by trying to placate the  Chinese, bringing them on board, getting them to help on North Korea.  They  didn't do that.  So, you know, right now, you have to a consensus --</p><p> REGAN:  And he said he was a little disappointed in that.  That he had  hoped to get more cooperation from China.</p><p> CHANG:  -- yes.  And we know from the President's tweets that he is not  only -- of course, he was first disappointed but now angry and frustrated.   You have Bolton coming in, Pompeo coming in.  It's a new landscape for the  Chinese.</p><p> And right now, they're seeing something that they have never faced before.</p><p> REGAN:  Meaning?</p><p> CHANG:  Well, meaning that there's now an administration that is willing to  hold them responsible for really predatory mercantilist and dangerous  activities around the world.  And so, you know, they're seeing that the  U.S. is going to impose costs on China and deal with China as well as  Moscow in a way that we haven't seen since the end of the Cold War.  So I  think you have now in Beijing, people are saying who lost America, as a  \"Washington Post\" correspondent recently wrote about a week ago.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, it's about time.  They've been getting away with a whole lot  for much too long.</p><p> CHANG:  It's a about time.</p><p> REGAN:  Anyway, Gordon Chang, it's good to see you.  Appreciate your  analysis.</p><p> CHANG:  Thanks, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  For the first time in 70 years, the 2020 census is going to include  a question about citizenship.  Democrats are blasting this move, but is it  legal?  We have some intel as the market trades up 25 points right now on  the Dow.  See you right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  And on the market, it took a dip into negative territory.  So,  we're watching it very carefully.  It's been a rather volatile session all  over the place here.</p><p> Investors are still trying to come to grips with what's exactly this trade  dispute with China will mean.</p><p> In the mean time, we're watching another story here and that's the 2020  census, which is now expected to include a question about citizenship  status.  The population count take in every 10 years is required by the  Constitutions and it is use to determine the number of seats each state has  in the House.  So, it's important from that perspective as well as how  federal funds are distributed.</p><p> Democrats are condemning this move saying it would actually discourage  immigrants from responding, which would cause a population undercount and  therefore they wouldn't able to have as many representatives, say, from  state like California.  California's attorney general is suing the Trump  Administration saying and \"including a citizenship question on the 2020  census is not a bad idea, it is illegal.\"</p><p> Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano, with his sense of whether it is, in fact, legal or not.  Where  do you come out?</p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  It is legal to  ask because the federal government has a legitimate interest in knowing  that but the government cannot compel the answer from the person asked  because we have the right to remain silent.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  So then the California A.G. really doesn't have much of a  case.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  First of all, it's premature because Congress hasn't decided  this yet.  This is just a proposal from the Commerce Department, which must  file its proposal by the end of this week and they filed it last night.</p><p>Congress is not in session for the next two weeks.  They're going to debate  this all over again when Congress is back there.  But the only thing under  the Constitution of the government can compel any answer to is how many  human beings lives in this house and how many bathrooms you have?  What is  your education, what is your nationality, and what is your citizenship?   Again, it can ask but it can't punish him for not answering.</p><p> REGAN:  OK.  So, it seems to me then, it's fair to ask the question and  it's obviously an individual decision as to whether or not they want to  respond.  But assuming that California is right and all the people that are  here illegally decline to answer the question, does population count go  down and therefore does the number of representatives coming from a state  like California go down?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  That is a great question.  And that would be exquisitely  unfair to the rest of the country if California where to get more  representatives in the House of Representatives because of more illegal or  undocumented persons living in California.  That is not the intent of the  census and that is not the purpose of the headcount.  So the Federal  Government is going to have to find some other way to determine who is  legitimately, lawfully residing in California without compelling people to  answer.</p><p> Now, I think a lot of people will answer anyway.  I don't know if they'll  answer truthfully or not.  I think the Democrats do have an argument to  make the people here unlawfully are not going to answer truthfully because  they'll think it's going to trigger their deportation although this  questionnaires are anonymous.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.  Different then, let's say, it was back when, you know,  during World War II and you were making a point to me off-camera that there  were times in history that we have used the census --</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  -- to actually find people?</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  The Roosevelt Administration in the census of 1940 not  only asked if you're a citizen and asked your nationality.  And then when  FDR and his colleagues decided to incarcerate Japanese-Americans, they had  the data to find them.</p><p>Congress was so outraged by this.  But in 1947, FDR is dead, the war is  over.  That it enacted legislation prohibiting asking nationality but did  not prohibit asking citizenship.</p><p> REGAN:  All right.  Well, let's see what happens.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you, Judge.  Good to see you.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Good to see you.  Welcome back.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you.  It's good to be back.  Wow, lots of news going on.</p><p> NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  You could say that.  Any day, any week, Russia is vowing to  retaliate after President Trump expels 60 diplomats from the United States.   What will that include and will this finally put an end to talk that Trump  is too soft on Vladmir Putin?</p><p> Plus, we are following these markets.  We can see we've been all over the  place now, up 13 points, just straddling really the flat line here.  What  is driving this?  Is it really concerns about a trade war with China?   We've got more after this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  This is an interesting story, everyone.  Russia vowing to respond  harshly to the U.S. expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats.  Their foreign  ministry even accusing the U.S. of blackmailing other countries to expel  Russian diplomat.</p><p> Our Ashley Webster has been all over the story, of course, it starts in the  U.K. --</p><p> ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  It does.</p><p> REGAN:  -- with nerve gas in an ex-Russian spy.</p><p> WEBSTER:  I mean, on outrageous attack of a nerve agent on British soil,  that's a Russian nerve agent.  I think what's come out of this is a couple  things.  I think Vladmir Putin has totally miscalculated what's happened  here.</p><p> The Brits, I think there is a theory out there, Trish, that Britain is  leaving the E.U., that there's a perception that Theresa May is a weakened  leader and that that has propelled the Russians to take these kinds of  steps, to test the resolve.  If that is the case, terrible mistake because  look what happened, 27 countries now have kicked out more than 140 Russian  diplomats.  The U.N. expelling seven Russian diplomats, we just heard in  reaction to this.  And I think it is certainly hurt Putin in certain ways.</p><p> There are those in Moscow that when they're going to look him, they're  going to say, \"Hmm, that wasn't a very good move.\"</p><p> REAGAN:  He wants to be -- right, on the world international stage and  basically he's losing that starring role by getting all of his diplomats  expelled but one would understand.  I mean, why do you want people in your  country that are capable of --</p><p> WEBSTER:  Spying?</p><p> REGAN:  -- doing what these people did in the U.K.?</p><p> WEBSTER:  Of course, everybody does it.  And the U.K., especially we've had  like 12 deaths in the U.K. that have Russian links.</p><p> REGAN:  And we also know that more than 100 people were exposed to this  nerve gas agent.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, in this small town in the West of England, in Salisbury,  which, you know, the health authorities said, \"No, you'll be OK.\"  Then  they said, \"You may want to stop wiping your cell phones and washing your  clothing.\"  It was amid to this day, there very, you know, there are quite  a few people just say, \"Well, I don't know.  What are the health risks of  this?\"</p><p> But the bottom line is the other point I wanted to make about Putin and  Russia is this is the biggest blow to their spy network on the west,  multinational blows since the Cold War.  I mean, that has severely hurt  their spy network.</p><p> Look at the U.S., 60 diplomats gone, 48.  The closing of consulate in  Seattle, because it's close to Boeing, it's close to a submarine base  there.  That hurts.  That definitely hurts Russia's spy network.  It's not  going to kill it but it's going to make it pretty painful.</p><p> REGAN:  Now, they're trying to retaliate.</p><p> WEBSTER:  They will.</p><p> REGAN:  Meaning?</p><p> WEBSTER:  Meaning that they'll do it tit-to-tat.  The bottom line is Russia  is the big loser here.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  I would say and, you know, I wonder how this sits with some  members of the Democratic Party that keeps saying this administration is an  easy on Russia.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  You're telling me this is the biggest hit to their spy network --</p><p> WEBSTER:  Since the Cold War.</p><p> REGAN:  -- since the Cold War.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  It is significant and I think Putin totally did not expect  the United States to kick out 60 diplomats.  That's a high number.</p><p> The U.K. kicked out 23.  That was a very aggressive move.  It was  appropriate, I believe.  But it certainly was, I think, a shot to Moscow.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  And more and more countries are following the same way,  Ashley.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes, good.  Good.</p><p> REGAN:  Good.  Ashley, thank you so much.</p><p> We got the markets mixed right now although we are trading higher by about  57 points there on the Dow.  Stocks swinging around here rather wildly but  doesn't this always happen right around 2:00?</p><p> Nicole Petallides has more, down at the New York Stock Exchange for us.</p><p> Hey, Nicole.</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  As you said,  we've seen the volatility this afternoon, the most afternoons around this  time gets pretty wild.  Right now, we're up 41 points, off our earlier  highs but it's nice to see some arrows up, with up arrow after last week  where we saw the big sell-off of more than 1400 points.</p><p> Yesterday, nearly 700 point gain and we're holding on to the green just for  the Dow.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 have moved into the red.</p><p> Tech stocks, also financial stocks are coming under some pressure.  Well,  financials are mixed, I should say, tech, energy, and industrials are under  pressure.</p><p> I wanted to get to general electric.  The Buffett bounce.  There is  speculation that Warren Buffett's Berkshire has a way may be getting back  into G.E. after jumping out last year.</p><p> Of course, G.E., over the last 12 months down 56 percent.  It's been a big  dog.  And now there is word that they might be back in in amassing a big  stake.</p><p> Now, of course, General Electric, no comment.  Nobody is commenting.  But  look at the stock, though, it's up 5.5 percent today.  So, we'll see what  happens there but it's certainly getting a nice big boost for today. It's  the worst performer on the Dow this year.</p><p> And then just take a pick at that winners of Dow Jones Industrial Average  today, at this moment and that would be Nike, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Verizon,  Pfizer.  You see some up arrows here as everybody just takes a breather  about those trade war worries at least for the moment.</p><p> Back to you, Trish.</p><p> REGAN:  I encourage them to take a big breather, a big one because we have  to deal with this now, head-on, or we're going to see a real problem 10  years from now that we don't want.</p><p> Anyway, Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.</p><p> Paul Ryan, everyone, is forced to deny that he is stepping down as House  Speaker after a resignation rumor goes rampant.  It does open the door to  this big question, are both parties in need of new blood, new leadership,  as we head into the midterms?</p><p>Our panel debates it for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Ryan's office said the Speaker is not resigning.  This, after  reports surface last night the Republican leader may be stepping down.  One  Congressman even suggested that Whip Steve Scalise would be elected to  replace.</p><p> All these rumors out there and, well, they're just rumors but they give beg  the question.  Is it time for a shake-up in leadership for both parties?</p><p> Joining me right now, Fox News Contributor, Jessica Tarlov, and American  Majority CEO, Ned Ryun.  I think you two are going to be in agreement on  this one</p><p> JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's will the first time.</p><p> REGAN:  Right.</p><p> NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO:  Maybe.</p><p> REGAN:  Well, let me start with you, Jessica.  The Democratic Party, and I  think this is obvious to everyone given all the Marie Antoinette-like  comments Nancy Pelosi has been making, do they need a shake-up? </p><p> TARLOV:  I think they're going to end up with a shake-up.  I am a big fan  of Nancy Pelosi.  I think she has been long-term wonderful for the party.</p><p> REGAN:  You're one and only?</p><p> TARLOV:  What?  No, no, there are like 10 of us.  No, what she did was  getting the ACA passed and she's also done a prolific fund-raiser for the  party, which we all know is incredibly important.  Says a lot about that.   But with the leadership challenge the last time around from Tim Ryan and  with people like Conor Lamb getting elected all over the country, I think  there is going to be shift and a lot of pressure to go younger and more  progressive.</p><p> REGAN:  Yes.  I think that we are seeing that and it's probably the healthy  thing for that party.  Now, in terms of the Republicans, one of the biggest  complaints, I know you have had, Ned, is that Republicans ala Paul Ryan,  are not fully on board with the Trump administration's agenda and they're  very reluctant to come around on a lot of things.  With that in mind, do  they also need a change in leadership?</p><p> RYUN:  Well, I will say this, I mean, these rumors of Paul Ryan resigning  are fake news.  I talked with multiple members of Congress and they said  fake news.</p><p> One of them asked him point-blank, \"Are you going to resign?\"  And he said,  \"Absolutely not.\"  So, I don't think you're going to see a leadership  change anytime soon on the House side.</p><p> But, Trish, I think this whole omnibus bill is a sign that Congress is  broken.  And if you want to talk about leadership that needs to change,  Congress is broken because Mitch McConnell is basically letting the  Democrats help run the Senate with him.</p><p> I honestly think some days, Trish, that we have joint majority leaders with  Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell and one ruling class swamp party.   Because let's face it, a lot of GOP Senators they quite frankly like this  broken Congress.  They can help out their crony special interests buddies  and tuck away the special earmarks in 2200 page bills that nobody reads.   And all of a sudden, look what happens, we have 1.3 trillion omnibus bills.</p><p> So, if you were to ask me, is leadership change needed?  Yes, absolutely.</p><p> The House actually has been operating like it should be.  The Senate is  completely broken and I blame Mitch McConnell for it.</p><p> REGAN:  You do.  Do you think that the Democrats should also make a shift  then?</p><p> RYUN:  No, please, dear God.  Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.</p><p> TARLOV:  That's always what Republican say.</p><p> RYUN:  Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.  She is great for us.   She is writing our attack ads.  Between she and Hillary with crumbs,  deplorable, backwards Trump voters.  I mean, this, in all seriousness,  though Trish, this is a problem for Democrat in those 10 red states where  you have Democrat's Senators running for re-election.</p><p> Hillary and Nancy Pelosi and are writing Republican attack ads for the  midterms.</p><p> TARLOV:  Yes, I would add to that, and I agree with you when you said  Claire McCaskill being incredibly outspoken about Hillary Clinton's  comments.</p><p> RYUN:  Yes.</p><p> TARLOV:  And saying you shouldn't insult anybody but certainly don't be  insulting anyone in my state.  You know, it's just in a deep red state.   And we do have 10 up for re-election.</p><p> I would ask this on the Paul Ryan side of things that there are kind of two  sides to this coin.  Yes, you ask him point-blank what's he is going to do  but there have been a lot of surprise resignations.</p><p> Jason Chaffetz, I don't -- Trey Gowdy not going to run for re-election.   There are a lot committee heads on the Republican side who are not going to  run again.  And we are forgetting as well, Paul Ryan didn't even want this  job.</p><p> REGAN:  That's right.</p><p> TARLOV:  Remember, when he begrudgingly took in and he was like, well, I  want to make sure that I can spend time with me family.  So, under these  circumstances when he's pushing forward an agenda that the President really  doesn't have much interest in it, I can see why he might want to bow out  gracefully before.</p><p> REGAN:  It's kind of thankless job, right, Ned?  I mean, you know, you  either, you know, buy into what the President is doing, I think it's been  hard for him.  I think it's been hard for a lot of Republican there because  they're kind of, \"I don't know if I like this.  I don't know if I like  where it's going.\"  And I worry, much as you do, I think, Ned, it's the  swamp influence that they have --</p><p> RYUN:  It is.</p><p> TARLOV:  -- the ear of many corporations and lobbyists that have their own  interests at stake.  And so, suddenly everybody is saying, \"Whoa, we have a  huge trade war coming, thanks to President Trump and his administration.\"   And so, they're fighting back against that.  When we all know that if we  don't start to confront the reality of what China is doing now, it's going  to be our kids that are paying the price, Ned.</p><p> RYUN:  Absolutely.  You know, I think we're already -- China has already  declared economic warfare on us.  I think people just wake up to that fact.   But no, you're right and, Trish, you've kind of alluded to this just now.</p><p> The interests of Corporate America in the American people, the American  working class are not always aligns and the problem here that you see in  Republican politics and I know even in Democrat politics, a lot of the big  donors to these parties are from corporate interests.  They are not aligned  with American voter.  So, there's no alignment between Trump with the  outside devolve power from D.C., drain the swamp.</p><p> I mean, again, this omnibus bill had nothing to do with draining the swamp.   It was actually feeding the swamp.  It was a triumph from the swamp but it  goes back to some of the structural problems with in party politics of  who's actually footing the bill, who's funding things </p><p> And I tell you want?  When it comes down to the down to leadership, there  are a lot of people with corporate interests, special interests that are  right there in your ear whispering, \"You want to do this, you want next big  check, you need to do this.\"  And sadly, this is what continues to happen  in D.C. year after year.</p><p> TARLOV:  Yes, that is interesting, though, that you point that out about  Corporate America not being on the same page as the American voter.  When  you saw the Republican bill with big slashes to the corporate tax rate but  not to the individual --</p><p> REGAN:  They gave individuals a great, great deal, too.  The only  individuals that --</p><p> TARLOV: -- a lot of people are not benefiting from that.</p><p> REGAN:  -- we are high earner in New York and California.</p><p> RYUN:  Jessica, no complaints.</p><p> TARLOV:  Yes.</p><p> REGAN:  But I would say, we need to do that on the corporate side.  And  they did give a pretty big one to the -- that's a story for another day.</p><p> TARLOV:  Another segment.</p><p> REGAN:  Thank you, Jessica. </p><p> TARLOV:  Thanks, Trish.  Welcome back.</p><p> REGAN:  It's good to see you guys.  It's good to be back.</p><p> Anyway, we're going to look at this because the court battle underway right  now to decide the fate of AT&amp;T and Time Warner is heating up.  We're going  to have some details for you next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> REGAN:  Department of Justice is attempting to block the potential $85  billion merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner.  They're in court today, right  now.</p><p> For more, we're going to Connell McShane.  Hey, Connell.</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Well, hey, Trish.  We have  quite a face-off in the courtroom earlier today between Warren Schlichting,  is a guys and Executive at Sling T.V., which own by Dish network, and an  attorney for the company Daniel Petrocelli is representing AT&amp;T and Time  Warner.</p><p> Schlichting is a government witness.  He testified yesterday here in court  that Turner program and all the networks' Turner control, DCO, AT&amp;T, CNN,  all the rest, that it's a must for Sling and for Dish Network.  But today,  there was a challenge to that.  That's the real question, coming up on the  screen is, are these Turner Networks really must have programming?</p><p> Petrocelli was interesting in the way he did it.  He used the quote from  Charlie Ergen, the founder, kind of against his own employe saying, that he  had said Ergen, \"CNN may and must have programming in 20 years ago but it's  not anymore.  Schlichting response that, \"I call that negotiating in the  press.\"  And they kind of have similar conversation, Trish, about sports  programming and back and forth and went between the two.</p><p> As we move now into the afternoon session as Schlichting wraps up, we  expect to hear from the government's next witness in this trial, which  could be a very interesting witness and expected to be a hostile one, the  Turner Chairman, John Martin.  We'll see if any of his past words  particularly in contract negotiations can be used against him.</p><p> That still to come report back later.  But for now, back to you.</p><p> REGAN:  All right, interesting stuff.  Connell, Thank you so much.</p><p> I have to say, it's pretty good to be back.  It's great to be back in FBN.   I had a wonderful week off, a vacation with my family.  We went all the way  to Hawaii, believe or not and I wanted to show this because this is my  daughter, Alexandra, and she begged us for surfing lessons.</p><p> She's only eight years old.  You may have seen her on the show.  She talked  about her Brownie, Girl Scout cookie sales recently.  Well, she was on that  surfboard.  Oh my goodness.</p><p> She got up on this thing and we thought ourselves, \"Are we really good  parents.\"  She is quite a kid.</p><p> The other two were not as enthused about the surfing thing, I totally get  it, Elizabeth and Jamie.  I don't think you could get me on one of those  things either, I'll be honest.  People asked me if I took that video.  I'm  like, \"Are you kidding me?  Me on a surfboard?</p><p> That will be the day.  Liz Claman, over to you.  Down, gosh, 109.</p><p> LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  I know, exactly.  So, we have more  than 250-point gain earlier gone.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good to be back.   Anyway, we've got a brief jumping session right now all over the place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news, everyone, we've got Dow that's swinging back and forth, in  and out in negative territory.  It was up quite a bit earlier in the  session, more than 200 now.  Down to the flat line and now back up 50.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors are continuing to weigh basically the impact of the Trump  administration's aggressive approach to China.  They're not sure how it's  all been to turn out.  We're going to dive in to that over the next hour.   So you can think about how you should be interpreting this news and what is  going to mean for the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am Trish Regan.  Welcome to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.  It is great to be  back all the way from Hawaii.  I'll have a little more on that at the end  of the show.</p><p>But meanwhile, let's talk about this trade war that everybody is so fearful  about.  I'll tell you, they're starting to basically come to grips with it.   You've got fears are starting to ease.  You're starting to see that the  U.S. and China begin negotiations to address the tensions that had rocked  global markets in recent weeks.</p><p>Investors are still trying to digest of the news at last to record sell- off, which is followed by a sharp rebound, nice to see yesterday.  And  we're going to be watching here all this drama that's unfolding right up  until the closing bell.  But I will ask yet again, are these markets  overreacting?  I think so.  We've got some intel.</p><p>Plus, Facebook woes continue to pile on as U.S. officials say they are  investigating the social network over its controversial privacy policies.   And Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg out there finally feeling a little bit of  heat.  Now reports say he will testify before Congress.  Is this beginning  or the end for this company, for the Facebook founder?  We have more coming  up.</p><p>But first, back to our top story, this trade dispute with China.  Will  investors give President Trump a fair deal in terms of these markets?  Will  China give him a fair deal in terms of trade?</p><p>Joining me right now, Hudson Institute Senior Fellow, Michael Pillsbury,  along with our very own Charles Payne.  It's good to see you both.</p><p>Michael, I'll start with you.  You know, look, people say the Trump  administration is anti-free trade.  It seems like kind of a drastic,  drastic criticism, especially, I think, if you allow China to continue on  the path it is you're going to wake up a decade from now, we're going to be  the next France.  They're going to be the hegemonic power in the world  taking the place of the USA.  So, with that in mind, what needs to happen  so that things start to shake out in a more fair way?</p><p>MICHAEL PILLSBURY, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE:  Well, the first thing  is China has got to take President Trump seriously, and they've done that.   I think they've made some fairly major concessions in the last few days.   That's probably why the market is calming down.</p><p>President Trump did not really declare a trade war at all.  He had very,  very limited measures, measures that were talked about for many years.  The  only thing is he's actually doing it, instead of just talking about it.   But I don't see a really harsh pushback from the Chinese.</p><p>Their turnoffs against the steel and aluminum tariffs were very small, $3  billion to match $3 billion.  They haven't only replied to this yet.  But  they have certainly offered to negotiate, and so some very conciliatory  things almost an apology, Trish, where they say, \"We were willing to open  up our market, we're willing to open up some more sectors to foreign  investment.\"  So, I think, as you say, it's been really exaggerated.</p><p>And President Trump, he's probably showing that he's a master negotiator  here.  He's preserving his ties with China, which he needs for North Korea  and getting their attention to start these negotiations.  So, overall, I  think, it's a pretty optimistic outcome over the last three or four days.   It could have gone much differently.</p><p>REGAN:  Charles, one of the things that frustrated me about China and has  over the last number of years since I've, frankly, been following all of  this is that China really does take advantage of us and U.S. companies.   And you know what?  The CEOs, they don't care because they want access to  that Chinese market because it's going to be great for their quarterly  results.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  And, frankly, President Obama didn't really care so much either  because, I think, there's been such a concentration by so many in  Washington on the next election, much like CEOs are focused on the next  quarter's results that they don't appreciate the context of what's going on  here.  They don't appreciate how this is all going to affect our population  down the road, our kids, Charles, if we allow China to continue stealing  our technology and making such onerous demands on our companies.</p><p>PAYNE:  You know, I agree with you 1000 percent.  Now, listen, everyone  gives a lip service.  You know, there are endless articles where Jack Lew,  you know, was livid about the circumstances and he talked about them --</p><p>PILLSBURY:  That's right.</p><p>PAYNE:  -- but they never offered solutions.  They never had any sort of  real threat against China that will make China curb their predatory  actions.  And let's face it, when China joined the World Trade Organization  that was going to make them a legitimate player and follow all the rules.   Of course, they didn't follow the rules.  And who can blame China?  They  are.</p><p>You started to show up talking about their grand ambitions.  They do have  grand ambitions.  And right now, by 2026, their economy could be bigger  than ours.</p><p>And, you know, couple India and other Asian nations, and America starts to  falls into the sort of zone where Europe is.  And Europe can't turn around.   They're done unfortunately.  And so, if we're going to make a stand, we  have to make a stand at this very point.</p><p>And, you know, one example I like to use Trish, is a G.M. Buick division  has an SUV, the Envision.  The Envision is only made in Singapore, right,  in Shanghai, rather.  And it's exported to this country.  It was a big hit  last year.</p><p>Now, that's great for General Motors and their shareholders.  It's great  for the American consumers who probably get a pretty good car at a pretty  good price.  And it's great for the Chinese worker who made it.  There's  one person missing from the equation and that's the American factory  worker, auto worker who might have otherwise had made this product.  And  that's why there's a different bifurcation.</p><p>You know, China hasn't pushed back but Wall Street has pushed back.  Last  week, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, every day at 2:00, approximately  2:00, a gigantic sell program went off.  Ultimately it took 1200 Dow points  out of the market.  There was no new news at 2:00.</p><p>Every single day at that point we saw the markets fell off dramatically.  I  think Wall Street has been pushing back on this a lot harder than China  has.</p><p>REGAN:  Look, you know, Michael, I get Wall Street, but what I think is a  critical here is that we not look at the day-to-day, and I would remind  traders not to look at the day-to-day because I'll tell you, 10 years from  now you're going to wake up and had a heck of a problem on your hand if you  don't deal with the China stuff now.  So if we tick a little pain along the  way, we will be better off.  It is mind-boggling to me.</p><p>I mean, they're out creating their version of the WTO.  They're investing  in many economies in Latin America, in Pakistan, in Iran --</p><p>PILLSBURY:  Africa.</p><p>REGAN:  -- or Russia, Africa as well, places that they can seek commodity  resources in.  I mean, they have a very definite plan to be the world's  largest economic power and quite perhaps possibly the world's largest  military power.  So, if we don't wake up and deal with that at some point,  Michael, I think we're going to have much bigger problems on our hands than  600-point drop in the Dow.</p><p>PILLSBURY:  I agree.  I agree with Charles, too.  As you know, I wrote a  book about this three years ago, which is widely criticized as being  alarmist.</p><p>And now President Trump has not only accepted some of the premises, he's  released a much better report, if I may say so, than my book just last  week.  It's 250 pages long.  Example after example after example of what  President Obama used to call the \"gangsterization\" of our companies.   That's why President Trump is moving forward on several fronts.  It's not  just tariffs.  It's this new suit at the WTO in Geneva.</p><p>There's number of other measures.  And, frankly, there is bipartisan  support for what he is doing.  Senator Chuck Schumer is often seen as enemy  of the President, very quickly endorsed President Trump last Thursday on  the tightening up on technology purchases here in the United States.</p><p>The bill has attracted the co-sponsorship of Dianne Feinstein who would be  happy to call a progressive liberal, I think.  So this problem has gone on  for so long that just these limited steps seems to be producing a lot of  bipartisan support.  That's why the day-to-day fluctuation in the market  really kind of a shortsighted.  And some people who didn't listen are  probably losing money now.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  Well, they'll make it up.  Very quickly, Charles, there are  some examples, I think, out there of Chinese companies now looking to  invest in the U.S. because, look, we're not going to continue with the  current status quo.</p><p>PAYNE:  Absolutely.  Well, you know, two news items today.  One is a  smaller company, but it's really important, JinkoSolar, the fourth largest  solar manufacturer in the world that Chinese company probably will be  breaking ground here.  It becomes official today in Jacksonville, $50  million project, 400,000 square feet.</p><p>Here is the most important thing.  This comes after President Trump levied  the 30 percent tariff on their product.  So now they're going to bring and  manufacturing here and of course --</p><p>REGAN:  They're going to bring it here?</p><p>PAYNE:  -- we know Foxconn, of course, is building out big time.  They made  an acquisition today.  And while there are pros and cons to it, people need  to pay attention.</p><p>REGAN:  Michael, Charles, good to see you guys.</p><p>PAYNE:  You got it.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you so much.  Good perspective.  And make sure, everyone,  watch Charles on \"Making Money\" tonight, 6:00 p.m. Eastern right here on  Fox Business.</p><p>Turning to our other top story, Facebook says it will not confirm reports  that CEO, Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress about how Facebook  collects and stores user data.  But Mr. Zuckerberg says he will not appear  before the U.K. parliament.  All of this as we have uncovered video from  eight years ago of Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, warning Mark Zuckerberg  and other tech CEOs about user privacy.</p><p>For the latest, let's go right now to Deirdre Bolton who has been following  the story from day one.  Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Trish, Facebook is under  pressure.  It is facing investigations from 37 states attorneys general,  including tech-heavy states California, Massachusetts, New York.  It is  also now facing specific lawsuits just this morning from counties, such as  IllinoisCook County, that includes Chicago and surrounding areas.</p><p>So, basically those areas are just joining this legal fight against  Facebook and Cambridge Analytica over the misuse of data scraped from  social media profiles claiming that both companies violated state fraud  law.  So that is the paperwork from Cook County, Illinois.  So this lawsuit  claims that Cambridge Analytica tricked Facebook users with quizzes and  that Facebook knew, this is really serious, Trish, this accusation, and did  nothing to stop it.</p><p>Now, as you point it out, Steve Jobs, seemed to have a premonition about  this relationship between tech and privacy getting more cloudy.  Here is  what he said eight years ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE JOBS, CO-FOUNDER, APPLE:  The Silicon Valley is not monolithic.   We've always had a very different view of privacy than some of our  colleagues in the Valley.  We take privacy extremely seriously.  And some  people want to share more data than other people do.</p><p>Ask them.  Ask them every time.  Make them tell you to stop asking them, if  they get tired of you asking them.  Let them know precisely what you're  going to do with their data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  I'm sure Mark Zuckerberg wishes he had seen that or heard that or  paid attention because that Cook County lawsuit specifically states  \"Facebook is not a social media company, it is the largest data mining  operation in existence.\"  It further claims that Facebook worked to keep  developers on its platform plying them with sensitive data at the expense  of its users' privacy.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission also investigating Facebook.  It signaled  today that its probe of the company is broad.  So that's a key word because  it's never what a company wants to hear.  It implies impending regulation.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg may also testify on Capitol Hill not clear yet.  He has  been invited to a hearing on April 10th.  If he goes, he's going to be  asked questions about Facebook's policies regarding protection and  monitoring of consumer data.</p><p>Senator Grassley is the one who issue the invitation, also extended the  same to Google's CEO and Twitter's CEO.  But essentially, Trish, this opens  up huge questions for big tech, for privacy, for potential regulation.  All  of these companies right away, they have to spend more money on their legal  teams.  Probably Mark Zuckerberg has an extra direct report because of this  and it is certainly going to be a distraction to the way that they are  trying to run their normal businesses.</p><p>Trish, back to you.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's their fault.  Thank you very much, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON:  Thank you.</p><p>REGAN:  Joining me right now for more analysis, \"Bullseye Brief\" Publisher  and Founder and Author, Adam Johnson, along with Belpointe Chief  Strategist, David Nelson.</p><p>Is this going to be the end of Mark Zuckerberg?</p><p>ADAM JOHNSON, AUTHOR, \"BULLSEYE BRIEF\" PUBLISHER AND AUTHOR:  It's starting  to look like it.  And I tell you something, Trish, there's a real trust  problem which Zuckerberg himself said when he went on CNN in his t-shirt  looking all dough-eyed for all of us to try to sound contrite.  The problem  is we don't necessarily trust that our data is safe.  That's number one.</p><p>Number two, we don't necessarily trust that what's in our news feed is  accurate because of the fake news.  And number three, it's kind of hard for  me, and I would imagine a lot of other people, to necessarily trust a  company that takes all our data, all our hard work, our intellectual  capital, all the effort that we put into posting, sells that to other  people for billions of dollars, and all we get back in return is likes.   I'm sorry, but that doesn't breed trust.</p><p>REGAN:  You have a plan for that.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  You have some suggestions to Mr. Zuckerberg.</p><p>JOHNSON:  I do.</p><p>REGAN:  Let's get to that in a second.  But first of all, in terms of this  company, you know, look, I was on vacation this week.  And I used Facebook  more than I would on a regular basis because, you know, I'm posting  pictures of the kids.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Sure.</p><p>REGAN:  And all of that good stuff.  And I thought, you know, I don't know  if I want to be on this right now.  I don't know if anybody wants to be on  this right now because of these violations into our privacy, which, you  know, he's a little contrite there, saying, \"Oh, yes, shouldn't happen.   It's our responsibility.\"</p><p>This is a company, David, that makes money off being able to target ads so  specifically.  They're going to want to know everything they can about  Trish Regan, Adam Johnson, and David Nelson.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  So that they can target those ads.  And I don't know if any of us  should be OK with that.</p><p>NELSON:  Sure.  Big data is big money and that's what this is about.  And I  think what we're finding out is there's nothing social in that social  media.  This is a data mining operation like --</p><p>JOHNSON:  It's one-sided, right?</p><p>NELSON:  -- it's kind of one-sided.  They have the data and they use it.   And for Mark Zuckerberg not, you know, agreeing to appear, he obviously has  aspirations for something beyond Facebook.  He did a tour in the country,  almost in campaign style.</p><p>And nobody looks good in front of the Senate subcommittee.  You start to  look like Michael Corleone and you try to explain that you're just a CEO of  an olive oil company.  He's trying to deflect this, putting the CTO, those  Chief Technology Officers, in front of Congress or parliament.  That's not  going to cut it.  People want some answers.</p><p>And I think there are going to be some solutions.  I was wrong last week  when I thought that with the genie out of the bottle, this business model  wouldn't change.  Obviously it's going to change.  Regulation is going to  change it.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, yes, I mean, it has to change.  And you're right, I mean, the  news feed being fake, our information being compromised.  You think there's  a way for them to fix this so that their \"users,\" you wouldn't even call  them that, would actually have some skin in the game?</p><p>JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  How would you change that?</p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, I cut a video yesterday and I posted out on Twitter and  Facebook and link.  Then it got a little bit of traction.  I said, \"Stop  calling us users for starters, Mark.  Why don't you start calling us  partners and actually make us partners by giving us the same kind of upside  that the cryptocurrency markets give us.\"  In other words, they in all  their brilliance over at Facebook have all these algorithms.</p><p>\"So why don't you use your algorithms, Mark, to figure out what makes a  great post?  Maybe it's a number of likes, cute puppies, thoughtful social  commentary.  Whatever it is, use all of that to award our posts with face  coins and then let us redeem face coin on Facebook for goods and services.   And by the way, if we don't want to do that let's trade it, the same way we  trade bitcoin and get money for it.\"  In other words, create a rewards  point system so that we are partners.  And that is interesting --</p><p>REGAN:  But that would cost some money.</p><p>JOHNSON:  -- yes, exactly.</p><p>REGAN:  It would cost some money if they're the ones putting the good and  services.</p><p>JOHNSON:  That's right.</p><p>REGAN:  But the membership, you know, you think about --</p><p>NELSON:  But regulations cost money.</p><p>REGAN:  -- right, they give you membership rewards or these credit card  companies, or hotel companies, airline companies, if you spend a certain  amount of money with them, or fly with them, or travel with them you get  something in return.</p><p>JOHNSON:  And Facebook doesn't give us anything.</p><p>REGAN:  They use all our contact.</p><p>NELSON:  In fact, they're stealing and that's it and we're not getting a  dime for it.</p><p>JOHNSON:  All we get are likes.</p><p>NELSON:  We're giving it to them.  I don't know if they're stealing it.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>NELSON:  But I don't know a face coin is going to work.  But certainly, you  know, a rewards program something like that could work.  There's actually  some business models out there, seeking out.</p><p>There's a place where financial advisors go out and put outposts.  And if  they have enough viewers on that they actually get paid for that.  They  would get paid for our likes.  And maybe as of dislike, maybe you get some  points taken away.  Maybe that would eliminate some of those occupy  Democrat political, you know, hand grenades that I see post in my Facebook  page.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Now you're talking like the SAT test where you get penalized for  random answers.  But they can figure this stuff out.  They have the  algorithms</p><p>REGAN:  Well, yes, they certainly can.  I don't think there has been any  willingness to.  We haven't even started about how the, you know, ISIS  terrorists want to use social media.</p><p>NELSON:  The ramifications beyond Facebook are pretty large.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.</p><p>NELSON:  This affects Google and so many others.</p><p>REGAN:  Good stuff.  Adam, David, thank you so much.</p><p>NELSON:  Thanks, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Kim Jong-un reportedly making a secret trip to China,  his first foreign trip since taking power of the kingdom there in 2011.   What does this visit mean for the U.S.?  We're on it.  Stay with us.  We'll  see you here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Everyone, get this, a heavily guarded mysterious train  rolled into Beijing on Monday.  And officials believe that it may have been  carrying none other than North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.  A visit to  the Chinese capital would mark Kim's first trip beyond North Korean borders  since taking power back in 2011.  So if these reports are true, why did he  make the trip?  Why did he make it now?</p><p>Joining me with analysis, \"Nuclear Showdown\" Author, Gordon Chang.  Gordon,  always good to see you.  You are the guy to talk to about North Korea and  China.  So what your take on this?  Did it happen and why did he do it?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN\":  Yes, I think it certainly  happened.  And I think the reason why Kim went to Beijing was because  Beijing demanded that he go there.</p><p>You got to remember that Kim was going to make his first foreign trip to  South Korea, to go south of the military demarcation line in the  demilitarize zone to the peace house, which is in South Korea.  And then  his second foreign trip was going to be seeing President Trump.  The  Chinese realized they were being marginalized.  And so, essentially what  they said to Kim was, \"You come to Beijing or else.\"</p><p>REGAN:  What do you think will come of this?</p><p>CHANG:  I don't know what's going to happen with the Trump-Kim summit.  But  I think that it was very good for President Trump to do that because he is  cutting out the Chinese.  And the Chinese over this century have really  been a maligned influence.  They have been helping the North Korean nuclear  weapons effort as well as ballistic missile program.</p><p>And what Trump decided to do is he was not going to put up with that, he  was going to talk to Kim Jong-un directly.  And you've got to remember,  Trish, this is occurring at the same time as the trade disputes.</p><p>Now, the Chinese have heard American Presidents threaten trade actions, but  they haven't really seen anyone carry through.  And President Trump is  carrying through.  And the Chinese right now are probably pretty  bewildered.  They got both Kim and Trump giving them a hard time.</p><p>REGAN:  Simultaneously, you have John Bolton now as part of the  administration as well and he, Ambassador Bolton has made very clear,  certainly to me in the past, he would like to see the reunification of the  North Korean peninsula and one would have to assume that Kim Jong-un would  be on the losing side of that deal.  So, are the Chinese now being caught  off guard or a bit more nervous?  How does that affect everything that's  going on because they may be looking at it and saying, \"Gosh, you know, the  U.S. is playing tough now on trade?\"  Maybe somehow trying to court Kim  Jong-un in a way that we don't understand, and in fact, the U.S. may wind  up having a much bigger presence right next door to us than we anticipated,  Gordon?</p><p>CHANG:  Yes, you know, John Bolton as National security advisor and Mike  Pompeo as Secretary of State really round out of the war Cabinet.  And, you  know, you look at what Bolton said about the main problem in the world,  it's China and Russia.  And so, Beijing right now has got to understand  that they've got a new sheriff in town, and that Bolton is going to push  Trump in directions that Trump would go anyway.</p><p>You know, Trump started out his administration by trying to placate the  Chinese, bringing them on board, getting them to help on North Korea.  They  didn't do that.  So, you know, right now, you have to a consensus --</p><p>REGAN:  And he said he was a little disappointed in that.  That he had  hoped to get more cooperation from China.</p><p>CHANG:  -- yes.  And we know from the President's tweets that he is not  only -- of course, he was first disappointed but now angry and frustrated.   You have Bolton coming in, Pompeo coming in.  It's a new landscape for the  Chinese.</p><p>And right now, they're seeing something that they have never faced before.</p><p>REGAN:  Meaning?</p><p>CHANG:  Well, meaning that there's now an administration that is willing to  hold them responsible for really predatory mercantilist and dangerous  activities around the world.  And so, you know, they're seeing that the  U.S. is going to impose costs on China and deal with China as well as  Moscow in a way that we haven't seen since the end of the Cold War.  So I  think you have now in Beijing, people are saying who lost America, as a  \"Washington Post\" correspondent recently wrote about a week ago.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, it's about time.  They've been getting away with a whole lot  for much too long.</p><p>CHANG:  It's a about time.</p><p>REGAN:  Anyway, Gordon Chang, it's good to see you.  Appreciate your  analysis.</p><p>CHANG:  Thanks, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  For the first time in 70 years, the 2020 census is going to include  a question about citizenship.  Democrats are blasting this move, but is it  legal?  We have some intel as the market trades up 25 points right now on  the Dow.  See you right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  And on the market, it took a dip into negative territory.  So,  we're watching it very carefully.  It's been a rather volatile session all  over the place here.</p><p>Investors are still trying to come to grips with what's exactly this trade  dispute with China will mean.</p><p>In the mean time, we're watching another story here and that's the 2020  census, which is now expected to include a question about citizenship  status.  The population count take in every 10 years is required by the  Constitutions and it is use to determine the number of seats each state has  in the House.  So, it's important from that perspective as well as how  federal funds are distributed.</p><p>Democrats are condemning this move saying it would actually discourage  immigrants from responding, which would cause a population undercount and  therefore they wouldn't able to have as many representatives, say, from  state like California.  California's attorney general is suing the Trump  Administration saying and \"including a citizenship question on the 2020  census is not a bad idea, it is illegal.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano, with his sense of whether it is, in fact, legal or not.  Where  do you come out?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  It is legal to  ask because the federal government has a legitimate interest in knowing  that but the government cannot compel the answer from the person asked  because we have the right to remain silent.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  So then the California A.G. really doesn't have much of a  case.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  First of all, it's premature because Congress hasn't decided  this yet.  This is just a proposal from the Commerce Department, which must  file its proposal by the end of this week and they filed it last night.</p><p>Congress is not in session for the next two weeks.  They're going to debate  this all over again when Congress is back there.  But the only thing under  the Constitution of the government can compel any answer to is how many  human beings lives in this house and how many bathrooms you have?  What is  your education, what is your nationality, and what is your citizenship?   Again, it can ask but it can't punish him for not answering.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  So, it seems to me then, it's fair to ask the question and  it's obviously an individual decision as to whether or not they want to  respond.  But assuming that California is right and all the people that are  here illegally decline to answer the question, does population count go  down and therefore does the number of representatives coming from a state  like California go down?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That is a great question.  And that would be exquisitely  unfair to the rest of the country if California where to get more  representatives in the House of Representatives because of more illegal or  undocumented persons living in California.  That is not the intent of the  census and that is not the purpose of the headcount.  So the Federal  Government is going to have to find some other way to determine who is  legitimately, lawfully residing in California without compelling people to  answer.</p><p>Now, I think a lot of people will answer anyway.  I don't know if they'll  answer truthfully or not.  I think the Democrats do have an argument to  make the people here unlawfully are not going to answer truthfully because  they'll think it's going to trigger their deportation although this  questionnaires are anonymous.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  Different then, let's say, it was back when, you know,  during World War II and you were making a point to me off-camera that there  were times in history that we have used the census --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  -- to actually find people?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  The Roosevelt Administration in the census of 1940 not  only asked if you're a citizen and asked your nationality.  And then when  FDR and his colleagues decided to incarcerate Japanese-Americans, they had  the data to find them.</p><p>Congress was so outraged by this.  But in 1947, FDR is dead, the war is  over.  That it enacted legislation prohibiting asking nationality but did  not prohibit asking citizenship.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, let's see what happens.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you, Judge.  Good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Good to see you.  Welcome back.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you.  It's good to be back.  Wow, lots of news going on.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  You could say that.  Any day, any week, Russia is vowing to  retaliate after President Trump expels 60 diplomats from the United States.   What will that include and will this finally put an end to talk that Trump  is too soft on Vladmir Putin?</p><p>Plus, we are following these markets.  We can see we've been all over the  place now, up 13 points, just straddling really the flat line here.  What  is driving this?  Is it really concerns about a trade war with China?   We've got more after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  This is an interesting story, everyone.  Russia vowing to respond  harshly to the U.S. expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats.  Their foreign  ministry even accusing the U.S. of blackmailing other countries to expel  Russian diplomat.</p><p>Our Ashley Webster has been all over the story, of course, it starts in the  U.K. --</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  It does.</p><p>REGAN:  -- with nerve gas in an ex-Russian spy.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I mean, on outrageous attack of a nerve agent on British soil,  that's a Russian nerve agent.  I think what's come out of this is a couple  things.  I think Vladmir Putin has totally miscalculated what's happened  here.</p><p>The Brits, I think there is a theory out there, Trish, that Britain is  leaving the E.U., that there's a perception that Theresa May is a weakened  leader and that that has propelled the Russians to take these kinds of  steps, to test the resolve.  If that is the case, terrible mistake because  look what happened, 27 countries now have kicked out more than 140 Russian  diplomats.  The U.N. expelling seven Russian diplomats, we just heard in  reaction to this.  And I think it is certainly hurt Putin in certain ways.</p><p>There are those in Moscow that when they're going to look him, they're  going to say, \"Hmm, that wasn't a very good move.\"</p><p>REAGAN:  He wants to be -- right, on the world international stage and  basically he's losing that starring role by getting all of his diplomats  expelled but one would understand.  I mean, why do you want people in your  country that are capable of --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Spying?</p><p>REGAN:  -- doing what these people did in the U.K.?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Of course, everybody does it.  And the U.K., especially we've had  like 12 deaths in the U.K. that have Russian links.</p><p>REGAN:  And we also know that more than 100 people were exposed to this  nerve gas agent.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, in this small town in the West of England, in Salisbury,  which, you know, the health authorities said, \"No, you'll be OK.\"  Then  they said, \"You may want to stop wiping your cell phones and washing your  clothing.\"  It was amid to this day, there very, you know, there are quite  a few people just say, \"Well, I don't know.  What are the health risks of  this?\"</p><p>But the bottom line is the other point I wanted to make about Putin and  Russia is this is the biggest blow to their spy network on the west,  multinational blows since the Cold War.  I mean, that has severely hurt  their spy network.</p><p>Look at the U.S., 60 diplomats gone, 48.  The closing of consulate in  Seattle, because it's close to Boeing, it's close to a submarine base  there.  That hurts.  That definitely hurts Russia's spy network.  It's not  going to kill it but it's going to make it pretty painful.</p><p>REGAN:  Now, they're trying to retaliate.</p><p>WEBSTER:  They will.</p><p>REGAN:  Meaning?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Meaning that they'll do it tit-to-tat.  The bottom line is Russia  is the big loser here.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  I would say and, you know, I wonder how this sits with some  members of the Democratic Party that keeps saying this administration is an  easy on Russia.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  You're telling me this is the biggest hit to their spy network --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Since the Cold War.</p><p>REGAN:  -- since the Cold War.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  It is significant and I think Putin totally did not expect  the United States to kick out 60 diplomats.  That's a high number.</p><p>The U.K. kicked out 23.  That was a very aggressive move.  It was  appropriate, I believe.  But it certainly was, I think, a shot to Moscow.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  And more and more countries are following the same way,  Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, good.  Good.</p><p>REGAN:  Good.  Ashley, thank you so much.</p><p>We got the markets mixed right now although we are trading higher by about  57 points there on the Dow.  Stocks swinging around here rather wildly but  doesn't this always happen right around 2:00?</p><p>Nicole Petallides has more, down at the New York Stock Exchange for us.</p><p>Hey, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish.  As you said,  we've seen the volatility this afternoon, the most afternoons around this  time gets pretty wild.  Right now, we're up 41 points, off our earlier  highs but it's nice to see some arrows up, with up arrow after last week  where we saw the big sell-off of more than 1400 points.</p><p>Yesterday, nearly 700 point gain and we're holding on to the green just for  the Dow.  The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 have moved into the red.</p><p>Tech stocks, also financial stocks are coming under some pressure.  Well,  financials are mixed, I should say, tech, energy, and industrials are under  pressure.</p><p>I wanted to get to general electric.  The Buffett bounce.  There is  speculation that Warren Buffett's Berkshire has a way may be getting back  into G.E. after jumping out last year.</p><p>Of course, G.E., over the last 12 months down 56 percent.  It's been a big  dog.  And now there is word that they might be back in in amassing a big  stake.</p><p>Now, of course, General Electric, no comment.  Nobody is commenting.  But  look at the stock, though, it's up 5.5 percent today.  So, we'll see what  happens there but it's certainly getting a nice big boost for today. It's  the worst performer on the Dow this year.</p><p>And then just take a pick at that winners of Dow Jones Industrial Average  today, at this moment and that would be Nike, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Verizon,  Pfizer.  You see some up arrows here as everybody just takes a breather  about those trade war worries at least for the moment.</p><p>Back to you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  I encourage them to take a big breather, a big one because we have  to deal with this now, head-on, or we're going to see a real problem 10  years from now that we don't want.</p><p>Anyway, Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.</p><p>Paul Ryan, everyone, is forced to deny that he is stepping down as House  Speaker after a resignation rumor goes rampant.  It does open the door to  this big question, are both parties in need of new blood, new leadership,  as we head into the midterms?</p><p>Our panel debates it for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Ryan's office said the Speaker is not resigning.  This, after  reports surface last night the Republican leader may be stepping down.  One  Congressman even suggested that Whip Steve Scalise would be elected to  replace.</p><p>All these rumors out there and, well, they're just rumors but they give beg  the question.  Is it time for a shake-up in leadership for both parties?</p><p>Joining me right now, Fox News Contributor, Jessica Tarlov, and American  Majority CEO, Ned Ryun.  I think you two are going to be in agreement on  this one</p><p>JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's will the first time.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.</p><p>NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO:  Maybe.</p><p>REGAN:  Well, let me start with you, Jessica.  The Democratic Party, and I  think this is obvious to everyone given all the Marie Antoinette-like  comments Nancy Pelosi has been making, do they need a shake-up? </p><p>TARLOV:  I think they're going to end up with a shake-up.  I am a big fan  of Nancy Pelosi.  I think she has been long-term wonderful for the party.</p><p>REGAN:  You're one and only?</p><p>TARLOV:  What?  No, no, there are like 10 of us.  No, what she did was  getting the ACA passed and she's also done a prolific fund-raiser for the  party, which we all know is incredibly important.  Says a lot about that.   But with the leadership challenge the last time around from Tim Ryan and  with people like Conor Lamb getting elected all over the country, I think  there is going to be shift and a lot of pressure to go younger and more  progressive.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.  I think that we are seeing that and it's probably the healthy  thing for that party.  Now, in terms of the Republicans, one of the biggest  complaints, I know you have had, Ned, is that Republicans ala Paul Ryan,  are not fully on board with the Trump administration's agenda and they're  very reluctant to come around on a lot of things.  With that in mind, do  they also need a change in leadership?</p><p>RYUN:  Well, I will say this, I mean, these rumors of Paul Ryan resigning  are fake news.  I talked with multiple members of Congress and they said  fake news.</p><p>One of them asked him point-blank, \"Are you going to resign?\"  And he said,  \"Absolutely not.\"  So, I don't think you're going to see a leadership  change anytime soon on the House side.</p><p>But, Trish, I think this whole omnibus bill is a sign that Congress is  broken.  And if you want to talk about leadership that needs to change,  Congress is broken because Mitch McConnell is basically letting the  Democrats help run the Senate with him.</p><p>I honestly think some days, Trish, that we have joint majority leaders with  Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell and one ruling class swamp party.   Because let's face it, a lot of GOP Senators they quite frankly like this  broken Congress.  They can help out their crony special interests buddies  and tuck away the special earmarks in 2200 page bills that nobody reads.   And all of a sudden, look what happens, we have 1.3 trillion omnibus bills.</p><p>So, if you were to ask me, is leadership change needed?  Yes, absolutely.</p><p>The House actually has been operating like it should be.  The Senate is  completely broken and I blame Mitch McConnell for it.</p><p>REGAN:  You do.  Do you think that the Democrats should also make a shift  then?</p><p>RYUN:  No, please, dear God.  Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.</p><p>TARLOV:  That's always what Republican say.</p><p>RYUN:  Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.  She is great for us.   She is writing our attack ads.  Between she and Hillary with crumbs,  deplorable, backwards Trump voters.  I mean, this, in all seriousness,  though Trish, this is a problem for Democrat in those 10 red states where  you have Democrat's Senators running for re-election.</p><p>Hillary and Nancy Pelosi and are writing Republican attack ads for the  midterms.</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes, I would add to that, and I agree with you when you said  Claire McCaskill being incredibly outspoken about Hillary Clinton's  comments.</p><p>RYUN:  Yes.</p><p>TARLOV:  And saying you shouldn't insult anybody but certainly don't be  insulting anyone in my state.  You know, it's just in a deep red state.   And we do have 10 up for re-election.</p><p>I would ask this on the Paul Ryan side of things that there are kind of two  sides to this coin.  Yes, you ask him point-blank what's he is going to do  but there have been a lot of surprise resignations.</p><p>Jason Chaffetz, I don't -- Trey Gowdy not going to run for re-election.   There are a lot committee heads on the Republican side who are not going to  run again.  And we are forgetting as well, Paul Ryan didn't even want this  job.</p><p>REGAN:  That's right.</p><p>TARLOV:  Remember, when he begrudgingly took in and he was like, well, I  want to make sure that I can spend time with me family.  So, under these  circumstances when he's pushing forward an agenda that the President really  doesn't have much interest in it, I can see why he might want to bow out  gracefully before.</p><p>REGAN:  It's kind of thankless job, right, Ned?  I mean, you know, you  either, you know, buy into what the President is doing, I think it's been  hard for him.  I think it's been hard for a lot of Republican there because  they're kind of, \"I don't know if I like this.  I don't know if I like  where it's going.\"  And I worry, much as you do, I think, Ned, it's the  swamp influence that they have --</p><p>RYUN:  It is.</p><p>TARLOV:  -- the ear of many corporations and lobbyists that have their own  interests at stake.  And so, suddenly everybody is saying, \"Whoa, we have a  huge trade war coming, thanks to President Trump and his administration.\"   And so, they're fighting back against that.  When we all know that if we  don't start to confront the reality of what China is doing now, it's going  to be our kids that are paying the price, Ned.</p><p>RYUN:  Absolutely.  You know, I think we're already -- China has already  declared economic warfare on us.  I think people just wake up to that fact.   But no, you're right and, Trish, you've kind of alluded to this just now.</p><p>The interests of Corporate America in the American people, the American  working class are not always aligns and the problem here that you see in  Republican politics and I know even in Democrat politics, a lot of the big  donors to these parties are from corporate interests.  They are not aligned  with American voter.  So, there's no alignment between Trump with the  outside devolve power from D.C., drain the swamp.</p><p>I mean, again, this omnibus bill had nothing to do with draining the swamp.   It was actually feeding the swamp.  It was a triumph from the swamp but it  goes back to some of the structural problems with in party politics of  who's actually footing the bill, who's funding things </p><p>And I tell you want?  When it comes down to the down to leadership, there  are a lot of people with corporate interests, special interests that are  right there in your ear whispering, \"You want to do this, you want next big  check, you need to do this.\"  And sadly, this is what continues to happen  in D.C. year after year.</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes, that is interesting, though, that you point that out about  Corporate America not being on the same page as the American voter.  When  you saw the Republican bill with big slashes to the corporate tax rate but  not to the individual --</p><p>REGAN:  They gave individuals a great, great deal, too.  The only  individuals that --</p><p>TARLOV: -- a lot of people are not benefiting from that.</p><p>REGAN:  -- we are high earner in New York and California.</p><p>RYUN:  Jessica, no complaints.</p><p>TARLOV:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  But I would say, we need to do that on the corporate side.  And  they did give a pretty big one to the -- that's a story for another day.</p><p>TARLOV:  Another segment.</p><p>REGAN:  Thank you, Jessica. </p><p>TARLOV:  Thanks, Trish.  Welcome back.</p><p>REGAN:  It's good to see you guys.  It's good to be back.</p><p>Anyway, we're going to look at this because the court battle underway right  now to decide the fate of AT&amp;T and Time Warner is heating up.  We're going  to have some details for you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  Department of Justice is attempting to block the potential $85  billion merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner.  They're in court today, right  now.</p><p>For more, we're going to Connell McShane.  Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  Well, hey, Trish.  We have  quite a face-off in the courtroom earlier today between Warren Schlichting,  is a guys and Executive at Sling T.V., which own by Dish network, and an  attorney for the company Daniel Petrocelli is representing AT&amp;T and Time  Warner.</p><p>Schlichting is a government witness.  He testified yesterday here in court  that Turner program and all the networks' Turner control, DCO, AT&amp;T, CNN,  all the rest, that it's a must for Sling and for Dish Network.  But today,  there was a challenge to that.  That's the real question, coming up on the  screen is, are these Turner Networks really must have programming?</p><p>Petrocelli was interesting in the way he did it.  He used the quote from  Charlie Ergen, the founder, kind of against his own employe saying, that he  had said Ergen, \"CNN may and must have programming in 20 years ago but it's  not anymore.  Schlichting response that, \"I call that negotiating in the  press.\"  And they kind of have similar conversation, Trish, about sports  programming and back and forth and went between the two.</p><p>As we move now into the afternoon session as Schlichting wraps up, we  expect to hear from the government's next witness in this trial, which  could be a very interesting witness and expected to be a hostile one, the  Turner Chairman, John Martin.  We'll see if any of his past words  particularly in contract negotiations can be used against him.</p><p>That still to come report back later.  But for now, back to you.</p><p>REGAN:  All right, interesting stuff.  Connell, Thank you so much.</p><p>I have to say, it's pretty good to be back.  It's great to be back in FBN.   I had a wonderful week off, a vacation with my family.  We went all the way  to Hawaii, believe or not and I wanted to show this because this is my  daughter, Alexandra, and she begged us for surfing lessons.</p><p>She's only eight years old.  You may have seen her on the show.  She talked  about her Brownie, Girl Scout cookie sales recently.  Well, she was on that  surfboard.  Oh my goodness.</p><p>She got up on this thing and we thought ourselves, \"Are we really good  parents.\"  She is quite a kid.</p><p>The other two were not as enthused about the surfing thing, I totally get  it, Elizabeth and Jamie.  I don't think you could get me on one of those  things either, I'll be honest.  People asked me if I took that video.  I'm  like, \"Are you kidding me?  Me on a surfboard?</p><p>That will be the day.  Liz Claman, over to you.  Down, gosh, 109.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR:  I know, exactly.  So, we have more  than 250-point gain earlier gone.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good to be back. Anyway, we've got a brief jumping session right now all over the place.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news, everyone, we've got Dow that's swinging back and forth, in and out in negative territory. It was up quite a bit earlier in the session, more than 200 now. Down to the flat line and now back up 50.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors are continuing to weigh basically the impact of the <person><nameText>Trump administration's </nameText></person>aggressive approach to China. They're not sure how it's all been to turn out. We're going to dive in to that over the next hour. So you can think about how you should be interpreting this news and what is going to mean for the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I am Trish Regan. Welcome to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT. It is great to be back all the way from Hawaii. I'll have a little more on that at the end of the show.</p><p>But meanwhile, let's talk about this trade war that everybody is so fearful about. I'll tell you, they're starting to basically come to grips with it. You've got fears are starting to ease. You're starting to see that the U.S. and China begin negotiations to address the tensions that had rocked global markets in recent weeks.</p><p>Investors are still trying to digest of the news at last to record sell- off, which is followed by a sharp rebound, nice to see yesterday. And we're going to be watching here all this drama that's unfolding right up until the closing bell. But I will ask yet again, are these markets overreacting? I think so. We've got some intel.</p><p>Plus, Facebook woes continue to pile on as U.S. officials say they are investigating the social network over its controversial privacy policies. And Facebook CEO, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>out there finally feeling a little bit of heat. Now reports say he will testify before Congress. Is this beginning or the end for this company, for the Facebook founder? We have more coming up.</p><p>But first, back to our top story, this trade dispute with China. Will investors give <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>a fair deal in terms of these markets? Will China give him a fair deal in terms of trade?</p><p>Joining me right now, Hudson Institute Senior Fellow, Michael Pillsbury, along with our very own Charles Payne. It's good to see you both.</p><p>Michael, I'll start with you. You know, look, people say the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is anti-free trade. It seems like kind of a drastic, drastic criticism, especially, I think, if you allow China to continue on the path it is you're going to wake up a decade from now, we're going to be the next France. They're going to be the hegemonic power in the world taking the place of the USA. So, with that in mind, what needs to happen so that things start to shake out in a more fair way?</p><p>MICHAEL PILLSBURY, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE: Well, the first thing is China has got to take <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>seriously, and they've done that. I think they've made some fairly major concessions in the last few days. That's probably why the market is calming down.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>did not really declare a trade war at all. He had very, very limited measures, measures that were talked about for many years. The only thing is he's actually doing it, instead of just talking about it. But I don't see a really harsh pushback from the Chinese.</p><p>Their turnoffs against the steel and aluminum tariffs were very small, $3 billion to match $3 billion. They haven't only replied to this yet. But they have certainly offered to negotiate, and so some very conciliatory things almost an apology, Trish, where they say, \"We were willing to open up our market, we're willing to open up some more sectors to foreign investment.\" So, I think, as you say, it's been really exaggerated.</p><p>And <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>he's probably showing that he's a master negotiator here. He's preserving his ties with China, which he needs for North Korea and getting their attention to start these negotiations. So, overall, I think, it's a pretty optimistic outcome over the last three or four days. It could have gone much differently.</p><p>REGAN: Charles, one of the things that frustrated me about China and has over the last number of years since I've, frankly, been following all of this is that China really does take advantage of us and U.S. companies. And you know what? The CEOs, they don't care because they want access to that Chinese market because it's going to be great for their quarterly results.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: Right.</p><p>REGAN: And, frankly, President Obama didn't really care so much either because, I think, there's been such a concentration by so many in Washington on the next election, much like CEOs are focused on the next quarter's results that they don't appreciate the context of what's going on here. They don't appreciate how this is all going to affect our population down the road, our kids, Charles, if we allow China to continue stealing our technology and making such onerous demands on our companies.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, I agree with you 1000 percent. Now, listen, everyone gives a lip service. You know, there are endless articles where Jack Lew, you know, was livid about the circumstances and he talked about them --</p><p>PILLSBURY: That's right.</p><p>PAYNE: -- but they never offered solutions. They never had any sort of real threat against China that will make China curb their predatory actions. And let's face it, when China joined the World Trade Organization that was going to make them a legitimate player and follow all the rules. Of course, they didn't follow the rules. And who can blame China? They are.</p><p>You started to show up talking about their grand ambitions. They do have grand ambitions. And right now, by 2026, their economy could be bigger than ours.</p><p>And, you know, couple India and other Asian nations, and America starts to falls into the sort of zone where Europe is. And Europe can't turn around. They're done unfortunately. And so, if we're going to make a stand, we have to make a stand at this very point.</p><p>And, you know, one example I like to use Trish, is a G.M. Buick division has an SUV, the Envision. The Envision is only made in Singapore, right, in Shanghai, rather. And it's exported to this country. It was a big hit last year.</p><p>Now, that's great for General Motors and their shareholders. It's great for the American consumers who probably get a pretty good car at a pretty good price. And it's great for the Chinese worker who made it. There's one person missing from the equation and that's the American factory worker, auto worker who might have otherwise had made this product. And that's why there's a different bifurcation.</p><p>You know, China hasn't pushed back but Wall Street has pushed back. Last week, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, every day at 2:00, approximately 2:00, a gigantic sell program went off. Ultimately it took 1200 Dow points out of the market. There was no new news at 2:00.</p><p>Every single day at that point we saw the markets fell off dramatically. I think Wall Street has been pushing back on this a lot harder than China has.</p><p>REGAN: Look, you know, Michael, I get Wall Street, but what I think is a critical here is that we not look at the day-to-day, and I would remind traders not to look at the day-to-day because I'll tell you, 10 years from now you're going to wake up and had a heck of a problem on your hand if you don't deal with the China stuff now. So if we tick a little pain along the way, we will be better off. It is mind-boggling to me.</p><p>I mean, they're out creating their version of the WTO. They're investing in many economies in Latin America, in Pakistan, in Iran --</p><p>PILLSBURY: Africa.</p><p>REGAN: -- or Russia, Africa as well, places that they can seek commodity resources in. I mean, they have a very definite plan to be the world's largest economic power and quite perhaps possibly the world's largest military power. So, if we don't wake up and deal with that at some point, Michael, I think we're going to have much bigger problems on our hands than 600-point drop in the Dow.</p><p>PILLSBURY: I agree. I agree with Charles, too. As you know, I wrote a book about this three years ago, which is widely criticized as being alarmist.</p><p>And now <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has not only accepted some of the premises, he's released a much better report, if I may say so, than my book just last week. It's 250 pages long. Example after example after example of what President Obama used to call the \"gangsterization\" of our companies. That's why <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is moving forward on several fronts. It's not just tariffs. It's this new suit at the WTO in Geneva.</p><p>There's number of other measures. And, frankly, there is bipartisan support for what he is doing. Senator Chuck Schumer is often seen as enemy of the President, very quickly endorsed <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>last Thursday on the tightening up on technology purchases here in the United States.</p><p>The bill has attracted the co-sponsorship of Dianne Feinstein who would be happy to call a progressive liberal, I think. So this problem has gone on for so long that just these limited steps seems to be producing a lot of bipartisan support. That's why the day-to-day fluctuation in the market really kind of a shortsighted. And some people who didn't listen are probably losing money now.</p><p>REGAN: Yes. Well, they'll make it up. Very quickly, Charles, there are some examples, I think, out there of Chinese companies now looking to invest in the U.S. because, look, we're not going to continue with the current status quo.</p><p>PAYNE: Absolutely. Well, you know, two news items today. One is a smaller company, but it's really important, JinkoSolar, the fourth largest solar manufacturer in the world that Chinese company probably will be breaking ground here. It becomes official today in Jacksonville, $50 million project, 400,000 square feet.</p><p>Here is the most important thing. This comes after <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>levied the 30 percent tariff on their product. So now they're going to bring and manufacturing here and of course --</p><p>REGAN: They're going to bring it here?</p><p>PAYNE: -- we know Foxconn, of course, is building out big time. They made an acquisition today. And while there are pros and cons to it, people need to pay attention.</p><p>REGAN: Michael, Charles, good to see you guys.</p><p>PAYNE: You got it.</p><p>REGAN: Thank you so much. Good perspective. And make sure, everyone, watch Charles on \"Making Money\" tonight, 6:00 p.m. Eastern right here on Fox Business.</p><p>Turning to our other top story, Facebook says it will not confirm reports that CEO, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>will testify before Congress about how Facebook collects and stores user data. But Mr. Zuckerberg says he will not appear before the U.K. parliament. All of this as we have uncovered video from eight years ago of Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, warning <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and other tech CEOs about user privacy.</p><p>For the latest, let's go right now to Deirdre Bolton who has been following the story from day one. Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: Trish, Facebook is under pressure. It is facing investigations from 37 states attorneys general, including tech-heavy states California, Massachusetts, New York. It is also now facing specific lawsuits just this morning from counties, such as IllinoisCook County, that includes Chicago and surrounding areas.</p><p>So, basically those areas are just joining this legal fight against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica over the misuse of data scraped from social media profiles claiming that both companies violated state fraud law. So that is the paperwork from Cook County, Illinois. So this lawsuit claims that Cambridge Analytica tricked Facebook users with quizzes and that Facebook knew, this is really serious, Trish, this accusation, and did nothing to stop it.</p><p>Now, as you point it out, Steve Jobs, seemed to have a premonition about this relationship between tech and privacy getting more cloudy. Here is what he said eight years ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE JOBS, CO-FOUNDER, APPLE: The Silicon Valley is not monolithic. We've always had a very different view of privacy than some of our colleagues in the Valley. We take privacy extremely seriously. And some people want to share more data than other people do.</p><p>Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them, if they get tired of you asking them. Let them know precisely what you're going to do with their data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: I'm sure <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>wishes he had seen that or heard that or paid attention because that Cook County lawsuit specifically states \"Facebook is not a social media company, it is the largest data mining operation in existence.\" It further claims that Facebook worked to keep developers on its platform plying them with sensitive data at the expense of its users' privacy.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission also investigating Facebook. It signaled today that its probe of the company is broad. So that's a key word because it's never what a company wants to hear. It implies impending regulation.</p><p><person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>may also testify on Capitol Hill not clear yet. He has been invited to a hearing on April 10th. If he goes, he's going to be asked questions about Facebook's policies regarding protection and monitoring of consumer data.</p><p>Senator Grassley is the one who issue the invitation, also extended the same to Google's CEO and Twitter's CEO. But essentially, Trish, this opens up huge questions for big tech, for privacy, for potential regulation. All of these companies right away, they have to spend more money on their legal teams. Probably <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has an extra direct report because of this and it is certainly going to be a distraction to the way that they are trying to run their normal businesses.</p><p>Trish, back to you.</p><p>REGAN: Well, it's their fault. Thank you very much, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: Thank you.</p><p>REGAN: Joining me right now for more analysis, \"Bullseye Brief\" Publisher and Founder and Author, Adam Johnson, along with Belpointe Chief Strategist, David Nelson.</p><p>Is this going to be the end of <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg?</nameText></person></p><p>ADAM JOHNSON, AUTHOR, \"BULLSEYE BRIEF\" PUBLISHER AND AUTHOR: It's starting to look like it. And I tell you something, Trish, there's a real trust problem which Zuckerberg himself said when he went on CNN in his t-shirt looking all dough-eyed for all of us to try to sound contrite. The problem is we don't necessarily trust that our data is safe. That's number one.</p><p>Number two, we don't necessarily trust that what's in our news feed is accurate because of the fake news. And number three, it's kind of hard for me, and I would imagine a lot of other people, to necessarily trust a company that takes all our data, all our hard work, our intellectual capital, all the effort that we put into posting, sells that to other people for billions of dollars, and all we get back in return is likes. I'm sorry, but that doesn't breed trust.</p><p>REGAN: You have a plan for that.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: You have some suggestions to Mr. Zuckerberg.</p><p>JOHNSON: I do.</p><p>REGAN: Let's get to that in a second. But first of all, in terms of this company, you know, look, I was on vacation this week. And I used Facebook more than I would on a regular basis because, you know, I'm posting pictures of the kids.</p><p>JOHNSON: Sure.</p><p>REGAN: And all of that good stuff. And I thought, you know, I don't know if I want to be on this right now. I don't know if anybody wants to be on this right now because of these violations into our privacy, which, you know, he's a little contrite there, saying, \"Oh, yes, shouldn't happen. It's our responsibility.\"</p><p>This is a company, David, that makes money off being able to target ads so specifically. They're going to want to know everything they can about Trish Regan, Adam Johnson, and David Nelson.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: So that they can target those ads. And I don't know if any of us should be OK with that.</p><p>NELSON: Sure. Big data is big money and that's what this is about. And I think what we're finding out is there's nothing social in that social media. This is a data mining operation like --</p><p>JOHNSON: It's one-sided, right?</p><p>NELSON: -- it's kind of one-sided. They have the data and they use it. And for <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>not, you know, agreeing to appear, he obviously has aspirations for something beyond Facebook. He did a tour in the country, almost in campaign style.</p><p>And nobody looks good in front of the Senate subcommittee. You start to look like Michael Corleone and you try to explain that you're just a CEO of an olive oil company. He's trying to deflect this, putting the CTO, those Chief Technology Officers, in front of Congress or parliament. That's not going to cut it. People want some answers.</p><p>And I think there are going to be some solutions. I was wrong last week when I thought that with the genie out of the bottle, this business model wouldn't change. Obviously it's going to change. Regulation is going to change it.</p><p>REGAN: Well, yes, I mean, it has to change. And you're right, I mean, the news feed being fake, our information being compromised. You think there's a way for them to fix this so that their \"users,\" you wouldn't even call them that, would actually have some skin in the game?</p><p>JOHNSON: Right.</p><p>REGAN: How would you change that?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, I cut a video yesterday and I posted out on Twitter and Facebook and link. Then it got a little bit of traction. I said, \"Stop calling us users for starters, Mark. Why don't you start calling us partners and actually make us partners by giving us the same kind of upside that the cryptocurrency markets give us.\" In other words, they in all their brilliance over at Facebook have all these algorithms.</p><p>\"So why don't you use your algorithms, Mark, to figure out what makes a great post? Maybe it's a number of likes, cute puppies, thoughtful social commentary. Whatever it is, use all of that to award our posts with face coins and then let us redeem face coin on Facebook for goods and services. And by the way, if we don't want to do that let's trade it, the same way we trade bitcoin and get money for it.\" In other words, create a rewards point system so that we are partners. And that is interesting --</p><p>REGAN: But that would cost some money.</p><p>JOHNSON: -- yes, exactly.</p><p>REGAN: It would cost some money if they're the ones putting the good and services.</p><p>JOHNSON: That's right.</p><p>REGAN: But the membership, you know, you think about --</p><p>NELSON: But regulations cost money.</p><p>REGAN: -- right, they give you membership rewards or these credit card companies, or hotel companies, airline companies, if you spend a certain amount of money with them, or fly with them, or travel with them you get something in return.</p><p>JOHNSON: And Facebook doesn't give us anything.</p><p>REGAN: They use all our contact.</p><p>NELSON: In fact, they're stealing and that's it and we're not getting a dime for it.</p><p>JOHNSON: All we get are likes.</p><p>NELSON: We're giving it to them. I don't know if they're stealing it.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>NELSON: But I don't know a face coin is going to work. But certainly, you know, a rewards program something like that could work. There's actually some business models out there, seeking out.</p><p>There's a place where financial advisors go out and put outposts. And if they have enough viewers on that they actually get paid for that. They would get paid for our likes. And maybe as of dislike, maybe you get some points taken away. Maybe that would eliminate some of those occupy Democrat political, you know, hand grenades that I see post in my Facebook page.</p><p>JOHNSON: Now you're talking like the SAT test where you get penalized for random answers. But they can figure this stuff out. They have the algorithms</p><p>REGAN: Well, yes, they certainly can. I don't think there has been any willingness to. We haven't even started about how the, you know, ISIS terrorists want to use social media.</p><p>NELSON: The ramifications beyond Facebook are pretty large.</p><p>JOHNSON: Right.</p><p>REGAN: Right.</p><p>NELSON: This affects Google and so many others.</p><p>REGAN: Good stuff. Adam, David, thank you so much.</p><p>NELSON: Thanks, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Kim Jong-un reportedly making a secret trip to China, his first foreign trip since taking power of the kingdom there in 2011. What does this visit mean for the U.S.? We're on it. Stay with us. We'll see you here.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Everyone, get this, a heavily guarded mysterious train rolled into Beijing on Monday. And officials believe that it may have been carrying none other than North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un. A visit to the Chinese capital would mark Kim's first trip beyond North Korean borders since taking power back in 2011. So if these reports are true, why did he make the trip? Why did he make it now?</p><p>Joining me with analysis, \"Nuclear Showdown\" Author, Gordon Chang. Gordon, always good to see you. You are the guy to talk to about North Korea and China. So what your take on this? Did it happen and why did he do it?</p><p>GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN\": Yes, I think it certainly happened. And I think the reason why Kim went to Beijing was because Beijing demanded that he go there.</p><p>You got to remember that Kim was going to make his first foreign trip to South Korea, to go south of the military demarcation line in the demilitarize zone to the peace house, which is in South Korea. And then his second foreign trip was going to be seeing <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>The Chinese realized they were being marginalized. And so, essentially what they said to Kim was, \"You come to Beijing or else.\"</p><p>REGAN: What do you think will come of this?</p><p>CHANG: I don't know what's going to happen with the Trump-Kim summit. But I think that it was very good for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>to do that because he is cutting out the Chinese. And the Chinese over this century have really been a maligned influence. They have been helping the North Korean nuclear weapons effort as well as ballistic missile program.</p><p>And what Trump decided to do is he was not going to put up with that, he was going to talk to Kim Jong-un directly. And you've got to remember, Trish, this is occurring at the same time as the trade disputes.</p><p>Now, the Chinese have heard American Presidents threaten trade actions, but they haven't really seen anyone carry through. And <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is carrying through. And the Chinese right now are probably pretty bewildered. They got both Kim and Trump giving them a hard time.</p><p>REGAN: Simultaneously, you have John Bolton now as part of the administration as well and he, Ambassador Bolton has made very clear, certainly to me in the past, he would like to see the reunification of the North Korean peninsula and one would have to assume that Kim Jong-un would be on the losing side of that deal. So, are the Chinese now being caught off guard or a bit more nervous? How does that affect everything that's going on because they may be looking at it and saying, \"Gosh, you know, the U.S. is playing tough now on trade?\" Maybe somehow trying to court Kim Jong-un in a way that we don't understand, and in fact, the U.S. may wind up having a much bigger presence right next door to us than we anticipated, Gordon?</p><p>CHANG: Yes, you know, John Bolton as National security advisor and Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State really round out of the war Cabinet. And, you know, you look at what Bolton said about the main problem in the world, it's China and Russia. And so, Beijing right now has got to understand that they've got a new sheriff in town, and that Bolton is going to push Trump in directions that Trump would go anyway.</p><p>You know, Trump started out his administration by trying to placate the Chinese, bringing them on board, getting them to help on North Korea. They didn't do that. So, you know, right now, you have to a consensus --</p><p>REGAN: And he said he was a little disappointed in that. That he had hoped to get more cooperation from China.</p><p>CHANG: -- yes. And we know from the President's tweets that he is not only -- of course, he was first disappointed but now angry and frustrated. You have Bolton coming in, Pompeo coming in. It's a new landscape for the Chinese.</p><p>And right now, they're seeing something that they have never faced before.</p><p>REGAN: Meaning?</p><p>CHANG: Well, meaning that there's now an administration that is willing to hold them responsible for really predatory mercantilist and dangerous activities around the world. And so, you know, they're seeing that the U.S. is going to impose costs on China and deal with China as well as Moscow in a way that we haven't seen since the end of the Cold War. So I think you have now in Beijing, people are saying who lost America, as a \"Washington Post\" correspondent recently wrote about a week ago.</p><p>REGAN: Well, it's about time. They've been getting away with a whole lot for much too long.</p><p>CHANG: It's a about time.</p><p>REGAN: Anyway, Gordon Chang, it's good to see you. Appreciate your analysis.</p><p>CHANG: Thanks, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: For the first time in 70 years, the 2020 census is going to include a question about citizenship. Democrats are blasting this move, but is it legal? We have some intel as the market trades up 25 points right now on the Dow. See you right here.</p><p>REGAN: And on the market, it took a dip into negative territory. So, we're watching it very carefully. It's been a rather volatile session all over the place here.</p><p>Investors are still trying to come to grips with what's exactly this trade dispute with China will mean.</p><p>In the mean time, we're watching another story here and that's the 2020 census, which is now expected to include a question about citizenship status. The population count take in every 10 years is required by the Constitutions and it is use to determine the number of seats each state has in the House. So, it's important from that perspective as well as how federal funds are distributed.</p><p>Democrats are condemning this move saying it would actually discourage immigrants from responding, which would cause a population undercount and therefore they wouldn't able to have as many representatives, say, from state like California. California's attorney general is suing the <person><nameText>Trump Administration </nameText></person>saying and \"including a citizenship question on the 2020 census is not a bad idea, it is illegal.\"</p><p>Joining me right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano, with his sense of whether it is, in fact, legal or not. Where do you come out?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: It is legal to ask because the federal government has a legitimate interest in knowing that but the government cannot compel the answer from the person asked because we have the right to remain silent.</p><p>REGAN: OK. So then the California A.G. really doesn't have much of a case.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: First of all, it's premature because Congress hasn't decided this yet. This is just a proposal from the Commerce Department, which must file its proposal by the end of this week and they filed it last night.</p><p>Congress is not in session for the next two weeks. They're going to debate this all over again when Congress is back there. But the only thing under the Constitution of the government can compel any answer to is how many human beings lives in this house and how many bathrooms you have? What is your education, what is your nationality, and what is your citizenship? Again, it can ask but it can't punish him for not answering.</p><p>REGAN: OK. So, it seems to me then, it's fair to ask the question and it's obviously an individual decision as to whether or not they want to respond. But assuming that California is right and all the people that are here illegally decline to answer the question, does population count go down and therefore does the number of representatives coming from a state like California go down?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That is a great question. And that would be exquisitely unfair to the rest of the country if California where to get more representatives in the House of Representatives because of more illegal or undocumented persons living in California. That is not the intent of the census and that is not the purpose of the headcount. So the Federal Government is going to have to find some other way to determine who is legitimately, lawfully residing in California without compelling people to answer.</p><p>Now, I think a lot of people will answer anyway. I don't know if they'll answer truthfully or not. I think the Democrats do have an argument to make the people here unlawfully are not going to answer truthfully because they'll think it's going to trigger their deportation although this questionnaires are anonymous.</p><p>REGAN: Right. Different then, let's say, it was back when, you know, during World War II and you were making a point to me off-camera that there were times in history that we have used the census --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: -- to actually find people?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. The Roosevelt Administration in the census of 1940 not only asked if you're a citizen and asked your nationality. And then when FDR and his colleagues decided to incarcerate Japanese-Americans, they had the data to find them.</p><p>Congress was so outraged by this. But in 1947, FDR is dead, the war is over. That it enacted legislation prohibiting asking nationality but did not prohibit asking citizenship.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Well, let's see what happens.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: Thank you, Judge. Good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Good to see you. Welcome back.</p><p>REGAN: Thank you. It's good to be back. Wow, lots of news going on.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: You could say that. Any day, any week, Russia is vowing to retaliate after <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>expels 60 diplomats from the United States. What will that include and will this finally put an end to talk that Trump is too soft on Vladmir Putin?</p><p>Plus, we are following these markets. We can see we've been all over the place now, up 13 points, just straddling really the flat line here. What is driving this? Is it really concerns about a trade war with China? We've got more after this.</p><p>REGAN: This is an interesting story, everyone. Russia vowing to respond harshly to the U.S. expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats. Their foreign ministry even accusing the U.S. of blackmailing other countries to expel Russian diplomat.</p><p>Our Ashley Webster has been all over the story, of course, it starts in the U.K. --</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: It does.</p><p>REGAN: -- with nerve gas in an ex-Russian spy.</p><p>WEBSTER: I mean, on outrageous attack of a nerve agent on British soil, that's a Russian nerve agent. I think what's come out of this is a couple things. I think Vladmir Putin has totally miscalculated what's happened here.</p><p>The Brits, I think there is a theory out there, Trish, that Britain is leaving the E.U., that there's a perception that Theresa May is a weakened leader and that that has propelled the Russians to take these kinds of steps, to test the resolve. If that is the case, terrible mistake because look what happened, 27 countries now have kicked out more than 140 Russian diplomats. The U.N. expelling seven Russian diplomats, we just heard in reaction to this. And I think it is certainly hurt Putin in certain ways.</p><p>There are those in Moscow that when they're going to look him, they're going to say, \"Hmm, that wasn't a very good move.\"</p><p>REAGAN: He wants to be -- right, on the world international stage and basically he's losing that starring role by getting all of his diplomats expelled but one would understand. I mean, why do you want people in your country that are capable of --</p><p>WEBSTER: Spying?</p><p>REGAN: -- doing what these people did in the U.K.?</p><p>WEBSTER: Of course, everybody does it. And the U.K., especially we've had like 12 deaths in the U.K. that have Russian links.</p><p>REGAN: And we also know that more than 100 people were exposed to this nerve gas agent.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, in this small town in the West of England, in Salisbury, which, you know, the health authorities said, \"No, you'll be OK.\" Then they said, \"You may want to stop wiping your cell phones and washing your clothing.\" It was amid to this day, there very, you know, there are quite a few people just say, \"Well, I don't know. What are the health risks of this?\"</p><p>But the bottom line is the other point I wanted to make about Putin and Russia is this is the biggest blow to their spy network on the west, multinational blows since the Cold War. I mean, that has severely hurt their spy network.</p><p>Look at the U.S., 60 diplomats gone, 48. The closing of consulate in Seattle, because it's close to Boeing, it's close to a submarine base there. That hurts. That definitely hurts Russia's spy network. It's not going to kill it but it's going to make it pretty painful.</p><p>REGAN: Now, they're trying to retaliate.</p><p>WEBSTER: They will.</p><p>REGAN: Meaning?</p><p>WEBSTER: Meaning that they'll do it tit-to-tat. The bottom line is Russia is the big loser here.</p><p>REGAN: Yes. I would say and, you know, I wonder how this sits with some members of the Democratic Party that keeps saying this administration is an easy on Russia.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: You're telling me this is the biggest hit to their spy network --</p><p>WEBSTER: Since the Cold War.</p><p>REGAN: -- since the Cold War.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. It is significant and I think Putin totally did not expect the United States to kick out 60 diplomats. That's a high number.</p><p>The U.K. kicked out 23. That was a very aggressive move. It was appropriate, I believe. But it certainly was, I think, a shot to Moscow.</p><p>REGAN: Yes. And more and more countries are following the same way, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, good. Good.</p><p>REGAN: Good. Ashley, thank you so much.</p><p>We got the markets mixed right now although we are trading higher by about 57 points there on the Dow. Stocks swinging around here rather wildly but doesn't this always happen right around 2:00?</p><p>Nicole Petallides has more, down at the New York Stock Exchange for us.</p><p>Hey, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: Hey, Trish. As you said, we've seen the volatility this afternoon, the most afternoons around this time gets pretty wild. Right now, we're up 41 points, off our earlier highs but it's nice to see some arrows up, with up arrow after last week where we saw the big sell-off of more than 1400 points.</p><p>Yesterday, nearly 700 point gain and we're holding on to the green just for the Dow. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 have moved into the red.</p><p>Tech stocks, also financial stocks are coming under some pressure. Well, financials are mixed, I should say, tech, energy, and industrials are under pressure.</p><p>I wanted to get to general electric. The Buffett bounce. There is speculation that Warren Buffett's Berkshire has a way may be getting back into G.E. after jumping out last year.</p><p>Of course, G.E., over the last 12 months down 56 percent. It's been a big dog. And now there is word that they might be back in in amassing a big stake.</p><p>Now, of course, General Electric, no comment. Nobody is commenting. But look at the stock, though, it's up 5.5 percent today. So, we'll see what happens there but it's certainly getting a nice big boost for today. It's the worst performer on the Dow this year.</p><p>And then just take a pick at that winners of Dow Jones Industrial Average today, at this moment and that would be Nike, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Verizon, Pfizer. You see some up arrows here as everybody just takes a breather about those trade war worries at least for the moment.</p><p>Back to you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: I encourage them to take a big breather, a big one because we have to deal with this now, head-on, or we're going to see a real problem 10 years from now that we don't want.</p><p>Anyway, Nicole Petallides, thank you so much.</p><p><person><nameText>Paul Ryan, </nameText></person>everyone, is forced to deny that he is stepping down as House Speaker after a resignation rumor goes rampant. It does open the door to this big question, are both parties in need of new blood, new leadership, as we head into the midterms?</p><p>Our panel debates it for you next.</p><p>REGAN: Ryan's office said the Speaker is not resigning. This, after reports surface last night the Republican leader may be stepping down. One Congressman even suggested that Whip Steve Scalise would be elected to replace.</p><p>All these rumors out there and, well, they're just rumors but they give beg the question. Is it time for a shake-up in leadership for both parties?</p><p>Joining me right now, Fox News Contributor, Jessica Tarlov, and American Majority CEO, Ned Ryun. I think you two are going to be in agreement on this one</p><p>JESSICA TARLOV, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that's will the first time.</p><p>REGAN: Right.</p><p>NED RYUN, AMERICAN MAJORITY CEO: Maybe.</p><p>REGAN: Well, let me start with you, Jessica. The Democratic Party, and I think this is obvious to everyone given all the Marie Antoinette-like comments Nancy Pelosi has been making, do they need a shake-up?</p><p>TARLOV: I think they're going to end up with a shake-up. I am a big fan of Nancy Pelosi. I think she has been long-term wonderful for the party.</p><p>REGAN: You're one and only?</p><p>TARLOV: What? No, no, there are like 10 of us. No, what she did was getting the ACA passed and she's also done a prolific fund-raiser for the party, which we all know is incredibly important. Says a lot about that. But with the leadership challenge the last time around from Tim Ryan and with people like Conor Lamb getting elected all over the country, I think there is going to be shift and a lot of pressure to go younger and more progressive.</p><p>REGAN: Yes. I think that we are seeing that and it's probably the healthy thing for that party. Now, in terms of the Republicans, one of the biggest complaints, I know you have had, Ned, is that Republicans ala <person><nameText>Paul Ryan, </nameText></person>are not fully on board with the <person><nameText>Trump administration's </nameText></person>agenda and they're very reluctant to come around on a lot of things. With that in mind, do they also need a change in leadership?</p><p>RYUN: Well, I will say this, I mean, these rumors of <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>resigning are fake news. I talked with multiple members of Congress and they said fake news.</p><p>One of them asked him point-blank, \"Are you going to resign?\" And he said, \"Absolutely not.\" So, I don't think you're going to see a leadership change anytime soon on the House side.</p><p>But, Trish, I think this whole omnibus bill is a sign that Congress is broken. And if you want to talk about leadership that needs to change, Congress is broken because Mitch McConnell is basically letting the Democrats help run the Senate with him.</p><p>I honestly think some days, Trish, that we have joint majority leaders with Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell and one ruling class swamp party. Because let's face it, a lot of GOP Senators they quite frankly like this broken Congress. They can help out their crony special interests buddies and tuck away the special earmarks in 2200 page bills that nobody reads. And all of a sudden, look what happens, we have 1.3 trillion omnibus bills.</p><p>So, if you were to ask me, is leadership change needed? Yes, absolutely.</p><p>The House actually has been operating like it should be. The Senate is completely broken and I blame Mitch McConnell for it.</p><p>REGAN: You do. Do you think that the Democrats should also make a shift then?</p><p>RYUN: No, please, dear God. Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco.</p><p>TARLOV: That's always what Republican say.</p><p>RYUN: Do not dethrone the queen of San Francisco. She is great for us. She is writing our attack ads. Between she and Hillary with crumbs, deplorable, backwards Trump voters. I mean, this, in all seriousness, though Trish, this is a problem for Democrat in those 10 red states where you have Democrat's Senators running for re-election.</p><p>Hillary and Nancy Pelosi and are writing Republican attack ads for the midterms.</p><p>TARLOV: Yes, I would add to that, and I agree with you when you said Claire McCaskill being incredibly outspoken about Hillary Clinton's comments.</p><p>RYUN: Yes.</p><p>TARLOV: And saying you shouldn't insult anybody but certainly don't be insulting anyone in my state. You know, it's just in a deep red state. And we do have 10 up for re-election.</p><p>I would ask this on the <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>side of things that there are kind of two sides to this coin. Yes, you ask him point-blank what's he is going to do but there have been a lot of surprise resignations.</p><p>Jason Chaffetz, I don't -- Trey Gowdy not going to run for re-election. There are a lot committee heads on the Republican side who are not going to run again. And we are forgetting as well, <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>didn't even want this job.</p><p>REGAN: That's right.</p><p>TARLOV: Remember, when he begrudgingly took in and he was like, well, I want to make sure that I can spend time with me family. So, under these circumstances when he's pushing forward an agenda that the President really doesn't have much interest in it, I can see why he might want to bow out gracefully before.</p><p>REGAN: It's kind of thankless job, right, Ned? I mean, you know, you either, you know, buy into what the President is doing, I think it's been hard for him. I think it's been hard for a lot of Republican there because they're kind of, \"I don't know if I like this. I don't know if I like where it's going.\" And I worry, much as you do, I think, Ned, it's the swamp influence that they have --</p><p>RYUN: It is.</p><p>TARLOV: -- the ear of many corporations and lobbyists that have their own interests at stake. And so, suddenly everybody is saying, \"Whoa, we have a huge trade war coming, thanks to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and his administration.\" And so, they're fighting back against that. When we all know that if we don't start to confront the reality of what China is doing now, it's going to be our kids that are paying the price, Ned.</p><p>RYUN: Absolutely. You know, I think we're already -- China has already declared economic warfare on us. I think people just wake up to that fact. But no, you're right and, Trish, you've kind of alluded to this just now.</p><p>The interests of Corporate America in the American people, the American working class are not always aligns and the problem here that you see in Republican politics and I know even in Democrat politics, a lot of the big donors to these parties are from corporate interests. They are not aligned with American voter. So, there's no alignment between Trump with the outside devolve power from D.C., drain the swamp.</p><p>I mean, again, this omnibus bill had nothing to do with draining the swamp. It was actually feeding the swamp. It was a triumph from the swamp but it goes back to some of the structural problems with in party politics of who's actually footing the bill, who's funding things</p><p>And I tell you want? When it comes down to the down to leadership, there are a lot of people with corporate interests, special interests that are right there in your ear whispering, \"You want to do this, you want next big check, you need to do this.\" And sadly, this is what continues to happen in D.C. year after year.</p><p>TARLOV: Yes, that is interesting, though, that you point that out about Corporate America not being on the same page as the American voter. When you saw the Republican bill with big slashes to the corporate tax rate but not to the individual --</p><p>REGAN: They gave individuals a great, great deal, too. The only individuals that --</p><p>TARLOV: -- a lot of people are not benefiting from that.</p><p>REGAN: -- we are high earner in New York and California.</p><p>RYUN: Jessica, no complaints.</p><p>TARLOV: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: But I would say, we need to do that on the corporate side. And they did give a pretty big one to the -- that's a story for another day.</p><p>TARLOV: Another segment.</p><p>REGAN: Thank you, Jessica.</p><p>TARLOV: Thanks, Trish. Welcome back.</p><p>REGAN: It's good to see you guys. It's good to be back.</p><p>Anyway, we're going to look at this because the court battle underway right now to decide the fate of AT&amp;T and Time Warner is heating up. We're going to have some details for you next.</p><p>REGAN: Department of Justice is attempting to block the potential $85 billion merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner. They're in court today, right now.</p><p>For more, we're going to Connell McShane. Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: Well, hey, Trish. We have quite a face-off in the courtroom earlier today between Warren Schlichting, is a guys and Executive at Sling T.V., which own by Dish network, and an attorney for the company Daniel Petrocelli is representing AT&amp;T and Time Warner.</p><p>Schlichting is a government witness. He testified yesterday here in court that Turner program and all the networks' Turner control, DCO, AT&amp;T, CNN, all the rest, that it's a must for Sling and for Dish Network. But today, there was a challenge to that. That's the real question, coming up on the screen is, are these Turner Networks really must have programming?</p><p>Petrocelli was interesting in the way he did it. He used the quote from Charlie Ergen, the founder, kind of against his own employe saying, that he had said Ergen, \"CNN may and must have programming in 20 years ago but it's not anymore. Schlichting response that, \"I call that negotiating in the press.\" And they kind of have similar conversation, Trish, about sports programming and back and forth and went between the two.</p><p>As we move now into the afternoon session as Schlichting wraps up, we expect to hear from the government's next witness in this trial, which could be a very interesting witness and expected to be a hostile one, the Turner Chairman, John Martin. We'll see if any of his past words particularly in contract negotiations can be used against him.</p><p>That still to come report back later. But for now, back to you.</p><p>REGAN: All right, interesting stuff. Connell, Thank you so much.</p><p>I have to say, it's pretty good to be back. It's great to be back in FBN. I had a wonderful week off, a vacation with my family. We went all the way to Hawaii, believe or not and I wanted to show this because this is my daughter, Alexandra, and she begged us for surfing lessons.</p><p>She's only eight years old. You may have seen her on the show. She talked about her Brownie, Girl Scout cookie sales recently. Well, she was on that surfboard. Oh my goodness.</p><p>She got up on this thing and we thought ourselves, \"Are we really good parents.\" She is quite a kid.</p><p>The other two were not as enthused about the surfing thing, I totally get it, Elizabeth and Jamie. I don't think you could get me on one of those things either, I'll be honest. People asked me if I took that video. I'm like, \"Are you kidding me? Me on a surfboard?</p><p>That will be the day. Liz Claman, over to you. Down, gosh, 109.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NEWS ANCHOR: I know, exactly.

It is Friday, the 30th of March.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, the ugly truth about Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg disavows a leaked company memo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Russia's retaliation against the West goes global as more diplomats are expelled.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And on the final show of an extraordinary quarter, Richard delivers his first quarterly report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Stephanie Sy. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SY: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been forced to disavow an internal memo that called for growth at any cost. The leaked memo argued growth was the priority, even if users were harmed.</p><p>The note, written by Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth in 2016 reads, \"Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people, more often is de facto good.\"</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement that most people at Facebook disagree with this memo's message and that last year the company changed its mission and focus.</p><p>Dylan Byers joins us now in Los Angeles.</p><p>Dylan, let's just take a step back.</p><p>Who leaked this memo?</p><p>DYLAN BYERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a really good question, and you'll say the amount of leaks, the fact that every time Facebook comes forward to try to put out one fire, another fire pops up just a few days, sometimes just a few hours later, suggested to folks who are happy to see Facebook go through the PR crisis that it's going through right now.</p><p>The memo was written by Andrew Bosworth, who is really one of the core executives at Facebook. This is not a rogue actor. This is somebody who was very much part of the central discussions and conversations about Facebook strategy happening well before 2016 and certainly in 2016 when he wrote the memo.</p><p>The conversations I've had with my Facebook sources suggest that what he was trying to do was rally the troops and say, look, we are pursuing growth. We believe that connecting the world, bringing more people onto the platform is fundamentally a good thing.</p><p>There will be good news along the way and good things will happen along the way and there will be bad things that happen along the way and we'll have to accept that as part of the growth strategy.</p><p>Obviously in the context of everything that's happened with Facebook, all of the scandals with Cambridge Analytica and Russian meddling in the election, general fear about how Facebook handles user data, this looks callous. It looks insensitive and it sort of confirms or at least seems to confirm so many people's worst suspicions about Silicon Valley and certainly about Facebook.</p><p>SY: All right, Dylan Byers, thank you so much.</p><p>I want to bring in Rana Foroohar in a minute.</p><p>But it's been a week to forget for some of tech's biggest companies, the quarter may be over but their problems are not. Over the last five days, Facebook's stock fell over 3 percent. Tesla fell nearly 15 percent.</p><p>The company announced a recall after the market closed. And Amazon, down 6 percent as the company faces President Trump's wrath and new competition in the health care sector.</p><p>Its rival, Walmart, is reportedly in the early stages of talks to buy the health insurance, Humana.</p><p>So bringing in our global analyst, Rana Foroohar, joins us now.</p><p>Rana, I want to get back to the Facebook story for a moment because, according to BuzzFeed, this memo leaked a day after a shooting death in Chicago was captured on Facebook Live.</p><p>And I think the question it brings up for a lot of folks is, what control does Facebook actually have over the content on its platform?</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, I think they have more than they would like to admit. I think that there hasn't always been the use of all the tools in the arsenal to police the content. Internet companies in the mid-1990s actually got sort of an exemption from liability that typical media companies, traditional media companies have, where if something libelous, if something nefarious happens and you're a traditional cable company or a print paper, you're on the hook --</p><p>[16:05:00]</p><p>FOROOHAR: -- for that. But internet companies really haven't been and I think that's led to a tremendous amount of carelessness. But they do have algorithms they can use to police what happens -- pornography, for example. You often see that being taken down very quickly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SY: -- do they want to police it?</p><p>Because --</p><p>FOROOHAR: -- I think this memo gets to is that question.</p><p>SY: Zuckerberg in his statement said this is one provocative leader at Facebook.</p><p>But do you think it speaks to the culture?</p><p>FOROOHAR: I have no doubt, Stephanie, it's the culture. As a matter of fact, I think that there's a very particular culture in Silicon Valley, which is coming to the fore now. It's sort of a libertarian, everything deserves to be disrupted, move fast and break things. Everyone is in the way, government, consumers, other companies and that is an attitude that will change.</p><p>This moment reminds me a lot of 2008 and how Wall Street looked right after where you had a lot of guys, mostly guys, who seemed pretty out of touch with what the rest of the world was doing and thinking of them.</p><p>SY: And maybe haven't caught up to what was happening in the financial world, same questions being asked about the digital world.</p><p>Let's take the broader look at what's going on with the tech companies and we saw a lot of stock prices slide.</p><p>But what is really going to come out of this techlash at the end of the day besides a slide in the stock prices?</p><p>FOROOHAR: It's such a good question. The markets are clearly reacting to the idea that they think big tech is going to be regulated. I think it probably will be but not necessarily in the U.S.</p><p>I think you may see regulation coming first in Europe. Europe is actually rolling out some very important privacy shifts that are really going to give people a lot more control over how their data is used. That's happening in May.</p><p>I'm a little worried, frankly, that again, there are parallels to the 2008 efforts to try and rein in financial firms. There's a lot of lobbying power from big tech in Washington. Google is the number one corporate lobbyist, I believe.</p><p>The industry as a whole is a major influencer and I think it's going to be really hard for politicians to come together around the right types of regulation even though they need to.</p><p>SY: And not only that but would there be a patchwork of regulations versus a comprehensive way to deal not only with issues of policing content but also with data usage?</p><p>FOROOHAR: And that's the bigger question because we see the scandal at Facebook. We hear about the fangs but our data is being used by any number of companies in any number of industries.</p><p>Artificial intelligence, which is what a lot of companies are counting on for the next generation growth is basically data plus computing power. This is the tip of the iceberg. I think we'll be hearing about these scandals for a long time.</p><p>SY: All right, I want you to stand with me for this next piece because, as Facebook tries to move on from Cambridge Analytica, Kenyans are learning that the firm appears to have been heavily involved in the election of president Uhuru Kenyatta.</p><p>From there, Farai Sevenzo reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FARAI SEVENZO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nairobi, thousands of miles away from the offices of Cambridge Analytica. When the political consultancy firm revealed to an undercover news team that Kenya's current president was a client, their managing director claimed, \"The Kenyatta campaign which we ran in 2013 and 2017 for Kenyatta, we have rebranded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, and messaging. I think we wrote all of the speeches and we staged the whole thing. So just about every element of this candidate.\"</p><p>These are polarized elections, full of animosity and questions are being raised now over how big Cambridge Analytica's reach was.</p><p>Kenyans are painfully aware of the dangers of negative campaigning given the history of violent elections in this country and, of course, they want to know what it is Cambridge Analytica did for their government and what impact that it had on Kenyan democracy.</p><p>Have you heard of Cambridge Analytica?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, I have.</p><p>Those are the guys who manipulated -- in a way, manipulated the elections.</p><p>SEVENZO: Do you think they gave Mr. Kenyatta unfair advantage?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't know if there is substance to that story. But if there is, then it's unfortunate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It (INAUDIBLE) into question the whole electoral infrastructure in relation to the elections which were held last year must be fully audited. I think we'll see the footprints of Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>SEVENZO: (voice-over) Images of Kenya's president appear on Cambridge Analytica's website as well as on that of parent company SCL, where these images have since been removed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let's not absolve Kenyan politicians of their role in this because Cambridge Analytica didn't pay themselves. They paid a foreign company to come to Kenya.</p><p>SEVENZO (voice-over): This video appeared on social media. It made astounding claims about the opposition leader.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Whenever you try to --</p><p>[16:10:00]</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- go to Kenya, you can -- your first greeting was (INAUDIBLE) and all that trash about me.</p><p>SEVENZO: And do you think it contributed to ethnic tensions in this country?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Certainly and there's dozen of loss of lives. I think very many innocent people lost their lives as a result of that negative epic campaign (INAUDIBLE) by Cambridge Analytica. Somebody need to take responsibility for this.</p><p>SEVENZO (voice-over): We arrived at President Kenyatta's party headquarters to try to find some answers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We hired them to do analysis, a focus group discussion, focus group discussion results because they did have that expertise. They did demonstrate to us that they had that expertise.</p><p>SEVENZO: And that was it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And that was it.</p><p>SEVENZO: No sort of strategy to be completely negative about the opposition?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No. No.</p><p>SEVENZO: And you don't know where all of these videos that were around in 2017 came from?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We had no idea. We saw them, some of them were sent out to us.</p><p>SEVENZO: Now it's possible that, in this investigation, there will be a massive paper trail that leads right here to (INAUDIBLE) headquarters.</p><p>What do you say to people who are worried about things like that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It doesn't bother me because, in our engagement with SCL, which you say is related to Cambridge Analytica, in our engagement, at no time did we ask them to do any kind of data mining.</p><p>SEVENZO: Why don't you want to find out who they are and who their parent company is?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, no, it's not necessary, not by a business who find out who else are your business associates, is it?</p><p>SEVENZO: But if this business associate have such a terrible reputation and (INAUDIBLE) in terms of negative campaigning, would you hire them again in 2022?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I would not and there would not so much of the reputation. I would not because I don't have time to be dealing with all these side issues. I have to deal with my core business. And my core business is to run a campaign and win an election.</p><p>SEVENZO (voice-over): The fallout over Cambridge Analytica's tactics is far from over for this East African nation and time will tell whether Kenyans get the answers they're looking for -- Farai Sevenzo, CNN, Nairobi.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SY: Cambridge Analytica has denied any acquisitions of wrongdoing and the company did suspend its chief executive after Channel 4's undercover report aired.</p><p>I want to bring in Rana Foroohar again on this story.</p><p>And Rana, of course because of the violent history of Kenyan elections in the past, the stakes seem higher, although it occurs to me that Cambridge Analytica being hired by one of the politicians to message is not illegal.</p><p>FOROOHAR: It's absolutely not illegal and this brings up the fact that there are free speech issues involved in all of this. And this is going to become a bigger issue both in the U.S. and abroad. There is actually an interesting case going on right now in California looking at free speech, data scraping, how much of this should be illegal -- sorry, legal under the First Amendment.</p><p>So watch this space. But as of now, you're absolutely right. Just hiring Cambridge Analytica to do a research project, to do (INAUDIBLE) is not illegal.</p><p>SY: And just because they were foreign, that seemed to really bother the Kenyans that were interviewed in that piece. But it does raise some important questions about whether, if they had used data, for example, from Facebook, which they deny, for example, for targeted political messaging.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>SY: It raises questions about the impact of big data on democracies.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, it absolutely does and it's interesting that you say that because there are some studies out that show that rising social media usage actually coincides with declining trust in liberal democracy.</p><p>And if you just look, there was an interesting study from MIT showing that fake news on Twitter had a 70 percent more likely chance of being spread than real news. So you think about the kind of informational bubbles that people are living in, this is a huge, huge threat.</p><p>SY: It occurs to me that informational warfare to a certain degree has always been part of politics.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Yes.</p><p>SY: Whether we have the online accelerant that we have now is the question.</p><p>FOROOHAR: That's a good point.</p><p>SY: And it doesn't seem clear what the rules are.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Well, here's what I think. I think the rules should be the same for media companies across the board. This is also something that's being contested in the U.S. There is a bipartisan bill actually called the Honest Ads Act. It was put out by McCain and Warner, saying Facebook, Google, you should have to disclose political advertising just like CNN would, just like the \"Financial Times\" would.</p><p>That seems fair to me. I think let's get rid of the special treatment, the subsidies for these industries, particularly given how it puts these problems on kerosene, as you say.</p><p>SY: Yes, transparency and oversight, those are the words of the day when it comes to these companies and their impact on our societies. Rana Foroohar, thanks as always for your insight.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Thanks for having me.</p><p>SY: Well, what --</p><p>[16:15:00]</p><p>SY: -- started in the quiet English market town of Salisbury has now become a major international incident. Russia's retaliation against the West continues as dozens of diplomats are expelled.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SY: Russian relations with the West are plumbing new depths as Russia expels diplomats from nearly 2 dozen countries with more to potentially follow. Foreign ambassadors were summoned by the Russian government, where they were given notes of protest.</p><p>The Kremlin denies accusations by Western governments that it was behind the poisoning of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in England. All in all, Russia has expelled diplomats from at least 19 countries. Britain's ambassador to Moscow said Russia's actions would not make him back down.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURIE BRISTOW, BRITAIN'S AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA: (INAUDIBLE) it's important to bear in mind why this crisis has arisen in the first place. It's the use of a chemical weapon on the streets of the United Kingdom that has threatened the lives of a number of people in my country.</p><p>We asked certain questions of the Russian state and we've still not received adequate answers to those questions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: The White House has yet to respond to these new expulsions.</p><p>While President Trump has kept a relatively low profile this week, we've seen two significant shifts in terms of his foreign policy. The first is Russia, where Monday's expulsion of Russian diplomats sparked today's countermeasures.</p><p>The second is South Korea, where the Trump administration revamped its first major trade deal. Donald Trump has since said that he could delay that deal to use as leverage in talks with North Korea.</p><p>Speaking on this program earlier this week, the president's top trade adviser went as far as to say this week had been historic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL: A lot of news went on today but 10-20 years from now in the history books, this day will be marked as historic because this was one of the first times an American president has ever successfully renegotiated a horrible trade deal.</p><p>And the president did that and what it does is it symbolizes how trade peace can come about and bring about fair and reciprocal trade. This was the poster child for trade peace through good negotiations with our allies and partners.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: CNN's senior political analyst David Gergen joins me now. He's advised Presidents Reagan, Nixon and Clinton.</p><p>David, thank you so much for your time.</p><p>DAVID GERGEN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST: Thank you for having me.</p><p>SY: What do you think people will most remember about this week in the Trump administration?</p><p>Will it be the accusations of extramarital affairs?</p><p>Will it be the major staff shakeups we have seen?</p><p>Or will it be these significant moves we've seen on the foreign policy front?</p><p>GERGEN: Well, the moves in foreign policy, I think, will have more impact on history. But they're less noticed here in the United States. There are not a lot of people talking about the staff renegotiating the Korean trade --</p><p>[16:20:00]</p><p>GERGEN: -- deal. If anything on the national security side, this country is concerned about the shifts in personnel, the new secretary of state and the new national security adviser both very hard line.</p><p>And there is a good chance, a rising chance now that Trump will not renew the Iranian agreement in mid-May, saying that he won't accept it. That may fall apart and that will have large implications for our negotiations with the North Koreans.</p><p>It may make it much more difficult to reach an agreement with the North Koreans. So there are important things that are underlying all of this.</p><p>But the truth is there are more probably people in this country talking about a woman named Stormy Daniels. She was on \"60 Minutes,\" the program this past weekend and they got the biggest audience they've had in 10 years.</p><p>So there are a lot of people gossiping. That's easier to grasp than trade and nuclear armaments. But it actually does have some bearing on the president's capacity for governance.</p><p>These cases that women have tried to file against the president could be -- he could be vulnerable -- to me, there's some embarrassment or worse. We'll have to wait and see. Right now it's not changing our politics but it is providing a lot of fodder for gossip.</p><p>SY: It will be interesting to see if it weakens the president in any way in the future. You talk about hard line and his new foreign policy team to include Bolton, one of the biggest hawks out there.</p><p>One might point to the expulsions of Russian diplomat as well as the closures of consulates, including in Seattle, as proof that Trump is now taking a harder line when it comes to Putin and Russia.</p><p>Do you see a policy shift here that's meaningful?</p><p>GERGEN: I don't think we quite know yet. The president himself has kept a very low profile on this whole issue of expelling diplomats. His team, his White House team and the State Department taking much more of the lead.</p><p>Let's give it -- let's have another couple of episodes of one thing or another and we'll have a better judgment on that. The cynics argued that the president took a harder line on this and jumped in by expelling a lot of diplomats because it showed that he was not in Putin's pocket with regard to the Mueller investigation. It wasn't really about a harder line he had about the Russians (INAUDIBLE) that were barely on the job.</p><p>But I think it's a little hard to interpret. What we do know is that the U.S. and Russians and Europeans have thrown out each others' diplomats in the past but there seems to be a harder edge this time and there is much more of a sense that Putin has become very tough since he now has become essentially the Russian leader for life.</p><p>He's been very sharp edged and in return the U.S. and the Europeans are getting a sharper edge. And there's a growing that this could become in fact a major blowup among the countries. It could lead it a crisis. We are not there yet. But right now we're on the front edges of something and we don't know where it's going to go.</p><p>SY: David Gergen, thank you so much for your analysis, appreciate it, and have a good holiday weekend.</p><p>GERGEN: Thank you. Take care. 'Bye.</p><p>SY: The Kremlin says plans to take the Russian news channel RT off air in some U.S. regions may be discrimination. Starting this weekend, RT will no longer be available in the Washington, D.C., area after its distribution deal expired. The distributors say the timing is just coincidence. CNN's Hadas Gold is in Washington with more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Stephanie, RT, that Russian government funded network that airs in the United States will no longer be available in the Washington area starting this Sunday. It will still be available on satellite and streaming on its website.</p><p>But if you're looking for it on cable or broadcast, you won't see it in the Washington area. The distributor for RT in the United States says it just has to do with licensing agreements and that they lost access to the license that they were leasing out and they couldn't afford to buy it back.</p><p>But RT is blaming the Justice Department. Back in the fall, the Justice Department forced the American production company that produces RT here in the United States to register as a foreign agent.</p><p>What this means is they have to give certain disclosures to the Justice Department and include a disclosure to their audience that they are registered as a foreign agent. RT s deputy editor in chief Annabel Kena (ph) told me in a statement that while they're not at liberty to disclosure the details, we know that the reason for this was linked to RT's forced registration as a foreign agent in the U.S.</p><p>She went on to tell me that this has put pressure on RT's partners and as a result it's lost access to Washington. This is clearly an ongoing situation between RT, the Justice Department and how they reach their audience --</p><p>[16:25:00]</p><p>GOLD: -- out here and we've actually even seen some pushback in Russia against American reporters there and there's now fear in Moscow for foreign reporters there, that they are going start feeling even more backlash, potentially even being banned from reporting there --Stephanie.</p><p>SY: Hadas Gold, thank you for that report.</p><p>And as the business gears up for a fresh quarter, we'll recap memorable moments of the one that just ended in \"Quest's Quarterly Report\" when we return.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SY: Hello. I'm Stephanie Sy. Coming up on the next half hour of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, on our last program of Q1, Richard Quest presents his quarterly report and a look ahead to the next three months in global economics. First, these are the top news headlines on CNN this hour.</p><p>(HEADLINES)</p><p>AMARA WALKER, CNN: Those are the headlines for this hour now, QUEST QUARTERLY REPORT.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: It is the last day of the first quarter. What a quarter it's been. Extreme volatility of the markets, swelling fears of a trade war and this major reckoning for Facebook, and of course we covered it all on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The U.S. markets are heading for all-time highs and the very first trading session of 2018.</p><p>QUEST: Records are falling faster and faster.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Clearly, the momentum is absolutely on the up side.</p><p>QUEST: Some are really worrying when wondering whether this rally is out of control.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>The Dow suffers its worst single day point fall.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't think I've ever seen anything so bold in my life.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's like a perfect storm, the stock market's natural fear of uncertainty all conspires here.</p><p>QUEST: The U.S. may be on the verge of imposing hefty tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a quite a blunt tool because it hits a lot of other countries.</p><p>GARY COHN, FORMER CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISER TO DONALD TRUMP: We really believe in free, fair, open and reciprocal trade.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's about time, right?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's right, sir --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, no, sir --</p><p>TRUMP: We've been waiting for a long --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes sir --</p><p>TRUMP: Time --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes sir.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not going to call it a trade war, but wars usually start with one battle.</p><p>QUEST: In the war room as you'll recall, I've shown you exactly what has been happening. Each side is already showing up its arsenal of trade weapons.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will take the necessary strong measures to protect our own interests.</p><p>TRUMP: This is number one, but this is the first of many.</p><p>QUEST: Mark Zuckerberg says his new year's resolution is to focus on tackling Facebook's problems, stopping hate speech and warding off foreign meddling.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Facebook is a turning point. The question is how many resources can they invest to solve these problems.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A whistleblower says a (INAUDIBLE) firm linked to the Trump campaign tried to brainwash the American electorate.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The company that I remember was really aggressive without protecting user data. Yes, I do think the company should have acted earlier.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FACEBOOK: I am really sorry that this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data, and if we can't do that, then we don't deserve at the opportunity to serve people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Exhausting and it's only Q1, three topics on the board for the first quarter: markets, tariffs and Facebook, and three Syrian reporters who have been living those stories for the whole quarter.</p><p>Paul is our man in the markets.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT, CNNMONEY: Thank you, sir --</p><p>QUEST: (INAUDIBLE) has been watching all matters on tit-for-tat tariffs, and in Atlanta, joining us from the Cnn Center Lori Siegel who magnificently secured that exclusive interview with Mark Zuckerberg, we'll be with you Lori, in just a moment.</p><p>February with volatility defined the quarter. When we came out of that volatility, we sort of knew it wasn't over, but we didn't quite expect it to ramp up again like it has.</p><p>LA MONICA: I think clearly Richard, the issue that the market is grappling with right now is that there was way too much complacency in 2017.</p><p>A lot of people laughed off on Wall Street, all of the crazy soap opera-ish sort of things coming out of Washington and the Trump administration and the environment.</p><p>[16:35:00] Everyone really thought well, companies are going to continue spending, consumers are going to continue spending, none of this is going to really matter, but I think that change once all of a sudden you have this fear of a trade war, you had tariffs coming in to play.</p><p>You always had questions about whether or not the Trump administration was going to be fuelling the economy with too much stimulus at a time when they didn't need it and could cause the economy to overheat.</p><p>QUEST: So that question of a trade war - I mean, Peter Navarro said on this program earlier in the week, look, everybody knew what the policies were, everybody knew what we were going to do.</p><p>Why are you surprised that we went out and did it?</p><p>PATRICK GILLESPIE, CNNMONEY ECONOMICS REPORTER: He has a fair point, Richard, the markets knew -- should have known for a long time that this was in fact coming, I think it was the delivery and the communication of Trump's trade policy that threw markets off.</p><p>You might remember earlier in the quarter, President Trump haphazardly mentioned the 10 percent tariff on aluminium, the 25 percent tariff on steel. He ended the meeting and then a reporter asked him a question and he shouted out the numbers.</p><p>No announcement on policy or paper from the White House on that particular day. So there was a lot of confusion at the time in markets and you know, and even here in the press, we were trying to figure out what exactly was going to happen.</p><p>And there's still some confusion about how the countries will be exempted and what measures they're going to have to take.</p><p>QUEST: Well, with that -- with that in mind, Paul, if we look at the way the market had risen so sharply in 17, this idea that almost it couldn't go down. But at the same time, it seems to want to go higher.</p><p>We saw this after February again. You know, you had the volatility, but it makes another -- now, that's just definable in the back of corporate profits which we'll get the Q1 numbers.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think many people on Wall Street are extremely optimistic about what earnings are going to look like --</p><p>QUEST: Justifiably --</p><p>LA MONICA: First quarter -- justifiably and probably for all of 2018. The question becomes whether or not some of these trade policies impact 2019 results. You have some people wondering whether or not we might have a recession sooner rather than later.</p><p>I mean, we --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>LA MONICA: Are due for a slow-down inevitably. Will it be during this Trump administration or after 2020 during a second Trump administration perhaps, or someone else's.</p><p>QUEST: Trade in Q2, go on.</p><p>GILLESPIE: Well, it could be good news or it could be bigger fears. We could get escalation between China and the United States. On the other hand, we could get a trade agreement and principle on NAFTA between Canada, Mexico and the United States.</p><p>This has been an ongoing concern for markets, so there could be a mix of good and bad news. It will be interesting to see if the countries that received exemptions on the steel tariffs, Richard, are facing a quota or if they get off scot-free.</p><p>Peter Navarro told us earlier this week they're not getting off scot-free.</p><p>QUEST: And it will be in that second quarter. January, February, March, April, May, June -- thank you sir, we've got a busy quarter ahead, good to see you.</p><p>GILLESPIE: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Lori Siegel is in Atlanta. Lori, Facebook, and the reality is regulation is coming. The only issue I need to understand is for more you understand about Facebook and what we saw in Q1, why didn't they see this coming?</p><p>Why -- did they -- was it arrogance? Was it hubris? Was it incompetence?</p><p>LORI SIEGEL, CNN: What a fascinating question. I think there's always been this sort of arrogance and the idealism about Silicon Valley. And this is a watershed moment. This is a moment that tech fenders are coming out and saying wait, how did this happen, why didn't we see it sooner?</p><p>And I think this is the problem with Facebook. You see the bloc post after the fact. After Russia interference, you saw Mark Zuckerberg come out and say fake news didn't do anything for the election.</p><p>And then months later, he wrote a manifesto saying I'm going to get this right. You know, the idea when I sat across from him at one of the most crucial moments in the company's history, where you could see him sweating, you could see --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>SIEGEL: How nervous he was for this moment. You know, I said to him, how do you guys become more proactive and not reactive because you can make mistakes when you're a small start-up, but when you're a large kingdom with 2 billion users --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>SIEGEL: Those mistakes can impact democracy, can impact mental health, and can put you on Capitol Hill having to answer these really difficult questions that lawmakers are now going to be asking him, and also trying to regain user trust.</p><p>QUEST: Right, so question to all three, start with you, Lori, Q2, what are you preparing for?</p><p>SIEGEL: Oh, I think the backlash has began, I think this is going to be damage-control. I think they're going to be investing quite a bit in security as we had here in America at least toward the mid-term elections - -</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>SIEGEL: I think they're going to be investing in quite a bit of that, and then I think are they going to make a prediction?</p><p>QUEST: No --</p><p>SIEGEL: They're going to start putting Zuckerberg -- I will raise my hand now, they can put him on with me, but they're going to start putting him out there more. He has been, Richard, in his own filter bubble.</p><p>You know, and they haven't put him out enough. This is a time when his company needs --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>[16:40:00] SIEGEL: Accountability and transparency. I think we're going to be hearing more and more frequently from him and not just in bloc posts and he can't Facebook live.</p><p>QUEST: Lori, you have given us a new -- right on our very first quarter, you have given us a new catchphrase. Gentlemen, put your hands up, what are you going to see in Q2?</p><p>GILLESPIE: Potential escalation --</p><p>QUEST: Hands up! What is it?</p><p>GILLESPIE: Potential escalation on trade wars between -- trade conflict between China and the United States and Richard, let's face it, we are in a red hot U.S. market right now, this is the engine of the U.S. economy and to some extent the global economy.</p><p>QUEST: Hands up!</p><p>LA MONICA: Along those lines, if the U.S. economy continues to hold up reasonably well, will Jerome Powell, the new head of the Fed have to be loose more aggressively with regards to interest rates hikes, and how will President Trump who is technically his boss because he appointed him --</p><p>QUEST: Can't fire him though --</p><p>LA MONICA: Be able to do that. He can't fire him, but do we have to announce the situation to Greenspan potentially as some would argue destroying chances per George H.W. Bush get reelected in 1992, because the economy eventually slowed because of rapid rate hikes.</p><p>We're not there yet, but I think it's something this Fed is watching.</p><p>QUEST: The team will be covering and watching. Trade is a global business, it requires global coverage, I'll take you to Davos, where world leaders challenged President Trump's agenda.</p><p>And to UPS Worldport where packages go before they arrive at your door.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: The lights are on, it didn't sparkle, I'm pretty certain, the -- I knew you said (INAUDIBLE), I knew when the Eiffel Tower will sparkle at the top of the hour.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: That's something else to remember where I am sometimes. Ranging the year in Times Square, and since then, as the map shows, we've been in Davos, Paris, London, we went to Dubai, we've been in Kentucky, Brussels, Atlanta and down in Perth, western Australia.</p><p>Sometimes I find myself out of place and that was the problem facing President Trump when he traveled to the annual meeting of the global leaders at Davos. If he was nervous about going, the leaders in Davos were nervous about what he would say when he got there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President!</p><p>TRUMP: Very exciting.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is just a voice of a Russia probe. We have to look not just at the person, we have to look at the reasons behind.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We want to level the playing field to put our workers at a competitive equal level to workers around the world.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's been deregulation which has been helpful in some respect. The effect of the tax cut is coming now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think it's now when we go down to the details and how we deal with the unfairness, that's where we need to do the hard work.</p><p>TRUMP: Thank you very much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have to look at both the rhetoric and the actions. The message is firm, others are measuring up how to handle that.</p><p>[16:45:00] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need the United States and its leadership to solve big international issues. Be it in the economy, be it state-to- state, be it not electorally.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do a survey every year, 1,300 CEOs, geopolitical risks rose to the top of that survey as well.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Geopolitics and macro economics, feel very disconnected. You see a huge optimism about the economy and huge nervousness about the world of politics.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: So the leaders come together to tackle the world's biggest problems and talk of their own countries. It's a particularly tall order for Zimbabwe's new President Emmerson Mnangagwa is telling businesses his countrymen.</p><p>Now the corruption of the past Mugabe era is gone. However, what he won't change, laws dealing with same-sex rights. The president told me it's up to the voters to decide.</p><p>I put it to him that his country is being left behind.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMERSON MNANGAGWA, PRESIDENT OF ZIMBABWE: My priorities today, I will draw my economy right? Increase the standard of life of my people, putting that as a priority.</p><p>Our priority now -- my government is to embrace the international community and then say Zimbabwe is opened for business, let people who want to invest in Zimbabwe say this is what they want, these are the constituents they see, and this is what I believe is necessary for us to catch up with some of the developing countries in our world --</p><p>QUEST: One moment --</p><p>MNANGAGWA: In our region.</p><p>QUEST: One moment, I venture to disagree with you, Mr. President --</p><p>MNANGAGWA: That's democratic --</p><p>QUEST: Surely, by changing -- whether it's on women's rights, gay rights, whatever rights, it is human rights. Surely, by changing those, you really send the true message that you're not just interested in money coming in for dollars for business.</p><p>But creating an equal environment for all. Surely, that's a much more powerful message than just asking for a bit of extra foreign direct investment.</p><p>MNANGAGWA: It's not your personal dollars in Zimbabwe, it's a personal development. We must be functional, there are systems in my country -- we must have functional infrastructure in terms of our highways and so on.</p><p>We must have a functional manufacturing sector in the country. I must modernize and mechanize my agriculture in Zimbabwe. I must have a developed mining sector in Zimbabwe.</p><p>These are the things as far as I am concerned are the issues which my people look out for governments to address and facilitate for their development so that we catch up with members of the region.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: As we were on the road in the quarter, from Davos to Kentucky, UPS Worldport is the heart of a network that handles 20 million packages every day. And I learned what it takes to be the man in route(ph).</p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Now every quarter, we travel the world to show you the economy at work.

How much care?</p><p>JEFF GOODMAN, UPS DELIVERY MAN: I see these people every day, I don't want to get a report saying that something of theirs was damaged, so I handle it as if it was mine.</p><p>QUEST: You ever wonder what's in all these things?</p><p>GOODMAN: It's a duct tape(ph) --</p><p>QUEST: What?</p><p>GOODMAN: It's a duct tape(ph).</p><p>QUEST: How do you know that?</p><p>GOODMAN: Because of the way it sounds.</p><p>QUEST: That's the real beauty of being local deliverer. You know the area, you know the people you're delivering to and you know the dog.</p><p>GOODMAN: I probably know the dog better than the people.</p><p>QUEST: You want a house -- at the end of the month -- the last bit is you --</p><p>GOODMAN: Walking --</p><p>QUEST: Going in there --</p><p>GOODMAN: Walking into the door --</p><p>QUEST: And walking into the door.</p><p>GOODMAN: Walking into the door.</p><p>QUEST: Right, roger now.</p><p>(voice-over): Rule number two, you need to walk and there were a lot of walking.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>Number three, beware of the dog. You and (INAUDIBLE) when it comes to the dogs.</p><p>GOODMAN: Those have been my best friends or like they can be your worst enemy. So you've always got --</p><p>QUEST: Emergency resources. There's a lot of planning involved, isn't it?</p><p>GOODMAN: The more you plan, they need to be laid(ph).</p><p>QUEST: Something tells me I am not going to make a very good UPS delivery boy.</p><p>Finally, I earned my stripes, well done, my socks. I heard you were admiring our socks.</p><p>GOODMAN: Because not anybody can just get these done.</p><p>QUEST (on camera): Look at this.</p><p>GOODMAN: So you are officially a UPS driver --</p><p>QUEST: Yes, I know you're a UPS driver, UPS socks. For a moment at least, I was officially a man in brown.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Time to get out of the truck and back to my own comfort zone. The stock exchange, you always just gavel three times for a couple more, it's the sound that brings trading to a close every day.</p><p>[16:55:00] However, as you'll have watched on many occasions, not all gavels are banged equally, and it takes a range of skills.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: It's a quite miserable sort of day. Hello, a bit like that gavel which is a bit of a pathetic one. And yes, they're trying to break the gavel but they can't.</p><p>It was a strong, firm, robust gavel. The market has fallen very sharply. Please sir, put us out of our misery. Hello, yes, something tells me that gavel is entirely appropriate.</p><p>Yes, that's a good one, that's a robust one. And a second one, but you don't often play it to the crowd quite like this. There you go.</p><p>Yes sir! One! You're going to go one time, boy. That was rather weakened - - would be. Four, five, six, seven -- I think that called over egging the pudding. Three hefty gavels and a hi-five, that's why the early bit of cheering you're going to get today.</p><p>Come along sir, one, two, three, yes, there we are, that's how we close the market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: And that is the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS quarterly report for Q1. I am Richard Quest in New York, somehow I don't think the gavel is going to beat the bell. Because whatever you're up to in the quarter ahead, I hope it's profitable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018033001cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S0V-11M1-JB20-G3TB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7255\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 30, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

We now  send it over to somebody who's always great to see in person every day,  Dagen McDowell, good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right on Cheryl Casone,  giving me running advice every morning as I hobble in like a broken down  old lady.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning everybody, great to see you.  We'll see Cheryl and Tracy later  this morning.  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.   It's Monday, June 4th.  Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Markets extending gains, we have a triple digit gain on the Dow Futures  this morning.  So we're looking at a rally to start this week.  This after  stocks did just that on Friday following the better than expected jobs  report, 219-point gain on the Blue Chips on Friday.  </p><p>And global markets following those gains this Monday in Europe, we have  green across the board, the biggest winner being the FT-100 in England up  seven-tenths of one percent.  And in Asia overnight take a look at the  picture across the four major markets there, it was buying galore.  The  Hang Seng and Hong Kong gaining 1.6 percent.</p><p>Facebook under fire, a new report from the New York Times says that the  social media giant gave users data to device makers including Apple and  Samsung, this raising new privacy concerns surrounding the company.  And it  comes as the tech industry faces scrutiny over censorship.  House  Intelligence Committee Chairman had a big warning for big tech on Sunday  Morning Futures with Maria yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  I would  hope that they, you know, just don't get involved in politics and don't  censor conservatives and republicans.  But if they continue to do it, then  we have to move obviously to hearings on these issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We take a closer look straight ahead.  Trade turmoil, Commerce  Secretary Wilber Ross returning from China with no deal, it comes as our  allies ramp up their threats and criticism, threats of retaliation over  steel and aluminum tariffs.  </p><p>The rising cost of oil set to hit flyers, American Airlines warning that  it's going to raise airfares.  We take a look at whether this is the  beginning of a broader trend.  </p><p>Former President Bill Clinton offering his take on the impeachment debate,  he says proceedings would be in full swing if democrat was in the White  House.  </p><p>A surprise celebrity appearance at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School's  graduation, Jimmy Fallon giving a heartfelt, emotional commencement speech  honoring the victims of that shooting in Parkland, Florida.  </p><p>Plus, SpaceX launching a satellite overnight but it's not all success, the  company announces a delay to its space tourism plans.</p><p>All of that and so much more coming up this morning, Fox News Contributor,  Kat Timpf is here, I thank her first thing for getting up so early for us.   Benchmark Manager Partner, Kevin Kelly.  And Maslansky &amp; Partners  President, Lee Carter.  Welcome one and all, I can't hear what --</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- you two have to say about this Facebook story.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yes.  Oh my God.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So that's our -- that's our first topic this morning.  We're  going to -- I want to tease a little bit of what's coming up.</p><p>Also joining us this morning on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, the Office of  Management Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney.  Tennessee Congresswoman, Senate  Candidate Marsha Blackburn.  And Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge  Andrew Napolitano.  Don't miss any of those fine folks. </p><p>But first to our top story, Facebook on the defensive once again this  morning, this time after investigation by the New York Times reveals the  scope of data sharing deals that the social media giant struck with at  least 60 device makers including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft over the last  decade.  According to the Times, the partnerships allowed the companies to  access user's personal data as well as information of their friends even if  they specifically block Facebook from sharing that information with third  parties.  </p><p>For its part, Facebook is defending the data sharing as consistent with its  privacy policies.  Official say they're not aware of any abuse by these  companies.  Kevin Kelly, your take on this report.  So to be clear, with  the Cambridge Analytica scandal and what Facebook was doing from 2007 past  2014, they were letting app developers access the data of friends -- of  friends of friends.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is different, this is device makers and we did -- until  this report by the New York Times, we had no idea that they were up to this  in such a broad scale.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And one of the concerning issues is that this actually goes  against a 2011 decree they had with the FTC and part of the problem we're  having here that this one against what people -- what people opted into  saying, \"Hey, you cannot share my information with third parties.\"</p><p>So, is Facebook in a sense trying to say, \"Listen, we are a phone,\" is that  what we're trying to say here?  If they're saying, \"We're not going against  the decrees, we're not going against people's privacy,\" I think the big  issue too is also security, right?  Any time that Facebook allows your data  information, friends of friends, any way it can be pulled out through a  third party that you haven't given access to, there's security at risk and  implications.</p><p>And so, I think this is -- this is a par for the course for Facebook.   Their motto has always been move fast, break things.  They haven't cared  about loss.  They -- that's been consistent with their modus operandi year- over-year especially when this come to affiliate marketing, to taking in  payments in rubles.  I mean, across the board they don't want to be held  accountable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So Kat, with the app developers --</p><p>TIMPF:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Facebook ended that policy in 2014 and started winding it  down, but with these device makers like phone makers, Amazon, Apple,  Blackberry, Microsoft, and Samsung, most of the partnerships remain in  effect that Facebook started winding them down in April.  </p><p>TIMPF:  I just don't know when there's going to be some good news coming  out about Facebook.  It's a bad story and there's another bad story, who  else are they sharing our information with?</p><p>A lot of times you get on Facebook, you set your privacy setting a certain  way and if you block that, you assume that it's not going to be shared.   Now, my phone company knows more about me than I thought and I just don't  even see myself even continuing to use Facebook much anymore.  I barely use  it as it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It does raise a lot of privacy concerns because so much  information is actually store -- very private personal information is  stored on the actual phone.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it raises issues about how much of that information was  circulating between Facebook and all of these device makers.  Some device  makers could retrieve personal information for even from user's friends who  believe they have barred any sharing, it's really astonishing.</p><p>TIMPF:  I don't -- I don't even use Facebook Messenger anymore because now  I'm suspicious that maybe they're reading my messages and sharing my  messages.  I mean, I know that sounds ridiculous but --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I don't use it at all either.</p><p>TIMPF:  But more --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had it installed just in case -- just in case.</p><p>TIMPF:  Someone messages you that you need.  Right.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, I think the overarching thing that we're kind of tiptoeing  around is that this is going to lead to regulation.  We've given them  enough leash to regulate themselves which they said, \"We need to do that,  you're going to hamper us.  You're going to restrict us.\"  </p><p>But they are stamping on and trampeding over our rights and our privacy and  that's a big thing.  So this is going to lead to regulation and if it's not  here, we've seen it come out of Europe.  So, the regulators really need to  come around and figure out what they're going to do about it otherwise,  Europe is going to actually do worst regulations that could actually impede  it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well Kat, what -- it raises the issue of basically losing market  share for Facebook.  As for you, which of these social media platforms do  you use the most?  Because I've almost stopped using Facebook.</p><p>TIMPF:  Same.  I pretty much entirely use Twitter and Instagram.  I  basically only use Facebook, there's some family members that I keep in  touch with on Facebook, so some of them are on there.</p><p>But, yes, back to the regulation thing, one I can think that concerns me  about that is that it might make it harder for competitors to try to start  their own app.  I would love to see an alternative to Facebook at this  point because so many bad things have come out about it, I don't really  even really want much to do with it anymore.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well speaking of regulation, I just want to move on to the --  warning for Silicon Valley, again, from Capitol Hill.  This is in the wake  of Google listing Nazism as an ideology of the California Republican Party  just days ahead of that states primary elections.</p><p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes says that the search  giant and other big technology companies could face hearings from  lawmakers.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  The best thing would be is for there to be some -- there were a new  search engine that actually doesn't censor conservatives.  I think there's  a free market solution here if somebody can compete with Google.  </p><p>If they can't, then ultimately we're looking at monopolies and then that --  you know, that brings in a whole another set of circumstances is, \"Are  these companies, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, et cetera, are they  monopolies?  And should they be reined in?\"  I would hope we don't have to  go there, I would hope that they, you know, just don't get involved in  politics and don't censor conservatives and republicans.  But if they  continue to do it, then we have to move obviously to hearings on these  issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kat, the threat -- there's, again, the threat of regulation but  these tech companies can't get out of their own way.  The fact that Google  would think that that was OK whether it was an algorithm or not, it doesn't  matter because, again, it's -- it raises political bias.</p><p>TIMPF:  Right, absolutely.  They would never see anything like that on a  liberal or the Democrat Party.  There clearly is some sort of bias towards  liberals democrats on some of these search engines.  And the fact that  Nazism is the very first thing listed, that's just makes me roll my eyes so  hard that they're just going to get lost in the back of my head.  I'm so  sick of seeing things like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We need new emojis just for the disgust --</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  Totally.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- disgusting we feel.  And to buy --</p><p>KELLY:  Well --</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  I think it's really important  that we talk about this because we go to Google, we go to these places  because you think that it's going to be fair.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>CARTER:  You think that it's just going to be, \"I want to put up a search\"  and things are going to come up.  And what we don't realize is that within  the -- within Google, within the algorithms that are there that there's  already bias.  And we also have to learn and people don't realize how much  people pay to get to the top of the fold and how much information is being  manipulated.</p><p>KELLY:  Do you remember the elections where they actually were swaying auto  population of search queries for Hillary Clinton.  I mean, this was  completely uncovered and talked about, right?</p><p>TIMPF:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KELLY:  Right?  And you -- and, yes.  And even on Twitter though, there  were certain things that were trending, you know, for Hillary Clinton and  not for Donald Trump.  So you saw this bias play out and this goes back to  the federal election committees, it goes back to the FTC.</p><p>There -- I mean, this is a complex convoluted things and now we're talking  about breaking up some of these companies to separating YouTube from  Google, Instagram from Facebook, there's chatters happening around there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin, real quick, do you think that this concern is factored  into Facebook stock here?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, it is.  And that's why you've seen the stock actually run up  because the advertising is still going that way and advertise -- digital  advertising and it's growing 30 percent year-over-year.  There's -- it's  hard to get out of the way where advertisers are going to spend their money  elsewhere.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll raise it this way, this Cambridge Analytica developer  story, they could say, \"It ended in 20114, this is old.\"  But you know  what, this story that's in the New York Times, they only started rolling it  back in April, so it didn't just end.  This was going on and, again, the  users did not know about it.  So, it will be interesting to watch that  stock today.</p><p>And we want to move to trade really quickly, the Trump Administration  showing no signs of backing down from posing tariffs despite pushback from  our allies, U.S. allies in China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER:  The idea that we are somehow a  national security threat to the United States is quite frankly insulting  and unacceptable.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL:  In regard, this is more  of a family quarrel.  This is -- this is a trade dispute if you will.  It  can be solved.  Mr. Trudeau, I think he's overreacting but the point is, we  have to protect ourselves.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  All we're doing here, all  the president is doing is defending this country's national security  sovereignty and economic security from the flood of imports.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm going to go to Lee on this first this is interesting  language, \"It's just a family quarrel, poo-poo.\"</p><p>CARTER:  Here's what --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And also, this is a national security issue, so basically you  just called Canada and our European allies national security threats  because of steel which by the -- I've got a lot to say about this, but go  ahead.</p><p>CARTER:  I have a lot to say about this because this comes down to  messaging and being consistent to the American people.  And one of the  things that I've been watching lately is how independents are reacting  especially this is really important going into the midterm elections  because it's not necessarily accounted for in all of the primaries.</p><p>Independents right now are really vocalizing that they are nervous, and  that they are scared about what's happening with trade.  There is a huge  fear of playing out of NAFTA which I talked about yesterday on Maria's  show.  There's a huge fear of getting into a trade war and this could  really have an impact on the economy.</p><p>So going right in to the midterms right now, making these risks, making  these kinds of tariffs where people are going to feel it in their pocket  book.  I think it's a very, very risky endeavor on the part of the  administration.</p><p>TIMPF:  Right.  These people vote with their pocket book essentially.   There's a lot of other things that matter but if this ends up affecting the  economy negatively and ends up making people have less money or have to pay  what is essentially a tax on mini goods, they're not going to be a big fan  of that.  I'm not a fan of it, I know that much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What I was going to say is steel prices are already up 40  percent this year already, about 50 percent in the last year.  So steel  prices have been climbing.  Higher prices, it puts pressure on businesses  in this country that use steel.  Again, where do you source that?  How --  are you going to pass along those costs to your customers?</p><p>Are you going to cut jobs?  Are you going to cut wages?  How are these  businesses going to cope with this because this is a huge looming issue  that were just dumped on top the American people and businesses.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, that's the biggest issue we're having.  But at the same time,  we've seen Canada has enacted protectionist policies especially when it  comes to dairy, poultry, especially with timber.  So I think when they're  talking about a family quarrel, they're trying to address all these issues  and modernize NAFTA, they've talked about that.  And the negotiations  haven't really gone anywhere and we've passed ALLEN:  deadlines.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We shall see.  That was a very nice way of putting that.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Yes, it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, it's the -- it's not just steel and aluminum  tariffs, it's the retaliation that we're hearing about from Canada and  Mexico and our American allies targeting those very red states.</p><p>Coming up, pain in the pump and in the skies, why American Airlines is  warning about price hikes if oil prices remain high and how other airlines  are reacting.  </p><p>And President Bill Clinton says the only reason that President Trump is not  facing impeachment hearings right now is because he's not a democrat.  More  on the former president's take, that's ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news right now, Russian President Vladimir Putin  inviting Kim Jong-un to his country.  Cheryl Casone has the details, good  morning Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes Dagen.  Russian media is reporting that Vladimir Putin has  invited the North Korean leader to travel to Russia this fall.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reportedly passed Putin's invitation  to Kim Jong-un while he was visiting Pyongyang just last week.  Now, Putin  wants Kim to attend the Eastern Economic Forum which is held in Vladivostok  every year.  Of course.  Well, we shall see what happens there.</p><p>Let's follow another headline for international anyway, at least 25 people  are dead, 20 were wounded following a volcanic eruption that happened in  Guatemala yesterday.  This is the Fuego Volcano where it erupted for the  second time this year.  Spewed a lot of thick smoke nearly six miles into  the air.  Report say that more than 3,000 people have been evacuated from  their homes.</p><p>Meanwhile the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii continues to rage on leaving some  residents now stranded.  The area's escape route has been cut off by lava  and now has left them with no power, no cell reception, landlines are even  water.  Authorities are planning to airlift people out if the lava  continues to spread.  And actually, over the weekend, three people were  airlifted out of a remote area near that volcano.</p><p>Well, Microsoft reportedly agreeing to buy coding site GitHub.  Some  analyst say that Microsoft might pay up to $5 billion for GitHub.  This, of  course, would bolster Microsoft's programming tools as its trying to move  toward building more open source software.  GitHub said last year that it  was about -- it was booking about $250 million in annual subscription  revenue.  This deal could be announced as early as today.  </p><p>Taking a look at shares of Microsoft, higher in the premarket, up almost  one percent, Dagen.  And those are some of your headlines we're following.   Putin and Kim Jong-un, I'm not even sure what to say about that but back to  you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Interference by Putin in attempted manipulation of the United  States once again.</p><p>CASONE:  Lovely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin, this Microsoft-GitHub story, good for Microsoft?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I think it's great for Microsoft.  You see -- you started to  see actually the transition from (INAUDIBLE) has -- he's really opened up.   I mean, they've got partnerships including with other apps to have open  source and its brought on users into their hybrid cloud which is growing 90  percent quarter-over-quarter.</p><p>So -- I mean, it's -- it really transitioned and opened up the company.   They had to get away from the hardware business and they're now going to  new software as a service company.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And really giving Amazon a run for its money in terms of the  cloud computing business because that's a big grower for Amazon as well.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And they've gone into the subscription model for their own  software.  If you think about Microsoft Word, all the processing, it's been  unbelievable what they've been able -- the transition has been phenomenal  especially if you think about kind of the boondoggles they had with trying  to do their own cellphones, the (INAUDIBLE) and hardware, you didn't really  have any direction, they have direction now.</p><p>CARTER:  And it's fascinating to watch the turnaround of a company that,  you know, could have been irrelevant if they weren't careful, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, that's what Apple's trying to do with recurring  revenue streams.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And it's Apple worldwide developer conference starting today,  so that all these things are going to be talked to.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love that you're up on the news Kevin.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Try to be.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You were out of breath when you came in here earlier this  morning.  </p><p>KELLY:  I know, because I was reading.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  OK.  And by the way, if you're where I came from, it's not  GitHub, it's GitHub.</p><p>Coming up, a graduation surprise from Jimmy Fallon for Stoneman Douglas  High School's class of 2018, as the Florida school also celebrates the  memory of those lost in that school shooting earlier this year.</p><p>And Biden, 2020, why former Vice President Joe Biden says he's willing to  put his hat in the ring and when he'll make up his mind.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rising oil prices not only hitting consumers at the gas pump,  now the CEO of one airline says ticket prices are set to go up due to  higher fuel cost.  The price of crude oil is nearly 40 percent higher than  it was one year ago off its recent highs however.</p><p>Joining me now, Price Futures Group Analyst, Fox Business Contributor, Phil  Flynn.  Always fired up bright and early.  Phil, the warning comes from  American Airlines, Doug Parker, what do you think of this and will it be  the first of many?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think it may be.  You know, a lot  of these airlines were spoiled last year, they were making record profits,  $38 billion in profits and they didn't think that oil prices might ever go  up.</p><p>But all of a sudden, oil prices have gone up, a lot of them were not  prepared for this because they believe in this lower for longer mantra and  they weren't hedged correctly.  Now, I don't think that prices are going to  go up right away but this is a strong signal that if these oil prices say  where they are and they probably will, then more than likely we're going to  see those prices for tickets go up.</p><p>KELLY:  Hey Phil, it's Kevin Kelly here.  You know, what's pretty  interesting is that OPEC is actually trying to figure out the whole  production conundrum, do you think they're going to open up their spigots  and actually bring more output on to the market and actually helps  stabilize oil prices and really put a cap on the run-up we've seen  recently?</p><p>FLYNN:  Kevin, great question.  Last week we heard from Saudi Arabia and  Russia and they were basically signaling to the market that they were ready  to raise production maybe by one million barrels of oil a day.</p><p>But as soon as they said that, the price of oil dropped like, you know,  eight percent in a couple of days.  And I think it scared the cartel out of  them to be honest with you.  So I think they may have second thoughts  because today on the weekend, they basically said that they might raise  production but they weren't very solid about that, they're going to be very  price sensitive before they make that final decision.</p><p>CARTER:  One of the questions I have is the announcement said they're  necessarily going to -- they're going to have higher prices, it doesn't  necessarily mean higher fares.  Do you think airlines are going to go back  to this?</p><p>I mean, I've been reading about people saying that they're got put --  they're going to start charging for carryon bags and other kinds of things,  you think it might go into fees rather than fares?</p><p>FLYNN:  I think it is.  I mean, the last time prices went up, they put on a  fuel surcharge on tickets, that may be a possible.  But overall, we saw  report from the International Air Transport Association that basically said  that their profits are going to be down by 12 percent from the record that  they set last year. </p><p>That's a huge drop, that's billions of dollars.  So I think because of the  competitive nature of airlines are going to try to keep those ticket prices  down but eventually if prices stay high, eventually they're going to pass  those cost on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Phil, in terms of what people are going to be paying at the pump  this summer, are your estimates, have they come down recently with the drop  in the cost of crude oil?</p><p>FLYNN:  I think they have slightly.  I mean right now the national average  is about $2.95.  We do expect another run-up in price right before the 4th  of July which is typical.  But right now we haven't hit that $3.00 a gallon  area.</p><p>But the big picture for gasoline prices, the era of low gasoline prices are  over.  Even if prices go down, they're going to stay pretty much where they  are right now.  There's a very strong global economy, demand is strong.   And the other thing I'm really concerned about is the cost of diesel, the  truckers have really been feeling this price increase.</p><p>You know, gasoline prices are $2.50 but if you're a trucker, you're paying  an average of $3.21 a gallon, that's mainly because the white oil in the  U.S. doesn't produce a lot of diesel fuels and those supplies are a lot  tighter than gasoline.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And those higher freight cost if you will, broadly  speaking Phil, it filters through the other businesses.  We've heard that  from the food company Cisco just as one example.  So, again, these rising  prices are filtering through the economy and will show up in ways we might  not expect.  Phil, great to see you.</p><p>FLYNN:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.</p><p>FLYNN:  Thank you Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Phil Flynn in Chicago for us.  Coming up, Bill Clinton's  eyebrow-raising take on impeachment, why he says the only reason President  Trump isn't facing impeachment hearings right now is because he's not a  democrat.</p><p>And hooked on your smart phone, many of us are, but now Apple is set to  reveal new software that is supposed to help you kick your screen  addiction.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, June 4th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets extending  gains, Futures pointing to a triple-digit rally at the open, 137-point gain  on the Dow Futures right now.  This after stocks rallied on Friday,  following that better-than-expected job's report and it was a blockbuster,  219 points with the Dow gained on Friday.  </p><p>And global markets following America's lead, going -- starting the new week  in Europe, we have buying across the board, nearly a one percent gain on  the FTSE-100 in England.  In Asia overnight, same story, we have strong  global markets with both the Nikkei in Japan and the Hang Seng in Hong  Kong, gaining more than one percent.  Former President Bill Clinton  weighing in on the impeachment debate surrounding President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think if roles were  reversed, if there were a Democrat President and these facts were present,  most people I know in Washington believe that impeachment hearings would  have begun already.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We take a closer look at those comments, straight ahead.  A  celebrity surprise for the graduating class of Marjory Stoneman Douglas  High School, Jimmy Fallon, giving an emotional and uplifting commencement  address, this  after the shooting there, earlier this year.  Another strike  averted in Las Vegas, the Culinary Union reportedly making a deal with MGM,  we will have those details, and Apple, looking to address the growing issue  of phone addiction.  </p><p>Details on the announcements we're expecting from the Worldwide Developers  Conference.  Plus, SpaceX, launching a satellite overnight, but it's not  all success.  The company announcing a delay to its space tourism plans.  </p><p>But to our top story this half hour, President Bill Clinton, ramping up his  rhetoric, the former president arguing that impeachment hearings would have  already started if a Democrat was the commander-in-chief during the current  investigation on meddling by Russia into the election.  Here's what  President Clinton said during an interview on CBS, yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  I think they have tried, by in large, to cover this investigation  based on the facts.  I think if roles were reversed, now, this is me just  talking based on my experience, if there were a Democratic President and  these facts were present, most people I know in Washington believe  impeachment hearings would have begun already.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us is Former Ohio State Senate Minority Leader and  American University School of Public Affairs Executive in Residence, Capri  Cafaro, along with Former Massachusetts State Co-Chairman for Trump's  Presidential Campaign and U.S. Senate Candidate for Massachusetts, Geoff  Diehl.  Geoff, back in 1999, the Senate voted to acquit President Clinton  of both articles of impeachment.  What is your take on this that he raises  this issue now?</p><p>FMR. REP. GEOFF DIEHL (R-MA), MEMBER, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  MASSACHUSETTS:  Well, Dagen, thank you for having me on.  And I will say  it's hard to believe that President Clinton is making this comment after he  was given such a pass whether it was Whitewater or whether it was  Travelgate, to the point where his wife ended up scrubbing his server and  seemed to be getting a complete pass.  So, a very ironic that he would be  making these accusations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Capri, I look at it from this point of view that, Hillary  Clinton has not really been out there, campaigning in the midterm elections  for the most part.  She did endorse Governor Cuomo in New York, recently.   And President Clinton has been largely absent but he, kind of, comes out  with this whopper, and I say that because the Special Counsel investigation  is still on-going, we don't have a report delivered.  And he says this,  that impeachment proceedings would have already been started.</p><p>FMR. SEN. CAPRI CAFARO (D), OHIO:  Look, I think that, you know, President  Clinton, he is somebody -- obviously, he's gone through this before,  personally, his wife loss, so I think that there's just a little bit of,  maybe, a bad taste in his mouth, if you will, over this whole impeachment  thing.  </p><p>I think that, you know, he's gone through this before and I think that the  only point, frankly, that I think President Clinton is making, is that, you  know, if it was a Democratic President and a Republican Congress, maybe it  would have been done, and vice versa.  </p><p>Look, there's a lot of concern that if the Democrats take back the House,  that they could start the impeachment process.  So, unfortunately, what has  happened with impeachment, is that it's become a political hammer more than  a legal proceeding, and that's a problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Given what his impeachment was -- the impeachment proceedings on  President Clinton what they were related to, it was kind of curious that he  wasn't pressed on his thoughts on the Me Too Movement even what -- even  what -- you know, raised the issue, again, of what Kirsten Gillibrand, the  Senator, said about President Clinton, that he should have resigned and we  have gotten some commentary from him on that recently, but your take on  that because, again, if you're going to -- if you're going to talk about  impeachment, let's talk about all of it, Capri.</p><p>CAFARO:  You know, I think we also need to put some context into this  interview.  Apparently, Bill Clinton just wrote some, sort of, a political  thriller with John Patterson.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>CAFARO:  So, I mean, he's doing these interviews as part of a book tour.   But sure, I mean, I've always said, you have got to be equitable in these  conversations whether you're a Democrat or a Republican.  If you're going  to have the conversations surrounding this, then, sure, I mean, be fair and  have a conversation about the reasons behind impeachment, which were not  just Monica Lewinsky, but frankly, about lying, you know,  as part of a  deposition, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it was related to the Lewinsky affair.  I mean, the charges  were directly related to that.</p><p>CAFARO:  Right, of course, of course.  I mean, again, I think that -- you  know, the Clintons, frankly, and I say this as a Democrat, and I love Bill  Clinton as a president, I'm not -- I was not really crazy about Hillary  Clinton, but the Clintons are part of the past and we need to move forward  and redefine the Democratic Party and stop continuing to go back and  relitigate things from the 1990s, we need to move forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to -- President Clinton also weighed in on the mainstream  media bias allegations when President Obama was in office.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  They did treat him differently than other Democrats and  Republicans because they --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why?</p><p>CLINTON:  That was the political press.  You know, I don't know.  They  liked him.  And they liked having the first African-American president, and  he was a good president, I think.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get your thoughts on this, Geoff, because, again, he's  -- weighing in on some very serious topics.  And he definitely seems upset  about the way that he was treated toward the end of his presidency, whether  it was the impeachment proceeding and the big picture, how does this --  does this help Republicans and hurt Democrats, going into November?</p><p>DIEHL:  Well, I will say that Bill Clinton is absolutely right that  President Obama was given a pass on many things as well, fast and furious,  Benghazi, which was a combination of Hillary Clinton and President Obama's  administration.  They seemed -- the press seemed to just continually ignore  and white-wash all that was going on there.  </p><p>Now, at the same time, Donald Trump can't seem to catch a break, the DOJ,  the FBI, the IRS of his weaponized against conservatives for the last, I  don't know how many years, and all of this pointing to, you know, collusion  within the government, you know, trying to keep Republicans from having any  success.  So I think, again, Bill Clinton needs to, probably, moderate his  conversation about, you know, unfairness and talk about the fact that, I  think, even President Trump is being treated unfairly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Capri, I just did want to point out that President Clinton  did was, he was asked about the Kirsten Gillibrand, saying that he should  resign and his response was, kind of, it was all over the place, you know  she's living in a different context, and she did it for different reasons,  so I just disagree with her, he said, during that -- during that interview.   We just didn't play the clip, but what were you going to say?</p><p>CAFARO:  What is he going to say?  I mean, what does someone say to that?   I mean, Kirsten Gillibrand is obviously angling to run for President in  2020 and, certainly, she wanted to, you know, capture on that Me Too  Movement and take a stand.  But what is President Clinton going to say,  yes, I should have resigned?  </p><p>I mean, you know, he's in a -- he's in a tough spot, but I think -- but I  think the conversations that we are having here is why is President  Clinton, maybe, not having an honest of a dialogue as I think people are,  maybe, hoping from him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Philippe Reines called Kirsten Gillibrand, a hypocrite.   But President Clinton could've done that and said, given new support that  she got from the Clintons, maybe that's one word he could've used.  </p><p>CAFARO:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Meantime, Former Vice President Joe Biden, isn't ruling out a  2020 Presidential bid, while he continues to campaign for other Democrats,  Biden's team is said to be outlining what his campaign could look like and  will likely decide by the end of the year, if he will run.  This is  according to reporting by NBC News, Capri, your reaction to this?</p><p>CAFARO:  You know, well, I said earlier, we need to move forward and we  need to have some new blood into the Democratic Party.  Our bench is  actually pretty weak and, you know, I come from the State from Ohio, a guy  like Joe Biden, really connects with, you know, my people, in the Rust  Belt, you know, coming from Scranton, he's a straight shooter, and while he  is old, so is President Trump, I think that Joe Biden regrets not running  in 2016, a lot of, could have, would have, should have, there.  </p><p>And I think that he has a better shot than some of the more progressive  names that we're hearing, like Elizabeth Warren and the like.  So, it's not  an ideal situation, but, you know, if Joe Biden does run, he would be  certainly somebody that I would support because I think he could connect  with those Trump crossover Democrats.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Geoff, he's certainly somebody who can talk to people who  don't live on the East Coast and major cities and, basically, Los Angeles  and San Francisco.  He does know how to talk to every man and every woman.</p><p>DIEHL:  Yes.  No, Dagen, and I think it was interesting, my opponent,  Elizabeth Warren, was in Ohio just a few weeks ago, stumping for a  Democratic governor's candidate because she's trying to grease these kids  for a 2020 run, obviously, but showing that Joe Biden is out there and  thinking that he has a chance of running, I think, is a good example of why  Elizabeth Warren has no chance to becoming the nominee for 2020.  She's  done nothing for Massachusetts, no credits, nothing to take credit for.  </p><p>And now, she's basically wants re-election so she can spend two more years  doing nothing for Massachusetts, that's why I'm running this race to make  sure that people know they have a choice in November, to have someone who's  going to work for them down in Washington D.C., versus someone who doesn't  even have a chance to run in 2020.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Capri, it's good to see you as always.  Capri Cafaro --</p><p>CAFARO:  Absolutely.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Geoff Diehl, thanks for coming on.  Coming up --</p><p>DIEHL:  Thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breathing a sigh of relief, workers, striking a tentative deal  with another Las Vegas casino, days after threat of a massive walkout,  details on the plan, ahead, and another success for launch for SpaceX's  Falcon 9 earlier this morning, but a major setback for SpaceX's  intergalactic tourism plans, more on the failure to launch, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A surprise speech for Stoneman Douglas High School graduates.   Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Dagen.  So, the surprise commencement speaker was \"Late  Night\" Host, Jimmy Fallon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY FALLON, COMEDIAN AND HOST:  You won't be classmates anymore.  You'll  be -- (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FALLON:  When something feels hard, remember that you get better.  Choose  to move forward.  Don't let anything stop you.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  It's quite a moment there.  Fallon continue, though, of course, to  provide some comic relief and then, of course, show that heart felt message  of hope to the students there.  The graduation coming months after the  shooting in Parkland that left 17 people dead; four students killed  would've graduated yesterday.  </p><p>Well, a crisis averted for MGM Resorts.  It has raised tentative labor  agreement with an employee union.  MGM joins Caesars Entertainment in  approving new five-year contracts with union workers -- avoiding what could  have been a major disruption in business as game five of the Stanley Cup  finals is returning to Vegas this week.  Of course, here are those  employees celebrating in that video.  Details of the agreement, not  disclosed but casino workers have been asking for an increase in wages and  benefits for the last several weeks.  </p><p>And then finally this, another successful launch overnight for SpaceX's  Falcon 9, the rocket carrying a massive communication satellite.  This is  going to bring data and broadband services to Asia, Australia, and the  Middle East taking off.  This is Falcon 9's 11th launch this year.   Meanwhile, more news, Elon Musk's big plans for space tourism are being put  on hold.  SpaceX announcing that its mission to fly tourists around the  moon will not likely happen until 2019 due to technical and production  problems.  Next year, OK.  Most previously, he said he'd hoped to launch  the first test flights by the end of this year.  So, next year going to the  moon, Dagen, or so he says.  I don't know.  Back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Might want to worry about the car company.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CARTER:  Energy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love it.  Like, we're going to the moon but this electric car,  this inexpensive electric car.  </p><p>CASONE:  That Model 3.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Struggling with that one.  Thank you, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.  Coming up, kicking your smart phone addiction with help  from Apple.  The tech giant expected to reveal big news today about the  latest software update that could help you reduce your screen time.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Attention iPhone addicts, Apple is reportedly unveiling new  software to help consumers digitally detox.  According to published reports  the feature is called digital health and will help users limit their screen  time.  This comes as the tech giant will hold its annual worldwide  developers conference in San Jose today and outline its software strategy  for the next year.  </p><p>Joining me now is Trends Expert, Futurist, CEO of TechSavvy Global and the  Author of \"Make Change Work for You\", Scott Steinberg.  Scott, Apple  changed the smartphone industry and now they're helping tools create --  creating tools to help you break iPhone habit.  Why are they doing this  now?  </p><p>SCOTT STEINBERG, CEO, TECHSAVVY:  Well, as you might imagine, Apple has  sold in billions of devices, people love these things.  The question is:  how the heck do we get them off them?  Companies like Google on their  android devices have already introduced digital wellness tools, so it's  only natural fit giving increasing calls and pressure for Apple to cut down  on people's smartphone addictions, for them to put it timers, screen time  limits, even apps that will prevent you from accessing your favorite  applications during the day at work.  So, maybe you can break that Candy  Crush Saga addiction a little bit.  </p><p>KELLY:  Scott, aren't we already moving away from this with the  proliferation of these things, devices, as well as the virtual assistance  that we're having like home pods?  Aren't people moving away from using  their actual device and starting to use other devices or other things?  And  Apple is actually behind in that regard.  I mean, their virtual assistance:  Siri has lost way to Alexa.  I mean, is that where we're headed?  </p><p>STEINBERG:  Well, we're definitely seeing people play with the variety of  different devices.  They're splitting their time between different screens  and even as you pointed out, on devices that is don't have a screen -- Siri  and the home pod, some of the smart speakers has fallen a big behind where  Google and Amazon are.  In fact, at Worldwide Developers Conference, you  can probably hear Apple talk a little bit about what the future of Siri is  going to hold.  They need to make the service a little bit smarter, they  need to talk about integrations with different devices from speakers to  headphones and even cars, and perhaps they'll even open up the platform,  the Siri platform so that other developers can create all sorts of fun  applications and new uses for it, but they definitely are playing catch-up  on that front and people are definitely using more devices across the  board.  So, should be an exciting day in terms of news.  </p><p>CARTER:  You know, it did seem that Apple was always ahead of the curb,  that Apple was the model.  Whenever I had a client, they said I want to be  more like Apple as far as innovation goes.  It seems like they're falling  behind with their launches, they're getting more bugs, and it seems, you  know, in all of these things, do you think they're going to make a big  announcement that's going to help create a vision for the future?  </p><p>STEINBERG:  I think absolutely, you're going to see Apple paint a picture  of what's coming next.  And I wouldn't count them out of the game at any  time -- as we've seen in timeless times in the past, bouncing back.  I  think this year, the focus is going to be more on software than hardware  devices, though.  Some of the big surprise reveals may surround the  introduction of Apple T.V. as a video streaming service, more like Hulu and  Netflix.  And in fact, one of the buzzes, that everybody is talking about,  is the fact that maybe pretty soon, you'll be able to run an iPhone and  iPad apps right there seamlessly on Mac computers, seamlessly integrating  computers and smart phones more going forward.  So, I think they'll have  some pretty exciting announcements.  And they'll probably touch on Siri and  privacy issues as well and draw and hardline stance.  Unlike companies like  Google and Facebook, Apple is more in the business of selling hardware, not  users data -- the marketer.  So, I think you'll hear about that as well.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let me raise an issue with you, Scott, because there's  this big story that the New York Times reported, an investigative story  that Facebook gave device makers deep access to data on users and friends,  and one of those named is Apple.  So, Apple has been quite bias about not  selling your information, protecting your own information if you're Apple  customer.  But they seem -- and this is a question all too willing to take  information on individuals if it's coming through another company.  Tim  Cook has gone after Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg has pushed back on that.   So, it raises an issue about a little bit of hypocrisy at Apple.  </p><p>STEINBERG:  Well, who knows what the heck is going on behind closed doors.   But keep in mind for Apple, it's not necessarily about selling information  onto marketers.  They have services like Siri that are powered by  artificial intelligence, and the more data you have on users, the smarter  and better the services get.  So, I think Apple probably isn't as extensive  users of people's personal private data as many other companies may be.   But of course, in some cases, it may be the pop calling the kettle back.   There's a lot of jousting going on out there in the media as you might  imagine. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Wall Street Journal also had a story about a new level of  security on your business trip, Scott, what do you make of that in terms of  the invasion maybe of your employer in tracking your, tracking your  movements when you're traveling for work?  </p><p>STEINBERG:  Well, there's some duty of care there.  You have to keep in  mind that any time a business sends you out on a trip in many countries,  they're taking a risk, they have a responsibility to exercise reasonable  care in terms of knowing where you are and making sure you have updates and  alerts, information on the areas in which you'll be traveling, and also  provide emergency relief.  And of course, we live in an increasingly  unpredictable world so people have bigger concerns as.  They're worried  about terrors, and they're worried about crime, they're even worried more  natural disaster.  So, it's only a natural step forward that more companies  would be tracking this information and introducing these policies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scott, great to see you.  Thank you so much.  I hope any Apple  T.V. thing is better than that Amazon, the one I've got which basically  blew up over the weekend.  So, thank you for that, Scott Steinberg.   Marking 500 days in office for President Trump.  I talked to his budget  director when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It's Monday June 4th.</p><p>Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Starting the week on an upbeat note; 126-point gain on the Dow futures  right now, we've got a rally on our hands.  The Dow right now percentage  wise is the biggest mover to the upside.  This is after stocks rallied on  Friday following that better than expected jobs report.  </p><p>The global markets starting Monday with gains as well.  In Europe we had  green across the board in England, France and Germany.</p><p>And in Asia overnight it was the exact same story.  All four major markets  there to the upside.</p><p>But here at home trade turmoil -- Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross returns  from China with no deal.  It comes as our allies ramp up their threats of  retaliation over steel and aluminum tariffs that the U.S. has slapped on  them but White House trade policy director, Peter Navarro standing firm on  the need for these tariffs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE POLICY DIRECTOR:  At the end of the day  this is a trade dispute and the President is going to defend this country.   He stands for American workers and he's standing up for them now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The reaction from Capitol Hill straight ahead.</p><p>Facebook under fire -- a new report from the New York Times says that the  social media giant gave users data to device makers including Apple and  Samsung.  This raising new privacy concerns this morning.</p><p>Plus the power to pardon -- President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani  sparking a major debate over whether President Trump can pardon himself.</p><p>Jeep getting into the subscription game -- the auto maker set to launch its  service next year.  How it will work, coming up.</p><p>And Lebron James rewears his suit with shorts.  That's the only news out of  the game.  And he wasn't the only person wearing those duds.</p><p>I'm kind of digging into all of that and so much more this morning.  Fox  News contributor Kat Timpf is here; Benchmark managing partner Kevin Kelly;  and Maslansky and Partners president Lee Carter.</p><p>Although Kevin is behind the desk, I can report he is wearing full-length  trousers.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Exactly.  Yes.  I thought that  trend went out over a year ago.  I was actually talking to some of my  buddies over the weekend about the short suit situation.  And it was a  quick fad for like a hot second.  And I think it's -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Now yes.  Now it's going to become a fad  again.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you've got good gams -- show them all.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, no -- I completely agree.  I said that on Friday.  But I think  this summer is the no-sock summer.  I think you actually are supposed to  wear full length pants with no socks.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  I had no idea.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  That's the -- there you are.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lee just made a face -- again we need more emojis.  We need  emojis to reflect the face that Lee just made at Kevin Kelly.</p><p>KELLY:  I'm just keeping up on the trends.</p><p>CARTER:  I like the bright colored socks.  I'm getting them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you Lee.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Mike Pompeo's socks -- how about those little soldiers? </p><p>TIMPF:  There you go.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sending a message to North Korea.</p><p>Coming up this morning: Office of Management and Budget director Mick  Mulvaney is here; Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano;  and the host of \"VARNEY AND COMPANY\" Stuart Varney.  You don't want to miss  any of those gentlemen.</p><p>But first to our top story this hour -- standing tall on trade.  The Trump  administration showing no signs of backing down from imposing tariffs on  our allies despite a pushback from those very allies and China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUSTINE TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: The idea that we are somehow a  national security threat to the United States is quite frankly insulting  and unacceptable.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  I regard this as more of  a family quarrel.  This is a trade dispute if you will.  It can be solved.   And Mr. Trudeau -- I think he's overreacting.  But the point is we have to  protect ourselves.</p><p>NAVARRO:  All we're doing here -- all the President is doing is defending  this country's national security sovereignty and economic security from the  flood of imports.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now House Energy and Commerce Committee Member  Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee -- </p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-TN), HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEES:  Good  morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- who's currently running for the senate.  Congresswoman --  always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Good to see you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Aren't Republicans though -- of you're running for reelection in  the House, if you're running for office in November -- aren't they worried  about the impact on their constituents on the voters about these tariffs  and the retaliation that could happen?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  We are watching it very closely.  Of course, we know that the  intention is to punish bad actors and not the American consumers.  So that  is something everybody agrees on.</p><p>We are concerned when it comes to auto manufacturers, to auto parts  manufacturers, boat manufacturers that we have in Tennessee that use a  tremendous amount of sheet aluminum.  We are watching it closely.</p><p>You've got washing machine manufacturers that are there.  And -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have already imposed tariffs on washing machines.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Right.  And we're talking to them every day.  And we're waiting  to see exactly what's going to happen what exemptions are going to take  place and how this is going to come down.</p><p>Donald Trump goes through a process in negotiating.  So we're -- we're in  the conversation, talking to commerce and trade, and you know, still trying  to work through this.</p><p>TIMPF:  Still the bottom line is tariffs always wind up as a tax on the  consumer and there's really no way around that.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  And I know the President's goal is to bring jobs back on shore  and that's why it's so important to stay engaged in this process with  Commerce and the Trade Rep and talking with your constituent companies that  use steel and aluminum.</p><p>A lot of tool and dye processing in Tennessee because of the auto  manufacturers that are there, and what you do not want to do is to take a  step that is going to end up having them charge more.</p><p>And of course, taxes and tariffs are something that give us concern but  also disadvantage trade.  It's something that has given us some concern.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you talk about -- talking about bad actors but Canada is a  valuable ally -- </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Absolutely they are.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mexico and particularly Europe.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the one thing that a lot of people can't get their have  around is if the real bad actor in terms of stealing our intellectual  property in terms of demanding that U.S. companies hand over their  technology in order to do business in China, that it's the real bad actor  in the room and on the world stage is China so we ought to be, as I've  said, locking arms with those allies.</p><p>Rather than essentially trying to protect 140,000 steel jobs in the United  States, protect a union while then basically putting al1 these other jobs  and the state of the consumers in the jeopardy.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Right.</p><p>And here's an example of that.  I was talking with someone that works in  the space, in the manufacturing space.  And there is a particular sheet  aluminum that they use that is not manufactured in the U.S.  So you're  disadvantaging them if they have to pay that tariff in order to get that  product that is an essential product and the product they manufacture.   Then you are running their price up.</p><p>China is the bad actor, they have been stealing our intellectual property  for decades.  It has -- they've stolen, they've infringed and yes, they  need to be dealt with.  And I know the Secretary -- Secretary Ross is  working through that process trying to get some concessions there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  This is something that Lee raised because again, it's not  just the tariffs on steel and aluminum -- </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it's the retaliatory tariffs on -- </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- I think the ones from Canada go into effect July 1st.  And  they're targeting red states and Republican districts whether it's on motor  boats, sail boats, cranberries, targeting -- </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Pork, soy -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  -- those are Tennessee products.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We sent Connell on a soybean farm out in Iowa.  Connell McShane  -- we're going to get to him.  It's very obvious what the retaliation is  meant to go after.</p><p>But to that point have -- business owners in your district -- have they  been calling your office saying what the heck is going on?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  What they are doing is calling and we're talking with them  about what specific impact would be on them.  And that's what you want to  know.  So that when you're talking with the administration you can say how  about this.  What is that impact going to be?</p><p>Now I'm -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have they given you any proof (ph)?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes -- and I sat down and met with farmers in Tennessee.  I  have met with individuals that sell to small business manufacturers and  those small business manufacturers themselves.</p><p>And they are concerned about it because the tax cuts are working.  They are  ramping up, their orders have increased.  Some of them are adding  production and they want to keep the focus on growth and productivity.</p><p>And their concern is let's not do anything that is going to cost us to hit  the brakes.  Let's look at what is going to continue with a ready supply  chain of the products that we need to manufacture the products we can sell.   And generate more jobs and more economic activity.</p><p>So of course, we are going to watch this very closely.  And continue the  conversations with constituents and other policies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I listened to the people from the administration on Sunday  yesterday.  Peter Navarro was on with Maria.  Larry Kudlow was on \"FOX NEWS  SUNDAY\".  Can they assure you and your constituents and the American people  who are going to be hurt by this, American businesses, that there isn't  going to be any pain?  Or are they saying this is pain that you need to  deal with?  What are they telling you?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Well, we will see exactly how they're going to approach that  this week.  We are going back to D.C. tomorrow and we will see what their  conversations are going to entail.</p><p>What we're trying to do is to arrive at a spot where we can say, you know,  this is going to have an impact.  This is not going to have an impact.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Do not adversely impact the American consumer or the American  manufacturer, the job creator.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to North Korea -- Congresswoman.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The country shaking up its top military brass ahead of the  summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un set for June 12.  North  Korea's top three military officials had been reportedly removed from their  posts.</p><p>And now there are reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin has invited  Kim Jong-un to Russia.  Your take on this ahead of this high-stakes summit  because again the President has the G-7 business in Quebec this Friday and  Saturday.  Then he's got to go to Singapore for that and then he's got to  deal with later on pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I'm telling you what -- they are giving America something to  talk about, aren't the?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  I think that everybody is now wanting a summit.  Putin wants a  summit with Trump and you know -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  -- so we're into the sit and talk -- the good thing is North  Korea is at the table.  This is a situation that has festered because it's  languished for decades.  And I applaud the President and his team and  Secretary Pompeo who is really doing a tremendous job for getting him to  the table and for having these discussions in trying to bring an end to  this conflict.  So that I think is to be applauded.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick, Facebook is on the defensive this morning. </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a story in the \"New York Times\".  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  As they ought to be.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  But this is an incredible of investigative journalism.   This report details the scope of its data sharing deals with 60 device  makers including Apple, Samsung, Microsoft.  According to \"The Times\" the  partnership gave the companies access to users' personal data as well as  the information of their friends even if they specifically blocked Facebook  from sharing their information from third parties.</p><p>This is like the Cambridge Analytica scandal but that was at developers.   Facebook said we ended that in 2014 but not this.  They only started  dialing this back in April when it looked like they were going to get  caught probably.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's exactly right.  And this is why we had been on all of  these edge providers -- Facebook, YouTube, Google, the search engines --  all of them because we need to have privacy legislation.</p><p>It's like the Wild West.  Your bank, your health care -- everybody has  privacy standards.  This segment of the virtual space is zero-privacy  standards.  That's why we need the Browser Act.  That's why we need a data  security bill.</p><p>You, the consumer, need the ability to opt in and decide what of your  identifying information -- </p><p>KELLY:  Congresswoman -- you co-chaired the bipartisan privacy working  group on this -- </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes, right.</p><p>KELLY:  -- and one of the biggest issues that I'm seeing happening through  Facebook and situations like this is that you're able to target ads  indiscriminate (ph).</p><p>I mean basically what happened with Facebook is in the fault.  Pro Publica  exposed how you can do housing ads and target whites only.  And so it went  against African-Americans, other high school kids.  When are they going to  be held accountable?</p><p>BLACKBURN:  We continue to try to hold them accountable in CPNI (ph) is  this bundle of information.

This is an incredible development.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  One of the biggest studies that we've seen in particular with  breast cancer -- let's talk about this.  It's a federally-funded study that  is now suggesting that many women with early stage breast cancer could  safely skip commonly used chemotherapy after surgery.  And that could spare  patients from, of course, the difficult side effect while they're  undergoing their treatment and also the cost of all of that to patients.</p><p>And then there was a separate study that showed that many patients with  advanced kidney cancer could avoid kidney removal surgery and instead take  a new drug.  These studies were both presented at the American Society of  Clinical Oncology's annual meeting -- a lot of big news coming at that  meeting.</p><p>Well, ticket-buying Web site TicketFly is still offline after a massive  data breach.

Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani weighing in on just how much power the  Commander-in-Chief has when it comes to ending the probe.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK TODD, NBC NEWS HOST:  Does this mean he could terminate any federal  investigation?  Is that the argument here?  Any federal investigation -- he  can terminate.</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, TRUMP LAWYER:  Yes.  I mean that is pretty clear.  He's  asking in the theoretical sense now.  I mean it could lead to impeachment,  it could lead to -- I mean if he terminated an investigation of himself it  could lead to all sorts of things.</p><p>TODD:  Right.  A constitutional -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mr. Giuliani also telling \"The Huffington Post\" that President  Trump could have former FBI director James Comey shot in the Oval Office  and still not be indicted saying impeachment would have to be the first  step.</p><p>Here now Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Much to  talk about -- </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- from what Rudy said, your reaction.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, let's start with the last one -- the comment about  having James Comey shot is incendiary, outrageous and just plain wrong  under the law.  I mean the President is immune from the rigors of  prosecution during the time he is in office so as not to take him away from  his Presidential duties.</p><p>But he is not immune from being charged.  He is not immune from being  indicted.  And in the case of a crime of violence he is not immune from  being arrested.</p><p>This is more extreme than when President Nixon once said, you remember this  famous quote, Lee.  \"If the President does it, that means it's not  illegal.\"  Forgive the double negative.  I'm quoting him exactly.</p><p>That would make the President a prince (ph).  That would remove the  President from the conference of the rule of law that would violate the  President's oath to uphold the constitution.</p><p>Look, we were talking during the break.  Rudy is throwing gasoline on fire.   And it's either because his client, the President, likes chaos or because  he and his legal team have decided the best way to undermine Bob Mueller is  to make incendiary and extreme statements about presidential power and  shove them in Mueller's face.  I don't think it's going to work.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can he pardon himself, you think?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That of course, has never happened before.  The argument in  favor of it is the pardoning powers when held by the court to be plenary,  absolute and without check.  The argument against it is the rule of law  says you can't be a judge in your own case, you can't evaluate your own  behavior.  And the rule of law is embedded in the constitution.  I don't  know which way that would go.</p><p>In my view it's a dangerous thing -- I realize Chuck Todd -- because Rudy  confused the name -- put the question to him.  So it's not Rudy's fault  that he got the question.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  But in my view it's a dangerous thing for him to be discussing  the very concept that the President in order to avoid complying with the  law would pardon himself, I think it would rub most Americans, even people  that like him as I do, the wrong way.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's turn to the controversy surrounding what President Trump  and people within the White House, Trump supporters call spy gate.  House  intelligence committee chairman, Devin Nunez, taking on his colleague  Congressman Trey Gowdy on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" with Maria yesterday.   Watch this.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNEZ (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  Mr Gowdy believes  that he has been told by the Department of Justice on several occasions  that Mister Trump is not a target.  But what I keep going back to is that  well, wait a second.  We know from Mr. Comey he said that the Trump  campaign was the reason that they opened up the counterintelligence  investigation.  So they did open up an investigation of the Trump campaign  -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There's two issues here.  One is hair-splitting over the  meaning of the word \"target\" and the meeting of the word that Congressman  Nunez did not use in that clip but did use elsewhere yesterday.  Subject --  a subject is a person or entity or group that is being investigated by the  government to see if the subject committed a crime.</p><p>A target is a person, entity or group the government has already decided to  indict.  You can go from a subject to a target like that depending up what  the evidence is that is found about you.</p><p>Second -- and this is dangerous and we've been talking about this for a  long time.  Congressman Gowdy and Congressman Nunes saw the same raw  intelligence FBI documents that you and I can't see.  Gowdy looks at it and  says, \"I'm a lawyer and I'm in x prosecutor.\"  The FBI behaved  appropriately.  There was no spy.  There was no undercover FBI person in  the Trump campaign as he Rudy Giuliani claimed.</p><p>Congressman Nunes looks at the same document said I wouldn't put it quite  that way.  This is the danger of exposing raw intelligence documents for  politicians who then draw their own political narrative from it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go ahead.</p><p>TIMPF:  Do you think that anything will actually happen with this?  I know  that President Trump talks about it a lot.  But is there any actual legal  problem here.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  well, if there truly was an undercover FBI agent pretending to  be a Republican operative, wouldn't you have known if he was a Republican  or not who made his way into the campaign.  They would need to have gotten  a search warrant to do that because that's the functional equivalent of  full time surveillance.  Every time he is there.  He is seen and listening  to what's going on.</p><p>And if they got the search warrant -- I would like to see what they told a  federal judge in order to get the judge to sign the warrant.  If they did  this without a search warrant they committed serious and grave violations.   But Kat there is no evidence -- I'm relying on Congressman Gowdy who saw  the documents and told me the non-classified parts of what he saw.  There  is zero evidence that this happened.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Could the President just release all these documents?  Let the  American people stand.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No, the President doesn't have these documents.  These  documents are in the possession of Bob Mueller and his bosses at the  Department of Justice.  It is highly unusual and almost unheard of for  documents and a criminal investigation to be released to the potential  defendant, no matter who he is before the charges had even been filed.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  but we should point out the inspector general is looking into  this.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  The Inspector General is looking into whether or not the FBI  violated DOJ regulations in the matter in which it commenced the Trump --  the campaign investigation and conducted the Hillary Clinton e-mail  investigation.</p><p>And that report my dear, Miss McDowell is coming up this week or next week.</p><p>MCDOWELL:   Next week.  They moved the testimony of -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- before the fourth of July.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They moved the testimony of the IG General to next week.  I  think it's it's now scheduled for -- I'm pulling this one out of my -- June  11, I think is -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You got it.</p><p>Good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Lots of pleasure guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Judge Andrew Napolitano -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Happy Monday morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right on.</p><p>Coming up President Trump marking 500 days in office with an economic tail  win.

The commander in chief  marking his 500 day in office.  And looking back he's taken action on many  of the key issues that he brought up on the campaign trail and during his  inaugural address.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  January 20th 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became  the rulers of this nation again.  The forgotten men and women of our  country.  Will be forgotten no longer.  Every decision on trade, on taxes,  on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers  and American families.  America will start winning again, winning like  never before.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  On Friday we saw the strength of the economy under President  Trump.  The May jobs report showed 223,000 jobs were added, that again was  an acceleration from the job growth that we've seen in the last year about  190,000 jobs with the monthly average before that came out.  The  unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent at an 18 year low.  Joining me now is  Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.  Good to see you,  Mick.  Your comments on where the economy is right now?  And can we -- I  think the Atlanta Fed estimates that in the second quarter.  We could be  growing at close to five percent, 4.8 percent.  Can we continue that  quarter after quarter?  </p><p>MICK MULVANEY, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET:  It's truly an  amazing testimony to what the American people or what the American economy  can do if the government will just let them.  Keep in mind the numbers that  they're talking about, not only on the Atlanta Fed numbers but the numbers  that we're actually seeing are actually better than we anticipated when we  first -- when the president first took office.  And much better than we  were left under the previous administration.  Remember the story after  story when the president first took office that we could never get back to  three percent growth, it wasn't possible.  Lawrence Summer's saying you  couldn't do, and I think Ben Bernanke said you couldn't do it.  Everybody  who supposedly knew what was happening said that the country was simply not  capable of growing at three percent again.  And the president and his  economic team absolutely believed that to be false.  And it's exciting to  be able to prove to people that the American economy is much stronger than  people realize.  And yes, but we do think it's sustainable because we think  we've changed the fundamental structure.  We haven't just lowered taxes,  we've changed taxes.  We haven't just reduced regulation, we've gotten rid  of the stuff that's on the books and slowed down the new stuff.  So,  there's structural changes that we change that we do think is sustainable.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The argument for making those corporate tax cuts permanent.  And  again, as far as the eye can see, that this is what their tax rate is going  to be.  They can plan, they can make a good long-term investment decisions  and hiring decisions.  But at the same time, now that you have these  tariffs that were introduced Mick, on steel and aluminum.  We've gotten  retaliatory measures announced by our allies Canada, Mexico and Europe.   And we're in this trade to give this trade negotiation if you will with  Canada that introduces uncertainty.  And I want to know how -- that you  kind of kind of line those two things up because again, it seems like that  the administration just snapped its fingers and said, hey we're throwing  these tariffs on steel aluminum.  And I've heard from manufacturers that  use steel and aluminum and manufacturers that export to Canada, Mexico and  Europe that that is a very, very jarring unnerving thing and they're very  worried about their businesses. </p><p>MULVANEY:  Sure, here's what I say to folks, everything the president has  done up to now has been with one goal in mind.  You heard him give his  speech there at the inauguration which is that we're going to reclaim the  American economy for American families and American workers.  And  everything that he's done up to this point has been aimed at that one  direction whether it's taxes or regulation or energy policy.  The trade  policy's the same thing, do you have to break some eggs to make an  omelette?  Absolutely.  Do you have to be tough with people in order to get  them to change their behavior?  Absolutely .  You cannot just ask other  countries to treat us better and expect them to do it.  That's not the way  that the world works but everything the president has done is designed to  help American workers and the American family and the trade policy's is  part.  And parcel of that will it be as quick to show results?  Probably  not, simply because we're dealing with foreign countries and not just  Congress on the hill.  But everything is aimed in the same direction I hope  folks give the president credit for that.  Because I think he's proven and  it has credibility when it comes to talking to people about helping  American families that's what our trade policies are doing.  Look, Canada's  an ally of ours there's no question but I don't think anybody watching this  show could make an argument that the intellectual policy practices of the  1990s are the same that should be in place today.  That's what we want to  change, we want to update the agreement with NAFTA.  We want to improve our  relations with our trade agreements with our folks overseas, that's what  this is all about. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Mick, so the tariffs on steel and aluminum they will hurt or  send prices up, well I think steel prices are up -- they're up 40% just  this year so far.  That will hurt businesses that use steel and aluminum  potentially here in the United States.  And then you talk about all the  other manufacturers that could face tariffs when they export goods to these  other nations, these ally nations.  So, can you say to them ultimately this  is a -- this is better for the United States.  But your business and your  family potentially will get hurt in the interim.  Can you say that? </p><p>MULVANEY:  Without reservation and as evidence they don't even have to  believe me, they can look at everything else that this administration has  done.  So, if you're watching this this show this morning you're wondering  was the president changed?  No, the president hasn't changed.  This is just  part and parcel of what we're trying to accomplish.  Everything else that  he has done has been good for your business, good for the business owners,  good for the folks who work there and good for the families they take that  money home too.  And the trade policies are part and parcel of that.  So, I  hope folks give the president some credit for the actions that he's already  taken.  You don't even have to believe what he says, look at what he's done  already and there's the proof that what he's doing is good for the America. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, they're going to -- but they're going to face short-term  pain in the process, is what you're saying? </p><p>MULVANEY:  Again, but that's the way the world works when it comes to  international affairs and trade policies specifically yes, there may be  some short-term pain but in a long-term American workers American families  are going to be better off.  We absolutely believe that that's what driving  everything that we do.  And in fact, his drive every driven everything that  we've done since we've been here. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I noticed that the president was tweeting over the weekend that  what within $800 billion trade deficit.  You can't -- he was -- he was --  he was tweeting about it and talk about the use of the phrase trade war.   But why not more tweeting about an actual debt that we owe and that is our  national debt more than $21 trillion and now with this omnibus spending  bill that was signed into law we're now facing $1-trillion budget deficits  every year.  What are we going to do about that rather what are you guys  going to do about that to fix it?  Other than grow in the economy faster  which again, at least in the short run it seems to be working. </p><p>MULVANEY:  Well, keep in mind there's only two things you can do to solve  that problem.  One would be to spend less and the other would be to take in  more.  And you saw some of the president's hesitation about signing an  omnibus because he is concerned about the amount of money that we're  spending.  But with Congress not being able to reduce its spending very  dramatically, we do look forward them taking up our recessions bill.  For  example, here this week when they return the focus has to be on the other  side of that equation, which is how do you grow the economy when people  make more money the government takes in more money in taxes.  In fact, it's  the only way we actually take in more real money as for you and everybody  else watching to make more money.  </p><p>So, in a healthy American economy where people are making more the  government takes in more revenue and that shrinks our deficits.  We saw  some really good, first, I know they're preliminary signs and the -- and  the receipts that we took in in April the largest receipts ever by the  United States Treasury.  I think it's more than half a trillion dollars in  this -- in this in the single month of April.  So, we're seeing some  really, really good signs.  Some benefits starting to pay off from our  policies but we will continue to focus on growing the economy, not because  it makes you more money but because it makes the government more money as  well. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know if you know the government making more money it  that sticks with people.  I'm just kidding, thank you so much Mick Mulvaney  Budget Director for President Donald Trump in the White House, thank you so  much. </p><p>Coming up, the fight for 15 at the happiest place on earth.  Workers at  Disney getting closer to making $15.00 an hour.  The latest on ongoing  negotiations between officials and union members. </p><p>Plus Steph Curry setting a mind-boggling three-point shot record during the  NBA Finals.

Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Disney plans to raise its minimum wage from $10.00  to $15.00 an hour by the year 2021.  Union representatives in Florida are  going to head to the negotiations table this week to discuss the company's  latest offer.  Some Union leaders say that Disney's plan to include new  roles that will affect how the employees are paid for worker things like  overtime, holidays and if that would change how their schedules are made.   So, the story will later continue this week.  Shares of Disney are down  about eight percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well, Jeep is driving in to a new era of car ownership.  They're launching  a subscription program.  That's going to allow drivers to use vehicles for  monthly fees.  This is part of its Jeep Wave Royalty Program.  And it comes  of course as Jeep parent company FiatChrysler is looking to expand a Jeep  brand.  Announcing on Friday plans to launch several new vehicles and  putting a pick-up truck by 2022.  The subscription service is scheduled to  be launched sometime next year.  Shares of FiatChrysler are lower in the  premarket, down about two percent.  </p><p>Well, more competition is ramping up in the ever-growing meal kit business.   HelloFresh is going to start selling meal kits in two supermarket chains  starting this Wednesday.  And these kits are going to be sold in over 600  giant food in Stop and Shop stores.  Just last month Blue Apron you may  remember begin selling their kits in Costco.  Plated started selling their  kits over at Albertsons.  There is a theme obviously on that story. </p><p>And then finally let's about, food A1 steak sauce.  Has got the perfect  gift for any father out there.  Meat scented candles. Yes, three different  fragrances for the discerning dad.  Original meat, backyard barbecue and  classic burger for $15.00 for each candle.  Dad can now get that smoky  barbecue smell without actually having to fire up the grill.  They can just  sit on the couch drink a beer and light a candle.  Shares of parent company  Craft Times are down 26 percent so far this year.  But Dagen, you have to  get them while supply lasts.  You know, Limited supply of those steak  candles, I know you're interested in that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gross.  So, his dad is getting an A1 candle.  </p><p>CARTER:  No, dad's simply not going to take an A1 candle.  My father's  dead, I think that's gross.  But why would you want your house to smell  like meat? </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I'm with you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but you're from the Midwest.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes, I mean, it's not like the smell of meat is bad if there's  meat around.  Well, I don't know, I think maybe my cat would like it  actually if I made my house smell like meat.  But sorry about that, isn't  going to happen. </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I don't like it when I barbecue and I have this smell stuck on  me.  Like, I hated on my clothes.  So, I'd rather just have firewood or  something the smell of that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe your smells like it though.  You need to check with her.  </p><p>KELLY:  I did.  She doesn't.  That's how I know I smell like that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's like, what's that smell?  It smells like charcoal.

We will show  this cringe worthy moment again and again, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors are two wins away from  another NBA Championship.  Jared Max, what a show last night.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Yes, Dagen, it was a record setting  three party hosted by Steph.  He made the most three points ever in an NBA  Finals game.  After being pushed overtime in their game one victory, the  Warriors set the tone earlier in game two.  The Cavs made their first seven  shots.  While Kevin Durant scored 26 and Klay Thompson had 20.  Steph was  the star.  Basketball fell through the nets like soft crumpets at Steph's  three party.  That broke Rey Allen's final record by (INAUDIBLE) nine  three-pointer, scored 33.  Five three's in the final quarter.  Won the  Warrior by advance court the Cavs by nine.  Golden State wins 122-103.   Third year in a row they lead the Finals to nothing.  Game three, Wednesday  in Cleveland.  LeBron James not the only one who wore shorts through the  Finals last night.  LeBron (INAUDIBLE) who wore the Tom Brown's suit.  The  Warriors Draymond Green went Caribbean Blue for his suit shorts.  The  Detroit Grand Prix was delayed yesterday because the pace car were crashed.

Now, his airbag deployed both were taken to  the infield and checked out and all good to go.  </p><p>And look at Alex Rodriguez last night at the Sunday night baseball.  That  was not making a comeback.  Alex, who was broadcasting the Astro's Red Sox  game through ESPN last night.  left the booth and played a little game of  catch.  But Houston's Astro's outfield J.D. Davis who throws it right back  to him.  Fun time back and forth into the crowd.  Just like they did in the  world series.  Alex Rodriguez and with his girlfriend with him to accompany  at the Minute Maid Park Jennifer Lopez also there at the game.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but she out there -- when she's sitting and stand with the  little people.  </p><p>CARTER:  She's underrated, I think.  </p><p>MAX:  Underrated? </p><p>CARTER:  She can sing, she can dance, she can act, she looks amazing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but her choices of men, is questionable.  Did he get booth? </p><p>MAX:  Yes, Alex is like you know -- for somebody who is so unpopular during  his career with the cheating and the lying about the cheating and caught  about all that.  His Q rating has been soaring since he -- </p><p>KELLY:  In the broadcast booth.  Actually, it's commentary but -- and he  doesn't actually text and drive when he is driving in the cars, because you  can crash.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, (INAUDIBLE) they were not texting that's just again, driving  on a -- </p><p>KELLY:  Joking around here. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know but driving on the race racetrack is really hard.  The  only dangerous they don't have the safety mechanisms and that corvette that  they do in the actual on any car or even the race cart car doesn't have the  same safety measures that NASCAR do.  </p><p>MAX:  Have you seen that before?  Pace car crashing?  You've seen a lot of  races, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've been in a pace car.  I've gone around the Daytona track in  the pace car.  Generally, they only let former racecar drivers drive the  car, I thought.  But who knew?  Mistake. </p><p>CARTER:  Whoopsies. </p><p>MAX:  Then, you have to clean up $300,000 car. </p><p>KELLY:  So, you guys wanted to race? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm sorry.  They should have let you clean up the debris.  Thank  you, Jared.  </p><p>MAX:  Thanks, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  Coming up everybody, the rising cost of oil  and how it could impact airline ticket prices. America is warning about  price hike details.

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, June 4th, your top stories  at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Markets extending gains from Friday a 128-point gain  on the Dow futures.  Trade worries?  Not showing up in the market.  Stocks  rally on Friday following that much better than expected jobs' report.  The  unemployment rate falling again at an 18-year low.  We have 219-point gain  on the blue chips and that green is now showing up in Europe.  We have  gains across the board to report to start this week in Europe.  Same story  in Asia overnight, all four major markets there gaining this Monday.   Facebook under fire, a new report from The New York Times says the social  media giant gave users data to device makers including Apple and Samsung.   This raising new privacy concerns surrounding the company and it's weighing  on the stock down nearly 1 1/2 percent in premarket trading.  This comes as  the tech industry is facing scrutiny over censorship not just Facebook,  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes had a warning for big  tech on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES WITH MARIA\" yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIR, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I would hope  that they, you know, just don't get involved in politics and don't sensor  conservatives and Republicans, but if they continue to do it then we have  to move obviously to hearings on this issues. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We take a closer look straight ahead.  Trade turmoil, Commerce  Secretary Wilbur Ross returns from China with no deal, when it comes as our  allies ramp up their threats of retaliation over our steel and aluminum  tariffs.  And breaking news overnight, a shooting on a football field, five  people shot including a pregnant woman who had to have an emergency C- section, we have latest from Texas.  Plus, scare in the sky, a flight  forced to make an emergency landing after the plane's windshield cracked.   And a warning from American Airlines, ticket prices could go higher as that  airline faces higher fuel costs.  And former President Bill Clinton  offering his take on the impeachment debate.  He says proceedings would be  in full swing for impeachment if a Democrat was in office.  All of that and  so much more coming up this morning.  Fox News Contributor, Kat Timpf is  here, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly, and Maslansky + Partners  President Lee Carter.  Good morning.  We got one hour left.  I can't wait  to get to all of that.  President Clinton not helping the Democrats. </p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  No.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  No. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Of course.  Can I just say  something about the markets?  One of the reasons why we're seeing strong  market action this morning and we saw it actually strengthen in Friday  session is because the manufacturing numbers exceeded expectations.  I mean  we're well into expansion numbers.  I mean we were supposed to get 57-print  on the PMI numbers of manufacturing.  We got a 58 number.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But except, if you look at the front page of the Journal this  morning that global economic growth that the optimism is diming that you  have global manufacturing at a nine-month and the Baltic Dry Index that  shipping measure peaked last month, copper prices are falling, so there --  there's warning flares -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  There's -- there are some warning flares on the global side  especially because that's emanating out of Europe, and so Europe is really  weighing down the global economy, and so their strike with political  discourse.  But the problem that you're having is not here in the U.S.   We're 25 percent of the world's GDP.  We're still strengthening and so I  think that's a good thing. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And let's move onto that Facebook privacy story.  It's privacy  policy is under scrutiny again amid a new report.  This is from The New  York Times that Facebook gave phone makers, device makers like Apple and  Samsung vast access to user data.  Blake Burman is on this story in  Washington, D.C. with more.  Good morning, Blake. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hello, Dagen.  Good  morning to you as well.  Yes, we're talking about the biggest names here  Apple, Blackberry, Samsung, Microsoft, Amazon, just a handful of the  roughly 60 device makers that Facebook shared data with according to a  brand-new report our this morning from The New York Times.  The  partnerships according to the report allowed for the use of like buttons  and address books and allowed for Facebook to access the data of users'  friends without their explicit consent.  In a posting in response to the  Times article, Facebook defending itself by saying, \"These partners signed  agreements that prevented peoples Facebook information for being used for  any other purpose than to recreate Facebook like experiences, partners  could not integrate the user's Facebook features without their devices or  with their devices rather without the user's permission.\"  Now, over the  weekend, Congressman Devin Nunes was warning tech companies both of  reaching into the political arena and whether or not companies need to be  regulated. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  That brings in a whole another set of circumstances.  Are these  companies Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, etcetera, are they monopolies  and should they be reined in?  I would hope we don't have to go there. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Now, that opens the door to even more questions about Facebook,  Dagen, and user privacy when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying on Capitol Hill  just a few weeks ago.  This issue was not publicly known then, so it was  not raised either, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake, thank you for that.  Blake Burman in Washington for us.   Turning to trade tensions, the Trump administration showing no signs of  backing down after imposing sweeping tariffs on aluminum and steel imports  from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union late last week despite swift  pushback from America's allies. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  The national security  issue is not about Canada, or China, or Turkey, or any other country that  sends us aluminum or steel.  National security issue is a flood of imports  from 20 countries that are putting our aluminum and steel businesses out of  business.  And so the national security issue is basically us looking  outward defending ourselves against that flood of imports so that these  industries can thrive. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now as President and CEO of MagneGas which is focused  on the $5 billion metal cutting market, Ermanno Santilli.  Ermanno, some of  America's closest allies are calling these tariffs insulting, unacceptable  even illegal.  They're threatening retaliation lining up tariffs on goods  that we export to nations like Canada, Mexico, and Europe, how are these  tariffs going to impact your business? </p><p>ERMANNO SANTILLI, PRESIDENT AND CEO, MAGNEGAS CORPORATION:  Well, MagneGas  Corporation is profiling companies that will definitely benefit from these  tariffs.  (INAUDIBLE) MNGA, we're a small to medium-sized company.  We're  in the industrial gas sector and we have created industrial gas that is  unique, developed here in the United States.  It replaces the (INAUDIBLE)  and that's used to cut and form metal.  So clearly, if this economy in  respect to the metal and aluminum starts taking off even more so than it  already has I think MagneGas will definitely benefit and we're not alone. </p><p>KELLY:  Ermanno or Ermanno, I apologized.  How do you face shareholders and  talk about the growth going forward and the volatility around the sanctions  and your cash flows and managing really shareholder expectations because  this may be a temporal situation that only happens for a few quarters?</p><p>SANTILLI:  Well, that's a good question.  And at the end of the day, our  customers of our product are not going to stop welding.  They're not going  to stop building.  They're not going to stop producing automobiles just  because the cost of welding where it goes up by 10 percent.  I think it's  something that and if you look at the industry as a whole, I mean in --  unemployment is down 18-year low, back orders that are 14-year high,  industry really isn't that afraid about these tariffs on the whole in my  opinion. </p><p>CARTER:  Industry is not necessarily concerned but a lot of the individuals  out there are because we just heard, and Dagen -- and when Dagen's last  interview said there is going to be short-term pain for consumers.  So  while it might have an impact on jobs, do you think it's going to have an  impact on individuals? </p><p>SANTILLI:  I think it's high -- if you look at a six pack is going to go up  by a few pennies and automobile will go up by -- the price will go up by  $40.  I honestly don't think it's going to have a huge impact on other  consumers.  Frankly, I think it's all hype. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's not just -- it's not just a six pack of beer and it's  an automobile, Ermanno, it's everything that follows.  It's also the  retaliatory tariffs from all these other nations.  The administration is  looking at automobile tariffs, so if you want to buy a Kia, that Kia might  go up by several thousand dollars in cost, so when -- the sum total and  it's not just -- again, so you're admitting that consumer prices are going  to go up.  I mean Peter Navarro was on this show when these tariff were  first announced before they were ever implemented saying don't you worry  your head.  The six pack of beer is not going up that much.  But again, it  affects the entire supplier chain as well and some manufacturers are left  wondering how they're going to source their materials. </p><p>SANTILLI:  Yes.  I think that's true.  I think that there is a risk for  some retaliatory tariffs, but tariff mechanisms are used every day by every  country in the world, 50 percent of products imported in the United States  are subject to some sort of a tariff.  Now, it's not 25 percent.  It's  usually much lower.  I think the average is about 2-1/2 percent.   Retaliatory tariffs are a concern but hopefully Trump will be using this as  sort of a negotiations tool to avoid that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you have any sense?  Have you talked to anybody in the  administration at all?  Do you have a sense of when we might have more  certainty on that? </p><p>SANTILLI:  No, I have not.  I know that my customers and our suppliers,  they're just kind of rolling with it.  Prices are going up for aluminum and  steel.  But again, in our sector, we're not going to stop building just  because something goes up by a few pennies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ermanno, thank you for being here.  Ermanno Santilli, take care. </p><p>SANTILLI:  My pleasure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, President Bill Clinton ramping up his rhetoric.  The  former President arguing that impeachment hearings would have already  started if a Democrat was the commander-in-chief.  That's ahead.  Plus, a  crude awaken, American Airlines warning customers might face higher ticket  prices if oil prices stay high.  We break down the details, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At least five people including a pregnant woman shot at a  football game in Texas last night.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  Well, the pregnant  woman was shot in the chest and underwent an emergency C-section.  The baby  reportedly is OK, but the woman herself is in critical condition this  morning.  Now, this happened after two people opened fire at a football  game.  It happened in South Dallas.  There's injured at least three women  and two men.  The motive for the shooting still unclear at this point,  police are searching for the suspects in this.  Well, (INAUDIBLE) this  morning, Jordan's Prime Minister Hani Al-Mulki has resigned after several  days of protests in that country.  \"AL JAZEERA\" is reporting that Jordan's  King Abdullah asked the prime minister to step down.  These recent  demonstrations over tax increases are the biggest in years in that country  and a lot of police fired, and tear gas, and blocked roads is now the  result of these protests as it really erupted in Jordan as you can see on  your screen. </p><p>Well, an American Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing  after its windshield was shattered by a powerful hailstorm.  One passenger  able to get this picture shows.  You can see here the excessive damage to  the nose of the plane.  Luckily, the flight was able to lane safely.  No  injuries were reported.  But meanwhile, American Airlines has warning now  that a continued rise in oil prices could result in higher ticket prices  for the passengers this summer.  The spike in prices also resulting in a  somber forecast for global airline profits in general.  According to the  International Air Transport Association, the industry is expected to post a  $33.8 billion profit this year, but that's down $0.12 from the previous  forecast.  This of course due largely to rising fuel costs for the airline,  and may oil reached 730 bucks per barrel for the first time in four years.   Now, we're at 65.52.  But again, these higher prices if they continue to  the summer in particular airlines can only hedge so much, Dagen, you know  they can maybe hedge 60 percent, 70 percent, but not whole enchilada, so  your ticket may get a little pricier this summer. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  Now, all the good news for you this morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl Casone.  Coming up, President Bill Clinton  speaking out, why the former President is arguing that impeachment hearings  would have already started if a Democrat was commander-in-chief?  Plus,  tensions bubble over trade ahead of President Trump attending the G7  meeting in Canada.  We're breaking down the tariff tussle ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A different kind of double standard, former President Bill  Clinton claiming if a Democrat was in office, impeachment proceedings would  have already been happening. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think they have  tried by and large to cover this investigation based on the facts.  I think  if roles were reversed now, this is me just talking but based on my  experience.  If there were a Democratic President in these facts for  President, most people on Washington believe impeachment hearings would  have begun already. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President teaming up with author James Patterson, you saw  him there for a spy thriller, a fictitious spy thriller involving the  President of the United States.  Joining me now is Bre Payton, a staff  writer for The Federalist.  Bre, what do you make of Clinton's comments? </p><p>BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST:  Yes.  I think he's totally  wrong.  I think that if the roles were reverse and if the Republican really  were a Democrat, I don't even think that there would be an investigation at  all to be, you know, quite frank.  And, you know what, the part of his  comments that bothered me the most was at the end when he said that, you  know, the media has been covered this fairly and that their coverage of the  Mueller -- ongoing Mueller probe has been, you know, based in fact and all  of these sort of things like that.  I think that that's totally off base.   I think it's clear that a lot of members of the media are active  participants in these ongoing investigations, you know, they're not passive  recorders of history like Bill Clinton seems to think that they are. </p><p>TIMPF:  Bre, hi, it's Kat.  Why is Bill Clinton talking?  I mean do you  really think that having him out there is something that helps Democrats?   Do you think that it could be actually doing some harm? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes.  I think it could potentially be doing some harm, you know,  in the same interview when he was asked if he has ever apologize to Monica  Lewinsky, you know, throughout 20 years of having ample opportunity to do  so he said that he hadn't, you know, so I think, you know, having out there  rehashing a lot of these same things I think it just reminds everyone of  what happened 20 years ago, and how not great things were, and have been  for Democrats since then. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and then you throw in Hillary Clinton who -- I, you know,  who can't get away from a microphone.  It's like a -- there's a magnet that  what did she say in one of the recent speeches she gave in the last couple  of weeks, I'm not over it. </p><p>PAYTON:  No kidding. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which it should have been the title of her book by the way, Bre. </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes.  I definitely agree.  I think that honestly, you know, it is  time to accept the lessons of 2016 on both sides of the aisle except that  both parties are radically different now than they were three years ago.   It's not the same political environment of America.  I mean really it feels  like every day we're rehashing the same thing or rehashing November 2016  all over again.  I think it would be great if people would take the lessons  away from that, and move along, and do what they need to do. </p><p>CARTER:  You know, one of the things that I'm curious about.  I mean I know  that they did covered, did you apologize to Monica Lewinsky?  But this  President was known to be or may be if we were to look at it in the context  of how would be perceived today, his behavior in the Me Too movement all of  that, you know, we were talking about this earlier.  It's astounding that  wasn't brought up during this interview.  Why do you think that was? </p><p>PAYTON:  I think it wasn't brought up because I think that Bill Clinton  gets a free pass along a lot of members of the media.  I think you're  absolutely right that it is time to revisit what happened to Monica.  I  mean she was patient zero in all of this, you know, in today's modern media  and all these things like that.  I definitely think that her story needs to  be retold and revisited, and, you know, I think that the fact that they  didn't ask him that and gave him a free pass on that goes to show you that  the media definitely has a double standard, and that if the roles were  reversed that things would not at all be the same. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And now, Bre, I point to the fact that Town &amp; Country invited  Monica Lewinsky to this event and then disinvited her once Bill Clinton  agreed to show up, and then tried to like offer her up little chicklets if  you will to get her to avoid talking about it and I think that just shows  you why -- maybe not a whole party, but that man still gets a free pass  from a lot of people. </p><p>PAYTON:  Oh, yes, absolutely.  I mean, you know, I guess in today's  environment even after we've had the Me Too movement certain victims of  sexual abuse are going to get elevated.  Their stories are going to get  elevated above others.  It's really sad that our country is so politically  divided to the point that that is a political issue as well, right?  And  that if you're a victim of a certain man, you're going to get marginalized  and pushed to the sidelines, but if you're a victim of another man, it's  going to be wall-to-wall coverage of, you know, this same thing, right?   That disparity in and off itself is not fair.  We shouldn't not have a  double standard when it comes to women who have, you know, suffered at the  hands of powerful men. </p><p>KELLY:  Bre, it's Kevin Kelly here.  And I think the kind of looming  situation about Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton keep going out to talk  about themselves and what happened in November 2016 is overshadowing the  Democrats especially going into this midterm elections, do you think would  -- the Clintons are doing is counterproductive to helping the Democrats in  the elections coming up? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, absolutely.  I mean I think it's very clear that the base of  the Democratic Party has moved past the Clintons.  So, you know, I think it  would behoove the Democratic Party if they would picked up on that queue,  you know, and would say, OK, it's very clear that our voters do not like  these people.  Let's move on and figure out what they do like who they do  want to see on the ticket coming forward who they do want to see on the TV  and what issues that they actually do care about.  It's very clear that  Democrats honestly don't care about many of the factions of the people that  they try to pretend to care about or say that they care about, and I think  this is just another example of that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So this spy political thriller that President Clinton worked on  with James Patterson, it involves cyber espionage and a traitor in the  White House, is this a commentary on the current political environment  according to Clinton and corner -- and based on what you said, Bre, about  the division in this country? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes.  I definitely think it could be a not so subtle, you know,  swipe at what's going on, you know, I personally I'm kind of tired of  fictionalized stories that are kind of rift from the headlines especially  regarding this issue just because I personally feel just totally saturated,  you know, with coverage of this.  I don't think that, you know, the things  that I enjoy for fiction and for pleasure reading need to have this as  well.  Personally, that's how I feel about it. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bre, good to see you.  I know that -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The outrage machine in the last week has been and I only know  how they're getting the gasoline to keep it charged up --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PAYTON:  Their perpetual revolution marches on as always. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you, Bre.  Bre Payton, as always.  So President  Trump tweeting this morning, this is my 500th day in office and we have  accomplished a lot, many believe more than any President in the first 500  days.  Kat -- that's Kat Timpf (INAUDIBLE) he lists what he accomplished,  massive tax and regulation cuts, military and vet, lower crime, and illegal  immigration, stronger boarders, judgeships, best economy and jobs ever, and  much more.  We had repeal and replace done and the savings to our country  of one trillion dollars except for one person, but it is getting done  anyway.  Individual mandate is gone and greet less expensive plans will be  announced this month, drug prices coming down and right to try. </p><p>KELLY:  He didn't bring up the wall though. </p><p>TIMPF:  Just the way that he tweets and the way that he speaks always makes  me laugh.  I don't know -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can' help it.  You can't help it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TIMPF:  Many people believe -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  But he left the wall out.</p><p>TIMPF:  He did leave the wall out. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARTER:  He did talk about borders. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, there was no wall funding and the -- for the most part  there was replacement fencing funding and the omnibus spending bill, no  restrictions on sanctuary cities in that -- in that spending bill.  So  again, but I will quote Ed Rollins he said that 20/20 bumper sticker should  be promises made, promises kept.  That's a lot of it whether you agree with  the President or not, he has gotten a lot -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARTER:  -- look forward on the healthcare.  Don't go backwards. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they've got to come up with a plan because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARTER:  They have to come up with a plan.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Those premium increases are going to get announced in October  right before people go to the polls. </p><p>CARTER:  So much forward and get something done.  Don't look back to what  happened. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You don't want Nancy Pelosi as the Speaker of the House.  </p><p>CARTER:  No.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Certainly not. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So coming up, Dell reported quarterly earnings before the bell  this morning beating revenue expectations.  We'll break down those numbers  ahead.  Plus, high stakes in the soybean industry.  We will -- you get a  live look with Connell McShane on the farm.  The impact of the tariff  tussle between the U.S. and China on the farming communities, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, June 4th.  Your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets still  gaining at 139-point gain on Dow futures right now.  We're looking at a  nice rally to start this new week.  This after stocks rallied on Friday,  after that much better-than-expected jobs' report.  Again, to point that  out, job growth accelerated last month from where it's been on average in  the last 12 months.  It's an incredible in economic expansion that's been  going on for more than nine years.  Global markets following those gains;  look at England, France, and Germany, we have gains across the board there.   And in Asia overnight, it was the same story -- buying galore.  All four  markets, major markets in Asia, up this Monday.  Nevertheless, trade  turmoil.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross returns from China with no deal  and it comes as our allies ramp up the threat of retaliation over steel and  aluminum tariffs.  The White House Trade Policy Director Peter Navarro  standing firm on the need for these tariffs.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NAVARRO:  All the president is doing is defending this country's national  security sovereignty and economic security from the flood of imports.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We look at the implications for business and markets straight  ahead.  Targeting the gas tax.  A battle looming in California over a $0.12  hike.  How it could impact the midterms as voters there, head to the polls  tomorrow?  Amazon in focus.  One analyst raising its price target to $2000  a share.  But where does it put the company in the race to one trillion  against Apple?  We will tell.  Dell arising in the premarket.  The company  reporting better-than-expected revenue.  The details, later this hour.   Targeting tariffs.  U.S. allies criticizing the Trump administration over  its latest round of tariffs ahead of the G7 summit later this week in  Quebec, Canada.  Farmers are among hardest hit because of the tariffs so  far.  Connell McShane is in Ogden, Iowa with the very latest details.  Hey,  Connell.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey there, Dagen.  Yes.  You  know, it's interesting, we want to try to make this story come to life as  much as we can -- you talk about the trade talks over the weekend, so we  come up to this soybean farm in beautiful part of Iowa.  And we're just  going to get down here and show you the rows of soybeans that are being  grown here.  And the idea when you think trade with China: look at these  rows, they won't be harvest until September that's why they're so low to  the ground.  One out of every three rows of soybeans that we're looking at,  end up going from United States, to China, eventually.  The business  numbers wise, works out to about $12 billion a year.  So, when we talk  about trade tensions in the United States, they're felt out here in Iowa.   I want to introduce you to Ron Hecht, who's out here with us, a farmer, in  Iowa, he's also on the president's advisory council for agriculture.  Ron,  thanks so much, first of all, for having you out -- having us out to your  farm -- a beautiful place.  </p><p>RON HECHT, IOWA FARMER:  Thank you.  It's a great place to be this morning.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  We were in Beijing there about a month ago or so.  And at the  time, they were telling us that some of the orders for later of the year  had actually stopped -- for soybeans coming from the United States -- but  how is your business been impacted by all of this trade talk, trade  tensions?  </p><p>HECHT:  Well, actually, the price of soybeans has gone up since the talks  started -- buyers around the rest of the world are stepping up and buying  more soybeans than they were.  So, we've -- so far, we've had a price  increase.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  How does business work?  In other words, this time of the year,  they're not normally -- the Chinese buying from United States, right, comes  later in the year?  </p><p>HECHT:  Right.  China, is a seasonal buyer.  They buy from the United  States about six months a year, during our harvest time, and then they buy  about six months a year from South America.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  From Brazil, and Argentina -- the final point, what's your big  worry in all of this?  Could they shift some that buying to the Brazilians,  to the Argentinians, and how do you see the whole thing playing out?  </p><p>HECHT:  Absolutely.  So far, so good.  Everything has been fine.  But if  they shift their purchases during their normal purchasing time from U.S. --  which is starting in September -- that could be a problem for us, and  that's when we might feel the price impact.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  So, watch these trade talks like the rest of us.   We'll be talking to Ron and some of the folks out here, Dagen, throughout  the day but that's the idea -- they're watching it like all of us but  watching it obviously a little bit more intently because this is their  livelihood.  A $12 billion a year business.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Connell, do you mind if -- I'm curious to ask Ron something can  you just -- is he making any changes in the way he's managing his farm at  all?  Has he made any -- is he changing --</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, you know, that's --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You might already know that.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's interesting.  We've talked a little bit about that off  camera, but Dagen was asking you, and just a quick answer, Ron, if you're  making any changes in the way you're managing your farm because of this?  I  know it's tough to anticipate what's next.  </p><p>HECHT:  No, I'm not really making any changes, but I'm being more watchful  of what's going on in the marketing.  But no changes are called for yet.   Actually, nothing has happened, so far.  And there is a chance that as a  result of these negotiations, it will actually be helpful for U.S. and  Chinese soybean trade.  So, it's hard to know which way to jump right now.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  And that's kind of a final point, Dagen, is that the Chinese  already charged a tax, right?  There's a 16 percent tariff on soybeans  coming out to United States into China now.  Their threat is to make 25.   But people like Ron are hoping, obviously, maybe that number at 16 goes  lower.  So, that's why they're so uncertain -- they may come out on top by  the time this is all done.  But right now, they just don't know.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said when you were talking, you do such incredible reporting.   So, I'll say that to your face, McShane.  Connell McShane, in Iowa.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  Take care.  You can catch Connell all day --  actually, for the next few days in Iowa.  Rhetoric over Trump tariffs  heating up over the weekend with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  calling the president's move an insult.  White House Economic Advisor,  Larry Kudlow, saying: we must put America first.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  Mr. Trudeau, I think he's  overreacting.  I don't want to get in the middle of that.  As a fine friend  and ally of the United States, nobody denies that.  But the point is, we  have to protect ourselves.  We must protect ourselves.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Larry Kudlow also said this is like a family squabble, a feud.   Joining me now with more about this tiff over tariffs, Brandywine Global  Portfolio Manager, Jack McIntyre.  Jack, to be clear, Friday, today, there  is no worry showing up in the stock market here at home.  </p><p>JACK MCINTYRE, GLOBAL PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BRANDYWINE:  Yes, that's correct,  because we know the U.S. economy is doing well.  There's a strong  employment report.  Right.  The risk obviously is from trade standpoint: is  it going to escalate?  I think the markets are kind of keying off Kudlow  and Mnuchin versus Navarro and Lighthizer.  As long as that's the case, I  think the equity market will do OK.  </p><p>KELLY:  Jack, you know, one of the interesting things -- it's Kevin Kelly  here.  One of the interesting things that's been a theme this year for the  markets is the rising rate environment we've seen.  We've touched 3.15 on  the 10-year treasury on an intraday basis.  What are your worries for the  fixed income markets, and are they going to be exacerbated given trade  talks, given kind of what's happening right now with our ballooning deficit  with -- as well as bunch of other -- structural things like are going to be  happening the next decade where we have to issue tons of debt?  </p><p>MCINTYRE:  Yes.  No, it's a great point.  You know, the back end of that,  about the -- budget deficit increasing trade deficit deteriorate.  I mean,  ultimately, that should be weaker or drive U.S. dollar lower, which to me  is part of the solution that would help, maybe, alleviate some of the trade  tension in there.  But so, I think -- from a fixed-income investor  standpoint.  I don't see a lot of inflation pressures building right now.   The fed is going to go slow.  I think they've kind of given as the road  map.  So, yes, yields are going to drift higher, but not to the point where  it's going to derail the U.S. economy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jack, there is a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal,  today talking about global economic -- the growth story globally is fading.   Dimming markets' optimism is the headline -- the global manufacturing, the  index there, nine-month low.  Baltic dry index, a measure of shipping  costs, down 22 percent since peak last month.  Copper prices, also down.   Can the U.S. keep growing at a clip that the Atlanta fed thinks this  quarter is going to be 4.8 percent growth which is extraordinary?  Can we  keep growing at that kind of pace if the rest of the world is slowing?  </p><p>MCINTYRE:  So, yes, I'm not sure we're going to actually print four percent  in the U.S.  But, so I think -- if you look at China, and the U.S. and  combine those, those are two big, obviously, economies where data is still  coming in better than expected.  That's why I take the other side of that  article because I think global economy still on solid footing yet Q1 was  sort of a little bit slower.  I suspect we'll see a little uptick in  growth.  I don't see global inventory overhang.  The key is, the corporate  sector CAPEX.  I suspect, we'll see CAPEX cycle tying in trade sensations,  though, that creates uncertainty in a business community, and if it  accelerates then corporate might not build up CAPEX quite to the degree  that they would absent those trade sensations.  But bottom line, I think  the global economy is still on very solid footing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, on that note, there's a survey from the National  Association of Business Economics shows many are worried about a recession,  by 2020.  Your take on that report?  Because again, a -- we're more than  nine years into this expansion.  That would be -- that would be -- a  recession by 2020 would be an expansion of 12 years.  But what's your take?   Because again, to introduce the worry of tariffs and what that will do to  business that you know, prices and business activity here in the U.S.  </p><p>MCINTYRE:  Right.  So, I don't think expansion have to die of old age.  And  the one characteristic of this expansion, as you pointed out, it's been  long.  But it's been a pretty slow expansion.  So, it's not strong but it  is long.  But you're right, there's risk from on the trade standpoint.   Clearly, if this escalates into a trade war, that's going to bring forward  the next recession.  But if I'm right about CAPEX, kind of coming to the  forefront -- and inflation not getting out of hand, because you know the  fed obviously ends up ending a lot of these expansions and if inflation  remains tame the fed won't do it this time around.  So, it is a  possibility.  It's you know, 18 months away, but I don't think it has to  happen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Jack.  Good to see you, Jack McIntyre.  The president  continues to tweet this morning, writing this: \"As has been stated by  numerous legal scholars, I have the absolutely right to pardon myself.  But  why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?  In the meantime, the  never-ending witch hunt led by 13 very angry and conflicted Democrats and  others, continues into mid-terms.\"  And he tweeted this again.  Mr.  President, are you watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA?  \"China already charges a  tax of 16 percent on soybeans; Canada has all sorts of trade barriers on  our agricultural products.  Not acceptable.\"  Because that's exactly what  Connell McShane was just talking about with that soybean farmer.  So, it  could go to 25 percent, at least that's the U.S. threat, but could it go  lower than 16 percent?  We'll be right back.  </p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER:  Welcome back to Tennis Channel  Court Report a special presentation for Fox Business.  I'm Dani Klupenger.   It was a great day for the red, white, and blue at Ronald-Garros with two  American women reaching the quarter finals for the first time in their  careers.  </p><p>Sloane Stephens' blasted in that (INAUDIBLE) off the court to punch her  ticket into the elite eight.  The U.S Open champion took the last 11 games  of the match to wrap up the impressive win in under an hour.  </p><p>Earlier, Madison Keys comfortably took care of business against Romania's  Mihaela Buzarnescu to set up a quarterfinal meeting with Yulia Putintseva  Kuznetsova.  Four aces and 17 winners for last year's finals at flushing  meadows.  </p><p>Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova renewed their rivalry, Monday, in  Harrisburg Place in the quarter, and you can watch it live on Tennis  Channel.  Our coverage from Ronald-Garros ticks the air at 5:00 a.m.  Eastern.  I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President still tweeting this morning, \"The U.S. has made  such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only win!\"</p><p>Shares of Dell, meantime, up two percent this morning, after beating first- quarter revenue expectations.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange with much more.  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Monday morning,  Dagen.  That's right, so we're watching Delta this morning -- Dell to the  upside this morning after the revenue really wowed Wall Street.  The stock  is up about two percent, so they saw the pc shipments on the rise.  In  fact, products overall, saw an increase of 22 percent.  And that's the --  that is the motherload of what they do for revenue, about 78 percent of the  revenue comes from products.  So, that's where they saw the increase of 22  percent.  Service revenue also gained and so with that, you see, it was a  winning quarter.  The stock over 52 weeks is up about 24 percent.  </p><p>And then Amazon.  When we're watching Amazon, we had some positive comments  from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  The analyst there puts a $2000 price  target.  This is the fourth time this year that he's uped his price target.   He actually is liking private label for the company.  That would include  Amazon's Echo essentials apparel, Elements nutritional supplements, but  when will it get to that trillion-dollar market cap.  Will it beat out  Apple to do so?  Well, in fact, if you want to see Amazon in the trillion- dollar market cap, it would have to trade at 2060.89, so not quite here but  -- yet, but it's had five record closes in a row, looking at a sixth this  morning.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.  </p><p>Google in hot water, and now some are calling for a probe of the tech  company in the wake of Google listing Nazism as an ideology of the  California Republican Part.  Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Pretty strong stuff I'd say.   When you're bandying about labels like Nazis and a South Carolina State  Senator -- or North Carolina State Senator was called a bigot.  That was  stamped across her picture.  This is all part of the Google picture at the  moment, and I think is one of the reasons, why Google is underperforming  the other tech stocks.  You may notice, Dagen, that recently, Microsoft  passed Google in terms of overall market value.  That was a surprise.  And  there's other things going on as well.  I remember the \"60 Minutes'\" piece  one week ago, where -- well, it emerged that Google is watching you, knows  everything about you, but who is watching Google?</p><p>Well, now, Representative Devin Nunes says, look, you're operating like a  monopoly.  Keep going like this and we're going to have hearings into you.   Well, that's interesting because that's a real threat to Alphabet's  business, Google's business going forward.  It's profitability going  forward, I think they're pressing for the breakup of the company.  This is  something to watch, because big tech is so powerful, they're just asking  the politicians to rein them in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they've gotten away with a lot in recent years, and we just  sat back and did nothing.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart, great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY:  You, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Always, my dear Sir, 9:00 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday,  Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  You can't miss a minute.</p><p>Coming up, a fight over California's $0.12 gas tax intensifies.  We head  live to Orange County, California where a midterm battle to repeal the  state's gas tax is brewing.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A midterm battle over California's $0.12 gas tax is brewing.   Hillary Vaughn is live in Orange County, California with the very latest.   Hey, Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Dagen.  Well,  National Democrats tell me their pathway to the majority in November runs  right here through California.  They are targeting 10 seats in the state,  four right here in Orange County, but National Republicans says this, $0.12  tax -- gas tax increase at the pumps that state Democrats pushed through is  actually going to pump the brakes on their road to victory in November  because Republicans say it's energizing their base.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MATT GORMAN, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, RNC:  There's a lot of energy on the  Republican side.  People want to talk about how Democrats are enthused.   Well, I don't see Democrats marching in the streets overpaying upwards of  $5.00 a gallon for gasoline.  And I think this is going to resonate with  voters not just now but as well in the fall.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  Voters are so fired up over this gas tax issue that one state  senator is facing a recall vote tomorrow to kick him out of office for  voting for the tax.  But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is  convinced voters aren't going to be worried about rising transportation  costs when weighing who to support for Congress and instead are focused on  what's happening in D.C.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDREW GODINICH, SPOKESMAN, DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN  COMMITTEE:  I  think that when voters are going to the polls this week, the issues that  they are thinking about when they're voting for Congress are the issues  that they're seeing coming out of Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  There is one tax Democrat say voters are worried about the GOP tax  plan that they say has hit voters in California the hardest.  The  California Republican leadership says Democrats in the state are to blame  for the high taxes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JIM BRULTE, CHAIRMAN, CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY:  I think there's a  collective Democrat strategy to blame Washington, D.C., and Donald Trump  for all of the ills in California.  The fact of the matter is the Democrats  own California, they've had total control of it for over seven years, and  they don't want to take credit for their record here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  Dagen, this $52-billion tax plan is meant to push cars off the  road, but the GOP hopes it will push Democrats off the ballot in November.   Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Hillary.  Hillary Vaughn for us in Orange County,  California.  Coming up, final thoughts from our all-stars.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A giant fake hug to Kevin Kelly and Lee Carter for being with me  this morning.  So much to talk about trade, but these markets are loving  what's coming out of Washington, at least so far.  That does it for  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is up right now.  Stuart, it is  all yours, Sir.</p><p>VARNEY:  All right.  We're off and we are running this Monday morning.   Looks like kind of a follow on from last week.  Good morning, everyone.   Our allies are united on this, they don't like the tariffs we're imposing  on them.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

We'll see Cheryl and Tracy later this morning. Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, June 4th. Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Markets extending gains, we have a triple digit gain on the Dow Futures this morning. So we're looking at a rally to start this week. This after stocks did just that on Friday following the better than expected jobs report, 219-point gain on the Blue Chips on Friday.</p><p>And global markets following those gains this Monday in Europe, we have green across the board, the biggest winner being the FT-100 in England up seven-tenths of one percent. And in Asia overnight take a look at the picture across the four major markets there, it was buying galore. The Hang Seng and Hong Kong gaining 1.6 percent.</p><p>Facebook under fire, a new report from the New York Times says that the social media giant gave users data to device makers including Apple and Samsung, this raising new privacy concerns surrounding the company. And it comes as the tech industry faces scrutiny over censorship. House Intelligence Committee Chairman had a big warning for big tech on Sunday Morning Futures with Maria yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I would hope that they, you know, just don't get involved in politics and don't censor conservatives and republicans. But if they continue to do it, then we have to move obviously to hearings on these issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We take a closer look straight ahead. Trade turmoil, Commerce Secretary Wilber Ross returning from China with no deal, it comes as our allies ramp up their threats and criticism, threats of retaliation over steel and aluminum tariffs.</p><p>The rising cost of oil set to hit flyers, American Airlines warning that it's going to raise airfares. We take a look at whether this is the beginning of a broader trend.</p><p>Former President Bill Clinton offering his take on the impeachment debate, he says proceedings would be in full swing if democrat was in the White House.</p><p>A surprise celebrity appearance at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School's graduation, Jimmy Fallon giving a heartfelt, emotional commencement speech honoring the victims of that shooting in Parkland, Florida.</p><p>Plus, SpaceX launching a satellite overnight but it's not all success, the company announces a delay to its space tourism plans.</p><p>All of that and so much more coming up this morning, Fox News Contributor, Kat Timpf is here, I thank her first thing for getting up so early for us. Benchmark Manager Partner, Kevin Kelly. And Maslansky &amp; Partners President, Lee Carter. Welcome one and all, I can't hear what --</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- you two have to say about this Facebook story.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Yes. Oh my God.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So that's our -- that's our first topic this morning. We're going to -- I want to tease a little bit of what's coming up.</p><p>Also joining us this morning on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, the Office of Management Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney. Tennessee Congresswoman, Senate Candidate Marsha Blackburn. And Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Don't miss any of those fine folks.</p><p>But first to our top story, Facebook on the defensive once again this morning, this time after investigation by the New York Times reveals the scope of data sharing deals that the social media giant struck with at least 60 device makers including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft over the last decade. According to the Times, the partnerships allowed the companies to access user's personal data as well as information of their friends even if they specifically block Facebook from sharing that information with third parties.</p><p>For its part, Facebook is defending the data sharing as consistent with its privacy policies. Official say they're not aware of any abuse by these companies. Kevin Kelly, your take on this report. So to be clear, with the Cambridge Analytica scandal and what Facebook was doing from 2007 past 2014, they were letting app developers access the data of friends -- of friends of friends.</p><p>KELLY: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is different, this is device makers and we did -- until this report by the New York Times, we had no idea that they were up to this in such a broad scale.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. And one of the concerning issues is that this actually goes against a 2011 decree they had with the FTC and part of the problem we're having here that this one against what people -- what people opted into saying, \"Hey, you cannot share my information with third parties.\"</p><p>So, is Facebook in a sense trying to say, \"Listen, we are a phone,\" is that what we're trying to say here? If they're saying, \"We're not going against the decrees, we're not going against people's privacy,\" I think the big issue too is also security, right? Any time that Facebook allows your data information, friends of friends, any way it can be pulled out through a third party that you haven't given access to, there's security at risk and implications.</p><p>And so, I think this is -- this is a par for the course for Facebook. Their motto has always been move fast, break things. They haven't cared about loss. They -- that's been consistent with their modus operandi year- over-year especially when this come to affiliate marketing, to taking in payments in rubles. I mean, across the board they don't want to be held accountable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So Kat, with the app developers --</p><p>TIMPF: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- Facebook ended that policy in 2014 and started winding it down, but with these device makers like phone makers, Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Microsoft, and Samsung, most of the partnerships remain in effect that Facebook started winding them down in April.</p><p>TIMPF: I just don't know when there's going to be some good news coming out about Facebook. It's a bad story and there's another bad story, who else are they sharing our information with?</p><p>A lot of times you get on Facebook, you set your privacy setting a certain way and if you block that, you assume that it's not going to be shared. Now, my phone company knows more about me than I thought and I just don't even see myself even continuing to use Facebook much anymore. I barely use it as it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It does raise a lot of privacy concerns because so much information is actually store -- very private personal information is stored on the actual phone.</p><p>TIMPF: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it raises issues about how much of that information was circulating between Facebook and all of these device makers. Some device makers could retrieve personal information for even from user's friends who believe they have barred any sharing, it's really astonishing.</p><p>TIMPF: I don't -- I don't even use Facebook Messenger anymore because now I'm suspicious that maybe they're reading my messages and sharing my messages. I mean, I know that sounds ridiculous but --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I don't use it at all either.</p><p>TIMPF: But more --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I had it installed just in case -- just in case.</p><p>TIMPF: Someone messages you that you need. Right.</p><p>KELLY: Well, I think the overarching thing that we're kind of tiptoeing around is that this is going to lead to regulation. We've given them enough leash to regulate themselves which they said, \"We need to do that, you're going to hamper us. You're going to restrict us.\"</p><p>But they are stamping on and trampeding over our rights and our privacy and that's a big thing. So this is going to lead to regulation and if it's not here, we've seen it come out of Europe. So, the regulators really need to come around and figure out what they're going to do about it otherwise, Europe is going to actually do worst regulations that could actually impede it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well Kat, what -- it raises the issue of basically losing market share for Facebook. As for you, which of these social media platforms do you use the most? Because I've almost stopped using Facebook.</p><p>TIMPF: Same. I pretty much entirely use Twitter and Instagram. I basically only use Facebook, there's some family members that I keep in touch with on Facebook, so some of them are on there.</p><p>But, yes, back to the regulation thing, one I can think that concerns me about that is that it might make it harder for competitors to try to start their own app. I would love to see an alternative to Facebook at this point because so many bad things have come out about it, I don't really even really want much to do with it anymore.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well speaking of regulation, I just want to move on to the -- warning for Silicon Valley, again, from Capitol Hill. This is in the wake of Google listing Nazism as an ideology of the California Republican Party just days ahead of that states primary elections.</p><p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes says that the search giant and other big technology companies could face hearings from lawmakers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES: The best thing would be is for there to be some -- there were a new search engine that actually doesn't censor conservatives. I think there's a free market solution here if somebody can compete with Google.</p><p>If they can't, then ultimately we're looking at monopolies and then that -- you know, that brings in a whole another set of circumstances is, \"Are these companies, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, et cetera, are they monopolies? And should they be reined in?\" I would hope we don't have to go there, I would hope that they, you know, just don't get involved in politics and don't censor conservatives and republicans. But if they continue to do it, then we have to move obviously to hearings on these issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kat, the threat -- there's, again, the threat of regulation but these tech companies can't get out of their own way. The fact that Google would think that that was OK whether it was an algorithm or not, it doesn't matter because, again, it's -- it raises political bias.</p><p>TIMPF: Right, absolutely. They would never see anything like that on a liberal or the Democrat Party. There clearly is some sort of bias towards liberals democrats on some of these search engines. And the fact that Nazism is the very first thing listed, that's just makes me roll my eyes so hard that they're just going to get lost in the back of my head. I'm so sick of seeing things like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We need new emojis just for the disgust --</p><p>TIMPF: Yes. Totally.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- disgusting we feel. And to buy --</p><p>KELLY: Well --</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: I think it's really important that we talk about this because we go to Google, we go to these places because you think that it's going to be fair.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>CARTER: You think that it's just going to be, \"I want to put up a search\" and things are going to come up. And what we don't realize is that within the -- within Google, within the algorithms that are there that there's already bias. And we also have to learn and people don't realize how much people pay to get to the top of the fold and how much information is being manipulated.</p><p>KELLY: Do you remember the elections where they actually were swaying auto population of search queries for Hillary Clinton. I mean, this was completely uncovered and talked about, right?</p><p>TIMPF: (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KELLY: Right? And you -- and, yes. And even on Twitter though, there were certain things that were trending, you know, for Hillary Clinton and not for Donald Trump. So you saw this bias play out and this goes back to the federal election committees, it goes back to the FTC.</p><p>There -- I mean, this is a complex convoluted things and now we're talking about breaking up some of these companies to separating YouTube from Google, Instagram from Facebook, there's chatters happening around there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kevin, real quick, do you think that this concern is factored into Facebook stock here?</p><p>KELLY: Yes, it is. And that's why you've seen the stock actually run up because the advertising is still going that way and advertise -- digital advertising and it's growing 30 percent year-over-year. There's -- it's hard to get out of the way where advertisers are going to spend their money elsewhere.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll raise it this way, this Cambridge Analytica developer story, they could say, \"It ended in 20114, this is old.\" But you know what, this story that's in the New York Times, they only started rolling it back in April, so it didn't just end. This was going on and, again, the users did not know about it. So, it will be interesting to watch that stock today.</p><p>And we want to move to trade really quickly, the Trump Administration showing no signs of backing down from posing tariffs despite pushback from our allies, U.S. allies in China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER: The idea that we are somehow a national security threat to the United States is quite frankly insulting and unacceptable.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: In regard, this is more of a family quarrel. This is -- this is a trade dispute if you will. It can be solved. Mr. Trudeau, I think he's overreacting but the point is, we have to protect ourselves.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL: All we're doing here, all the president is doing is defending this country's national security sovereignty and economic security from the flood of imports.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm going to go to Lee on this first this is interesting language, \"It's just a family quarrel, poo-poo.\"</p><p>CARTER: Here's what --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And also, this is a national security issue, so basically you just called Canada and our European allies national security threats because of steel which by the -- I've got a lot to say about this, but go ahead.</p><p>CARTER: I have a lot to say about this because this comes down to messaging and being consistent to the American people. And one of the things that I've been watching lately is how independents are reacting especially this is really important going into the midterm elections because it's not necessarily accounted for in all of the primaries.</p><p>Independents right now are really vocalizing that they are nervous, and that they are scared about what's happening with trade. There is a huge fear of playing out of NAFTA which I talked about yesterday on Maria's show. There's a huge fear of getting into a trade war and this could really have an impact on the economy.</p><p>So going right in to the midterms right now, making these risks, making these kinds of tariffs where people are going to feel it in their pocket book. I think it's a very, very risky endeavor on the part of the administration.</p><p>TIMPF: Right. These people vote with their pocket book essentially. There's a lot of other things that matter but if this ends up affecting the economy negatively and ends up making people have less money or have to pay what is essentially a tax on mini goods, they're not going to be a big fan of that. I'm not a fan of it, I know that much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What I was going to say is steel prices are already up 40 percent this year already, about 50 percent in the last year. So steel prices have been climbing. Higher prices, it puts pressure on businesses in this country that use steel. Again, where do you source that? How -- are you going to pass along those costs to your customers?</p><p>Are you going to cut jobs? Are you going to cut wages? How are these businesses going to cope with this because this is a huge looming issue that were just dumped on top the American people and businesses.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, that's the biggest issue we're having. But at the same time, we've seen Canada has enacted protectionist policies especially when it comes to dairy, poultry, especially with timber. So I think when they're talking about a family quarrel, they're trying to address all these issues and modernize NAFTA, they've talked about that. And the negotiations haven't really gone anywhere and we've passed ALLEN: deadlines.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We shall see. That was a very nice way of putting that.</p><p>TIMPF: Yes, it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, again, it's the -- it's not just steel and aluminum tariffs, it's the retaliation that we're hearing about from Canada and Mexico and our American allies targeting those very red states.</p><p>Coming up, pain in the pump and in the skies, why American Airlines is warning about price hikes if oil prices remain high and how other airlines are reacting.</p><p>And President Bill Clinton says the only reason that President Trump is not facing impeachment hearings right now is because he's not a democrat. More on the former president's take, that's ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Breaking news right now, Russian President Vladimir Putin inviting Kim Jong-un to his country. Cheryl Casone has the details, good morning Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes Dagen. Russian media is reporting that Vladimir Putin has invited the North Korean leader to travel to Russia this fall.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reportedly passed Putin's invitation to Kim Jong-un while he was visiting Pyongyang just last week. Now, Putin wants Kim to attend the Eastern Economic Forum which is held in Vladivostok every year. Of course. Well, we shall see what happens there.</p><p>Let's follow another headline for international anyway, at least 25 people are dead, 20 were wounded following a volcanic eruption that happened in Guatemala yesterday. This is the Fuego Volcano where it erupted for the second time this year. Spewed a lot of thick smoke nearly six miles into the air. Report say that more than 3,000 people have been evacuated from their homes.</p><p>Meanwhile the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii continues to rage on leaving some residents now stranded. The area's escape route has been cut off by lava and now has left them with no power, no cell reception, landlines are even water. Authorities are planning to airlift people out if the lava continues to spread. And actually, over the weekend, three people were airlifted out of a remote area near that volcano.</p><p>Well, Microsoft reportedly agreeing to buy coding site GitHub. Some analyst say that Microsoft might pay up to $5 billion for GitHub. This, of course, would bolster Microsoft's programming tools as its trying to move toward building more open source software. GitHub said last year that it was about -- it was booking about $250 million in annual subscription revenue. This deal could be announced as early as today.</p><p>Taking a look at shares of Microsoft, higher in the premarket, up almost one percent, Dagen. And those are some of your headlines we're following. Putin and Kim Jong-un, I'm not even sure what to say about that but back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Interference by Putin in attempted manipulation of the United States once again.</p><p>CASONE: Lovely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kevin, this Microsoft-GitHub story, good for Microsoft?</p><p>KELLY: Yes, I think it's great for Microsoft. You see -- you started to see actually the transition from (INAUDIBLE) has -- he's really opened up. I mean, they've got partnerships including with other apps to have open source and its brought on users into their hybrid cloud which is growing 90 percent quarter-over-quarter.</p><p>So -- I mean, it's -- it really transitioned and opened up the company. They had to get away from the hardware business and they're now going to new software as a service company.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And really giving Amazon a run for its money in terms of the cloud computing business because that's a big grower for Amazon as well.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. And they've gone into the subscription model for their own software. If you think about Microsoft Word, all the processing, it's been unbelievable what they've been able -- the transition has been phenomenal especially if you think about kind of the boondoggles they had with trying to do their own cellphones, the (INAUDIBLE) and hardware, you didn't really have any direction, they have direction now.</p><p>CARTER: And it's fascinating to watch the turnaround of a company that, you know, could have been irrelevant if they weren't careful, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But, again, that's what Apple's trying to do with recurring revenue streams.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. And it's Apple worldwide developer conference starting today, so that all these things are going to be talked to.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love that you're up on the news Kevin.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. Try to be.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You were out of breath when you came in here earlier this morning.</p><p>KELLY: I know, because I was reading.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. OK. And by the way, if you're where I came from, it's not GitHub, it's GitHub.</p><p>Coming up, a graduation surprise from Jimmy Fallon for Stoneman Douglas High School's class of 2018, as the Florida school also celebrates the memory of those lost in that school shooting earlier this year.</p><p>And Biden, 2020, why former Vice President Joe Biden says he's willing to put his hat in the ring and when he'll make up his mind.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Rising oil prices not only hitting consumers at the gas pump, now the CEO of one airline says ticket prices are set to go up due to higher fuel cost. The price of crude oil is nearly 40 percent higher than it was one year ago off its recent highs however.</p><p>Joining me now, Price Futures Group Analyst, Fox Business Contributor, Phil Flynn. Always fired up bright and early. Phil, the warning comes from American Airlines, Doug Parker, what do you think of this and will it be the first of many?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: I think it may be. You know, a lot of these airlines were spoiled last year, they were making record profits, $38 billion in profits and they didn't think that oil prices might ever go up.</p><p>But all of a sudden, oil prices have gone up, a lot of them were not prepared for this because they believe in this lower for longer mantra and they weren't hedged correctly. Now, I don't think that prices are going to go up right away but this is a strong signal that if these oil prices say where they are and they probably will, then more than likely we're going to see those prices for tickets go up.</p><p>KELLY: Hey Phil, it's Kevin Kelly here. You know, what's pretty interesting is that OPEC is actually trying to figure out the whole production conundrum, do you think they're going to open up their spigots and actually bring more output on to the market and actually helps stabilize oil prices and really put a cap on the run-up we've seen recently?</p><p>FLYNN: Kevin, great question. Last week we heard from Saudi Arabia and Russia and they were basically signaling to the market that they were ready to raise production maybe by one million barrels of oil a day.</p><p>But as soon as they said that, the price of oil dropped like, you know, eight percent in a couple of days. And I think it scared the cartel out of them to be honest with you. So I think they may have second thoughts because today on the weekend, they basically said that they might raise production but they weren't very solid about that, they're going to be very price sensitive before they make that final decision.</p><p>CARTER: One of the questions I have is the announcement said they're necessarily going to -- they're going to have higher prices, it doesn't necessarily mean higher fares. Do you think airlines are going to go back to this?</p><p>I mean, I've been reading about people saying that they're got put -- they're going to start charging for carryon bags and other kinds of things, you think it might go into fees rather than fares?</p><p>FLYNN: I think it is. I mean, the last time prices went up, they put on a fuel surcharge on tickets, that may be a possible. But overall, we saw report from the International Air Transport Association that basically said that their profits are going to be down by 12 percent from the record that they set last year.</p><p>That's a huge drop, that's billions of dollars. So I think because of the competitive nature of airlines are going to try to keep those ticket prices down but eventually if prices stay high, eventually they're going to pass those cost on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Phil, in terms of what people are going to be paying at the pump this summer, are your estimates, have they come down recently with the drop in the cost of crude oil?</p><p>FLYNN: I think they have slightly. I mean right now the national average is about $2.95. We do expect another run-up in price right before the 4th of July which is typical. But right now we haven't hit that $3.00 a gallon area.</p><p>But the big picture for gasoline prices, the era of low gasoline prices are over. Even if prices go down, they're going to stay pretty much where they are right now. There's a very strong global economy, demand is strong. And the other thing I'm really concerned about is the cost of diesel, the truckers have really been feeling this price increase.</p><p>You know, gasoline prices are $2.50 but if you're a trucker, you're paying an average of $3.21 a gallon, that's mainly because the white oil in the U.S. doesn't produce a lot of diesel fuels and those supplies are a lot tighter than gasoline.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And those higher freight cost if you will, broadly speaking Phil, it filters through the other businesses. We've heard that from the food company Cisco just as one example. So, again, these rising prices are filtering through the economy and will show up in ways we might not expect. Phil, great to see you.</p><p>FLYNN: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much.</p><p>FLYNN: Thank you Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Phil Flynn in Chicago for us. Coming up, Bill Clinton's eyebrow-raising take on impeachment, why he says the only reason President Trump isn't facing impeachment hearings right now is because he's not a democrat.</p><p>And hooked on your smart phone, many of us are, but now Apple is set to reveal new software that is supposed to help you kick your screen addiction.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, June 4th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern. Markets extending gains, Futures pointing to a triple-digit rally at the open, 137-point gain on the Dow Futures right now. This after stocks rallied on Friday, following that better-than-expected job's report and it was a blockbuster, 219 points with the Dow gained on Friday.</p><p>And global markets following America's lead, going -- starting the new week in Europe, we have buying across the board, nearly a one percent gain on the FTSE-100 in England. In Asia overnight, same story, we have strong global markets with both the Nikkei in Japan and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong, gaining more than one percent. Former President Bill Clinton weighing in on the impeachment debate surrounding President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think if roles were reversed, if there were a Democrat President and these facts were present, most people I know in Washington believe that impeachment hearings would have begun already.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We take a closer look at those comments, straight ahead. A celebrity surprise for the graduating class of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Jimmy Fallon, giving an emotional and uplifting commencement address, this after the shooting there, earlier this year. Another strike averted in Las Vegas, the Culinary Union reportedly making a deal with MGM, we will have those details, and Apple, looking to address the growing issue of phone addiction.</p><p>Details on the announcements we're expecting from the Worldwide Developers Conference. Plus, SpaceX, launching a satellite overnight, but it's not all success. The company announcing a delay to its space tourism plans.</p><p>But to our top story this half hour, President Bill Clinton, ramping up his rhetoric, the former president arguing that impeachment hearings would have already started if a Democrat was the commander-in-chief during the current investigation on meddling by Russia into the election. Here's what President Clinton said during an interview on CBS, yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: I think they have tried, by in large, to cover this investigation based on the facts. I think if roles were reversed, now, this is me just talking based on my experience, if there were a Democratic President and these facts were present, most people I know in Washington believe impeachment hearings would have begun already.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining us is Former Ohio State Senate Minority Leader and American University School of Public Affairs Executive in Residence, Capri Cafaro, along with Former Massachusetts State Co-Chairman for Trump's Presidential Campaign and U.S. Senate Candidate for Massachusetts, Geoff Diehl. Geoff, back in 1999, the Senate voted to acquit President Clinton of both articles of impeachment. What is your take on this that he raises this issue now?</p><p>FMR. REP. GEOFF DIEHL (R-MA), MEMBER, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, MASSACHUSETTS: Well, Dagen, thank you for having me on. And I will say it's hard to believe that President Clinton is making this comment after he was given such a pass whether it was Whitewater or whether it was Travelgate, to the point where his wife ended up scrubbing his server and seemed to be getting a complete pass. So, a very ironic that he would be making these accusations.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Capri, I look at it from this point of view that, Hillary Clinton has not really been out there, campaigning in the midterm elections for the most part. She did endorse Governor Cuomo in New York, recently. And President Clinton has been largely absent but he, kind of, comes out with this whopper, and I say that because the Special Counsel investigation is still on-going, we don't have a report delivered. And he says this, that impeachment proceedings would have already been started.</p><p>FMR. SEN. CAPRI CAFARO (D), OHIO: Look, I think that, you know, President Clinton, he is somebody -- obviously, he's gone through this before, personally, his wife loss, so I think that there's just a little bit of, maybe, a bad taste in his mouth, if you will, over this whole impeachment thing.</p><p>I think that, you know, he's gone through this before and I think that the only point, frankly, that I think President Clinton is making, is that, you know, if it was a Democratic President and a Republican Congress, maybe it would have been done, and vice versa.</p><p>Look, there's a lot of concern that if the Democrats take back the House, that they could start the impeachment process. So, unfortunately, what has happened with impeachment, is that it's become a political hammer more than a legal proceeding, and that's a problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Given what his impeachment was -- the impeachment proceedings on President Clinton what they were related to, it was kind of curious that he wasn't pressed on his thoughts on the Me Too Movement even what -- even what -- you know, raised the issue, again, of what Kirsten Gillibrand, the Senator, said about President Clinton, that he should have resigned and we have gotten some commentary from him on that recently, but your take on that because, again, if you're going to -- if you're going to talk about impeachment, let's talk about all of it, Capri.</p><p>CAFARO: You know, I think we also need to put some context into this interview. Apparently, Bill Clinton just wrote some, sort of, a political thriller with John Patterson.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>CAFARO: So, I mean, he's doing these interviews as part of a book tour. But sure, I mean, I've always said, you have got to be equitable in these conversations whether you're a Democrat or a Republican. If you're going to have the conversations surrounding this, then, sure, I mean, be fair and have a conversation about the reasons behind impeachment, which were not just Monica Lewinsky, but frankly, about lying, you know, as part of a deposition, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it was related to the Lewinsky affair. I mean, the charges were directly related to that.</p><p>CAFARO: Right, of course, of course. I mean, again, I think that -- you know, the Clintons, frankly, and I say this as a Democrat, and I love Bill Clinton as a president, I'm not -- I was not really crazy about Hillary Clinton, but the Clintons are part of the past and we need to move forward and redefine the Democratic Party and stop continuing to go back and relitigate things from the 1990s, we need to move forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to -- President Clinton also weighed in on the mainstream media bias allegations when President Obama was in office. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON: They did treat him differently than other Democrats and Republicans because they --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why?</p><p>CLINTON: That was the political press. You know, I don't know. They liked him. And they liked having the first African-American president, and he was a good president, I think.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to get your thoughts on this, Geoff, because, again, he's -- weighing in on some very serious topics. And he definitely seems upset about the way that he was treated toward the end of his presidency, whether it was the impeachment proceeding and the big picture, how does this -- does this help Republicans and hurt Democrats, going into November?</p><p>DIEHL: Well, I will say that Bill Clinton is absolutely right that President Obama was given a pass on many things as well, fast and furious, Benghazi, which was a combination of Hillary Clinton and President Obama's administration. They seemed -- the press seemed to just continually ignore and white-wash all that was going on there.</p><p>Now, at the same time, Donald Trump can't seem to catch a break, the DOJ, the FBI, the IRS of his weaponized against conservatives for the last, I don't know how many years, and all of this pointing to, you know, collusion within the government, you know, trying to keep Republicans from having any success. So I think, again, Bill Clinton needs to, probably, moderate his conversation about, you know, unfairness and talk about the fact that, I think, even President Trump is being treated unfairly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Capri, I just did want to point out that President Clinton did was, he was asked about the Kirsten Gillibrand, saying that he should resign and his response was, kind of, it was all over the place, you know she's living in a different context, and she did it for different reasons, so I just disagree with her, he said, during that -- during that interview. We just didn't play the clip, but what were you going to say?</p><p>CAFARO: What is he going to say? I mean, what does someone say to that? I mean, Kirsten Gillibrand is obviously angling to run for President in 2020 and, certainly, she wanted to, you know, capture on that Me Too Movement and take a stand. But what is President Clinton going to say, yes, I should have resigned?</p><p>I mean, you know, he's in a -- he's in a tough spot, but I think -- but I think the conversations that we are having here is why is President Clinton, maybe, not having an honest of a dialogue as I think people are, maybe, hoping from him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Philippe Reines called Kirsten Gillibrand, a hypocrite. But President Clinton could've done that and said, given new support that she got from the Clintons, maybe that's one word he could've used.</p><p>CAFARO: That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Meantime, Former Vice President Joe Biden, isn't ruling out a 2020 Presidential bid, while he continues to campaign for other Democrats, Biden's team is said to be outlining what his campaign could look like and will likely decide by the end of the year, if he will run. This is according to reporting by NBC News, Capri, your reaction to this?</p><p>CAFARO: You know, well, I said earlier, we need to move forward and we need to have some new blood into the Democratic Party. Our bench is actually pretty weak and, you know, I come from the State from Ohio, a guy like Joe Biden, really connects with, you know, my people, in the Rust Belt, you know, coming from Scranton, he's a straight shooter, and while he is old, so is President Trump, I think that Joe Biden regrets not running in 2016, a lot of, could have, would have, should have, there.</p><p>And I think that he has a better shot than some of the more progressive names that we're hearing, like Elizabeth Warren and the like. So, it's not an ideal situation, but, you know, if Joe Biden does run, he would be certainly somebody that I would support because I think he could connect with those Trump crossover Democrats.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Geoff, he's certainly somebody who can talk to people who don't live on the East Coast and major cities and, basically, Los Angeles and San Francisco. He does know how to talk to every man and every woman.</p><p>DIEHL: Yes. No, Dagen, and I think it was interesting, my opponent, Elizabeth Warren, was in Ohio just a few weeks ago, stumping for a Democratic governor's candidate because she's trying to grease these kids for a 2020 run, obviously, but showing that Joe Biden is out there and thinking that he has a chance of running, I think, is a good example of why Elizabeth Warren has no chance to becoming the nominee for 2020. She's done nothing for Massachusetts, no credits, nothing to take credit for.</p><p>And now, she's basically wants re-election so she can spend two more years doing nothing for Massachusetts, that's why I'm running this race to make sure that people know they have a choice in November, to have someone who's going to work for them down in Washington D.C., versus someone who doesn't even have a chance to run in 2020.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Capri, it's good to see you as always. Capri Cafaro --</p><p>CAFARO: Absolutely. Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Geoff Diehl, thanks for coming on. Coming up --</p><p>DIEHL: Thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Breathing a sigh of relief, workers, striking a tentative deal with another Las Vegas casino, days after threat of a massive walkout, details on the plan, ahead, and another success for launch for SpaceX's Falcon 9 earlier this morning, but a major setback for SpaceX's intergalactic tourism plans, more on the failure to launch, coming up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A surprise speech for Stoneman Douglas High School graduates. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Dagen. So, the surprise commencement speaker was \"Late Night\" Host, Jimmy Fallon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY FALLON, COMEDIAN AND HOST: You won't be classmates anymore. You'll be -- (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FALLON: When something feels hard, remember that you get better. Choose to move forward. Don't let anything stop you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: It's quite a moment there. Fallon continue, though, of course, to provide some comic relief and then, of course, show that heart felt message of hope to the students there. The graduation coming months after the shooting in Parkland that left 17 people dead; four students killed would've graduated yesterday.</p><p>Well, a crisis averted for MGM Resorts. It has raised tentative labor agreement with an employee union. MGM joins Caesars Entertainment in approving new five-year contracts with union workers -- avoiding what could have been a major disruption in business as game five of the Stanley Cup finals is returning to Vegas this week. Of course, here are those employees celebrating in that video. Details of the agreement, not disclosed but casino workers have been asking for an increase in wages and benefits for the last several weeks.</p><p>And then finally this, another successful launch overnight for SpaceX's Falcon 9, the rocket carrying a massive communication satellite. This is going to bring data and broadband services to Asia, Australia, and the Middle East taking off. This is Falcon 9's 11th launch this year. Meanwhile, more news, Elon Musk's big plans for space tourism are being put on hold. SpaceX announcing that its mission to fly tourists around the moon will not likely happen until 2019 due to technical and production problems. Next year, OK. Most previously, he said he'd hoped to launch the first test flights by the end of this year. So, next year going to the moon, Dagen, or so he says. I don't know. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Might want to worry about the car company.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CARTER: Energy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love it. Like, we're going to the moon but this electric car, this inexpensive electric car.</p><p>CASONE: That Model 3.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Struggling with that one. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet. Coming up, kicking your smart phone addiction with help from Apple. The tech giant expected to reveal big news today about the latest software update that could help you reduce your screen time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Attention iPhone addicts, Apple is reportedly unveiling new software to help consumers digitally detox. According to published reports the feature is called digital health and will help users limit their screen time. This comes as the tech giant will hold its annual worldwide developers conference in San Jose today and outline its software strategy for the next year.</p><p>Joining me now is Trends Expert, Futurist, CEO of TechSavvy Global and the Author of \"Make Change Work for You\", Scott Steinberg. Scott, Apple changed the smartphone industry and now they're helping tools create -- creating tools to help you break iPhone habit. Why are they doing this now?</p><p>SCOTT STEINBERG, CEO, TECHSAVVY: Well, as you might imagine, Apple has sold in billions of devices, people love these things. The question is: how the heck do we get them off them? Companies like Google on their android devices have already introduced digital wellness tools, so it's only natural fit giving increasing calls and pressure for Apple to cut down on people's smartphone addictions, for them to put it timers, screen time limits, even apps that will prevent you from accessing your favorite applications during the day at work. So, maybe you can break that Candy Crush Saga addiction a little bit.</p><p>KELLY: Scott, aren't we already moving away from this with the proliferation of these things, devices, as well as the virtual assistance that we're having like home pods? Aren't people moving away from using their actual device and starting to use other devices or other things? And Apple is actually behind in that regard. I mean, their virtual assistance: Siri has lost way to Alexa. I mean, is that where we're headed?</p><p>STEINBERG: Well, we're definitely seeing people play with the variety of different devices. They're splitting their time between different screens and even as you pointed out, on devices that is don't have a screen -- Siri and the home pod, some of the smart speakers has fallen a big behind where Google and Amazon are. In fact, at Worldwide Developers Conference, you can probably hear Apple talk a little bit about what the future of Siri is going to hold. They need to make the service a little bit smarter, they need to talk about integrations with different devices from speakers to headphones and even cars, and perhaps they'll even open up the platform, the Siri platform so that other developers can create all sorts of fun applications and new uses for it, but they definitely are playing catch-up on that front and people are definitely using more devices across the board. So, should be an exciting day in terms of news.</p><p>CARTER: You know, it did seem that Apple was always ahead of the curb, that Apple was the model. Whenever I had a client, they said I want to be more like Apple as far as innovation goes. It seems like they're falling behind with their launches, they're getting more bugs, and it seems, you know, in all of these things, do you think they're going to make a big announcement that's going to help create a vision for the future?</p><p>STEINBERG: I think absolutely, you're going to see Apple paint a picture of what's coming next. And I wouldn't count them out of the game at any time -- as we've seen in timeless times in the past, bouncing back. I think this year, the focus is going to be more on software than hardware devices, though. Some of the big surprise reveals may surround the introduction of Apple T.V. as a video streaming service, more like Hulu and Netflix. And in fact, one of the buzzes, that everybody is talking about, is the fact that maybe pretty soon, you'll be able to run an iPhone and iPad apps right there seamlessly on Mac computers, seamlessly integrating computers and smart phones more going forward. So, I think they'll have some pretty exciting announcements. And they'll probably touch on Siri and privacy issues as well and draw and hardline stance. Unlike companies like Google and Facebook, Apple is more in the business of selling hardware, not users data -- the marketer. So, I think you'll hear about that as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, let me raise an issue with you, Scott, because there's this big story that the New York Times reported, an investigative story that Facebook gave device makers deep access to data on users and friends, and one of those named is Apple. So, Apple has been quite bias about not selling your information, protecting your own information if you're Apple customer. But they seem -- and this is a question all too willing to take information on individuals if it's coming through another company. Tim Cook has gone after Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg has pushed back on that. So, it raises an issue about a little bit of hypocrisy at Apple.</p><p>STEINBERG: Well, who knows what the heck is going on behind closed doors. But keep in mind for Apple, it's not necessarily about selling information onto marketers. They have services like Siri that are powered by artificial intelligence, and the more data you have on users, the smarter and better the services get. So, I think Apple probably isn't as extensive users of people's personal private data as many other companies may be. But of course, in some cases, it may be the pop calling the kettle back. There's a lot of jousting going on out there in the media as you might imagine.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Wall Street Journal also had a story about a new level of security on your business trip, Scott, what do you make of that in terms of the invasion maybe of your employer in tracking your, tracking your movements when you're traveling for work?</p><p>STEINBERG: Well, there's some duty of care there. You have to keep in mind that any time a business sends you out on a trip in many countries, they're taking a risk, they have a responsibility to exercise reasonable care in terms of knowing where you are and making sure you have updates and alerts, information on the areas in which you'll be traveling, and also provide emergency relief. And of course, we live in an increasingly unpredictable world so people have bigger concerns as. They're worried about terrors, and they're worried about crime, they're even worried more natural disaster. So, it's only a natural step forward that more companies would be tracking this information and introducing these policies.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Scott, great to see you. Thank you so much. I hope any Apple T.V. thing is better than that Amazon, the one I've got which basically blew up over the weekend. So, thank you for that, Scott Steinberg. Marking 500 days in office for President Trump. I talked to his budget director when we come back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018060401cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SGG-YNH1-JB20-G4M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 4, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001TIV</classCode><className>AMERICAN AIRLINES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Benchmark Manager Partner, Kevin Kelly.  And Maslansky &amp; Partners  President, Lee Carter.  Welcome one and all, I can't hear what --</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- you two have to say about this Facebook story.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Yes.  Oh my God.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So that's our -- that's our first topic this morning.  We're  going to -- I want to tease a little bit of what's coming up.</p><p>Also joining us this morning on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, the Office of  Management Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney.  Tennessee Congresswoman, Senate  Candidate Marsha Blackburn.  And Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge  Andrew Napolitano.  Don't miss any of those fine folks. </p><p>But first to our top story, Facebook on the defensive once again this  morning, this time after investigation by the New York Times reveals the  scope of data sharing deals that the social media giant struck with at  least 60 device makers including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft over the last  decade.  According to the Times, the partnerships allowed the companies to  access user's personal data as well as information of their friends even if  they specifically block Facebook from sharing that information with third  parties.  </p><p>For its part, Facebook is defending the data sharing as consistent with its  privacy policies.  Official say they're not aware of any abuse by these  companies.  Kevin Kelly, your take on this report.  So to be clear, with  the Cambridge Analytica scandal and what Facebook was doing from 2007 past  2014, they were letting app developers access the data of friends -- of  friends of friends.</p><p>KELLY:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is different, this is device makers and we did -- until  this report by the New York Times, we had no idea that they were up to this  in such a broad scale.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And one of the concerning issues is that this actually goes  against a 2011 decree they had with the FTC and part of the problem we're  having here that this one against what people -- what people opted into  saying, \"Hey, you cannot share my information with third parties.\"</p><p>So, is Facebook in a sense trying to say, \"Listen, we are a phone,\" is that  what we're trying to say here?  If they're saying, \"We're not going against  the decrees, we're not going against people's privacy,\" I think the big  issue too is also security, right?  Any time that Facebook allows your data  information, friends of friends, any way it can be pulled out through a  third party that you haven't given access to, there's security at risk and  implications.</p><p>And so, I think this is -- this is a par for the course for Facebook.   Their motto has always been move fast, break things.  They haven't cared  about loss.  They -- that's been consistent with their modus operandi year- over-year especially when this come to affiliate marketing, to taking in  payments in rubles.  I mean, across the board they don't want to be held  accountable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So Kat, with the app developers --</p><p>TIMPF:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- Facebook ended that policy in 2014 and started winding it  down, but with these device makers like phone makers, Amazon, Apple,  Blackberry, Microsoft, and Samsung, most of the partnerships remain in  effect that Facebook started winding them down in April.  </p><p>TIMPF:  I just don't know when there's going to be some good news coming  out about Facebook.  It's a bad story and there's another bad story, who  else are they sharing our information with?</p><p>A lot of times you get on Facebook, you set your privacy setting a certain  way and if you block that, you assume that it's not going to be shared.   Now, my phone company knows more about me than I thought and I just don't  even see myself even continuing to use Facebook much anymore.  I barely use  it as it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It does raise a lot of privacy concerns because so much  information is actually store -- very private personal information is  stored on the actual phone.</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it raises issues about how much of that information was  circulating between Facebook and all of these device makers.  Some device  makers could retrieve personal information for even from user's friends who  believe they have barred any sharing, it's really astonishing.</p><p>TIMPF:  I don't -- I don't even use Facebook Messenger anymore because now  I'm suspicious that maybe they're reading my messages and sharing my  messages.  I mean, I know that sounds ridiculous but --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I don't use it at all either.</p><p>TIMPF:  But more --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I had it installed just in case -- just in case.</p><p>TIMPF:  Someone messages you that you need.  Right.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, I think the overarching thing that we're kind of tiptoeing  around is that this is going to lead to regulation.  We've given them  enough leash to regulate themselves which they said, \"We need to do that,  you're going to hamper us.  You're going to restrict us.\"  </p><p>But they are stamping on and trampeding over our rights and our privacy and  that's a big thing.  So this is going to lead to regulation and if it's not  here, we've seen it come out of Europe.  So, the regulators really need to  come around and figure out what they're going to do about it otherwise,  Europe is going to actually do worst regulations that could actually impede  it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well Kat, what -- it raises the issue of basically losing market  share for Facebook.  As for you, which of these social media platforms do  you use the most?  Because I've almost stopped using Facebook.</p><p>TIMPF:  Same.  I pretty much entirely use Twitter and Instagram.  I  basically only use Facebook, there's some family members that I keep in  touch with on Facebook, so some of them are on there.</p><p>But, yes, back to the regulation thing, one I can think that concerns me  about that is that it might make it harder for competitors to try to start  their own app.  I would love to see an alternative to Facebook at this  point because so many bad things have come out about it, I don't really  even really want much to do with it anymore.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well speaking of regulation, I just want to move on to the --  warning for Silicon Valley, again, from Capitol Hill.  This is in the wake  of Google listing Nazism as an ideology of the California Republican Party  just days ahead of that states primary elections.</p><p>House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes says that the search  giant and other big technology companies could face hearings from  lawmakers.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  The best thing would be is for there to be some -- there were a new  search engine that actually doesn't censor conservatives.  I think there's  a free market solution here if somebody can compete with Google.  </p><p>If they can't, then ultimately we're looking at monopolies and then that --  you know, that brings in a whole another set of circumstances is, \"Are  these companies, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, et cetera, are they  monopolies?  And should they be reined in?\"  I would hope we don't have to  go there, I would hope that they, you know, just don't get involved in  politics and don't censor conservatives and republicans.  But if they  continue to do it, then we have to move obviously to hearings on these  issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kat, the threat -- there's, again, the threat of regulation but  these tech companies can't get out of their own way.  The fact that Google  would think that that was OK whether it was an algorithm or not, it doesn't  matter because, again, it's -- it raises political bias.</p><p>TIMPF:  Right, absolutely.  They would never see anything like that on a  liberal or the Democrat Party.  There clearly is some sort of bias towards  liberals democrats on some of these search engines.  And the fact that  Nazism is the very first thing listed, that's just makes me roll my eyes so  hard that they're just going to get lost in the back of my head.  I'm so  sick of seeing things like that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We need new emojis just for the disgust --</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  Totally.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- disgusting we feel.  And to buy --</p><p>KELLY:  Well --</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  I think it's really important  that we talk about this because we go to Google, we go to these places  because you think that it's going to be fair.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>CARTER:  You think that it's just going to be, \"I want to put up a search\"  and things are going to come up.  And what we don't realize is that within  the -- within Google, within the algorithms that are there that there's  already bias.  And we also have to learn and people don't realize how much  people pay to get to the top of the fold and how much information is being  manipulated.</p><p>KELLY:  Do you remember the elections where they actually were swaying auto  population of search queries for Hillary Clinton.  I mean, this was  completely uncovered and talked about, right?</p><p>TIMPF:  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>KELLY:  Right?  And you -- and, yes.  And even on Twitter though, there  were certain things that were trending, you know, for Hillary Clinton and  not for Donald Trump.  So you saw this bias play out and this goes back to  the federal election committees, it goes back to the FTC.</p><p>There -- I mean, this is a complex convoluted things and now we're talking  about breaking up some of these companies to separating YouTube from  Google, Instagram from Facebook, there's chatters happening around there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin, real quick, do you think that this concern is factored  into Facebook stock here?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, it is.  And that's why you've seen the stock actually run up  because the advertising is still going that way and advertise -- digital  advertising and it's growing 30 percent year-over-year.  There's -- it's  hard to get out of the way where advertisers are going to spend their money  elsewhere.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll raise it this way, this Cambridge Analytica developer  story, they could say, \"It ended in 20114, this is old.\"  But you know  what, this story that's in the New York Times, they only started rolling it  back in April, so it didn't just end.  This was going on and, again, the  users did not know about it.  So, it will be interesting to watch that  stock today.</p><p>And we want to move to trade really quickly, the Trump Administration  showing no signs of backing down from posing tariffs despite pushback from  our allies, U.S. allies in China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUSTIN TRUDEAU, CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER:  The idea that we are somehow a  national security threat to the United States is quite frankly insulting  and unacceptable.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL:  In regard, this is more  of a family quarrel.  This is -- this is a trade dispute if you will.  It  can be solved.  Mr. Trudeau, I think he's overreacting but the point is, we  have to protect ourselves.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  All we're doing here, all  the president is doing is defending this country's national security  sovereignty and economic security from the flood of imports.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm going to go to Lee on this first this is interesting  language, \"It's just a family quarrel, poo-poo.\"</p><p>CARTER:  Here's what --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And also, this is a national security issue, so basically you  just called Canada and our European allies national security threats  because of steel which by the -- I've got a lot to say about this, but go  ahead.</p><p>CARTER:  I have a lot to say about this because this comes down to  messaging and being consistent to the American people.  And one of the  things that I've been watching lately is how independents are reacting  especially this is really important going into the midterm elections  because it's not necessarily accounted for in all of the primaries.</p><p>Independents right now are really vocalizing that they are nervous, and  that they are scared about what's happening with trade.  There is a huge  fear of playing out of NAFTA which I talked about yesterday on Maria's  show.  There's a huge fear of getting into a trade war and this could  really have an impact on the economy.</p><p>So going right in to the midterms right now, making these risks, making  these kinds of tariffs where people are going to feel it in their pocket  book.  I think it's a very, very risky endeavor on the part of the  administration.</p><p>TIMPF:  Right.  These people vote with their pocket book essentially.   There's a lot of other things that matter but if this ends up affecting the  economy negatively and ends up making people have less money or have to pay  what is essentially a tax on mini goods, they're not going to be a big fan  of that.  I'm not a fan of it, I know that much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What I was going to say is steel prices are already up 40  percent this year already, about 50 percent in the last year.  So steel  prices have been climbing.  Higher prices, it puts pressure on businesses  in this country that use steel.  Again, where do you source that?  How --  are you going to pass along those costs to your customers?</p><p>Are you going to cut jobs?  Are you going to cut wages?  How are these  businesses going to cope with this because this is a huge looming issue  that were just dumped on top the American people and businesses.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, that's the biggest issue we're having.  But at the same time,  we've seen Canada has enacted protectionist policies especially when it  comes to dairy, poultry, especially with timber.  So I think when they're  talking about a family quarrel, they're trying to address all these issues  and modernize NAFTA, they've talked about that.  And the negotiations  haven't really gone anywhere and we've passed ALLEN:  deadlines.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We shall see.  That was a very nice way of putting that.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Yes, it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, it's the -- it's not just steel and aluminum  tariffs, it's the retaliation that we're hearing about from Canada and  Mexico and our American allies targeting those very red states.</p><p>Coming up, pain in the pump and in the skies, why American Airlines is  warning about price hikes if oil prices remain high and how other airlines  are reacting.  </p><p>And President Bill Clinton says the only reason that President Trump is not  facing impeachment hearings right now is because he's not a democrat.  More  on the former president's take, that's ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news right now, Russian President Vladimir Putin  inviting Kim Jong-un to his country.  Cheryl Casone has the details, good  morning Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes Dagen.  Russian media is reporting that Vladimir Putin has  invited the North Korean leader to travel to Russia this fall.</p><p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reportedly passed Putin's invitation  to Kim Jong-un while he was visiting Pyongyang just last week.  Now, Putin  wants Kim to attend the Eastern Economic Forum which is held in Vladivostok  every year.  Of course.  Well, we shall see what happens there.</p><p>Let's follow another headline for international anyway, at least 25 people  are dead, 20 were wounded following a volcanic eruption that happened in  Guatemala yesterday.  This is the Fuego Volcano where it erupted for the  second time this year.  Spewed a lot of thick smoke nearly six miles into  the air.  Report say that more than 3,000 people have been evacuated from  their homes.</p><p>Meanwhile the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii continues to rage on leaving some  residents now stranded.  The area's escape route has been cut off by lava  and now has left them with no power, no cell reception, landlines are even  water.  Authorities are planning to airlift people out if the lava  continues to spread.  And actually, over the weekend, three people were  airlifted out of a remote area near that volcano.</p><p>Well, Microsoft reportedly agreeing to buy coding site GitHub.  Some  analyst say that Microsoft might pay up to $5 billion for GitHub.  This, of  course, would bolster Microsoft's programming tools as its trying to move  toward building more open source software.  GitHub said last year that it  was about -- it was booking about $250 million in annual subscription  revenue.  This deal could be announced as early as today.  </p><p>Taking a look at shares of Microsoft, higher in the premarket, up almost  one percent, Dagen.  And those are some of your headlines we're following.   Putin and Kim Jong-un, I'm not even sure what to say about that but back to  you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Interference by Putin in attempted manipulation of the United  States once again.</p><p>CASONE:  Lovely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kevin, this Microsoft-GitHub story, good for Microsoft?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I think it's great for Microsoft.  You see -- you started to  see actually the transition from (INAUDIBLE) has -- he's really opened up.   I mean, they've got partnerships including with other apps to have open  source and its brought on users into their hybrid cloud which is growing 90  percent quarter-over-quarter.</p><p>So -- I mean, it's -- it really transitioned and opened up the company.   They had to get away from the hardware business and they're now going to  new software as a service company.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And really giving Amazon a run for its money in terms of the  cloud computing business because that's a big grower for Amazon as well.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And they've gone into the subscription model for their own  software.  If you think about Microsoft Word, all the processing, it's been  unbelievable what they've been able -- the transition has been phenomenal  especially if you think about kind of the boondoggles they had with trying  to do their own cellphones, the (INAUDIBLE) and hardware, you didn't really  have any direction, they have direction now.</p><p>CARTER:  And it's fascinating to watch the turnaround of a company that,  you know, could have been irrelevant if they weren't careful, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, again, that's what Apple's trying to do with recurring  revenue streams.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  And it's Apple worldwide developer conference starting today,  so that all these things are going to be talked to.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love that you're up on the news Kevin.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Try to be.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You were out of breath when you came in here earlier this  morning.  </p><p>KELLY:  I know, because I was reading.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  OK.  And by the way, if you're where I came from, it's not  GitHub, it's GitHub.</p><p>Coming up, a graduation surprise from Jimmy Fallon for Stoneman Douglas  High School's class of 2018, as the Florida school also celebrates the  memory of those lost in that school shooting earlier this year.</p><p>And Biden, 2020, why former Vice President Joe Biden says he's willing to  put his hat in the ring and when he'll make up his mind.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rising oil prices not only hitting consumers at the gas pump,  now the CEO of one airline says ticket prices are set to go up due to  higher fuel cost.  The price of crude oil is nearly 40 percent higher than  it was one year ago off its recent highs however.</p><p>Joining me now, Price Futures Group Analyst, Fox Business Contributor, Phil  Flynn.  Always fired up bright and early.  Phil, the warning comes from  American Airlines, Doug Parker, what do you think of this and will it be  the first of many?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think it may be.  You know, a lot  of these airlines were spoiled last year, they were making record profits,  $38 billion in profits and they didn't think that oil prices might ever go  up.</p><p>But all of a sudden, oil prices have gone up, a lot of them were not  prepared for this because they believe in this lower for longer mantra and  they weren't hedged correctly.  Now, I don't think that prices are going to  go up right away but this is a strong signal that if these oil prices say  where they are and they probably will, then more than likely we're going to  see those prices for tickets go up.</p><p>KELLY:  Hey Phil, it's Kevin Kelly here.  You know, what's pretty  interesting is that OPEC is actually trying to figure out the whole  production conundrum, do you think they're going to open up their spigots  and actually bring more output on to the market and actually helps  stabilize oil prices and really put a cap on the run-up we've seen  recently?</p><p>FLYNN:  Kevin, great question.  Last week we heard from Saudi Arabia and  Russia and they were basically signaling to the market that they were ready  to raise production maybe by one million barrels of oil a day.</p><p>But as soon as they said that, the price of oil dropped like, you know,  eight percent in a couple of days.  And I think it scared the cartel out of  them to be honest with you.  So I think they may have second thoughts  because today on the weekend, they basically said that they might raise  production but they weren't very solid about that, they're going to be very  price sensitive before they make that final decision.</p><p>CARTER:  One of the questions I have is the announcement said they're  necessarily going to -- they're going to have higher prices, it doesn't  necessarily mean higher fares.  Do you think airlines are going to go back  to this?</p><p>I mean, I've been reading about people saying that they're got put --  they're going to start charging for carryon bags and other kinds of things,  you think it might go into fees rather than fares?</p><p>FLYNN:  I think it is.  I mean, the last time prices went up, they put on a  fuel surcharge on tickets, that may be a possible.  But overall, we saw  report from the International Air Transport Association that basically said  that their profits are going to be down by 12 percent from the record that  they set last year. </p><p>That's a huge drop, that's billions of dollars.  So I think because of the  competitive nature of airlines are going to try to keep those ticket prices  down but eventually if prices stay high, eventually they're going to pass  those cost on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Phil, in terms of what people are going to be paying at the pump  this summer, are your estimates, have they come down recently with the drop  in the cost of crude oil?</p><p>FLYNN:  I think they have slightly.  I mean right now the national average  is about $2.95.  We do expect another run-up in price right before the 4th  of July which is typical.  But right now we haven't hit that $3.00 a gallon  area.</p><p>But the big picture for gasoline prices, the era of low gasoline prices are  over.  Even if prices go down, they're going to stay pretty much where they  are right now.  There's a very strong global economy, demand is strong.   And the other thing I'm really concerned about is the cost of diesel, the  truckers have really been feeling this price increase.</p><p>You know, gasoline prices are $2.50 but if you're a trucker, you're paying  an average of $3.21 a gallon, that's mainly because the white oil in the  U.S. doesn't produce a lot of diesel fuels and those supplies are a lot  tighter than gasoline.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And those higher freight cost if you will, broadly  speaking Phil, it filters through the other businesses.  We've heard that  from the food company Cisco just as one example.  So, again, these rising  prices are filtering through the economy and will show up in ways we might  not expect.  Phil, great to see you.</p><p>FLYNN:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much.</p><p>FLYNN:  Thank you Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Phil Flynn in Chicago for us.  Coming up, Bill Clinton's  eyebrow-raising take on impeachment, why he says the only reason President  Trump isn't facing impeachment hearings right now is because he's not a  democrat.</p><p>And hooked on your smart phone, many of us are, but now Apple is set to  reveal new software that is supposed to help you kick your screen  addiction.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, June 4th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets extending  gains, Futures pointing to a triple-digit rally at the open, 137-point gain  on the Dow Futures right now.  This after stocks rallied on Friday,  following that better-than-expected job's report and it was a blockbuster,  219 points with the Dow gained on Friday.  </p><p>And global markets following America's lead, going -- starting the new week  in Europe, we have buying across the board, nearly a one percent gain on  the FTSE-100 in England.  In Asia overnight, same story, we have strong  global markets with both the Nikkei in Japan and the Hang Seng in Hong  Kong, gaining more than one percent.  Former President Bill Clinton  weighing in on the impeachment debate surrounding President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think if roles were  reversed, if there were a Democrat President and these facts were present,  most people I know in Washington believe that impeachment hearings would  have begun already.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We take a closer look at those comments, straight ahead.  A  celebrity surprise for the graduating class of Marjory Stoneman Douglas  High School, Jimmy Fallon, giving an emotional and uplifting commencement  address, this  after the shooting there, earlier this year.  Another strike  averted in Las Vegas, the Culinary Union reportedly making a deal with MGM,  we will have those details, and Apple, looking to address the growing issue  of phone addiction.  </p><p>Details on the announcements we're expecting from the Worldwide Developers  Conference.  Plus, SpaceX, launching a satellite overnight, but it's not  all success.  The company announcing a delay to its space tourism plans.  </p><p>But to our top story this half hour, President Bill Clinton, ramping up his  rhetoric, the former president arguing that impeachment hearings would have  already started if a Democrat was the commander-in-chief during the current  investigation on meddling by Russia into the election.  Here's what  President Clinton said during an interview on CBS, yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  I think they have tried, by in large, to cover this investigation  based on the facts.  I think if roles were reversed, now, this is me just  talking based on my experience, if there were a Democratic President and  these facts were present, most people I know in Washington believe  impeachment hearings would have begun already.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us is Former Ohio State Senate Minority Leader and  American University School of Public Affairs Executive in Residence, Capri  Cafaro, along with Former Massachusetts State Co-Chairman for Trump's  Presidential Campaign and U.S. Senate Candidate for Massachusetts, Geoff  Diehl.  Geoff, back in 1999, the Senate voted to acquit President Clinton  of both articles of impeachment.  What is your take on this that he raises  this issue now?</p><p>FMR. REP. GEOFF DIEHL (R-MA), MEMBER, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,  MASSACHUSETTS:  Well, Dagen, thank you for having me on.  And I will say  it's hard to believe that President Clinton is making this comment after he  was given such a pass whether it was Whitewater or whether it was  Travelgate, to the point where his wife ended up scrubbing his server and  seemed to be getting a complete pass.  So, a very ironic that he would be  making these accusations.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Capri, I look at it from this point of view that, Hillary  Clinton has not really been out there, campaigning in the midterm elections  for the most part.  She did endorse Governor Cuomo in New York, recently.   And President Clinton has been largely absent but he, kind of, comes out  with this whopper, and I say that because the Special Counsel investigation  is still on-going, we don't have a report delivered.  And he says this,  that impeachment proceedings would have already been started.</p><p>FMR. SEN. CAPRI CAFARO (D), OHIO:  Look, I think that, you know, President  Clinton, he is somebody -- obviously, he's gone through this before,  personally, his wife loss, so I think that there's just a little bit of,  maybe, a bad taste in his mouth, if you will, over this whole impeachment  thing.  </p><p>I think that, you know, he's gone through this before and I think that the  only point, frankly, that I think President Clinton is making, is that, you  know, if it was a Democratic President and a Republican Congress, maybe it  would have been done, and vice versa.  </p><p>Look, there's a lot of concern that if the Democrats take back the House,  that they could start the impeachment process.  So, unfortunately, what has  happened with impeachment, is that it's become a political hammer more than  a legal proceeding, and that's a problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Given what his impeachment was -- the impeachment proceedings on  President Clinton what they were related to, it was kind of curious that he  wasn't pressed on his thoughts on the Me Too Movement even what -- even  what -- you know, raised the issue, again, of what Kirsten Gillibrand, the  Senator, said about President Clinton, that he should have resigned and we  have gotten some commentary from him on that recently, but your take on  that because, again, if you're going to -- if you're going to talk about  impeachment, let's talk about all of it, Capri.</p><p>CAFARO:  You know, I think we also need to put some context into this  interview.  Apparently, Bill Clinton just wrote some, sort of, a political  thriller with John Patterson.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>CAFARO:  So, I mean, he's doing these interviews as part of a book tour.   But sure, I mean, I've always said, you have got to be equitable in these  conversations whether you're a Democrat or a Republican.  If you're going  to have the conversations surrounding this, then, sure, I mean, be fair and  have a conversation about the reasons behind impeachment, which were not  just Monica Lewinsky, but frankly, about lying, you know,  as part of a  deposition, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it was related to the Lewinsky affair.  I mean, the charges  were directly related to that.</p><p>CAFARO:  Right, of course, of course.  I mean, again, I think that -- you  know, the Clintons, frankly, and I say this as a Democrat, and I love Bill  Clinton as a president, I'm not -- I was not really crazy about Hillary  Clinton, but the Clintons are part of the past and we need to move forward  and redefine the Democratic Party and stop continuing to go back and  relitigate things from the 1990s, we need to move forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to -- President Clinton also weighed in on the mainstream  media bias allegations when President Obama was in office.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLINTON:  They did treat him differently than other Democrats and  Republicans because they --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Why?</p><p>CLINTON:  That was the political press.  You know, I don't know.  They  liked him.  And they liked having the first African-American president, and  he was a good president, I think.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get your thoughts on this, Geoff, because, again, he's  -- weighing in on some very serious topics.  And he definitely seems upset  about the way that he was treated toward the end of his presidency, whether  it was the impeachment proceeding and the big picture, how does this --  does this help Republicans and hurt Democrats, going into November?</p><p>DIEHL:  Well, I will say that Bill Clinton is absolutely right that  President Obama was given a pass on many things as well, fast and furious,  Benghazi, which was a combination of Hillary Clinton and President Obama's  administration.  They seemed -- the press seemed to just continually ignore  and white-wash all that was going on there.  </p><p>Now, at the same time, Donald Trump can't seem to catch a break, the DOJ,  the FBI, the IRS of his weaponized against conservatives for the last, I  don't know how many years, and all of this pointing to, you know, collusion  within the government, you know, trying to keep Republicans from having any  success.  So I think, again, Bill Clinton needs to, probably, moderate his  conversation about, you know, unfairness and talk about the fact that, I  think, even President Trump is being treated unfairly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Capri, I just did want to point out that President Clinton  did was, he was asked about the Kirsten Gillibrand, saying that he should  resign and his response was, kind of, it was all over the place, you know  she's living in a different context, and she did it for different reasons,  so I just disagree with her, he said, during that -- during that interview.   We just didn't play the clip, but what were you going to say?</p><p>CAFARO:  What is he going to say?  I mean, what does someone say to that?   I mean, Kirsten Gillibrand is obviously angling to run for President in  2020 and, certainly, she wanted to, you know, capture on that Me Too  Movement and take a stand.  But what is President Clinton going to say,  yes, I should have resigned?  </p><p>I mean, you know, he's in a -- he's in a tough spot, but I think -- but I  think the conversations that we are having here is why is President  Clinton, maybe, not having an honest of a dialogue as I think people are,  maybe, hoping from him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Philippe Reines called Kirsten Gillibrand, a hypocrite.   But President Clinton could've done that and said, given new support that  she got from the Clintons, maybe that's one word he could've used.  </p><p>CAFARO:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Meantime, Former Vice President Joe Biden, isn't ruling out a  2020 Presidential bid, while he continues to campaign for other Democrats,  Biden's team is said to be outlining what his campaign could look like and  will likely decide by the end of the year, if he will run.  This is  according to reporting by NBC News, Capri, your reaction to this?</p><p>CAFARO:  You know, well, I said earlier, we need to move forward and we  need to have some new blood into the Democratic Party.  Our bench is  actually pretty weak and, you know, I come from the State from Ohio, a guy  like Joe Biden, really connects with, you know, my people, in the Rust  Belt, you know, coming from Scranton, he's a straight shooter, and while he  is old, so is President Trump, I think that Joe Biden regrets not running  in 2016, a lot of, could have, would have, should have, there.  </p><p>And I think that he has a better shot than some of the more progressive  names that we're hearing, like Elizabeth Warren and the like.  So, it's not  an ideal situation, but, you know, if Joe Biden does run, he would be  certainly somebody that I would support because I think he could connect  with those Trump crossover Democrats.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Geoff, he's certainly somebody who can talk to people who  don't live on the East Coast and major cities and, basically, Los Angeles  and San Francisco.  He does know how to talk to every man and every woman.</p><p>DIEHL:  Yes.  No, Dagen, and I think it was interesting, my opponent,  Elizabeth Warren, was in Ohio just a few weeks ago, stumping for a  Democratic governor's candidate because she's trying to grease these kids  for a 2020 run, obviously, but showing that Joe Biden is out there and  thinking that he has a chance of running, I think, is a good example of why  Elizabeth Warren has no chance to becoming the nominee for 2020.  She's  done nothing for Massachusetts, no credits, nothing to take credit for.  </p><p>And now, she's basically wants re-election so she can spend two more years  doing nothing for Massachusetts, that's why I'm running this race to make  sure that people know they have a choice in November, to have someone who's  going to work for them down in Washington D.C., versus someone who doesn't  even have a chance to run in 2020.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Capri, it's good to see you as always.  Capri Cafaro --</p><p>CAFARO:  Absolutely.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Geoff Diehl, thanks for coming on.  Coming up --</p><p>DIEHL:  Thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breathing a sigh of relief, workers, striking a tentative deal  with another Las Vegas casino, days after threat of a massive walkout,  details on the plan, ahead, and another success for launch for SpaceX's  Falcon 9 earlier this morning, but a major setback for SpaceX's  intergalactic tourism plans, more on the failure to launch, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A surprise speech for Stoneman Douglas High School graduates.   Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Dagen.  So, the surprise commencement speaker was \"Late  Night\" Host, Jimmy Fallon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY FALLON, COMEDIAN AND HOST:  You won't be classmates anymore.  You'll  be -- (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FALLON:  When something feels hard, remember that you get better.  Choose  to move forward.  Don't let anything stop you.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  It's quite a moment there.  Fallon continue, though, of course, to  provide some comic relief and then, of course, show that heart felt message  of hope to the students there.  The graduation coming months after the  shooting in Parkland that left 17 people dead; four students killed  would've graduated yesterday.  </p><p>Well, a crisis averted for MGM Resorts.  It has raised tentative labor  agreement with an employee union.  MGM joins Caesars Entertainment in  approving new five-year contracts with union workers -- avoiding what could  have been a major disruption in business as game five of the Stanley Cup  finals is returning to Vegas this week.  Of course, here are those  employees celebrating in that video.  Details of the agreement, not  disclosed but casino workers have been asking for an increase in wages and  benefits for the last several weeks.  </p><p>And then finally this, another successful launch overnight for SpaceX's  Falcon 9, the rocket carrying a massive communication satellite.  This is  going to bring data and broadband services to Asia, Australia, and the  Middle East taking off.  This is Falcon 9's 11th launch this year.   Meanwhile, more news, Elon Musk's big plans for space tourism are being put  on hold.  SpaceX announcing that its mission to fly tourists around the  moon will not likely happen until 2019 due to technical and production  problems.  Next year, OK.  Most previously, he said he'd hoped to launch  the first test flights by the end of this year.  So, next year going to the  moon, Dagen, or so he says.  I don't know.  Back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Might want to worry about the car company.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>CARTER:  Energy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love it.  Like, we're going to the moon but this electric car,  this inexpensive electric car.  </p><p>CASONE:  That Model 3.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Struggling with that one.  Thank you, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet.  Coming up, kicking your smart phone addiction with help  from Apple.  The tech giant expected to reveal big news today about the  latest software update that could help you reduce your screen time.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Attention iPhone addicts, Apple is reportedly unveiling new  software to help consumers digitally detox.  According to published reports  the feature is called digital health and will help users limit their screen  time.  This comes as the tech giant will hold its annual worldwide  developers conference in San Jose today and outline its software strategy  for the next year.  </p><p>Joining me now is Trends Expert, Futurist, CEO of TechSavvy Global and the  Author of \"Make Change Work for You\", Scott Steinberg.  Scott, Apple  changed the smartphone industry and now they're helping tools create --  creating tools to help you break iPhone habit.  Why are they doing this  now?  </p><p>SCOTT STEINBERG, CEO, TECHSAVVY:  Well, as you might imagine, Apple has  sold in billions of devices, people love these things.  The question is:  how the heck do we get them off them?  Companies like Google on their  android devices have already introduced digital wellness tools, so it's  only natural fit giving increasing calls and pressure for Apple to cut down  on people's smartphone addictions, for them to put it timers, screen time  limits, even apps that will prevent you from accessing your favorite  applications during the day at work.  So, maybe you can break that Candy  Crush Saga addiction a little bit.  </p><p>KELLY:  Scott, aren't we already moving away from this with the  proliferation of these things, devices, as well as the virtual assistance  that we're having like home pods?  Aren't people moving away from using  their actual device and starting to use other devices or other things?  And  Apple is actually behind in that regard.  I mean, their virtual assistance:  Siri has lost way to Alexa.  I mean, is that where we're headed?  </p><p>STEINBERG:  Well, we're definitely seeing people play with the variety of  different devices.  They're splitting their time between different screens  and even as you pointed out, on devices that is don't have a screen -- Siri  and the home pod, some of the smart speakers has fallen a big behind where  Google and Amazon are.  In fact, at Worldwide Developers Conference, you  can probably hear Apple talk a little bit about what the future of Siri is  going to hold.  They need to make the service a little bit smarter, they  need to talk about integrations with different devices from speakers to  headphones and even cars, and perhaps they'll even open up the platform,  the Siri platform so that other developers can create all sorts of fun  applications and new uses for it, but they definitely are playing catch-up  on that front and people are definitely using more devices across the  board.  So, should be an exciting day in terms of news.  </p><p>CARTER:  You know, it did seem that Apple was always ahead of the curb,  that Apple was the model.  Whenever I had a client, they said I want to be  more like Apple as far as innovation goes.  It seems like they're falling  behind with their launches, they're getting more bugs, and it seems, you  know, in all of these things, do you think they're going to make a big  announcement that's going to help create a vision for the future?  </p><p>STEINBERG:  I think absolutely, you're going to see Apple paint a picture  of what's coming next.  And I wouldn't count them out of the game at any  time -- as we've seen in timeless times in the past, bouncing back.  I  think this year, the focus is going to be more on software than hardware  devices, though.  Some of the big surprise reveals may surround the  introduction of Apple T.V. as a video streaming service, more like Hulu and  Netflix.  And in fact, one of the buzzes, that everybody is talking about,  is the fact that maybe pretty soon, you'll be able to run an iPhone and  iPad apps right there seamlessly on Mac computers, seamlessly integrating  computers and smart phones more going forward.  So, I think they'll have  some pretty exciting announcements.  And they'll probably touch on Siri and  privacy issues as well and draw and hardline stance.  Unlike companies like  Google and Facebook, Apple is more in the business of selling hardware, not  users data -- the marketer.  So, I think you'll hear about that as well.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, let me raise an issue with you, Scott, because there's  this big story that the New York Times reported, an investigative story  that Facebook gave device makers deep access to data on users and friends,  and one of those named is Apple.  So, Apple has been quite bias about not  selling your information, protecting your own information if you're Apple  customer.  But they seem -- and this is a question all too willing to take  information on individuals if it's coming through another company.  Tim  Cook has gone after Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg has pushed back on that.   So, it raises an issue about a little bit of hypocrisy at Apple.  </p><p>STEINBERG:  Well, who knows what the heck is going on behind closed doors.   But keep in mind for Apple, it's not necessarily about selling information  onto marketers.  They have services like Siri that are powered by  artificial intelligence, and the more data you have on users, the smarter  and better the services get.  So, I think Apple probably isn't as extensive  users of people's personal private data as many other companies may be.   But of course, in some cases, it may be the pop calling the kettle back.   There's a lot of jousting going on out there in the media as you might  imagine. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Wall Street Journal also had a story about a new level of  security on your business trip, Scott, what do you make of that in terms of  the invasion maybe of your employer in tracking your, tracking your  movements when you're traveling for work?  </p><p>STEINBERG:  Well, there's some duty of care there.  You have to keep in  mind that any time a business sends you out on a trip in many countries,  they're taking a risk, they have a responsibility to exercise reasonable  care in terms of knowing where you are and making sure you have updates and  alerts, information on the areas in which you'll be traveling, and also  provide emergency relief.  And of course, we live in an increasingly  unpredictable world so people have bigger concerns as.  They're worried  about terrors, and they're worried about crime, they're even worried more  natural disaster.  So, it's only a natural step forward that more companies  would be tracking this information and introducing these policies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scott, great to see you.  Thank you so much.  I hope any Apple  T.V. thing is better than that Amazon, the one I've got which basically  blew up over the weekend.  So, thank you for that, Scott Steinberg.   Marking 500 days in office for President Trump.  I talked to his budget  director when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

But its advertising revenues, to date, have remained robust.</p><p>As the company prepares to release its third-quarter results on Wednesday, its shares are trading at about $189, down more than 7 per cent since its last set of earnings.\u00a0</p><p>The dip suggests that anxiety over regulation and scandal is taking hold. But how is the social network\u2019s underlying business faring?</p><p>Here are the four big questions that investors will be weighing as the numbers land.</p><p>Will advertising headwinds hurt revenues?</p><p>In July, Facebook\u2019s second-quarter revenues rose 28 per cent to $16.9bn, coming in just ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, and many analysts are similarly bullish about the forthcoming quarter. </p><p>\u201c[Facebook] had a better than expected [second quarter], and we believe marketers continued to invest heavily in advertising on both Facebook and Instagram in [the third],\" Debra Aho Williamson, principal analyst at research group eMarketer, said in a note.\u00a0</p><p>But a number of potential sources of pain have emerged which could spell difficulties ahead. In July, David Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief finance officer, warned of a \u201cmore pronounced deceleration\u201d in the pace of revenue growth later in the year because of \u201cad targeting-related headwinds and uncertainties\u201d.</p><p>The following month, Facebook launched a tool that allows users to restrict the platform from wielding third-party personal data to boost its ad-targeting capabilities, cautioning at the time that this could hurt revenues.</p><p>Separately, the latest version of Apple\u2019s operating system iOS 13, which was launched in September, cut off several potentially valuable forms of data from Facebook and other online advertisers used for targeting.\u00a0</p><p>Mr Wehner pointed in particular to the fourth quarter and 2020, but investors will be looking for any early signs that the predicted deceleration is real.</p><p>What is the cost and progress of Facebook\u2019s \u2018pivot to privacy\u2019?</p><p>Facebook has said that it expects margins to be squeezed this year compared with 2018. Contributing to this is chief executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cpivot to privacy\u201d in response to public and political pressure over lax data practices.\u00a0</p><p>For example, Mr Zuckerberg announced a move at the start of the year to integrate its messaging apps \u2014 Messenger, Instagram direct messaging and WhatsApp\u2014 into one encrypted system, in a dramatic overhaul that means the company will no longer be able to see the content of users\u2019 conversations.</p><p>Separately, Facebook has promised to introduce a \u201ccomprehensive data security program\u201d as part of a $5bn settlement with the FTC, announced in July \u2014 the culmination of a probe launched in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. This includes changes to its governance structure but also to how Facebook handles and stores user data.\u00a0</p><p>Implementing these changes will probably be costly in terms of resources and manpower. Investors will be listening out for any guidance on this, and how far along in the process the company has come.\u00a0</p><p>Colin Sebastian, senior research analyst at Baird, said in a note: \u201cManagement's focus on privacy, data security, messaging and other product improvements will continue to weigh on margins.\u201d</p><p>Will rising competition take the sheen from Instagram\u2019s bumper growth?</p><p>Instagram, particularly its ephemeral \u201cStories\u201d video feature, has been widely recognised as a major driver of growth for the overall business, where Facebook\u2019s staple \u2018blue app\u2019 has lost some of its appeal for users.</p><p>According to estimates by eMarketer, Instagram represents a growing share of Facebook's global mobile advertising revenue \u2014 close to 23 per cent this year. In 2012, when Facebook bought the company for $1bn, it was lossmaking and revenue-free.</p><p>Plans to shift Instagram towards a potentially more lucrative ecommerce business model \u2014 which will allow shoppers to buy goods on the app without leaving it \u2014 have also excited advertisers and investors.\u00a0</p><p>Still, the photo-sharing app is facing more competitive environment than ever, as smaller rivals begin to enjoy more traction. A move by Snap, parent company of Snapchat, to double down its investment in its advertising offering has paid off and the company is edging closer to profitability.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, rival TikTok, owned by deep-pocketed Chinese private company ByteDance, is rapidly gaining popularity among a younger demographic in the US and EU, and interest from big advertisers. \u201cSnap is starting to get itself together, TikTok is starting to gain market share,\u201d said Youssef Squali, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.\u00a0</p><p>How will the company respond to big tech regulation?\u00a0</p><p>Politicians and regulators continue to circle Facebook and other big tech companies as calls grow for fresh regulation to curb their power.</p><p>Beyond mounting privacy and data security concerns, Facebook is facing antitrust investigations including multiple state and federal probes in the US. One remedy on the table is a forced break-up of the company, with Instagram and WhatsApp hived off from the main platform \u2014 an outcome that Mr Zuckerberg has vowed to fight in court if it were to happen.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, this month alone, Mr Zuckerberg caused furore over his decision to allow adverts paid for by politicians to be exempt from fact-checking, and faced questioning in Congress over his controversial plans to spearhead the launch of a global digital currency, Libra.</p><p>With the company under attack on so many fronts, investors will be looking for any indication as to how it plans to handle or combat the regulatory pressures and risks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-6cac8dd8fa6811e9a35436acbbb0d9b6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCV-VDT1-DXP9-94WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"964\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 30, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
