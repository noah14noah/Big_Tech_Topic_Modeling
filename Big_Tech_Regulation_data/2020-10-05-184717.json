Mr. Secretary, it's always a pleasure to see you, thanks so much for joining me.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WILBUR ROSS, COMMERCE SECRETARY:  Thank you for having me, Maria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BARTIROMO:  So what is your expectation on this contempt issue?</p><p>ROSS:  Oh this is just more political theater; it doesn't really have any substantive basis. We produced to the committee over 14,000 pages of documents. What's an issue here is about a dozen documents, roughly 15 pages, all of which the courts didn't find necessary to make their conclusion.</p><p>So this is silly, I testified myself for almost seven hours before this very committee. Three of my former senior staff people, including one who's now Assistant Attorney General in the State of Florida testified as well.</p><p>We answered thousands of questions; we are not stonewalling. But we are also not yielding on the very, very important matter of executive privilege. These are privileged document;, they're going to remain privileged documents, and we're not going to be frightened into changing that position just because of some action the House might take.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how will the President deal with this then in terms of understanding fully the number of Americans in this country versus illegals? I mean, is that the whole point of putting that question on the census?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, the question of illegals was never going to be asked. The census was intending to ask the questions, \"are you a citizen or are you not?\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ROSS:  We've never asked about legal status, nor can the census data be used for ICE purposes or criminal investigation of any sort. Under Title 13, those data are protected. Individual data cannot be released. There's a serious jail sentence and a serious fine for anybody who's convicted of doing so, so -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right. And the - and the left knows that, right? Wilbur, I mean, but they don't want this question on the census regardless. Why do you think that is?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, I think it's just gamesmanship on their part. They know we're going to come much closer to the answer than we ever have before -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.</p><p>ROSS:  - because with the President's executive order we're having much better access to federal documents than we ever had before. And believe it or not, many states are also going to be cooperating with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>ROSS:  So we will get the kind of data that's needed. And in some ways it'll be even better because I believe that a lot of census money should be dedicated to administrative records rather than just people ringing doorbells, and we hope that the progress we make this time will move us toward that for the 2020 census.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK. Well, we're going to be watching that obviously. Meanwhile, look what's going on in the Congress right now, Secretary. I mean, first of all, big tech is in the hot seat. Lawmakers are taking aim at Silicon Valley giants yesterday. The issues here data and privacy concerns. Listen to this. I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>ROSS:  Well, I was at the cell phone -</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D), O.H.:  Facebook is dangerous. Now, Facebook might not intend to be dangerous, but surely they don't respect the power of the technologies they are playing with. Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the House over and over and called every arson a learning experience.</p><p>SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), T.N.:  On Monday, you claimed in an op-ed that Google is not politically biased, yet you acknowledge that Google took down or limited the reach of conservative content accounts and only did so mistakenly.</p><p>REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D), M.D.:  According to data produced by Rand Fishkin, Google controls over 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States, so congratulations on that. Although, this seems to fit the classical definition of monopoly.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that? You know, it's interesting to look on both sides of the aisle, Secretary, and both sides of the aisle want to - want to really put in the screws on these tech companies. What's your take?</p><p>ROSS:  Well, I was at the Social Media Conference last week at the White House, and quite a number of the participants in that conference came up with very specific instances of censorship. These are not theoretical issues. These are people saying this is exactly what happened to me on this data at this time.</p><p>So there is censorship. I don't think there's any question based on the evidence that those folks put forward. And so, I think the real question is how should government, how should the Congress, how should the administration deal with it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSS:  Anybody who thinks there wasn't censorship is wrong. There was a public survey taken. 13,000 something responses came in, mostly all giving instances of this kind of censorship.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. So what is this administration going to do about it? I mean, I spoke with President Trump just about, I don't know, two weeks ago or so, when he called into the program, and I said to him, \"look, do you want to see regulation here? Do you want to see - how are you going to get these guys to stop doing what they're doing if, in fact, this is the reality,\" because if you've seen the censorship of conservatives now, wait until we get knee-deep into 2020. Here's what the president said to me two weeks ago. Watch this, Secretary.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. President, you mentioned technology companies. How concerned are you that technology companies are censoring conservatives, and they're going to do this right up to the 2020 election?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNTIED STATES:  Well, they're doing it to me on Twitter. I mean, what they did to me on Twitter's incredible. You know, I have, you know, millions and millions of followers, but I will tell you they make it very hard for people to join me on Twitter. And they make it very much harder for me to get out the message.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>And he went on to say - when I said to him do you want to see new regulation; he said you - I said or do you prefer just seeing competition in the marketplace? He said you might need legislation in order to get the competition.</p><p>ROSS:  Well that could be. It's - this is a whole new area for us to explore, but I think the underlying question is it's not appropriate for this kind of censorship. They've been given a get out of jail free card by the Congress, saying that if you're not the creating media, you don't have certain responsibilities.</p><p>Well to me, censorship is creating media, it's creating content, and if they're going to start doing that, they better think about the consequences.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, let me - let me switch gears, ask you about trade, futures are higher this morning, or mixed after the markets took a hit yesterday on President Trump's comments that a deal with China may still be out of reach.</p><p>Here's what the president said, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We have a long way to go as far as tariffs, where China's concerned -- if we want we have another $325 billion that we can put a tariff on if we want. So we're talking to China about a deal, but I wish they didn't break the deal that we had.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So is it fair to say it's probably a long time before we actually see deals here, what do you think, Secretary? Where are we?</p><p>ROSS:  Well as you know, I've said repeatedly this is not a 10 minute process. This is a long, involved process. The fundamental question now though, is will they go back to the point where we were before they change their mind and backtracked on some of the understandings that had been reached.</p><p>That's the important issue right now, and that's what's being probed in telephone conversation. And the outcome of those phone conversations is what will help determine whether there is in the next meeting, and if so, when.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you have - do you have any optimism or encouragement that they are planning to stop the theft of IP? Isn't that one of the big ticket items? Real quick,</p><p>ROSS:  Well the big ticket items are the structural reforms, the theft of IP, the unlevel playing field and procurement, the subsidies, all those. But there's another - in some ways even bigger issue, and that is what is:  the U.S. enforcement capability in the event that they violate the agreements.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, sure, yes, you were talking about that before.</p><p>ROSS:  That's the real key. That's the real key.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And real quick before you go, Secretary, on USMCA, I was speaking to a high profile senator over the last week, and he said I'm not expecting Nancy Pelosi to bring it to the floor at all.</p><p>ROSS:  Well it would be a real dereliction of duty if she did not. This is the biggest and the best trade deal this country has ever made. And it's quite ridiculous that many Democrats in the Congress voted for NAFTA. NAFTA was not only a disaster but paragraph by paragraph USMCA is demonstrably better on all scores, particularly for U.S. manufacturing but also for the digital economy, for intellectual property, for environmental and for labor constraints.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well that's - I know, but she doesn't want him to have another victory. We'll just have to wait and see. Real quick before you go, Secretary, there is a report that the president was considering removing you from your post following the Supreme Court defeat on adding the citizenship question to the census, quoting to NBC News, NBC is reporting this, what can you tell us?</p><p>ROSS:  Well I was in a trip with the president last Friday; we were in Milwaukee, we were in Cleveland. I was at the cabinet meeting, of course, yesterday and here I am on TV today. I think you ought to go by facts, not by rumors on some other network.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You got it. Mr. Secretary, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>ROSS:  Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We covered a lot there. Wilbur Ross, always a pleasure, thank you, sir.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Three of my former senior staff people, including one who's now Assistant Attorney General in the State of Florida testified as well.  </p><p>      We answered thousands of questions; we are not stonewalling. But we are also not yielding on the very, very important matter of executive privilege. These are privileged document;, they're going to remain privileged documents, and we're not going to be frightened into changing that position just because of some action the House might take.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So how will the President deal with this then in terms of understanding fully the number of Americans in this country versus illegals? I mean, is that the whole point of putting that question on the census?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Well, the question of illegals was never going to be asked. The census was intending to ask the questions, \"are you a citizen or are you not?\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  We've never asked about legal status, nor can the census data be used for ICE purposes or criminal investigation of any sort. Under Title 13, those data are protected. Individual data cannot be released. There's a serious jail sentence and a serious fine for anybody who's convicted of doing so, so -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Right. And the - and the left knows that, right? Wilbur, I mean, but they don't want this question on the census regardless. Why do you think that is?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Well, I think it's just gamesmanship on their part. They know we're going to come much closer to the answer than we ever have before -  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  I see.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  - because with the President's executive order we're having much better access to federal documents than we ever had before. And believe it or not, many states are also going to be cooperating with us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  So we will get the kind of data that's needed. And in some ways it'll be even better because I believe that a lot of census money should be dedicated to administrative records rather than just people ringing doorbells, and we hope that the progress we make this time will move us toward that for the 2020 census.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  OK. Well, we're going to be watching that obviously. Meanwhile, look what's going on in the Congress right now, Secretary. I mean, first of all, big tech is in the hot seat. Lawmakers are taking aim at Silicon Valley giants yesterday. The issues here data and privacy concerns. Listen to this. I've got to get your reaction.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Well, I was at the cell phone -  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D), O.H.</emphasis>:  Facebook is dangerous. Now, Facebook might not intend to be dangerous, but surely they don't respect the power of the technologies they are playing with. Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the House over and over and called every arson a learning experience.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), T.N.</emphasis>:  On Monday, you claimed in an op-ed that Google is not politically biased, yet you acknowledge that Google took down or limited the reach of conservative content accounts and only did so mistakenly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D), M.D.</emphasis>:  According to data produced by Rand Fishkin, Google controls over 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States, so congratulations on that. Although, this seems to fit the classical definition of monopoly.  </p><p>      (END VIDEOCLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  What about that? You know, it's interesting to look on both sides of the aisle, Secretary, and both sides of the aisle want to - want to really put in the screws on these tech companies. What's your take?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Well, I was at the Social Media Conference last week at the White House, and quite a number of the participants in that conference came up with very specific instances of censorship. These are not theoretical issues. These are people saying this is exactly what happened to me on this data at this time.  </p><p>      So there is censorship. I don't think there's any question based on the evidence that those folks put forward. And so, I think the real question is how should government, how should the Congress, how should the administration deal with it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Anybody who thinks there wasn't censorship is wrong. There was a public survey taken. 13,000 something responses came in, mostly all giving instances of this kind of censorship.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Yes. So what is this administration going to do about it? I mean, I spoke with President Trump just about, I don't know, two weeks ago or so, when he called into the program, and I said to him, \"look, do you want to see regulation here? Do you want to see - how are you going to get these guys to stop doing what they're doing if, in fact, this is the reality,\" because if you've seen the censorship of conservatives now, wait until we get knee-deep into 2020. Here's what the president said to me two weeks ago. Watch this, Secretary.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Mr. President, you mentioned technology companies. How concerned are you that technology companies are censoring conservatives, and they're going to do this right up to the 2020 election?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNTIED STATES</emphasis>:  Well, they're doing it to me on Twitter. I mean, what they did to me on Twitter's incredible. You know, I have, you know, millions and millions of followers, but I will tell you they make it very hard for people to join me on Twitter. And they make it very much harder for me to get out the message.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>      And he went on to say - when I said to him do you want to see new regulation; he said you - I said or do you prefer just seeing competition in the marketplace? He said you might need legislation in order to get the competition.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Well that could be. It's - this is a whole new area for us to explore, but I think the underlying question is it's not appropriate for this kind of censorship. They've been given a get out of jail free card by the Congress, saying that if you're not the creating media, you don't have certain responsibilities.  </p><p>      Well to me, censorship is creating media, it's creating content, and if they're going to start doing that, they better think about the consequences.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  All right, let me - let me switch gears, ask you about trade, futures are higher this morning, or mixed after the markets took a hit yesterday on President Trump's comments that a deal with China may still be out of reach.  </p><p>      Here's what the president said, watch.  </p><p>      (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TRUMP</emphasis>:  We have a long way to go as far as tariffs, where China's concerned -- if we want we have another $325 billion that we can put a tariff on if we want. So we're talking to China about a deal, but I wish they didn't break the deal that we had.  </p><p>      (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  So is it fair to say it's probably a long time before we actually see deals here, what do you think, Secretary? Where are we?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Well as you know, I've said repeatedly this is not a 10 minute process. This is a long, involved process. The fundamental question now though, is will they go back to the point where we were before they change their mind and backtracked on some of the understandings that had been reached.  </p><p>      That's the important issue right now, and that's what's being probed in telephone conversation. And the outcome of those phone conversations is what will help determine whether there is in the next meeting, and if so, when.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Do you have - do you have any optimism or encouragement that they are planning to stop the theft of IP? Isn't that one of the big ticket items? Real quick,  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Well the big ticket items are the structural reforms, the theft of IP, the unlevel playing field and procurement, the subsidies, all those. But there's another - in some ways even bigger issue, and that is what is:  the U.S. enforcement capability in the event that they violate the agreements.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Right, sure, yes, you were talking about that before.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  That's the real key. That's the real key.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  And real quick before you go, Secretary, on USMCA, I was speaking to a high profile senator over the last week, and he said I'm not expecting Nancy Pelosi to bring it to the floor at all.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Well it would be a real dereliction of duty if she did not. This is the biggest and the best trade deal this country has ever made. And it's quite ridiculous that many Democrats in the Congress voted for NAFTA. NAFTA was not only a disaster but paragraph by paragraph USMCA is demonstrably better on all scores, particularly for U.S. manufacturing but also for the digital economy, for intellectual property, for environmental and for labor constraints.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  Well that's - I know, but she doesn't want him to have another victory. We'll just have to wait and see. Real quick before you go, Secretary, there is a report that the president was considering removing you from your post following the Supreme Court defeat on adding the citizenship question to the census, quoting to NBC News, NBC is reporting this, what can you tell us?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Well I was in a trip with the president last Friday; we were in Milwaukee, we were in Cleveland. I was at the cabinet meeting, of course, yesterday and here I am on TV today. I think you ought to go by facts, not by rumors on some other network.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  You got it. Mr. Secretary, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ROSS</emphasis>:  Good to see you, Maria.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTIROMO</emphasis>:  We covered a lot there. Wilbur Ross, always a pleasure, thank you, sir.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKM-7W71-JDPT-T1BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

It was one of the most chaotic trading days ever in the markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is Risk and Reward. I'm Deirdre Bolton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow plunged more than 550 points at session lows. There was an attempt at a rebound and the Dow did close lower but certainly off that very low mark.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oil dropped a big part of the negative sentiment. Prices fell below $27 per barrel, a level not seen since May of 2003.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have you covered from all angles. We are going to start right now from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. My colleague, Lori Rothman there all day. Lori, this one is crazy?</p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: Yes. You think a bit of a roller coaster ride. I think people it couldn't end soon enough for the folks who are working down here. Although I will say that the higher volume and the increase in volatility is great for traders who make a living of all of that action.</p><p>But, yes. I mean, you hit the nail on the head. We were down at the low on the Dow of 566, we came back paring that decline to -- a decline of 250. So, that's about 1.5 percent decline.</p><p>I think what happened here mid-session, traders, investors were starting to look at our levels, testing those late summer losses levels there, and said, you know, how many more consecutive days can oil decline 5 percent, 7 percent, you know. And then they realize maybe this is the low, maybe we're at it.</p><p>For what is worth the Russell comprised of small mid-cap names, managed to close up about half a percent today. And some key sectors also drove the turn around which are very telling what investors how they view the makeup of the U.S. economy.</p><p>So, health care, biotech led the turnaround. In fact, United Health Care led the Dow Jones Industrial average to gain about 2 percent today.</p><p>As I mentioned, oil got clobbered. Chevron off 7 percent. Some of the other winners headline names. Nike, American Express, Microsoft, Apple, from a broad range of industries. So, really this was this was, you know, a statement on what U.S. investors think of the U.S. market and what's going to happen here with the U.S. economy.</p><p>Fed fund futures are now predicting perhaps only one -- more interest rate hike versus two or three they were looking at late last year, which is one rate hike perhaps this year. We'll see what happens. Back to you.</p><p>BOLTON: Lori, thank you so much. I'm going to pick up right on what you just said about oil. As Lori just told that decline a big part of what weighed on the stock market. So, prices in oil, levels not seen in more than 12 and a half years.</p><p>Jeff Flock with me now from the CME. So, Jeff, what were traders telling you how low can oil go?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: Listen, they -- a lot of traders are saying today's move was overplayed because today was the expiration date that the oil price got down lower in the February contract than really it really is. It closed at 26.55, which indeed it looks pretty bad.</p><p>But now the true futures prices, the March contract which is now trading and that over $28, even in the afterhours. Now I'm looking at the latest numbers, you know, we're still well over $28. So, maybe things aren't as bad as they look.</p><p>And then, Deirdre, if you look even farther out to the out months in terms of the futures I just looked at last hour's, these are last quote, but I think they're Germaine, the May quote is $31, the June quote is almost $32, and in December, we were at $35.</p><p>So, the long-range bet oil is that rises even though right now in the short term, you know, it doesn't look good.</p><p>BOLTON: We are going to take your words to heart, Jeff Flock. Thank you so much.</p><p>FLOCK: I hope.</p><p>BOLTON: Joining us there from the CME. So, this markets move was big. It was widespread. It showed up in every asset class. As you were just hearing about.</p><p>My power market panel here with their best advice for your money. Market bull, Michael Lee. Market bear, Lee Munson. Straight to our market bull, Michael Lee. You're the contrarian today. Volatility was the theme. Give me one reason to be optimistic on U.S. stocks.</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, TIGER WEALTH MANAGEMENT FOUNDER &amp; MANAGING PARTNER: Well, you need this volatility. We need to enter new volatility regime if we're going to break out to new all-time highs as where I think we're going. Based on the economic data we're seeing from the U.S. So, you got a great, great numbers on Friday. In terms of retail sales, up 4.6 percent year-over-year, when you take out gasoline sales.</p><p>You look at inflation today, ex food and energy up 2.1 percent. Great jobs number a couple of weeks ago rolling four-week average of job week -- jobless claims. Still at lows that we haven't seen since the 1960s.</p><p>So, the U.S. economy is in en fuego, it's just on fire. So, without this new level of volatility there is no way to break out to new all-time highs. So, it is the silver lining in the horror on the screens.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Lee, let me pick up with this idea of the U.S. economy going strong. Because Royal Dutch Shell is saying it may have to lay off something like 10,000 workers. And part of this is linked to what we've been talking about with oil's decline. How much before other corporations make that kind of decision?</p><p>LEE MUNSON, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS PRESIDENT: They're already making it. Because we've got lagging indicators that what Michael is talking about. You know, we're looking today at jobs and consumer sentiment being good in the past. We're going to start seeing tech companies start laying off that oil is going to have a knock-on effect.</p><p>This is the same thing we talked in 2008, about why we should save or not save General Motors or Ford because you lay off one person who is making big money, it has a cascading effect.</p><p>So, the one thing I want to remind people is that, we don't have volatility yet. I understand that Michael wants to see it. I want volatility to be like me, 40 and over. Look at September of 2011. That's called volatility. We don't even have volatility at same level as the August mini crash.</p><p>And quite frankly, I wrote about this last week in Forbes. We busted through the Columbus Day massacre of 2014. So, we have air underneath there. There is no technicality. I want pessimism. I want everybody including Michael to say we've been in the recession, we're in a bear market, then I'm going to go have a beer with Michael and I want to go be bullish for the rest of the year, but not yet.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. But to your point, we have in your view fallen beneath some key levels that you think are important?</p><p>MUNSON: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>MUNSON: We do. And that's unfortunately there's not a next little level close by. We could be in the 1700s on the S&amp;P.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Michael, defend yourself because I know you have a different point of view or are you just saying, listen, this is a good opportunity for people who want to own stocks, let's say for the next five years, to pick up companies they like?</p><p>LEE: Look, I'm not a day-trader. But to take a step back, the employment numbers are not lagging when they're getting stronger month in and month out. What I think you have here is sovereign wealth fund, who, majority of their money comes from oil are just flushing out the market.</p><p>And when the market sells off like this, all the fast money that pushes the market around, i.e. the hedge funds, their money lines get cut by their risk managers. So, it's very, very difficult to get out there and get loud and get long.</p><p>Bank of America said last week it was the largest buying they've seen in five years from hedge funds buying U.S. equities. So, I mean, this oil as a bad thing for the U.S. is laughable. You know, maybe we should be thinking...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Even when we see job cuts coming, Michael?</p><p>LEE: You know, U.S. consumes 162 billion of gasoline a year. So, $2 off a gallon of gasoline. that's 362 billion. That's millions of jobs and hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. It is a net positive for the economy. We are service-based import economy consumer driven. So, the less we have spent on gas, the more we can spend on other stuff.</p><p>The more the rest of the world goes into hell in a hand basket the better it is for the U.S. consumer. I mean, look, it would be nice if the rest the world were stabilized and not getting worse.</p><p>BOLTON: Lee.</p><p>LEE: But, you know, these are positive things for us and it's just going to continue to get better.</p><p>BOLTON: Lee, what is your point, because Michael's point is well-taken of course. But the ideas we are all now interconnected, right? We heard from China yesterday, slowest growth - China is the world's second largest economy - slowest growth in GDP figures for that country in 25 years. So, to what extent are we affected by other countries?</p><p>MUNSON: We are because it's going to affect the price of our dollar which has been one of the saving graces of profits. And also, this idea that oil is laughable that it doesn't matter, you start telling some of my clients here that are having to lay off people who buy other goods and services because they're simply no business in the gas and oil patch.</p><p>This is a major part of the U.S. economy. And while I get the idea that it's cheaper gas, not if you're not making any money. I think China is a real issue, but I think that China is actually leading right now. And I think if you want to buy value, look at China, look at Europe. They are already in a bear market. They've had a 20 percent correction. That's where value is right now.</p><p>I think in the U.S. you've got to wait. And I think if you want to buy for the next five years, why not just wait for another couple of weeks to see if we can go even lower. You've got nothing to lose if you're long-term investor, right?</p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, I hear what you're saying, you're saying don't buy but don't sell. Just wait to see what else develops. I'm going to take a page, though, from Michael's book. Because I did some research, 2008, 2009, in that 24-month period, if you were say, owning stocks, S&amp;P 500 as the index, you lost 24 percent.</p><p>But then, by 2012, you had made up your money. So, does this just mean for people who do have patience, that is to say not people who are trying to retire next year, there are opportunities and they should be buying?</p><p>LEE: Oh, I'm sorry, me?</p><p>BOLTON: Go ahead, Lee.</p><p>MUNSON: You know, I think so. I think that we're about 60, we're about 3 or 4 percent from a full bear market in the S&amp;P 500. My point is very simple. Because we broke those key levels, and because we have such a shocking crazy thing about oil, I don't see why we need to necessarily rush in.</p><p>I think that what I've told my cleaners is that my bear suit is getting old, and then in the next couple weeks or next couple of months, I'm going to turn it in and I want the bull suit out of the closet. But, I don't think because we went below those levels from August that people should see today as the big green light.</p><p>I want to see the VIX at 40, and then I will be like I said with...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: You want everyone to give up and you want to take Michael Lee, our market bull for a bear. That's very generous of you, Lee Munson. Thank you very much. Lee Munson, our market bear. Michael Lee, our market bull.</p><p>Well, volatility so far the theme of the year. If you're close to retirement as we were just talking about, our next experts will give you their best advice.</p><p>Also, we're going to be talking about how you can avoid working more years than you plan to.</p><p>The East Coast may get hit by an epic blizzard. The storm may affect more than 50 million people. But don't panic. Don't clear the grocery store shelves just yet. We're going to bring you the latest information on where the storm precisely is most likely to hit.</p><p>And the Senate voting today on such a key issue that two high-profile Senate republicans took time from the presidential campaign trail to cast their votes. Senator John Thune agrees with both, that is to say, Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio on blocking 10,000 Syrian refugees from coming to the U.S.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: The East Coast likely to get hit by a mega snowstorm. More than 50 million people may be affected. Rick Reichmuth with me now from the weather center. So, Rick, certain parts of the U.S. could get something like two feet of snow?</p><p>RICK REICHMUTH, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>METEOROLOGIST: Yes. I think we'll certainly see some two feet snowfall totals from the storm. Probably areas of Virginia and West Virginia. I will show you that. One storm right now is moving through, this is not it, but we'll see a few flurries here. If you see those don't think that's the big storm.</p><p>The storm that we're watching is now back across parts of Idaho and Wyoming. And it's a big disturbance right here that over the next day and a half is going to dive down across parts of South and cause big problems for a lot of people.</p><p>We have all kinds of winter storm advisories in effect where you see this blue including southern parts of New Jersey. Really the big concern here is where you have this green and that is blizzard watches in effect. We will likely be seeing blizzard conditions Friday night into Saturday for Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. And possibly that will extend a little bit more around that area.</p><p>I think that's going to be the bulls eye for the storm. This is the future radar. So, tomorrow, this system is going to bring us a lot of rain including severe weather. We could see some tornadoes down across parts of the south tomorrow. You see behind that cold air that gets in, maybe a little bit of snow here across parts of Mississippi and Arkansas.</p><p>I want also to point out areas of Kentucky, maybe into the Carolinas could be looking at some pretty significant icing. That can be devastating. It could looking at some power outages from that. But then Friday, day, we get into the snow, again, parts of West Virginia and Virginia and watch this here, it's all snow for D.C. and Philadelphia right on the border in New York City from this.</p><p>Maybe we're going to see some accumulating snowfall, plowable snow indeed in New York. But the bulls eye is going to be here around the D.C. area. And some of those spots may be over two feet of snow. Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: Rick, thank you as always.</p><p>REICHMUTH: You bet.</p><p>BOLTON: Rick Reichmuth joining me there on this epic snowstorm.</p><p>Well, it was a rocky session in the stock market. The Dow closed down around 1.5 percent after being much lower. So, by some metrics, we're off to the worst start for the U.S. stock market ever.</p><p>If you're close to retiring you may be panicking, but don't. Author of \"Real Money Answers for Every Woman,\" Patrice Washington is here. Also financial advisor, David Waddell. Thank you, both, for being here.</p><p>Patrice, to the person who is counting on retiring in five years' time, what should he or she be doing now?</p><p>PATICE WASHINGTON, \"REAL MONEY ANSWER FOR ALL WOMEN\" AUTHOR: Well, I say the first thing that you do is still determine what you can handle. This is not time to go baseball on what everyone else is doing. And so, you have to look at your comfort level. I'm sure you guys have heard before, you know that investing is not based on the brain, it's based on the stomach and what you can actually handle.</p><p>So, even though this is typically the time you want to be more aggressive, maybe you should back up a little bit and be conservative but just that realistic expectations.</p><p>BOLTON: So, David, we take your point there. Should anyone over 50 be putting more money in cash? Meaning, if this market is setting up to be like the one we saw in 2008 and 2009, is it better to look for safe havens, at least with part of your money?</p><p>DAVID WADDELL, WADDELL &amp; ASSOCIATES CEO: I think it's too hard to know. And I think anybody who is 50 may have a life expectancy of another 30 years, 40 years. There has never been a 20-year period where the stock market actually produced negative returns.</p><p>If you go back 20 years, it's been compounding a 10 percent a year, which by the way, is its long term historic rate of return.</p><p>So, I think the first thing investors need to do is refer to their financial plan. And if the financial plan calls for rate of return above 5 percent, then you need some stocks in your portfolio. And you know, over time stocks produce 10 bond, it produce five. You know, figure out what you're required rate of return is and split up the portfolio, and you just kind of got to hold on. It's easy to predict where the bond is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: David, it sounds easy, but how do you choose? What is your advice when you say you need stocks? Do you say, OK, do the research, the Peter Lynch model, buy what you know? That is to say if you happen to like Apple products, you use it. If you watch Netflix, you buy Netflix, is that the advice that you give to your clients?</p><p>WADDELL: No. But then again we're professional financial planners and advisors. And so, the first thing you ought to do is hire good people like the people at Waddell and Associates, right? So, get a good trusted advisor who can also act as psychologist for you and help hold your hand through tumultuous period.</p><p>Because the reality is, the market goes down 33 percent of the time, that's just part of the game.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Which gets back to what Patrice said about investing, keeping in mind, your own tolerance for risk. So, Patrice, on that note, when people reach out to you, do you suggest that they buy what they know, or do you suggest something else?</p><p>WASHINGTON: Well, I suggest that they also go to a professional. You know, that's the first thing. But I do also suggest that they think about diversifying and not keeping all their eggs in one basket. And that goes beyond the classes. That goes beyond the stocks and bonds and short term investments.</p><p>It goes even deeper in each of those classes, what are the different companies that appeal to you.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. We will leave it there. Short, sweet, to the point. Patrice Washington, David Waddell. Thank you very much.</p><p>WADDELL: Thank you.</p><p>WASHINGTON: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Congress investigating an increase in number of terror plots hatched by foreign-born residents. Also, the Department of Homeland Security warning that more than half a million foreigners overstayed their visas. We will see if there is a connection in some cases.</p><p>Also, a huge vote in the Senate today, so important that two GOP presidential candidates left the campaign trail to be in D.C. At issue, blocking 10,000 Syrian refugees from coming to the U.S.</p><p>My guest is Senator John Thune says we need to hold off on allowing refugees in. He says democrats are making a grave mistake in arguing the counter point. Senator Thune is my guest next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: In all 50 states we have opened terrorism investigations related to number of dimensions of the threat. In all 50 states we have ISIL radicalization cases under investigation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Senate democrats want to let Syrian and Iraqi refugees into the U.S. Republicans say it would be huge mistake.</p><p>Republican Senator from South Dakota, John Thune is with me now. Senator, glad to have you here.</p><p>JOHN THUNE, SOUTH DAKOTA SENATOR: Nice to be here. Thanks, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: Senators Rubio and Cruz went to D.C. today, in other words, even got off the campaign trail which is hot to try to address this issue. What happened?</p><p>THUNE: Well, what happened, Deirdre, was a bill came over from the House, that calls for vetting certification by the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Director of National Intelligence, that refugees coming into this country do not present a security risk to people in this country.</p><p>So, it's a simple, fairly simple bill. I think a fairly reasonable bill. We tried to call it up today to just be able to debate it and amend it and the democrats blocked it from even being considered. It's called the motion to proceed. It takes 60 votes to get on a bill. And the democrats had the requisite number to stop it. So, that's what happened on the floor today.</p><p>It's a big issue. It's an issue. It's important to our national security and one that I think needs to be addressed and the fact that the democrats were willing, on this procedural vote today to block it, I think is going to be very difficult for them to defend.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Senator, I want to ask you, because you introduced an amendment to the bill that would give governors the ability to refuse taking refugees. Did the Senate and any of the democrats or anyone you're speaking with recognize that each state, that is to say, the governor, understands resources and the difference in resources in his or her state?</p><p>THUNE: Right. Unfortunately, Deirdre, because the democrats blocked this, prevented us from even getting on the bill, I didn't get an opportunity to debate or have that amendment voted on. But I filed it. And it's very -- yes, it's very simple.</p><p>We heard from 30 governors last year who want to be able to have some control over their borders and who comes in. And so, all of this simply would have done is allow them to have more participation in that process to meet with the Secretary of State's Office when they're having these discussions about vetting refugees.</p><p>And hopefully, to have more input into it. And then if they, you know, if they decide that there are concerns that their state has about admitting certain people, that they would be able not to have to do that. So, that's what the amendment did.</p><p>But unfortunately we didn't get a chance to amend -- or to debate that simply because they blocked the consideration of the bill.</p><p>BOLTON: The Governor of Kansas was with us a few weeks ago. And he said he is very concerned for his resident's safety, which is the point that you made right when we began speaking.</p><p>I want to ask you also about something, Senator, that you wrote, an op-ed style of piece on President Obama and the numerous executive orders that he is trying to pass in his last year in office. We just want to bring our viewers up to speed with some comments that the president made back in 2014.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: I've got a pen and I've got a phone. I've got a pen to take executive actions where Congress won't and I've got a telephone. I've got a pen and I've got a phone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, this message that in his last year of office was the implication, obviously when he was speaking in 2014, that he was just going to try to push through unilaterally as much as possible. To what extent is this tarnishing his legacy?</p><p>THUNE: Well, and I think even this week, his spokesperson said that he is going to be audacious in using executive action to accomplish his objectives. And the problem with that, I tried to point this out in the op- ed, Deirdre, is if you live by executive action you're going to die by executive action.</p><p>And if he's really interested in having a legacy he gave that up when he determined that he was going to go around to the Congress basically, ignore the people's representatives and try and accomplish his agenda through regulatory action, executive orders and that sort of thing.</p><p>And what that means is, that can be overturned by the next president. And many of his executive actions have ended up in the courts. And the courts have ruled against him. So his, much of his agenda, the things that he wanted to accomplish have been done by executive order which is a very fleeting accomplishment.</p><p>It doesn't endure and it's not going to stand the test of time. And I think that this president is going to go down in history as somebody who tried to assert more power if the Executive Branch, probably than anybody since Woodrow Wilson. And that's not a good formula for how to get things done for the American people.</p><p>BOLTON: And even as you rightly point out, Senator, from a practical standpoint, if the Supreme Court is going to be forced to check some of these measures, it's a use of everyone's time. Senator John Thune, thank you as always, joining us there...</p><p>THUNE: Thanks, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: ... from Capitol Hill.</p><p>More market mayhem when we come back. Some details that may be useful to you as you try to manage your portfolio. Apple, you can see on the charts there. We're going to talk about this price point of $100 per stock if Apple goes back over that, if it's a good buy. We'll discuss it.</p><p>Also, President Obama said, one big regret was not getting along with Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: It is one of the few regrets of my presidency, that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: My next guest, two Senate leaders who never got along but now it's different. Former Senator Trent Lott, former Senator Tom Daschle. They are going to be joining me in just two minutes.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST: It was a wild market day. The Dow down by more than 550 points at its session low. Fox Business' Gerri Willis with me now. Gerri, you were watching right along with me. Winners and losers, I know you were picking them out, what did you find?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER: Let me tell you, what a day. A total rollercoaster. When I first started watching the markets all Dow stocks were down. But now by the end of session we've actually got some winners here. United Health got 1.96 percent. That was a winner on the day. Nike, up 1.23 percent. MX, marginally higher, Microsoft, marginally higher, Apple, marginally higher, up 13/100, believe it or not.</p><p>But you got to say positive is good here. On the other side, the flip side, the losers, IBM. Now remember that IBM had a bad report showing that its revenues now for 15 consecutive quarters have turned it down. IBM, down 4.88 percent. That accounts for 41 Dow points. Think about that.</p><p>Exxon, down. Oil obviously a big loser here down 4.21 percent. Cisco down 3.98 percent. A big tech company, you've got to think that they're selling into overseas markets; maybe it's the worry over those. Boeing as well, 3.1 percent. Chevron, another oil stock down 3.1 percent.</p><p>It's hard to imagine but oil is down 74 percent from its highs. These stocks continuing to languish. And when you look at the sectors on the day, healthcare had the best performance, energy had the worst predictably. Deirdre, back to you.</p><p>BOLTON: Predictably, indeed with as you rightly point out, Gerri. Oil trading at more than a 12-year low. Gerri Willis, thank you so much.</p><p>WILLIS: You're welcome.</p><p>BOLTON: Volatility in the markets, volatility in D.C. as well. Both sides of the aisle blaming each other for a lack of progress and financial waste.</p><p>Republicans, for example, blaming the divide on D.C. on President Obama and his overreached in executive action.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: It's one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.</p><p>I told my administration to keep looking every single for actions we can take without Congress.</p><p>With Congress, we're on my own.</p><p>Now I'm going to be working with Congress where I can to accomplish this. But I'm also going to act on my own if Congress is deadlocked.</p><p>Where Congress isn't acting I'll act on my own.</p><p>Whenever and wherever, I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunities for more American families, that's what I'm going to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: My next two guests know a thing or two about duking it out on the Hill in years' past.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM DASCHLE, FORMER SOUTH DAKOTA SENATOR: And we are getting a resounding no on the other side of the aisle. We are getting an absolute emphatic no with an exclamation point. We got to find a way with which to address this bill in a more consequential and productive way.</p><p>TRENT LOTT, FORMER MISSISSIPPI SENATOR: This thing has done as I said in other forums. This has become a problem of greed. Do you want to do something about this problem or do you want to play games. It's not clear to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Former Senate majority leader, here they are, democrat Tom Daschle and republican Trent Lott, they say that partisan gridlock has become a national crisis and have authored a new book called \"Crisis Point.\" Which I must say is a great read. I am so pleased to have you both here.</p><p>LOTT: Thank you for having us, Deirdre.</p><p>DASCHLE: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: So, thank you for coming in. What can we learn -- I'm going to start with you, Senator Daschle, about the future based on what you have seen in the past?</p><p>DASCHLE: Well, I think what we need to know about the future is just what kind of cooperation, what kind of communication, what kinds of relationship will our political leaders have. How much will the president invite congressional leaders to work together? How much will congressional reciprocate. That will tell a lot about the quality of governance we're going to see in the next three years.</p><p>BOLTON: Senator Lott, how is it different, how is the environment in Washington, D.C. different? It feels worse now than ever but I want to know from someone who's actually been there.</p><p>LOTT: Well, first, in the book we talk about there were difficult times in history going back to the period of our founding father. I mean, Berg did kill Hamilton and Jefferson hated Adams, and so forth. And of course we have this war here.</p><p>It is the worse I've seen in the 50 years that I've been watching it pretty closely, as a political science major and as a lawyer and being in Washington and Congress. A whole lot of things have caused this. But these are difficult and different times. They are different people.</p><p>Media is very different, not only, you know, TV, cable...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Oh, I know it, right? And social...</p><p>LOTT: ... but also social media has made a huge impact. But also, I really felt a changing in 2004, slipping and sliding, it was getting meaner spirited. It was also getting more and more difficult to get positive things done in Washington.</p><p>Now, look, there is plenty of blame to go around. Congress, the president, the republicans, the democrats. But those clips that you showed of the president, it agitated me just sitting here. Because, you know, you've got to reach out to the Congress. And you can't just do it on your own.</p><p>BOLTON: Where you had to lead, right?</p><p>LOTT: And, you know, that's one of the number one. We've talked about that, communication, chemistry, leadership and vision. What did the candidates this year want to do for our country? Tell me something positive.</p><p>BOLTON: Speaking of the candidates, when you talk about these qualities that I assume you agree with your fine colleague here...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DASCHLE: I do, strongly.</p><p>BOLTON: ... are necessary, what do you see when, for example, there are business people who want to be leaders, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But what can they bring as far as all those qualities that are necessary to lead?</p><p>DASCHLE: Well, I hope we'll have our leaders who, not only are successful business people or business leaders, but people who understand the importance of the institutions. These institutions were created for a reason. They were giving people an opportunity through their elected leadership to self-govern through our democratic republic.</p><p>These institutions have stood the test of time. What we have to do is respect them. We have to make sure that we continue to let them be that critical element to our democratic republic. If we fail to do that we're going to lose a vital element to democracy as we look forward.</p><p>LOTT: You know, there are awful lot of lawyers in the Congress not enough business men and women and people who out there professions. And I like the fact that business people realize they need to be involved, too. I would like to have more realtors to be involved, for instance.</p><p>My son is been a small businessman and he likes the fact that we got a businessman running for president. However, being President of United States is not something you do learning on the job. You need to have experience. You need to have been in the Congress. So, work in the administration you understand the leaders...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: It's a compromise is a big part of it but when you are the boss, you just get to be the boss, right?</p><p>LOTT: Yes. But, you know, compromise is now considered a dirty word. I don't think it is. In my opinion, it is the art of governing. I mean, Tom and I are friends and I trust Tom and I respect. We didn't agree for a couple of...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: But when -- I was going to say, when you're both on Capitol Hill, you probably didn't feel that generous.</p><p>LOTT: No, we did actually.</p><p>DASCHLE: No, we did actually pass...</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>DASCHLE: ... one of the lessons learned is that, if you build a relationship you can overcome the differences. He's a republican, I'm a democrat. He's center right and I'm to the left. But we found ways with which to bring together the consensus necessary to move this country forward in public policy that brought us a balanced budget, that brought us an array of public policy production that we don't see at the quality and at the volume we need today.</p><p>LOTT: You know, a lot of what we did was not partisan in either way. Safe drinking water, are we for that? That shouldn't be republican or democrat. Affordability of insurance. Telecommunications reform. Adequate military pay for our men and women in uniform. None of those are partisan or shouldn't be when we did those things.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, I hope that all the candidates read your books. Thank you so much for coming in.</p><p>DASCHLE: Thanks for having us.</p><p>BOLTON: Senators Tom Daschle and Trent Lott, glad to have you here.</p><p>When we come back, politicians are pushing Silicon Valley and tech companies to help fight terrorism. We have an attorney who is suing Twitter, blaming the social media company for the rise of ISIS.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: ISIL has used that ubiquitous social media to break the model and push into the United States into the pocket on to the mobile device of troubled souls throughout our country in all 50 states, a twin message. Come or kill. Come or kill.</p><p>Come to the so-called caliphate, live a life of glory, participate in the final battle between good and evil on God's side. Come to the caliphate. If you can't come, kill where you are.</p><p>Social media works to connect us. It works us a way to sell cars or shoes or a movie. It works to crowd source terrorism. And so, starting in the summer of 2014, they really invested in this and it works. It led to troubled souls convincing themselves that there was meaning for them in Syria and Iraq, or that they have should engage in acts of violence in the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARCO RUBIO, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is not an issue of process, it's an issue of information. And there is just not enough information about people coming from Syria. What's inexplicable is that there was information available and that we didn't look at it because of some policy designed to be politically correct and not offend people. That's unacceptable in the time of war.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: That was GOP presidential candidate, Senator Marco Rubio criticizing officials for failing to check social media accounts of the San Bernardino shooters.</p><p>The widow of a defense contractor killed by ISIS is suing Twitter for helping the terrorist's group to grow. Tamara Fields' husband, Carl Fields Jr. was killed in November in Jordan by a lone gunman. Now, ISIS took credit for that atrocity and then promoted it on social media.</p><p>Josh Arisohn is with me now. He is representing Ms. Fields. So, we are glad to have you here, Josh. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>JOSH ARISOHN, MS. FIELDS' LAWYER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BOLTON: What do you think the chances of your case are? Because I'm assuming that all social media platforms come back with the same argument that is to say, we are the pipes, we do not monitor the contents.</p><p>ARISOHN: Well, we feel strong about both the law and the facts in this case and about the case going forward. And, you know, Twitter wasn't just the pipes here. Twitter for a long time has known that ISIS is on social network. And it's been criticized by the White House and members of Congress and the FBI, and it has done little to act.</p><p>And so, if you go on t Twitter today, it's still very easy to find ISIS accounts and tweets and hash tags supporting ISIS.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Josh, you're building your case now as we speak. Are there any lessons to be taken, for example, from fighting child pornography? Because I know that is another issue that a lot of the social media companies have had to deal with where they actually have had to draw a line and say, to your point, OK, we are more than just a plumbing system. We are more than just a dissemination system.</p><p>ARISOHN: Well, the fight against child pornography online is actually a really good model that I think Twitter should follow in the area of terrorism. Using technology they've largely been able to get rid of child pornography on web sites like Twitter.</p><p>And according to the experts that we've spoken to, the same technology or similar technology could be used to eradicate ISIS, once and for all from Twitter. But for whatever reason, Twitter has declined to use that technology.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Josh, how concerned are you at this juncture Twitter stock is in the gutter. The company has really gone through numerous management changes. It seems like it's struggling at this particular moment. Even if you succeed, do you worry about the company's future to even paying Ms. Fields?</p><p>ARISOHN: I'm not really worried about Twitter's finances. We're focused on getting and making Twitter accountable for providing material support to a terrorist organization and trying to get them to influence some changes to get ISIS to get ISIS off of its social network once and for all.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, if you win this would be a big landmark case. We wish you luck.</p><p>ARISOHN: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Thank you, Josh. Josh Arisohn joining me there. He is representing the widow of a contractor who was killed in Jordan.</p><p>If you own gold you were spared some of today's market volatility or at least feeling it in your gut. The precious metal jumping more than 4 percent since the start of the year.</p><p>We are going to speak with my next guest who says gold prices could go even higher. We will also bring you the very latest on Flint, Michigan water crisis. Protesters are calling for the governors to resign. But my next guest says that the real culprit is government spending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've been fighting too long. We need more help. We need Obama to come in here and change these pipes. It's not about anything else. We need the pipes changed in this city. You know, they are talking about giving us filters and going around giving us water? How long is that going to last?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: Stock market volatility showed up in the form of stocks and oil falling and gold rising. Industries often want to hold gold in times of fear or uncertainty.</p><p>RJO Futures, Phil Streible with me now from the CME. So, Phil, given the volatility, how high can gold go?</p><p>PHIL STREIBLE, RJO FUTURES SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST: That's a good question. I really think gold prices could surge a lot higher. I think we could see the 1150 or even 1200. It really depends on how bad the situation deteriorates.</p><p>Now remember, last year, gold prices traveled bound to about, you know, 1050. We are in a rising interest rate environment. We have a stronger dollar and we had created global growth. We are starting to see kind of the opposite effect take place. Not necessarily the dollar index weakening too much but we are seeing other foreign currencies like the Eurozone.</p><p>They are embarking on quantitative easing. Global growth, it seems like it's been tossed out the window. There is a lot of concern about China. And remember, the Fed, they were expected to have four interest rates this year, then it got cut down to two. Now it looks like the Fed funds are pricing in a December rate hike.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, the Fed, oil, China. I want to bring in a few comments here from Harold Hamm. He's a billionaire oil executive. He's actually saying Saudi Arabia is to blame for some of the energy volatility.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAROLD HAMM, OIL AND GAS EXECUTIVE: Oil in a rebalancing situation has come about, basically at the hands of OPEC or primary Saudi Arabia that decided last Thanksgiving, frankly to put, a year ago in 2014, to put the 1.8 million barrels of new oil on the market. Basically, to try to drown out our success as shale players here in the U.S.</p><p>And so, they have been attempting to do that and put us out of business. And, you know, it has an effect. We are down to the lowest rig count since 1999. We've lost quarter million people, direct jobs. About three times that many indirect jobs. So, that's the effect that it's having.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Royal Dutch Shell backing up our gas saying, in fact, it may lay off up to 10,000 people. Do you think is a move by Saudi Arabia to hurt the U.S. energy industry or to hurt the Iranian energy industry?</p><p>STREIBLE: Well, I don't think that they are trying to hurt anybody. I think that they are in a race against Iran as far as getting oil into the system.</p><p>I remember, you know, we'll probably going to see Iran pump about 500,000 barrels a day. So, the thing is that, they weren't trying to hurt them. They're just trying to get ahead. As far as the U.S., it's all just a, you know, a technological change. We had now the ability to frack oil and produce quite a bit of it.</p><p>But Saudi Arabia doesn't want to let up any of that market share. So, of course, it's going to drive businesses out of, you know, business. A credit crisis is probably going to occur. And I think once you see a credit crisis occur in the oil and gas industry, then I think finally a bottom may be in place because our production will have already peaked.</p><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p>STREIBLE: You know, it picked last year at 9.6 million. I think we come back down into the 7's before we start to turn back around.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, Phil. Great to have you here. Thank you. Phil Streible joining me there from the CME.</p><p>Protesters are calling for the governor to step down in Flint, Michigan over the water crisis. My next guest says people should actually be looking at their own frivolous spending. And by that, he means the states and the federal government.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON: TransPro Consulting CEO, Mark Aesch joining me with how much the government in Flint, Michigan knew about the water crisis, when and to what extent overspending contributed to the crisis there now.</p><p>So, Mark, I'm very glad to have you with me. What can the city of Flint, Michigan do now?</p><p>MARK AESCH, TRANSPRO CONSULTING CEO: Well, I got to tell you. You couldn't help but notice today the mayor's comments at the White House when she was meeting with, you know, the president and others where she talked about the short-sightedness that the leadership in Michigan has provided from the state.</p><p>The reality is, it's the short-sightedness of the city itself where they were spending 60 percent more money than they took in every year that really caused this entire crisis.</p><p>They had purchased water from Detroit for years and it was fine. Because they went into receivership, because they were spending too much money, that's really what caused this crisis to be where it is today.</p><p>BOLTON: Mark, please come back. I would like to talk more about this. Mark Aesch, joining me these saying overspending is part of the problem in Flint, Michigan. He will join us another day, I hope.</p><p>Thank you for joining us here on Risk and Reward.

It was  one of the most chaotic trading days ever in the markets. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is Risk and Reward. I'm Deirdre Bolton. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow plunged more than 550 points at session lows. There was an attempt  at a rebound and the Dow did close lower but certainly off that very low  mark. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oil dropped a big part of the negative sentiment. Prices fell below $27 per  barrel, a level not seen since May of 2003. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have you covered from all angles. We are going to start right now from  the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. My colleague, Lori Rothman there  all day. Lori, this one is crazy? </p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes. You think a bit of a roller  coaster ride. I think people it couldn't end soon enough for the folks who  are working down here. Although I will say that the higher volume and the  increase in volatility is great for traders who make a living of all of  that action. </p><p>But, yes. I mean, you hit the nail on the head. We were down at the low on  the Dow of 566, we came back paring that decline to -- a decline of 250.  So, that's about 1.5 percent decline. </p><p>I think what happened here mid-session, traders, investors were starting to  look at our levels, testing those late summer losses levels there, and  said, you know, how many more consecutive days can oil decline 5 percent, 7  percent, you know. And then they realize maybe this is the low, maybe we're  at it. </p><p>For what is worth the Russell comprised of small mid-cap names, managed to  close up about half a percent today. And some key sectors also drove the  turn around which are very telling what investors how they view the makeup  of the U.S. economy. </p><p>So, health care, biotech led the turnaround. In fact, United Health Care  led the Dow Jones Industrial average to gain about 2 percent today. </p><p>As I mentioned, oil got clobbered. Chevron off 7 percent. Some of the other  winners headline names. Nike, American Express, Microsoft, Apple, from a  broad range of industries. So, really this was this was, you know, a  statement on what U.S. investors think of the U.S. market and what's going  to happen here with the U.S. economy. </p><p>Fed fund futures are now predicting perhaps only one -- more interest rate  hike versus two or three they were looking at late last year, which is one  rate hike perhaps this year. We'll see what happens. Back to you.</p><p>BOLTON:  Lori, thank you so much. I'm going to pick up right on what you  just said about oil. As Lori just told that decline a big part of what  weighed on the stock market. So, prices in oil, levels not seen in more  than 12 and a half years. </p><p>Jeff Flock with me now from the CME. So, Jeff, what were traders telling  you how low can oil go? </p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Listen, they -- a lot of traders are  saying today's move was overplayed because today was the expiration date  that the oil price got down lower in the February contract than really it  really is. It closed at 26.55, which indeed it looks pretty bad. </p><p>But now the true futures prices, the March contract which is now trading  and that over $28, even in the afterhours. Now I'm looking at the latest  numbers, you know, we're still well over $28. So, maybe things aren't as  bad as they look. </p><p>And then, Deirdre, if you look even farther out to the out months in terms  of the futures I just looked at last hour's, these are last quote, but I  think they're Germaine, the May quote is $31, the June quote is almost $32,  and in December, we were at $35. </p><p>So, the long-range bet oil is that rises even though right now in the short  term, you know, it doesn't look good. </p><p>BOLTON:  We are going to take your words to heart, Jeff Flock. Thank you so  much.</p><p>FLOCK:  I hope.</p><p>BOLTON:  Joining us there from the CME. So, this markets move was big. It  was widespread. It showed up in every asset class. As you were just hearing  about.</p><p>My power market panel here with their best advice for your money. Market  bull, Michael Lee. Market bear, Lee Munson. Straight to our market bull,  Michael Lee. You're the contrarian today. Volatility was the theme. Give me  one reason to be optimistic on U.S. stocks. </p><p>MICHAEL LEE, TIGER WEALTH MANAGEMENT FOUNDER &amp; MANAGING PARTNER:  Well,  you  need this volatility. We need to enter new volatility regime if we're going  to break out to new all-time highs as where I think we're going. Based on  the economic data we're seeing from the U.S. So, you got a great, great  numbers on Friday. In terms of retail sales, up 4.6 percent year-over-year,  when you take out gasoline sales. </p><p>You look at inflation today, ex food and energy up 2.1 percent. Great jobs  number a couple of weeks ago rolling four-week average of job week --  jobless claims. Still at lows that we haven't seen since the 1960s. </p><p>So, the U.S. economy is in en fuego, it's just on fire. So, without this  new level of volatility there is no way to break out to new all-time highs.  So, it is the silver lining in the horror on the screens. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Lee, let me pick up with this idea of the U.S. economy going  strong. Because Royal Dutch Shell is saying it may have to lay off  something like 10,000 workers. And part of this is linked to what we've  been talking about with oil's decline. How much before other corporations  make that kind of decision? </p><p>LEE MUNSON, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS PRESIDENT:  They're already making  it. Because we've got lagging indicators that what Michael is talking  about. You know, we're looking today at jobs and consumer sentiment being  good in the past. We're going to start seeing tech companies start laying  off that oil is going to have a knock-on effect.</p><p>This is the same thing we talked in 2008, about why we should save or not  save General Motors or Ford because you lay off one person who is making  big money, it has a cascading effect. </p><p>So, the one thing I want to remind people is that, we don't have volatility  yet. I understand that Michael wants to see it. I want volatility to be  like me, 40 and over. Look at September of 2011. That's called volatility.  We don't even have volatility at same level as the August mini crash. </p><p>And quite frankly, I wrote about this last week in Forbes. We busted  through the Columbus Day massacre of 2014. So, we have air underneath  there. There is no technicality. I want pessimism. I want everybody  including Michael to say we've been in the recession, we're in a bear  market, then I'm going to go have a beer with Michael and I want to go be  bullish for the rest of the year, but not yet. </p><p>BOLTON:  OK. But to your point, we have in your view fallen beneath some  key levels that you think are important? </p><p>MUNSON:  Yes. </p><p>BOLTON:  OK.</p><p>MUNSON:  We do. And that's unfortunately there's not a next little level  close by. We could be in the 1700s on the S&amp;P. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Michael, defend yourself because I know you have a  different point of view or are you just saying, listen, this is a good  opportunity for people who want to own stocks, let's say for the next five  years, to pick up companies they like? </p><p>LEE:  Look, I'm not a day-trader. But to take a step back, the employment  numbers are not lagging when they're getting stronger month in and month  out. What I think you have here is sovereign wealth fund, who, majority of  their money comes from oil are just flushing out the market. </p><p>And when the market sells off like this, all the fast money that pushes the  market around, i.e. the hedge funds, their money lines get cut by their  risk managers. So, it's very, very difficult to get out there and get loud  and get long. </p><p>Bank of America said last week it was the largest buying they've seen in  five years from hedge funds buying U.S. equities. So, I mean, this oil as a  bad thing for the U.S. is laughable. You know, maybe we should be  thinking...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Even when we see job cuts coming, Michael? </p><p>LEE:  You know, U.S. consumes 162 billion of gasoline a year. So, $2 off a  gallon of gasoline. that's 362 billion. That's millions of jobs and  hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. It is a net positive for the  economy. We are service-based import economy consumer driven. So, the less  we have spent on gas, the more we can spend on other stuff. </p><p>The more the rest of the world goes into hell in a hand basket the better  it is for the U.S. consumer. I mean, look, it would be nice if the rest the  world were stabilized and not getting worse. </p><p>BOLTON:  Lee.</p><p>LEE:  But, you know, these are positive things for us and it's just going  to continue to get better. </p><p>BOLTON:  Lee, what is your point, because Michael's point is well-taken of  course. But the ideas we are all now interconnected, right? We heard from  China yesterday, slowest growth - China is the world's second largest  economy - slowest growth in GDP figures for that country in 25 years. So,  to what extent are we affected by other countries? </p><p>MUNSON:  We are because it's going to affect the price of our dollar which  has been one of the saving graces of profits. And also, this idea that oil  is laughable that it doesn't matter, you start telling some of my clients  here that are having to lay off people who buy other goods and services  because they're simply no business in the gas and oil patch. </p><p>This is a major part of the U.S. economy. And while I get the idea that  it's cheaper gas, not if you're not making any money. I think China is a  real issue, but I think that China is actually leading right now. And I  think if you want to buy value, look at China, look at Europe. They are  already in a bear market. They've had a 20 percent correction. That's where  value is right now. </p><p>I think in the U.S. you've got to wait. And I think if you want to buy for  the next five years, why not just wait for another couple of weeks to see  if we can go even lower. You've got nothing to lose if you're long-term  investor, right? </p><p>BOLTON:  OK. So, I hear what you're saying, you're saying don't buy but  don't sell. Just wait to see what else develops. I'm going to take a page,  though, from Michael's book. Because I did some research, 2008, 2009, in  that 24-month period, if you were say, owning stocks, S&amp;P 500 as the index,  you lost 24 percent. </p><p>But then, by 2012, you had made up your money. So, does this just mean for  people who do have patience, that is to say not people who are trying to  retire next year, there are opportunities and they should be buying? </p><p>LEE:  Oh, I'm sorry, me? </p><p>BOLTON:  Go ahead, Lee. </p><p>MUNSON:  You know, I think so. I think that we're about 60, we're about 3  or 4 percent from a full bear market in the S&amp;P 500. My point is very  simple. Because we broke those key levels, and because we have such a  shocking crazy thing about oil, I don't see why we need to necessarily rush  in. </p><p>I think that what I've told my cleaners is that my bear suit is getting  old, and then in the next couple weeks or next couple of months, I'm going  to turn it in and I want the bull suit out of the closet. But, I don't  think because we went below those levels from August that people should see  today as the big green light. </p><p>I want to see the VIX at 40, and then I will be like I said with...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  You want everyone to give up and you want to take Michael Lee, our  market bull for a bear. That's very generous of you, Lee Munson. Thank you  very much. Lee Munson, our market bear. Michael Lee, our market bull.</p><p>Well, volatility so far the theme of the year. If you're close to  retirement as we were just talking about, our next experts will give you  their best advice. </p><p>Also, we're going to be talking about how you can avoid working more years  than you plan to. </p><p>The East Coast may get hit by an epic blizzard. The storm may affect more  than 50 million people. But don't panic. Don't clear the grocery store  shelves just yet. We're going to bring you the latest information on where  the storm precisely is most likely to hit. </p><p>And the Senate voting today on such a key issue that two high-profile  Senate republicans took time from the presidential campaign trail to cast  their votes. Senator John Thune agrees with both, that is to say, Senators  Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio on blocking 10,000 Syrian refugees from coming to  the U.S. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  The East Coast likely to get hit by a mega snowstorm. More than 50  million people may be affected. Rick Reichmuth with me now from the weather  center. So, Rick, certain parts of the U.S. could get something like two  feet of snow? </p><p>RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST:  Yes. I think we'll certainly see  some two feet snowfall totals from the storm. Probably areas of Virginia  and West Virginia. I will show you that. One storm right now is moving  through, this is not it, but we'll see a few flurries here. If you see  those don't think that's the big storm. </p><p>The storm that we're watching is now back across parts of Idaho and  Wyoming. And it's a big disturbance right here that over the next day and a  half is going to dive down across parts of South and cause big problems for  a lot of people. </p><p>We have all kinds of winter storm advisories in effect where you see this  blue including southern parts of New Jersey. Really the big concern here is  where you have this green and that is blizzard watches in effect. We will  likely be seeing blizzard conditions Friday night into Saturday for  Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. And possibly that will extend a little bit  more around that area. </p><p>I think that's going to be the bulls eye for the storm. This is the future  radar. So, tomorrow, this system is going to bring us a lot of rain  including severe weather. We could see some tornadoes down across parts of  the south tomorrow. You see behind that cold air that gets in, maybe a  little bit of snow here across parts of Mississippi and Arkansas. </p><p>I want also to point out areas of Kentucky, maybe into the Carolinas could  be looking at some pretty significant icing. That can be devastating. It  could looking at some power outages from that. But then Friday, day, we get  into the snow, again, parts of West Virginia and Virginia and watch this  here, it's all snow for D.C. and Philadelphia right on the border in New  York City from this. </p><p>Maybe we're going to see some accumulating snowfall, plowable snow indeed  in New York. But the bulls eye is going to be here around the D.C. area.  And some of those spots may be over two feet of snow. Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON:  Rick, thank you as always.</p><p>REICHMUTH:  You bet.</p><p>BOLTON:  Rick Reichmuth joining me there on this epic snowstorm. </p><p>Well, it was a rocky session in the stock market. The Dow closed down  around 1.5 percent after being much lower. So, by some metrics, we're off  to the worst start for the U.S. stock market ever. </p><p>If you're close to retiring you may be panicking, but don't. Author of  \"Real Money Answers for Every Woman,\" Patrice Washington is here. Also  financial advisor, David Waddell. Thank you, both, for being here. </p><p>Patrice, to the person who is counting on retiring in five years' time,  what should he or she be doing now? </p><p>PATICE WASHINGTON, \"REAL MONEY ANSWER FOR ALL WOMEN\" AUTHOR:  Well, I say  the first thing that you do is still determine what you can handle. This is  not time to go baseball on what everyone else is doing. And so, you have to  look at your comfort level. I'm sure you guys have heard before, you know  that investing is not based on the brain, it's based on the stomach and  what you can actually handle. </p><p>So, even though this is typically the time you want to be more aggressive,  maybe you should back up a little bit and be conservative but just that  realistic expectations. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, David, we take your point there. Should anyone over 50 be  putting more money in cash? Meaning, if this market is setting up to be  like the one we saw in 2008 and 2009, is it better to look for safe havens,  at least with part of your money? </p><p>DAVID WADDELL, WADDELL &amp; ASSOCIATES CEO:  I think it's too hard to know.  And I think anybody who is 50 may have a life expectancy of another 30  years, 40 years. There has never been a 20-year period where the stock  market actually produced negative returns. </p><p>If you go back 20 years, it's been compounding a 10 percent a year, which  by the way, is its long term historic rate of return. </p><p>So, I think the first thing investors need to do is refer to their  financial plan. And if the financial plan calls for rate of return above 5  percent, then you need some stocks in your portfolio. And you know, over  time stocks produce 10 bond, it produce five. You know, figure out what  you're required rate of return is and split up the portfolio, and you just  kind of got to hold on. It's easy to predict where the bond is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BOLTON:  David, it sounds easy, but how do you choose? What is your advice  when you say you need stocks? Do you say, OK, do the research, the Peter  Lynch model, buy what you know? That is to say if you happen to like Apple  products, you use it. If you watch Netflix, you buy Netflix, is that the  advice that you give to your clients? </p><p>WADDELL:  No. But then again we're professional financial planners and  advisors. And so, the first thing you ought to do is hire good people like  the people at Waddell and Associates, right? So, get a good trusted advisor  who can also act as psychologist for you and help hold your hand through  tumultuous period. </p><p>Because the reality is, the market goes down 33 percent of the time, that's  just part of the game. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. Which gets back to what Patrice said about investing,  keeping in mind, your own tolerance for risk. So, Patrice, on that note,  when people reach out to you, do you suggest that they buy what they know,  or do you suggest something else? </p><p>WASHINGTON:  Well, I suggest that they also go to a professional. You know,  that's the first thing. But I do also suggest that they think about  diversifying and not keeping all their eggs in one basket. And that goes  beyond the classes. That goes beyond the stocks and bonds and short term  investments. </p><p>It goes even deeper in each of those classes, what are the different  companies that appeal to you. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right. We will leave it there. Short, sweet, to the point.  Patrice Washington, David Waddell. Thank you very much. </p><p>WADDELL:  Thank you.</p><p>WASHINGTON:  Thank you. </p><p>BOLTON:  Congress investigating an increase in number of terror plots  hatched by foreign-born residents. Also, the Department of Homeland  Security warning that more than half a million foreigners overstayed their  visas. We will see if there is a connection in some cases.</p><p>Also, a huge vote in the Senate today, so important that two GOP  presidential candidates left the campaign trail to be in D.C. At issue,  blocking 10,000 Syrian refugees from coming to the U.S. </p><p>My guest is Senator John Thune says we need to hold off on allowing  refugees in. He says democrats are making a grave mistake in arguing the  counter point. Senator Thune is my guest next. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR:  In all 50 states we have opened terrorism  investigations related to number of dimensions of the threat. In all 50  states we have ISIL radicalization cases under investigation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Senate democrats want to let Syrian and Iraqi refugees into the  U.S. Republicans say it would be huge mistake. </p><p>Republican Senator from South Dakota, John Thune is with me now. Senator,  glad to have you here. </p><p>JOHN THUNE, SOUTH DAKOTA SENATOR:  Nice to be here. Thanks, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON:  Senators Rubio and Cruz went to D.C. today, in other words, even  got off the campaign trail which is hot to try to address this issue. What  happened? </p><p>THUNE:  Well, what happened, Deirdre, was a bill came over from the House,  that calls for vetting certification by the Department of Homeland  Security, the FBI, and the Director of National Intelligence, that refugees  coming into this country do not present a security risk to people in this  country. </p><p>So, it's a simple, fairly simple bill. I think a fairly reasonable bill. We  tried to call it up today to just be able to debate it and amend it and the  democrats blocked it from even being considered. It's called the motion to  proceed. It takes 60 votes to get on a bill. And the democrats had the  requisite number to stop it. So, that's what happened on the floor today. </p><p>It's a big issue. It's an issue. It's important to our national security  and one that I think needs to be addressed and the fact that the democrats  were willing, on this procedural vote today to block it, I think is going  to be very difficult for them to defend. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Senator, I want to ask you, because you introduced an  amendment to the bill that would give governors the ability to refuse  taking refugees. Did the Senate and any of the democrats or anyone you're  speaking with recognize that each state, that is to say, the governor,  understands resources and the difference in resources in his or her state? </p><p>THUNE:  Right. Unfortunately, Deirdre, because the democrats blocked this,  prevented us from even getting on the bill, I didn't get an opportunity to  debate or have that amendment voted on. But I filed it. And it's very --  yes, it's very simple. </p><p>We heard from 30 governors last year who want to be able to have some  control over their borders and who comes in. And so, all of this simply  would have done is allow them to have more participation in that process to  meet with the Secretary of State's Office when they're having these  discussions about vetting refugees. </p><p>And hopefully, to have more input into it. And then if they, you know, if  they decide that there are concerns that their state has about admitting  certain people, that they would be able not to have to do that. So, that's  what the amendment did. </p><p>But unfortunately we didn't get a chance to amend -- or to debate that  simply because they blocked the consideration of the bill. </p><p>BOLTON:  The Governor of Kansas was with us a few weeks ago. And he said he  is very concerned for his resident's safety, which is the point that you  made right when we began speaking. </p><p>I want to ask you also about something, Senator, that you wrote, an op-ed  style of piece on President Obama and the numerous executive orders that he  is trying to pass in his last year in office. We just want to bring our  viewers up to speed with some comments that the president made back in  2014.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT:  I've got a pen and I've  got a phone. I've got a pen to take executive actions where Congress won't  and I've got a telephone. I've got a pen and I've got a phone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  So, this message that in his last year of office was the  implication, obviously when he was speaking in 2014, that he was just going  to try to push through unilaterally as much as possible. To what extent is  this tarnishing his legacy? </p><p>THUNE:  Well, and I think even this week, his spokesperson said that he is  going to be audacious in using executive action to accomplish his  objectives. And the problem with that, I tried to point this out in the op- ed, Deirdre, is if you live by executive action you're going to die by  executive action. </p><p>And if he's really interested in having a legacy he gave that up when he  determined that he was going to go around to the Congress basically, ignore  the people's representatives and try and accomplish his agenda through  regulatory action, executive orders and that sort of thing. </p><p>And what that means is, that can be overturned by the next president. And  many of his executive actions have ended up in the courts. And the courts  have ruled against him. So his, much of his agenda, the things that he  wanted to accomplish have been done by executive order which is a very  fleeting accomplishment. </p><p>It doesn't endure and it's not going to stand the test of time. And I think  that this president is going to go down in history as somebody who tried to  assert more power if the Executive Branch, probably than anybody since  Woodrow Wilson. And that's not a good formula for how to get things done  for the American people. </p><p>BOLTON:  And even as you rightly point out, Senator, from a practical  standpoint, if the Supreme Court is going to be forced to check some of  these measures, it's a use of everyone's time. Senator John Thune, thank  you as always, joining us there... </p><p>THUNE:  Thanks, Deirdre. </p><p>BOLTON:  ... from Capitol Hill.</p><p>More market mayhem when we come back. Some details that may be useful to  you as you try to manage your portfolio. Apple, you can see on the charts  there. We're going to talk about this price point of $100 per stock if  Apple goes back over that, if it's a good buy. We'll discuss it. </p><p>Also, President Obama said, one big regret was not getting along with  Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>OBAMA:  It is one of the few regrets of my presidency, that the rancor and  suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  My next guest, two Senate leaders who never got along but now it's  different. Former Senator Trent Lott, former Senator Tom Daschle. They are  going to be joining me in just two minutes.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST:  It was a wild market day. The Dow  down by more than 550 points at its session low. Fox Business' Gerri Willis  with me now. Gerri, you were watching right along with me. Winners and  losers, I know you were picking them out, what did you find? </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER:  Let me tell you, what a day. A total  rollercoaster. When I first started watching the markets all Dow stocks  were down. But now by the end of session we've actually got some winners  here. United Health got 1.96 percent. That was a winner on the day. Nike,  up 1.23 percent. MX, marginally higher, Microsoft, marginally higher,  Apple, marginally higher, up 13/100, believe it or not. </p><p>But you got to say positive is good here. On the other side, the flip side,  the losers, IBM. Now remember that IBM had a bad report showing that its  revenues now for 15 consecutive quarters have turned it down. IBM, down  4.88 percent. That accounts for 41 Dow points. Think about that.</p><p>Exxon, down. Oil obviously a big loser here down 4.21 percent. Cisco down  3.98 percent. A big tech company, you've got to think that they're selling  into overseas markets; maybe it's the worry over those. Boeing as well, 3.1  percent. Chevron, another oil stock down 3.1 percent. </p><p>It's hard to imagine but oil is down 74 percent from its highs. These  stocks continuing to languish. And when you look at the sectors on the day,  healthcare had the best performance, energy had the worst predictably.  Deirdre, back to you.</p><p>BOLTON:  Predictably, indeed with as you rightly point out, Gerri. Oil  trading at more than a 12-year low. Gerri Willis, thank you so much.</p><p>WILLIS:  You're welcome.</p><p>BOLTON:  Volatility in the markets, volatility in D.C. as well. Both sides  of the aisle blaming each other for a lack of progress and financial waste. </p><p>Republicans, for example, blaming the divide on D.C. on President Obama and  his overreached in executive action.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT:  It's one of the few  regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties  has gotten worse instead of better. </p><p>I told my administration to keep looking every single for actions we can  take without Congress. </p><p>With Congress, we're on my own. </p><p>Now I'm going to be working with Congress where I can to accomplish this.  But I'm also going to act on my own if Congress is deadlocked. </p><p>Where Congress isn't acting I'll act on my own. </p><p>Whenever and wherever, I can take steps without legislation to expand  opportunities for more American families, that's what I'm going to do. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  My next two guests know a thing or two about duking it out on the  Hill in years' past.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM DASCHLE, FORMER SOUTH DAKOTA SENATOR:  And we are getting a resounding  no on the other side of the aisle. We are getting an absolute emphatic no  with an exclamation point. We got to find a way with which to address this  bill in a more consequential and productive way. </p><p>TRENT LOTT, FORMER MISSISSIPPI SENATOR:  This thing has done as I said in  other forums. This has become a problem of greed. Do you want to do  something about this problem or do you want to play games. It's not clear  to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Former Senate majority leader, here they are, democrat Tom Daschle  and republican Trent Lott, they say that partisan gridlock has become a  national crisis and have authored a new book called \"Crisis Point.\" Which I  must say is a great read. I am so pleased to have you both here.</p><p>LOTT:  Thank you for having us, Deirdre.</p><p>DASCHLE:  Thank you. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, thank you for coming in. What can we learn -- I'm going to  start with you, Senator Daschle, about the future based on what you have  seen in the past? </p><p>DASCHLE:  Well, I think what we need to know about the future is just what  kind of cooperation, what kind of communication, what kinds of relationship  will our political leaders have. How much will the president invite  congressional leaders to work together? How much will congressional  reciprocate. That will tell a lot about the quality of governance we're  going to see in the next three years.</p><p>BOLTON:  Senator Lott, how is it different, how is the environment in  Washington, D.C. different? It feels worse now than ever but I want to know  from someone who's actually been there. </p><p>LOTT:  Well, first, in the book we talk about there were difficult times in  history going back to the period of our founding father. I mean, Berg did  kill Hamilton and Jefferson hated Adams, and so forth. And of course we  have this war here.</p><p>It is the worse I've seen in the 50 years that I've been watching it pretty  closely, as a political science major and as a lawyer and being in  Washington and Congress. A whole lot of things have caused this. But these  are difficult and different times. They are different people. </p><p>Media is very different, not only, you know, TV, cable...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  Oh, I know it, right? And social...</p><p>LOTT:  ... but also social media has made a huge impact. But also, I really  felt a changing in 2004, slipping and sliding, it was getting meaner  spirited. It was also getting more and more difficult to get positive  things done in Washington. </p><p>Now, look, there is plenty of blame to go around. Congress, the president,  the republicans, the democrats. But those clips that you showed of the  president, it agitated me just sitting here. Because, you know, you've got  to reach out to the Congress. And you can't just do it on your own. </p><p>BOLTON:  Where you had to lead, right?</p><p>LOTT:  And, you know, that's one of the number one. We've talked about  that, communication, chemistry, leadership and vision. What did the  candidates this year want to do for our country? Tell me something  positive.</p><p>BOLTON:  Speaking of the candidates, when you talk about these qualities  that I assume you agree with your fine colleague here...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DASCHLE:  I do, strongly.</p><p>BOLTON:  ... are necessary, what do you see when, for example, there are  business people who want to be leaders, which is not necessarily a bad  thing. But what can they bring as far as all those qualities that are  necessary to lead? </p><p>DASCHLE:  Well, I hope we'll have our leaders who, not only are successful  business people or business leaders, but people who understand the  importance of the institutions. These institutions were created for a  reason. They were giving people an opportunity through their elected  leadership to self-govern through our democratic republic. </p><p>These institutions have stood the test of time. What we have to do is  respect them. We have to make sure that we continue to let them be that  critical element to our democratic republic. If we fail to do that we're  going to lose a vital element to democracy as we look forward. </p><p>LOTT:  You know, there are awful lot of lawyers in the Congress not enough  business men and women and people who out there professions. And I like the  fact that business people realize they need to be involved, too. I would  like to have more realtors to be involved, for instance. </p><p>My son is been a small businessman and he likes the fact that we got a  businessman running for president. However, being President of United  States is not something you do learning on the job. You need to have  experience. You need to have been in the Congress. So, work in the  administration you understand the leaders...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  It's a compromise is a big part of it but when you are the boss,  you just get to be the boss, right? </p><p>LOTT:  Yes. But, you know, compromise is now considered a dirty word. I  don't think it is. In my opinion, it is the art of governing. I mean, Tom  and I are friends and I trust Tom and I respect. We didn't agree for a  couple of...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON:  But when -- I was going to say, when you're both on Capitol Hill,  you probably didn't feel that generous. </p><p>LOTT:  No, we did actually.</p><p>DASCHLE:  No, we did actually pass...</p><p>BOLTON:  OK.</p><p>DASCHLE:  ... one of the lessons learned is that, if you build a  relationship you can overcome the differences. He's a republican, I'm a  democrat. He's center right and I'm to the left. But we found ways with  which to bring together the consensus necessary to move this country  forward in public policy that brought us a balanced budget, that brought us  an array of public policy production that we don't see at the quality and  at the volume we need today. </p><p>LOTT:  You know, a lot of what we did was not partisan in either way. Safe  drinking water, are we for that? That shouldn't be republican or democrat.  Affordability of insurance. Telecommunications reform. Adequate military  pay for our men and women in uniform. None of those are partisan or  shouldn't be when we did those things. </p><p>BOLTON:  Well, I hope that all the candidates read your books. Thank you so  much for coming in.</p><p>DASCHLE:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>BOLTON:  Senators Tom Daschle and Trent Lott, glad to have you here.</p><p>When we come back, politicians are pushing Silicon Valley and tech  companies to help fight terrorism. We have an attorney who is suing  Twitter, blaming the social media company for the rise of ISIS.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR:  ISIL has used that ubiquitous social media to  break the model and push into the United States into the pocket on to the  mobile device of troubled souls throughout our country in all 50 states, a  twin message. Come or kill. Come or kill. </p><p>Come to the so-called caliphate, live a life of glory, participate in the  final battle between good and evil on God's side. Come to the caliphate. If  you can't come, kill where you are. </p><p>Social media works to connect us. It works us a way to sell cars or shoes  or a movie. It works to crowd source terrorism. And so, starting in the  summer of 2014, they really invested in this and it works. It led to  troubled souls convincing themselves that there was meaning for them in  Syria and Iraq, or that they have should engage in acts of violence in the  United States. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARCO RUBIO, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  This is not an issue of  process, it's an issue of information. And there is just not enough  information about people coming from Syria. What's inexplicable is that  there was information available and that we didn't look at it because of  some policy designed to be politically correct and not offend people.  That's unacceptable in the time of war.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  That was GOP presidential candidate, Senator Marco Rubio  criticizing officials for failing to check social media accounts of the San  Bernardino shooters.</p><p>The widow of a defense contractor killed by ISIS is suing Twitter for  helping the terrorist's group to grow. Tamara Fields' husband, Carl Fields  Jr. was killed in November in Jordan by a lone gunman. Now, ISIS took  credit for that atrocity and then promoted it on social media. </p><p>Josh Arisohn is with me now. He is representing Ms. Fields. So, we are glad  to have you here, Josh. Thanks for coming in. </p><p>JOSH ARISOHN, MS. FIELDS' LAWYER:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BOLTON:  What do you think the chances of your case are? Because I'm  assuming that all social media platforms come back with the same argument  that is to say, we are the pipes, we do not monitor the contents. </p><p>ARISOHN:  Well, we feel strong about both the law and the facts in this  case and about the case going forward. And, you know, Twitter wasn't just  the pipes here. Twitter for a long time has known that ISIS is on social  network. And it's been criticized by the White House and members of  Congress and the FBI, and it has done little to act. </p><p>And so, if you go on t Twitter today, it's still very easy to find ISIS  accounts and tweets and hash tags supporting ISIS. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Josh, you're building your case now as we speak. Are there any  lessons to be taken, for example, from fighting child pornography? Because  I know that is another issue that a lot of the social media companies have  had to deal with where they actually have had to draw a line and say, to  your point, OK, we are more than just a plumbing system. We are more than  just a dissemination system. </p><p>ARISOHN:  Well, the fight against child pornography online is actually a  really good model that I think Twitter should follow in the area of  terrorism. Using technology they've largely been able to get rid of child  pornography on web sites like Twitter. </p><p>And according to the experts that we've spoken to, the same technology or  similar technology could be used to eradicate ISIS, once and for all from  Twitter. But for whatever reason, Twitter has declined to use that  technology. </p><p>BOLTON:  So, Josh, how concerned are you at this juncture Twitter stock is  in the gutter. The company has really gone through numerous management  changes. It seems like it's struggling at this particular moment. Even if  you succeed, do you worry about the company's future to even paying Ms.  Fields? </p><p>ARISOHN:  I'm not really worried about Twitter's finances. We're focused on  getting and making Twitter accountable for providing material support to a  terrorist organization and trying to get them to influence some changes to  get ISIS to get ISIS off of its social network once and for all. </p><p>BOLTON:  Well, if you win this would be a big landmark case. We wish you  luck.</p><p>ARISOHN:  Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON:  Thank you, Josh. Josh Arisohn joining me there.

I think we  could see the 1150 or even 1200. It really depends on how bad the situation  deteriorates. </p><p>Now remember, last year, gold prices traveled bound to about, you know,  1050. We are in a rising interest rate environment. We have a stronger  dollar and we had created global growth. We are starting to see kind of the  opposite effect take place. Not necessarily the dollar index weakening too  much but we are seeing other foreign currencies like the Eurozone. </p><p>They are embarking on quantitative easing. Global growth, it seems like  it's been tossed out the window. There is a lot of concern about China. And  remember, the Fed, they were expected to have four interest rates this  year, then it got cut down to two. Now it looks like the Fed funds are  pricing in a December rate hike. </p><p>BOLTON:  OK. So, the Fed, oil, China. I want to bring in a few comments  here from Harold Hamm. He's a billionaire oil executive. He's actually  saying Saudi Arabia is to blame for some of the energy volatility.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HAROLD HAMM, OIL AND GAS EXECUTIVE:  Oil in a rebalancing situation has  come about, basically at the hands of OPEC or primary Saudi Arabia that  decided last Thanksgiving, frankly to put, a year ago in 2014, to put the  1.8 million barrels of new oil on the market. Basically, to try to drown  out our success as shale players here in the U.S. </p><p>And so, they have been attempting to do that and put us out of business.  And, you know, it has an effect. We are down to the lowest rig count since  1999. We've lost quarter million people, direct jobs. About three times  that many indirect jobs. So, that's the effect that it's having. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Royal Dutch Shell backing up our gas saying, in fact, it may lay  off up to 10,000 people. Do you think is a move by Saudi Arabia to hurt the  U.S. energy industry or to hurt the Iranian energy industry? </p><p>STREIBLE:  Well, I don't think that they are trying to hurt anybody. I  think that they are in a race against Iran as far as getting oil into the  system. </p><p>I remember, you know, we'll probably going to see Iran pump about 500,000  barrels a day. So, the thing is that, they weren't trying to hurt them.  They're just trying to get ahead. As far as the U.S., it's all just a, you  know, a technological change. We had now the ability to frack oil and  produce quite a bit of it. </p><p>But Saudi Arabia doesn't want to let up any of that market share. So, of  course, it's going to drive businesses out of, you know, business. A credit  crisis is probably going to occur. And I think once you see a credit crisis  occur in the oil and gas industry, then I think finally a bottom may be in  place because our production will have already peaked. </p><p>BOLTON:  Right.</p><p>STREIBLE:  You know, it picked last year at 9.6 million. I think we come  back down into the 7's before we start to turn back around. </p><p>BOLTON:  All right, Phil. Great to have you here. Thank you. Phil Streible  joining me there from the CME. </p><p>Protesters are calling for the governor to step down in Flint, Michigan  over the water crisis. My next guest says people should actually be looking  at their own frivolous spending. And by that, he means the states and the  federal government.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BOLTON:  TransPro Consulting CEO, Mark Aesch joining me with how much the  government in Flint, Michigan knew about the water crisis, when and to what  extent overspending contributed to the crisis there now. </p><p>So, Mark, I'm very glad to have you with me. What can the city of Flint,  Michigan do now? </p><p>MARK AESCH, TRANSPRO CONSULTING CEO:  Well, I got to tell you. You couldn't  help but notice today the mayor's comments at the White House when she was  meeting with, you know, the president and others where she talked about the  short-sightedness that the leadership in Michigan has provided from the  state. </p><p>The reality is, it's the short-sightedness of the city itself where they  were spending 60 percent more money than they took in every year that  really caused this entire crisis. </p><p>They had purchased water from Detroit for years and it was fine. Because  they went into receivership, because they were spending too much money,  that's really what caused this crisis to be where it is today.</p><p>BOLTON:  Mark, please come back. I would like to talk more about this. Mark  Aesch, joining me these saying overspending is part of the problem in  Flint, Michigan. He will join us another day, I hope.</p><p>Thank you for joining us here on Risk and Reward.

It was one of the most chaotic trading days ever in the markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is Risk and Reward. I'm Deirdre Bolton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow plunged more than 550 points at session lows. There was an attempt at a rebound and the Dow did close lower but certainly off that very low mark.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oil dropped a big part of the negative sentiment. Prices fell below $27 per barrel, a level not seen since May of 2003.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have you covered from all angles. We are going to start right now from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. My colleague, Lori Rothman there all day. Lori, this one is crazy?</p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: Yes. You think a bit of a roller coaster ride. I think people it couldn't end soon enough for the folks who are working down here. Although I will say that the higher volume and the increase in volatility is great for traders who make a living of all of that action.</p><p>But, yes. I mean, you hit the nail on the head. We were down at the low on the Dow of 566, we came back paring that decline to -- a decline of 250. So, that's about 1.5 percent decline.</p><p>I think what happened here mid-session, traders, investors were starting to look at our levels, testing those late summer losses levels there, and said, you know, how many more consecutive days can oil decline 5 percent, 7 percent, you know. And then they realize maybe this is the low, maybe we're at it.</p><p>For what is worth the Russell comprised of small mid-cap names, managed to close up about half a percent today. And some key sectors also drove the turn around which are very telling what investors how they view the makeup of the U.S. economy.</p><p>So, health care, biotech led the turnaround. In fact, United Health Care led the Dow Jones Industrial average to gain about 2 percent today.</p><p>As I mentioned, oil got clobbered. Chevron off 7 percent. Some of the other winners headline names. Nike, American Express, Microsoft, Apple, from a broad range of industries. So, really this was this was, you know, a statement on what U.S. investors think of the U.S. market and what's going to happen here with the U.S. economy.</p><p>Fed fund futures are now predicting perhaps only one -- more interest rate hike versus two or three they were looking at late last year, which is one rate hike perhaps this year. We'll see what happens. Back to you.</p><p>BOLTON: Lori, thank you so much. I'm going to pick up right on what you just said about oil. As Lori just told that decline a big part of what weighed on the stock market. So, prices in oil, levels not seen in more than 12 and a half years.</p><p>Jeff Flock with me now from the CME. So, Jeff, what were traders telling you how low can oil go?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CORRESPONDENT: Listen, they -- a lot of traders are saying today's move was overplayed because today was the expiration date that the oil price got down lower in the February contract than really it really is. It closed at 26.55, which indeed it looks pretty bad.</p><p>But now the true futures prices, the March contract which is now trading and that over $28, even in the afterhours. Now I'm looking at the latest numbers, you know, we're still well over $28. So, maybe things aren't as bad as they look.</p><p>And then, Deirdre, if you look even farther out to the out months in terms of the futures I just looked at last hour's, these are last quote, but I think they're Germaine, the May quote is $31, the June quote is almost $32, and in December, we were at $35.</p><p>So, the long-range bet oil is that rises even though right now in the short term, you know, it doesn't look good.</p><p>BOLTON: We are going to take your words to heart, Jeff Flock. Thank you so much.</p><p>FLOCK: I hope.</p><p>BOLTON: Joining us there from the CME. So, this markets move was big. It was widespread. It showed up in every asset class. As you were just hearing about.</p><p>My power market panel here with their best advice for your money. Market bull, Michael Lee. Market bear, Lee Munson. Straight to our market bull, Michael Lee. You're the contrarian today. Volatility was the theme. Give me one reason to be optimistic on U.S. stocks.</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, TIGER WEALTH MANAGEMENT FOUNDER &amp; MANAGING PARTNER: Well, you need this volatility. We need to enter new volatility regime if we're going to break out to new all-time highs as where I think we're going. Based on the economic data we're seeing from the U.S. So, you got a great, great numbers on Friday. In terms of retail sales, up 4.6 percent year-over-year, when you take out gasoline sales.</p><p>You look at inflation today, ex food and energy up 2.1 percent. Great jobs number a couple of weeks ago rolling four-week average of job week -- jobless claims. Still at lows that we haven't seen since the 1960s.</p><p>So, the U.S. economy is in en fuego, it's just on fire. So, without this new level of volatility there is no way to break out to new all-time highs. So, it is the silver lining in the horror on the screens.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Lee, let me pick up with this idea of the U.S. economy going strong. Because Royal Dutch Shell is saying it may have to lay off something like 10,000 workers. And part of this is linked to what we've been talking about with oil's decline. How much before other corporations make that kind of decision?</p><p>LEE MUNSON, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS PRESIDENT: They're already making it. Because we've got lagging indicators that what Michael is talking about. You know, we're looking today at jobs and consumer sentiment being good in the past. We're going to start seeing tech companies start laying off that oil is going to have a knock-on effect.</p><p>This is the same thing we talked in 2008, about why we should save or not save General Motors or Ford because you lay off one person who is making big money, it has a cascading effect.</p><p>So, the one thing I want to remind people is that, we don't have volatility yet. I understand that Michael wants to see it. I want volatility to be like me, 40 and over. Look at September of 2011. That's called volatility. We don't even have volatility at same level as the August mini crash.</p><p>And quite frankly, I wrote about this last week in Forbes. We busted through the Columbus Day massacre of 2014. So, we have air underneath there. There is no technicality. I want pessimism. I want everybody including Michael to say we've been in the recession, we're in a bear market, then I'm going to go have a beer with Michael and I want to go be bullish for the rest of the year, but not yet.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. But to your point, we have in your view fallen beneath some key levels that you think are important?</p><p>MUNSON: Yes.</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>MUNSON: We do. And that's unfortunately there's not a next little level close by. We could be in the 1700s on the S&amp;P.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Michael, defend yourself because I know you have a different point of view or are you just saying, listen, this is a good opportunity for people who want to own stocks, let's say for the next five years, to pick up companies they like?</p><p>LEE: Look, I'm not a day-trader. But to take a step back, the employment numbers are not lagging when they're getting stronger month in and month out. What I think you have here is sovereign wealth fund, who, majority of their money comes from oil are just flushing out the market.</p><p>And when the market sells off like this, all the fast money that pushes the market around, i.e. the hedge funds, their money lines get cut by their risk managers. So, it's very, very difficult to get out there and get loud and get long.</p><p>Bank of America said last week it was the largest buying they've seen in five years from hedge funds buying U.S. equities. So, I mean, this oil as a bad thing for the U.S. is laughable. You know, maybe we should be thinking...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Even when we see job cuts coming, Michael?</p><p>LEE: You know, U.S. consumes 162 billion of gasoline a year. So, $2 off a gallon of gasoline. that's 362 billion. That's millions of jobs and hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. It is a net positive for the economy. We are service-based import economy consumer driven. So, the less we have spent on gas, the more we can spend on other stuff.</p><p>The more the rest of the world goes into hell in a hand basket the better it is for the U.S. consumer. I mean, look, it would be nice if the rest the world were stabilized and not getting worse.</p><p>BOLTON: Lee.</p><p>LEE: But, you know, these are positive things for us and it's just going to continue to get better.</p><p>BOLTON: Lee, what is your point, because Michael's point is well-taken of course. But the ideas we are all now interconnected, right? We heard from China yesterday, slowest growth - China is the world's second largest economy - slowest growth in GDP figures for that country in 25 years. So, to what extent are we affected by other countries?</p><p>MUNSON: We are because it's going to affect the price of our dollar which has been one of the saving graces of profits. And also, this idea that oil is laughable that it doesn't matter, you start telling some of my clients here that are having to lay off people who buy other goods and services because they're simply no business in the gas and oil patch.</p><p>This is a major part of the U.S. economy. And while I get the idea that it's cheaper gas, not if you're not making any money. I think China is a real issue, but I think that China is actually leading right now. And I think if you want to buy value, look at China, look at Europe. They are already in a bear market. They've had a 20 percent correction. That's where value is right now.</p><p>I think in the U.S. you've got to wait. And I think if you want to buy for the next five years, why not just wait for another couple of weeks to see if we can go even lower. You've got nothing to lose if you're long-term investor, right?</p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, I hear what you're saying, you're saying don't buy but don't sell. Just wait to see what else develops. I'm going to take a page, though, from Michael's book. Because I did some research, 2008, 2009, in that 24-month period, if you were say, owning stocks, S&amp;P 500 as the index, you lost 24 percent.</p><p>But then, by 2012, you had made up your money. So, does this just mean for people who do have patience, that is to say not people who are trying to retire next year, there are opportunities and they should be buying?</p><p>LEE: Oh, I'm sorry, me?</p><p>BOLTON: Go ahead, Lee.</p><p>MUNSON: You know, I think so. I think that we're about 60, we're about 3 or 4 percent from a full bear market in the S&amp;P 500. My point is very simple. Because we broke those key levels, and because we have such a shocking crazy thing about oil, I don't see why we need to necessarily rush in.</p><p>I think that what I've told my cleaners is that my bear suit is getting old, and then in the next couple weeks or next couple of months, I'm going to turn it in and I want the bull suit out of the closet. But, I don't think because we went below those levels from August that people should see today as the big green light.</p><p>I want to see the VIX at 40, and then I will be like I said with...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: You want everyone to give up and you want to take Michael Lee, our market bull for a bear. That's very generous of you, Lee Munson. Thank you very much. Lee Munson, our market bear. Michael Lee, our market bull.</p><p>Well, volatility so far the theme of the year. If you're close to retirement as we were just talking about, our next experts will give you their best advice.</p><p>Also, we're going to be talking about how you can avoid working more years than you plan to.</p><p>The East Coast may get hit by an epic blizzard. The storm may affect more than 50 million people. But don't panic. Don't clear the grocery store shelves just yet. We're going to bring you the latest information on where the storm precisely is most likely to hit.</p><p>And the Senate voting today on such a key issue that two high-profile Senate republicans took time from the presidential campaign trail to cast their votes. Senator John Thune agrees with both, that is to say, Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio on blocking 10,000 Syrian refugees from coming to the U.S.</p><p>BOLTON: The East Coast likely to get hit by a mega snowstorm. More than 50 million people may be affected. Rick Reichmuth with me now from the weather center. So, Rick, certain parts of the U.S. could get something like two feet of snow?</p><p>RICK REICHMUTH, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>METEOROLOGIST: Yes. I think we'll certainly see some two feet snowfall totals from the storm. Probably areas of Virginia and West Virginia. I will show you that. One storm right now is moving through, this is not it, but we'll see a few flurries here. If you see those don't think that's the big storm.</p><p>The storm that we're watching is now back across parts of Idaho and Wyoming. And it's a big disturbance right here that over the next day and a half is going to dive down across parts of South and cause big problems for a lot of people.</p><p>We have all kinds of winter storm advisories in effect where you see this blue including southern parts of New Jersey. Really the big concern here is where you have this green and that is blizzard watches in effect. We will likely be seeing blizzard conditions Friday night into Saturday for Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. And possibly that will extend a little bit more around that area.</p><p>I think that's going to be the bulls eye for the storm. This is the future radar. So, tomorrow, this system is going to bring us a lot of rain including severe weather. We could see some tornadoes down across parts of the south tomorrow. You see behind that cold air that gets in, maybe a little bit of snow here across parts of Mississippi and Arkansas.</p><p>I want also to point out areas of Kentucky, maybe into the Carolinas could be looking at some pretty significant icing. That can be devastating. It could looking at some power outages from that. But then Friday, day, we get into the snow, again, parts of West Virginia and Virginia and watch this here, it's all snow for D.C. and Philadelphia right on the border in New York City from this.</p><p>Maybe we're going to see some accumulating snowfall, plowable snow indeed in New York. But the bulls eye is going to be here around the D.C. area. And some of those spots may be over two feet of snow. Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: Rick, thank you as always.</p><p>REICHMUTH: You bet.</p><p>BOLTON: Rick Reichmuth joining me there on this epic snowstorm.</p><p>Well, it was a rocky session in the stock market. The Dow closed down around 1.5 percent after being much lower. So, by some metrics, we're off to the worst start for the U.S. stock market ever.</p><p>If you're close to retiring you may be panicking, but don't. Author of \"Real Money Answers for Every Woman,\" Patrice Washington is here. Also financial advisor, David Waddell. Thank you, both, for being here.</p><p>Patrice, to the person who is counting on retiring in five years' time, what should he or she be doing now?</p><p>PATICE WASHINGTON, \"REAL MONEY ANSWER FOR ALL WOMEN\" AUTHOR: Well, I say the first thing that you do is still determine what you can handle. This is not time to go baseball on what everyone else is doing. And so, you have to look at your comfort level. I'm sure you guys have heard before, you know that investing is not based on the brain, it's based on the stomach and what you can actually handle.</p><p>So, even though this is typically the time you want to be more aggressive, maybe you should back up a little bit and be conservative but just that realistic expectations.</p><p>BOLTON: So, David, we take your point there. Should anyone over 50 be putting more money in cash? Meaning, if this market is setting up to be like the one we saw in 2008 and 2009, is it better to look for safe havens, at least with part of your money?</p><p>DAVID WADDELL, WADDELL &amp; ASSOCIATES CEO: I think it's too hard to know. And I think anybody who is 50 may have a life expectancy of another 30 years, 40 years. There has never been a 20-year period where the stock market actually produced negative returns.</p><p>If you go back 20 years, it's been compounding a 10 percent a year, which by the way, is its long term historic rate of return.</p><p>So, I think the first thing investors need to do is refer to their financial plan. And if the financial plan calls for rate of return above 5 percent, then you need some stocks in your portfolio. And you know, over time stocks produce 10 bond, it produce five. You know, figure out what you're required rate of return is and split up the portfolio, and you just kind of got to hold on. It's easy to predict where the bond is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: David, it sounds easy, but how do you choose? What is your advice when you say you need stocks? Do you say, OK, do the research, the Peter Lynch model, buy what you know? That is to say if you happen to like Apple products, you use it. If you watch Netflix, you buy Netflix, is that the advice that you give to your clients?</p><p>WADDELL: No. But then again we're professional financial planners and advisors. And so, the first thing you ought to do is hire good people like the people at Waddell and Associates, right? So, get a good trusted advisor who can also act as psychologist for you and help hold your hand through tumultuous period.</p><p>Because the reality is, the market goes down 33 percent of the time, that's just part of the game.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. Which gets back to what Patrice said about investing, keeping in mind, your own tolerance for risk. So, Patrice, on that note, when people reach out to you, do you suggest that they buy what they know, or do you suggest something else?</p><p>WASHINGTON: Well, I suggest that they also go to a professional. You know, that's the first thing. But I do also suggest that they think about diversifying and not keeping all their eggs in one basket. And that goes beyond the classes. That goes beyond the stocks and bonds and short term investments.</p><p>It goes even deeper in each of those classes, what are the different companies that appeal to you.</p><p>BOLTON: All right. We will leave it there. Short, sweet, to the point. Patrice Washington, David Waddell. Thank you very much.</p><p>WADDELL: Thank you.</p><p>WASHINGTON: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Congress investigating an increase in number of terror plots hatched by foreign-born residents. Also, the Department of Homeland Security warning that more than half a million foreigners overstayed their visas. We will see if there is a connection in some cases.</p><p>Also, a huge vote in the Senate today, so important that two GOP presidential candidates left the campaign trail to be in D.C. At issue, blocking 10,000 Syrian refugees from coming to the U.S.</p><p>My guest is Senator John Thune says we need to hold off on allowing refugees in. He says democrats are making a grave mistake in arguing the counter point. Senator Thune is my guest next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: In all 50 states we have opened terrorism investigations related to number of dimensions of the threat. In all 50 states we have ISIL radicalization cases under investigation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Senate democrats want to let Syrian and Iraqi refugees into the U.S. Republicans say it would be huge mistake.</p><p>Republican Senator from South Dakota, John Thune is with me now. Senator, glad to have you here.</p><p>JOHN THUNE, SOUTH DAKOTA SENATOR: Nice to be here. Thanks, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: Senators Rubio and Cruz went to D.C. today, in other words, even got off the campaign trail which is hot to try to address this issue. What happened?</p><p>THUNE: Well, what happened, Deirdre, was a bill came over from the House, that calls for vetting certification by the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Director of National Intelligence, that refugees coming into this country do not present a security risk to people in this country.</p><p>So, it's a simple, fairly simple bill. I think a fairly reasonable bill. We tried to call it up today to just be able to debate it and amend it and the democrats blocked it from even being considered. It's called the motion to proceed. It takes 60 votes to get on a bill. And the democrats had the requisite number to stop it. So, that's what happened on the floor today.</p><p>It's a big issue. It's an issue. It's important to our national security and one that I think needs to be addressed and the fact that the democrats were willing, on this procedural vote today to block it, I think is going to be very difficult for them to defend.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Senator, I want to ask you, because you introduced an amendment to the bill that would give governors the ability to refuse taking refugees. Did the Senate and any of the democrats or anyone you're speaking with recognize that each state, that is to say, the governor, understands resources and the difference in resources in his or her state?</p><p>THUNE: Right. Unfortunately, Deirdre, because the democrats blocked this, prevented us from even getting on the bill, I didn't get an opportunity to debate or have that amendment voted on. But I filed it. And it's very -- yes, it's very simple.</p><p>We heard from 30 governors last year who want to be able to have some control over their borders and who comes in. And so, all of this simply would have done is allow them to have more participation in that process to meet with the Secretary of State's Office when they're having these discussions about vetting refugees.</p><p>And hopefully, to have more input into it. And then if they, you know, if they decide that there are concerns that their state has about admitting certain people, that they would be able not to have to do that. So, that's what the amendment did.</p><p>But unfortunately we didn't get a chance to amend -- or to debate that simply because they blocked the consideration of the bill.</p><p>BOLTON: The Governor of Kansas was with us a few weeks ago. And he said he is very concerned for his resident's safety, which is the point that you made right when we began speaking.</p><p>I want to ask you also about something, Senator, that you wrote, an op-ed style of piece on President Obama and the numerous executive orders that he is trying to pass in his last year in office. We just want to bring our viewers up to speed with some comments that the president made back in 2014.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: I've got a pen and I've got a phone. I've got a pen to take executive actions where Congress won't and I've got a telephone. I've got a pen and I've got a phone.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: So, this message that in his last year of office was the implication, obviously when he was speaking in 2014, that he was just going to try to push through unilaterally as much as possible. To what extent is this tarnishing his legacy?</p><p>THUNE: Well, and I think even this week, his spokesperson said that he is going to be audacious in using executive action to accomplish his objectives. And the problem with that, I tried to point this out in the op- ed, Deirdre, is if you live by executive action you're going to die by executive action.</p><p>And if he's really interested in having a legacy he gave that up when he determined that he was going to go around to the Congress basically, ignore the people's representatives and try and accomplish his agenda through regulatory action, executive orders and that sort of thing.</p><p>And what that means is, that can be overturned by the next president. And many of his executive actions have ended up in the courts. And the courts have ruled against him. So his, much of his agenda, the things that he wanted to accomplish have been done by executive order which is a very fleeting accomplishment.</p><p>It doesn't endure and it's not going to stand the test of time. And I think that this president is going to go down in history as somebody who tried to assert more power if the Executive Branch, probably than anybody since Woodrow Wilson. And that's not a good formula for how to get things done for the American people.</p><p>BOLTON: And even as you rightly point out, Senator, from a practical standpoint, if the Supreme Court is going to be forced to check some of these measures, it's a use of everyone's time. Senator John Thune, thank you as always, joining us there...</p><p>THUNE: Thanks, Deirdre.</p><p>BOLTON: ... from Capitol Hill.</p><p>More market mayhem when we come back. Some details that may be useful to you as you try to manage your portfolio. Apple, you can see on the charts there. We're going to talk about this price point of $100 per stock if Apple goes back over that, if it's a good buy. We'll discuss it.</p><p>Also, President Obama said, one big regret was not getting along with Congress.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: It is one of the few regrets of my presidency, that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: My next guest, two Senate leaders who never got along but now it's different. Former Senator Trent Lott, former Senator Tom Daschle. They are going to be joining me in just two minutes.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, RISK &amp; REWARD SHOW HOST: It was a wild market day. The Dow down by more than 550 points at its session low. Fox Business' Gerri Willis with me now. Gerri, you were watching right along with me. Winners and losers, I know you were picking them out, what did you find?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS REPORTER: Let me tell you, what a day. A total rollercoaster. When I first started watching the markets all Dow stocks were down. But now by the end of session we've actually got some winners here. United Health got 1.96 percent. That was a winner on the day. Nike, up 1.23 percent. MX, marginally higher, Microsoft, marginally higher, Apple, marginally higher, up 13/100, believe it or not.</p><p>But you got to say positive is good here. On the other side, the flip side, the losers, IBM. Now remember that IBM had a bad report showing that its revenues now for 15 consecutive quarters have turned it down. IBM, down 4.88 percent. That accounts for 41 Dow points. Think about that.</p><p>Exxon, down. Oil obviously a big loser here down 4.21 percent. Cisco down 3.98 percent. A big tech company, you've got to think that they're selling into overseas markets; maybe it's the worry over those. Boeing as well, 3.1 percent. Chevron, another oil stock down 3.1 percent.</p><p>It's hard to imagine but oil is down 74 percent from its highs. These stocks continuing to languish. And when you look at the sectors on the day, healthcare had the best performance, energy had the worst predictably. Deirdre, back to you.</p><p>BOLTON: Predictably, indeed with as you rightly point out, Gerri. Oil trading at more than a 12-year low. Gerri Willis, thank you so much.</p><p>WILLIS: You're welcome.</p><p>BOLTON: Volatility in the markets, volatility in D.C. as well. Both sides of the aisle blaming each other for a lack of progress and financial waste.</p><p>Republicans, for example, blaming the divide on D.C. on President Obama and his overreached in executive action.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA PRESIDENT: It's one of the few regrets of my presidency that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.</p><p>I told my administration to keep looking every single for actions we can take without Congress.</p><p>With Congress, we're on my own.</p><p>Now I'm going to be working with Congress where I can to accomplish this. But I'm also going to act on my own if Congress is deadlocked.</p><p>Where Congress isn't acting I'll act on my own.</p><p>Whenever and wherever, I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunities for more American families, that's what I'm going to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: My next two guests know a thing or two about duking it out on the Hill in years' past.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOM DASCHLE, FORMER SOUTH DAKOTA SENATOR: And we are getting a resounding no on the other side of the aisle. We are getting an absolute emphatic no with an exclamation point. We got to find a way with which to address this bill in a more consequential and productive way.</p><p>TRENT LOTT, FORMER MISSISSIPPI SENATOR: This thing has done as I said in other forums. This has become a problem of greed. Do you want to do something about this problem or do you want to play games. It's not clear to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Former Senate majority leader, here they are, democrat Tom Daschle and republican Trent Lott, they say that partisan gridlock has become a national crisis and have authored a new book called \"Crisis Point.\" Which I must say is a great read. I am so pleased to have you both here.</p><p>LOTT: Thank you for having us, Deirdre.</p><p>DASCHLE: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: So, thank you for coming in. What can we learn -- I'm going to start with you, Senator Daschle, about the future based on what you have seen in the past?</p><p>DASCHLE: Well, I think what we need to know about the future is just what kind of cooperation, what kind of communication, what kinds of relationship will our political leaders have. How much will the president invite congressional leaders to work together? How much will congressional reciprocate. That will tell a lot about the quality of governance we're going to see in the next three years.</p><p>BOLTON: Senator Lott, how is it different, how is the environment in Washington, D.C. different? It feels worse now than ever but I want to know from someone who's actually been there.</p><p>LOTT: Well, first, in the book we talk about there were difficult times in history going back to the period of our founding father. I mean, Berg did kill Hamilton and Jefferson hated Adams, and so forth. And of course we have this war here.</p><p>It is the worse I've seen in the 50 years that I've been watching it pretty closely, as a political science major and as a lawyer and being in Washington and Congress. A whole lot of things have caused this. But these are difficult and different times. They are different people.</p><p>Media is very different, not only, you know, TV, cable...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: Oh, I know it, right? And social...</p><p>LOTT: ... but also social media has made a huge impact. But also, I really felt a changing in 2004, slipping and sliding, it was getting meaner spirited. It was also getting more and more difficult to get positive things done in Washington.</p><p>Now, look, there is plenty of blame to go around. Congress, the president, the republicans, the democrats. But those clips that you showed of the president, it agitated me just sitting here. Because, you know, you've got to reach out to the Congress. And you can't just do it on your own.</p><p>BOLTON: Where you had to lead, right?</p><p>LOTT: And, you know, that's one of the number one. We've talked about that, communication, chemistry, leadership and vision. What did the candidates this year want to do for our country? Tell me something positive.</p><p>BOLTON: Speaking of the candidates, when you talk about these qualities that I assume you agree with your fine colleague here...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DASCHLE: I do, strongly.</p><p>BOLTON: ... are necessary, what do you see when, for example, there are business people who want to be leaders, which is not necessarily a bad thing. But what can they bring as far as all those qualities that are necessary to lead?</p><p>DASCHLE: Well, I hope we'll have our leaders who, not only are successful business people or business leaders, but people who understand the importance of the institutions. These institutions were created for a reason. They were giving people an opportunity through their elected leadership to self-govern through our democratic republic.</p><p>These institutions have stood the test of time. What we have to do is respect them. We have to make sure that we continue to let them be that critical element to our democratic republic. If we fail to do that we're going to lose a vital element to democracy as we look forward.</p><p>LOTT: You know, there are awful lot of lawyers in the Congress not enough business men and women and people who out there professions. And I like the fact that business people realize they need to be involved, too. I would like to have more realtors to be involved, for instance.</p><p>My son is been a small businessman and he likes the fact that we got a businessman running for president. However, being President of United States is not something you do learning on the job. You need to have experience. You need to have been in the Congress. So, work in the administration you understand the leaders...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: It's a compromise is a big part of it but when you are the boss, you just get to be the boss, right?</p><p>LOTT: Yes. But, you know, compromise is now considered a dirty word. I don't think it is. In my opinion, it is the art of governing. I mean, Tom and I are friends and I trust Tom and I respect. We didn't agree for a couple of...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLTON: But when -- I was going to say, when you're both on Capitol Hill, you probably didn't feel that generous.</p><p>LOTT: No, we did actually.</p><p>DASCHLE: No, we did actually pass...</p><p>BOLTON: OK.</p><p>DASCHLE: ... one of the lessons learned is that, if you build a relationship you can overcome the differences. He's a republican, I'm a democrat. He's center right and I'm to the left. But we found ways with which to bring together the consensus necessary to move this country forward in public policy that brought us a balanced budget, that brought us an array of public policy production that we don't see at the quality and at the volume we need today.</p><p>LOTT: You know, a lot of what we did was not partisan in either way. Safe drinking water, are we for that? That shouldn't be republican or democrat. Affordability of insurance. Telecommunications reform. Adequate military pay for our men and women in uniform. None of those are partisan or shouldn't be when we did those things.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, I hope that all the candidates read your books. Thank you so much for coming in.</p><p>DASCHLE: Thanks for having us.</p><p>BOLTON: Senators Tom Daschle and Trent Lott, glad to have you here.</p><p>When we come back, politicians are pushing Silicon Valley and tech companies to help fight terrorism. We have an attorney who is suing Twitter, blaming the social media company for the rise of ISIS.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES COMEY, FBI DIRECTOR: ISIL has used that ubiquitous social media to break the model and push into the United States into the pocket on to the mobile device of troubled souls throughout our country in all 50 states, a twin message. Come or kill. Come or kill.</p><p>Come to the so-called caliphate, live a life of glory, participate in the final battle between good and evil on God's side. Come to the caliphate. If you can't come, kill where you are.</p><p>Social media works to connect us. It works us a way to sell cars or shoes or a movie. It works to crowd source terrorism. And so, starting in the summer of 2014, they really invested in this and it works. It led to troubled souls convincing themselves that there was meaning for them in Syria and Iraq, or that they have should engage in acts of violence in the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARCO RUBIO, (R) U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is not an issue of process, it's an issue of information. And there is just not enough information about people coming from Syria. What's inexplicable is that there was information available and that we didn't look at it because of some policy designed to be politically correct and not offend people. That's unacceptable in the time of war.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: That was GOP presidential candidate, Senator Marco Rubio criticizing officials for failing to check social media accounts of the San Bernardino shooters.</p><p>The widow of a defense contractor killed by ISIS is suing Twitter for helping the terrorist's group to grow. Tamara Fields' husband, Carl Fields Jr. was killed in November in Jordan by a lone gunman. Now, ISIS took credit for that atrocity and then promoted it on social media.</p><p>Josh Arisohn is with me now. He is representing Ms. Fields. So, we are glad to have you here, Josh. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>JOSH ARISOHN, MS. FIELDS' LAWYER: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BOLTON: What do you think the chances of your case are? Because I'm assuming that all social media platforms come back with the same argument that is to say, we are the pipes, we do not monitor the contents.</p><p>ARISOHN: Well, we feel strong about both the law and the facts in this case and about the case going forward. And, you know, Twitter wasn't just the pipes here. Twitter for a long time has known that ISIS is on social network. And it's been criticized by the White House and members of Congress and the FBI, and it has done little to act.</p><p>And so, if you go on t Twitter today, it's still very easy to find ISIS accounts and tweets and hash tags supporting ISIS.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Josh, you're building your case now as we speak. Are there any lessons to be taken, for example, from fighting child pornography? Because I know that is another issue that a lot of the social media companies have had to deal with where they actually have had to draw a line and say, to your point, OK, we are more than just a plumbing system. We are more than just a dissemination system.</p><p>ARISOHN: Well, the fight against child pornography online is actually a really good model that I think Twitter should follow in the area of terrorism. Using technology they've largely been able to get rid of child pornography on web sites like Twitter.</p><p>And according to the experts that we've spoken to, the same technology or similar technology could be used to eradicate ISIS, once and for all from Twitter. But for whatever reason, Twitter has declined to use that technology.</p><p>BOLTON: So, Josh, how concerned are you at this juncture Twitter stock is in the gutter. The company has really gone through numerous management changes. It seems like it's struggling at this particular moment. Even if you succeed, do you worry about the company's future to even paying Ms. Fields?</p><p>ARISOHN: I'm not really worried about Twitter's finances. We're focused on getting and making Twitter accountable for providing material support to a terrorist organization and trying to get them to influence some changes to get ISIS to get ISIS off of its social network once and for all.</p><p>BOLTON: Well, if you win this would be a big landmark case. We wish you luck.</p><p>ARISOHN: Thank you.</p><p>BOLTON: Thank you, Josh. Josh Arisohn joining me there. He is representing the widow of a contractor who was killed in Jordan.</p><p>If you own gold you were spared some of today's market volatility or at least feeling it in your gut. The precious metal jumping more than 4 percent since the start of the year.</p><p>We are going to speak with my next guest who says gold prices could go even higher. We will also bring you the very latest on Flint, Michigan water crisis. Protesters are calling for the governors to resign. But my next guest says that the real culprit is government spending.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've been fighting too long. We need more help. We need Obama to come in here and change these pipes. It's not about anything else. We need the pipes changed in this city. You know, they are talking about giving us filters and going around giving us water? How long is that going to last?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Stock market volatility showed up in the form of stocks and oil falling and gold rising. Industries often want to hold gold in times of fear or uncertainty.</p><p>RJO Futures, Phil Streible with me now from the CME. So, Phil, given the volatility, how high can gold go?</p><p>PHIL STREIBLE, RJO FUTURES SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST: That's a good question. I really think gold prices could surge a lot higher. I think we could see the 1150 or even 1200. It really depends on how bad the situation deteriorates.</p><p>Now remember, last year, gold prices traveled bound to about, you know, 1050. We are in a rising interest rate environment. We have a stronger dollar and we had created global growth. We are starting to see kind of the opposite effect take place. Not necessarily the dollar index weakening too much but we are seeing other foreign currencies like the Eurozone.</p><p>They are embarking on quantitative easing. Global growth, it seems like it's been tossed out the window. There is a lot of concern about China. And remember, the Fed, they were expected to have four interest rates this year, then it got cut down to two. Now it looks like the Fed funds are pricing in a December rate hike.</p><p>BOLTON: OK. So, the Fed, oil, China. I want to bring in a few comments here from Harold Hamm. He's a billionaire oil executive. He's actually saying Saudi Arabia is to blame for some of the energy volatility.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HAROLD HAMM, OIL AND GAS EXECUTIVE: Oil in a rebalancing situation has come about, basically at the hands of OPEC or primary Saudi Arabia that decided last Thanksgiving, frankly to put, a year ago in 2014, to put the 1.8 million barrels of new oil on the market. Basically, to try to drown out our success as shale players here in the U.S.</p><p>And so, they have been attempting to do that and put us out of business. And, you know, it has an effect. We are down to the lowest rig count since 1999. We've lost quarter million people, direct jobs. About three times that many indirect jobs. So, that's the effect that it's having.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Royal Dutch Shell backing up our gas saying, in fact, it may lay off up to 10,000 people. Do you think is a move by Saudi Arabia to hurt the U.S. energy industry or to hurt the Iranian energy industry?</p><p>STREIBLE: Well, I don't think that they are trying to hurt anybody. I think that they are in a race against Iran as far as getting oil into the system.</p><p>I remember, you know, we'll probably going to see Iran pump about 500,000 barrels a day. So, the thing is that, they weren't trying to hurt them. They're just trying to get ahead. As far as the U.S., it's all just a, you know, a technological change. We had now the ability to frack oil and produce quite a bit of it.</p><p>But Saudi Arabia doesn't want to let up any of that market share. So, of course, it's going to drive businesses out of, you know, business. A credit crisis is probably going to occur. And I think once you see a credit crisis occur in the oil and gas industry, then I think finally a bottom may be in place because our production will have already peaked.</p><p>BOLTON: Right.</p><p>STREIBLE: You know, it picked last year at 9.6 million. I think we come back down into the 7's before we start to turn back around.</p><p>BOLTON: All right, Phil. Great to have you here. Thank you. Phil Streible joining me there from the CME.</p><p>Protesters are calling for the governor to step down in Flint, Michigan over the water crisis. My next guest says people should actually be looking at their own frivolous spending. And by that, he means the states and the federal government.</p><p>BOLTON: TransPro Consulting CEO, Mark Aesch joining me with how much the government in Flint, Michigan knew about the water crisis, when and to what extent overspending contributed to the crisis there now.</p><p>So, Mark, I'm very glad to have you with me. What can the city of Flint, Michigan do now?</p><p>MARK AESCH, TRANSPRO CONSULTING CEO: Well, I got to tell you. You couldn't help but notice today the mayor's comments at the White House when she was meeting with, you know, the president and others where she talked about the short-sightedness that the leadership in Michigan has provided from the state.</p><p>The reality is, it's the short-sightedness of the city itself where they were spending 60 percent more money than they took in every year that really caused this entire crisis.</p><p>They had purchased water from Detroit for years and it was fine. Because they went into receivership, because they were spending too much money, that's really what caused this crisis to be where it is today.</p><p>BOLTON: Mark, please come back. I would like to talk more about this. Mark Aesch, joining me these saying overspending is part of the problem in Flint, Michigan. He will join us another day, I hope.</p><p>Thank you for joining us here on Risk and Reward. Making Money with Charles Payne starts now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2016012001cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HWY-R0T1-JB20-G2NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7277\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>RISK &amp;

Good morning to everybody.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p> ROBERT WOLF, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Great too.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is when I'm very happy.  We have some age on the panel,  myself included because we remember what this kind of all feels it looks  like.</p><p> WOLF:  You know, I'm thinking that -- I think I was in middle school when  we had this volatility.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Really?</p><p> WOLF:  It's been like a -- let's be honest, outside of the dot-com bubble  and the Asia crisis and the 2008 recession, we've kind of been on a three- decade, one directional ride.  We haven't seen the 1,200 point swing, I  can't remember.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We want to make it there, yes.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  I mean, it turns out the stock  market actually goes down sometimes, right?  It should be a really -- this  should be a wakeup call for investors, retail investors especially.  What  do you have in your portfolio?  You need to know.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well I think that people already got a wakeup call Lindsey and  we will talk about that with people betting on stable markets with these  inverse volatility funds, a couple of them shutting down yesterday.  We're  talking about massive losses, so it's not just individuals, that some of  the smartest minds, some of the smartest guys and gals in the room, again,  also losing money.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And a lot of computers involved in what was going on, of  course, to those algorithms have certainly changed how the work is being  done.</p><p> WOLF:  No question.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're going to talk about it all this morning.  Coming up, White  House Director of Legislative Affairs, Marc Short is here.  New York  Congressman Tom Suozzi, New York Congresswoman, Claudia Tenney, that's on  the left and the right, we'll have them on together.  Louisiana Senator,  John Kennedy, and former George W. Bush Chief of Staff Business Roundtable  President and CEO, Josh Bolton.</p><p> You don't want to miss any of those guests but first for our top story,  Wall Street bouncing back, U.S. markets rallying to regain almost half  their losses from the day before when stocks took the largest plunge in six  and a half years, that is the percentage loss that we saw on the DOW.  The  DOW ending the day with a gain of 567 points.  After closing, down more  than 1,100 points on Monday.  Futures right now are showing losses across  the board, 243 point loss on the DOW Futures.</p><p> Despite the turbulence, Treasury Secretary Steve MNuchin telling lawmakers  on Capitol Hill that the markets are functioning, \"Very well.\"</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  We are very focused on the long- term economic growth and we believe that the policies that we've enacted  including tax reform are very positive for a long-term economic growth.   We're already beginning to see that in terms of corporate investments back  into the United States and the impact on corporate earnings.</p><p> I think as you said that the stock market is up significantly over 30  percent since President Trump was elected, we're monitoring the stock  markets, they're functioning very well, and we continue to believe in the  long-term impact of the stock market.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, your take on what Secretary MNuchin is saying but also  in volatility going to threaten this nine-year bull market?</p><p> BELL:  I think volatility certainly has a shot at ruining it but look, last  year, there were eight days that we saw a move of one percent plus or minus  on the S&amp;P500.  Historically, we usually see about 50 of those days.  And  when you have a year like that, the next year, you're bound to have more  volatility.  So, I think people should buckle in and get ready for more of  that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What all this referencing is, again, it was this sense of calm  leads to overconfidence.  Among individual investors and professional  investors that people kind of become delusional about their ability and you  had all these bets on stable markets, this inverse volatility.</p><p> These were exchange-traded retail products, two of which including the XIV  closed down to investors after they lost most of their money of late  Monday.  So, again, these losses, the tide goes out and you see who was  swimming naked.  </p><p> WOLF:  Well, I won't comment on the swimming naked but what I will say is  we realize financial engineering doesn't always work and program trading  sometimes the pendulum goes too far each lane, you have these types of  swings.  </p><p> My concerns are two-fold, one, I think the administration is talking way  too much about the stock market.  I think President Trump, I think he  should take a lot of credit for the rally but to talk about it literally  every day, it's not the gauge on the economy we should be using as 50  percent of the nation doesn't even own stocks.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well I've been saying that literally since he took office.  </p><p> WOLF:  Well that's where I took it from.  And I think secondly, I think  that I know as the oldest one on this desk, I have not been in a market  that we've seen this type of back up and rates starting, inflation feeling  protectionist environment, problems with the fiscal deficit on one side,  and then the other side, decent growth, you have the tax cuts that are  going to be almost like its own quantitative easing and then lastly, good  corporate profits.  There's a real tug of war that's going to go in 2018.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well who's going to win because I will push back because I've  been concerned about interest rate moving up since really the end of last  year but with inflation now come -- with wages now growing at close to  three percent which happened in the most recent month.</p><p> That's -- still, wages are still -- growth is still very muted, inflation  is still muted.  And all the signs in the market, for the most part, do say  that the economy is OK if not, great.  </p><p> WOLF:  So I would say -- first of all, I would say the bulls will win  short-term because the tax reform is going to be the sugar candy for  corporate growth.  And I think you're going to see that short-term soft  buybacks, dividend, some M&amp;A activity.</p><p> But I think long-term, people are going to project out a backup of rates  and when we start getting three and a half, four percent, you're going to  see a shift take place from equity to fixed income, you're just going to  see it because risk free returns are going to start to look good versus a  market that's been pretty buoyant.  I mean, that's just one thing I do have  as experience 30 years.  I can't say how much in the market today.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It sounds like you're calling longer term for a bear market in  stocks and bonds because, again, if -- because we've had a bull market in  bonds since the early 1980s.  Did you --</p><p> WOLF:  I wouldn't say a bear market but I think the bears will beat the  bulls probably come towards late 2018, early 2019 as we see in just to my  opinion this nervousness.  We're going to do better, growth is here, wages  will do better, the labor force is starting to tighten.  Those are just  facts.  And we have a whole new Fed environment with Powell coming in.</p><p> BELL:  I think it's going to depend largely on inflation and interest rates  as well and inflation is going to be driven by that wage number.  If we get  productivity which it seems like we should get better productivity, the  inflation won't come in high-speed manner that is sort of expected kind of  market right now.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Any concerns about the impact to the economy because of tax  reform if the Fed ends up tightening at monetary policy because of  inflation as some are talking about right now and also -- MCDOWELL:  Well they are tightening monetary policies.  They're reducing  their balance sheets, it's already down to $4 trillion and they're already  raising interesting rates.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Right.  But the question is, if interest rates if we get four  instead of three, if things change as they are trying to cool down the  economy getting too heated up, do you have any concerns over the tax cuts  and how that might have an impact on the deficit and debt?</p><p> WOLF:  Well I do.  I mean, I've been speaking about it, yes, I'm a pro- growth Democrat but I have been -- I am fiscally pretty hawkish in a sense  that I think if everything should have been revenue neutral, I believe in  the PAYGO system.  And so my view is although I was supportive of tax  reform, I probably would have looked to have done -- I would have done it - -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So you were up -- so you were concerned that that --</p><p> WOLF:  I was concerned on the fiscal side sometimes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well -- so you were also concerned when the national debt  doubled under President Obama.</p><p> WOLF:  Absolutely.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Did you fell in that as his economic advisor?</p><p> WOLF:  We're talking about -- we're looking -- the answer -- you know, I've  been with you for a decade, so the answer is yes.  I mean, listen, I --  when I was his economics advisor, very clear we want the tax reform to go  to 28 percent, for corporate it's 25 percent for manufacturing.  We will  also -- we had a Republican Senate in the House, it had to be revenue  neutral.</p><p> That was the only dialogue we ever had was revenue neutral.  That being  said, corporate tax reform is a good thing, I am not going to push back on  that.  I just think that we have not been in an environment with raising  rates, high debt, fiscal deficit and think that's good for the stock  market.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I agree with you that we've never been an environment where  the Federal Reserve.  We had easy, such easy money for so long that we're  entering this unprecedented era of where the Fed has to unwind this balance  sheet where the easy money starts disappearing and you're just beginning to  see the risky, even idiotic debts that people took because everything was  going up in lockstep. </p><p> I want to get to this though Lindsey, just to mention that the Atlanta  Federal Reserve did lower its first-quarter GDP forecast to four percent  from 5.4 percent, that was what it released last week.  The change in the  space of a week, what do you make of it?  BELL:  I mean, it was related to consumption and fixed investment.  So I  think consumption is still good at 3 percent, we saw 3.8 percent in the  fourth quarter, the consumer is very, very strong.  And 4 percent, let's be  honest, when was the last time we saw 4 percent GDP growth?  That's an  outstanding number.  And the Atlanta Fed has been pretty decent about their  -- with the accuracy for the initial estimate of GDP.</p><p> WOLF:  We should ring the bell if we have four percent GDP.</p><p> BELL:  Thank you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And we're getting that four percent in part because of the tax  reform.</p><p> WOLF:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.  See?  We all agree.</p><p> WOLF:  You got them two for two.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We all agree. </p><p> BELL:  You don't have to worry about that deficit if we get (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Again, I worry -- I've said this repeatedly but like you saw all  the speculation going on in like Bitcoin in these assets, speculating with  these exchange rate of products on stable low volatility markets and you  get a snapback and you see what kind of risk people are taking.  I don't  think that this -- I mean, this clearly is not over with the loss on the  Futures this morning.</p><p> Coming up, losing Wynn, real estate and casino mogul Steve Wynn stepping  down from his own company after being accused of sexual misconduct  allegations.  What this means for the future of Wynn's global empire,  that's ahead.</p><p> (VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Roaring toward a new chapter in the American space race, Elon  Musk, Falcon Heavy makes history but he doesn't lose his sense of humor  while doing it.  We'll explain.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  Investors are strapping in for another busy day  in the market.  Take a look at the Dow Futures right now, 236-point gain on  the Dow Futures.  Volatility came back with a vengeance and the question  remains: How long will it last?  What kind of wild swings are we going to  see in the market and what kind of losses it shakes out?  And do some  people lose confidence in their trading ability?  Meantime, Steve Wynn now  resigning as Chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts.  Cheryl Casone has more  details -- Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  That's right.  Dagen, good morning.  Wynn Resorts says that Steve  Wynn's resignation is effective immediately, this comes after sexual  misconduct allegations against the Las Vegas billionaire.  A number of  women claimed that Wynn harassed or assaulted them.  One case led to $7.5  million settlement.  Wynn denies these allegations but looking at what's  happening in the premarket here, the stock is actually down almost 1-1/2  percent in the premarket.  Again, Steve Wynn, his resignation effective  immediately.  So, we're also watching shares of Snap this morning.  Get  this, the stock soaring in the premarket up 23 percent, almost 24 percent.   Well, there you go.  Now, it's 24 percent.  They reported better-than- expected quarterly results after the bell.  The stock's back above that  $17.00 IPO price for now.  Revenues soaring more than 70 percent from a  year ago.  That a sharp increase in daily active users.  </p><p> Also this morning, we're going to get earnings from Hasbro and Michael  Kors, 21st Century Fox, the parent company of the FBN reports after the  bell later today.  And we are going to hear from Tesla, Elon Musk's company  later today as well.  And a little flicking for higher revenue from rising  sales of their Model S, their Model X, and their Model 3 vehicles.  Tesla  shares, however, are having, of course of that earnings report, moving  lower in the premarket a little more than a quarter percent.  But let's  stay with Tesla and Elon Musk, he made some news by launching the world's  biggest rocket.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CROWD OF PEOPLE:  Three, two, one.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launched yesterday to the delight of  employees, space fans, of course.  The 230-foot rocket featured 27 engines,  three boosters.  It cost SpaceX about a billion dollars to build.  Now, two  reusable side boosters did come back to Earth, they landed at the same  time.  That was flawless.  Remember that saves your money in space travel.   Now, this is neat though, Dagen, a Tesla Roadster was hidden onboard.  It  served as a test payload and they put basically a space guy in the driver's  seat.  The pictures have been amazing.  That roadster has now exceeded  Mars' orbit, but loving the pictures from there.  And for any dame that may  take a closer look at the Roadster, they're going to find this on the  circuit board, quote, \"Made on Earth by humans.\"  So, we'll see if little  space travel guy makes some alien friends while he's out there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love it.  </p><p> CASONE:  It was fun, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I was a NASA nerd when I was growing up.  So, I love seeing  these pictures in school, and Lea was a pilot.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  This is one of those things that could have been like, massive  success or a massive scale and what a massive success it was.  I mean,  looking at the two boosters land that way was just spectacular.  And then - - I mean, really, that car is space trash, let's admit it.  But if it's the  first thing that we see just heading out into space like this, it's pretty  neat to see this car cruising around.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And also, just the fact that you have private industries  stepping up where the government has pulled away.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, that's just that.  It's just that it's the way  innovations do this.</p><p> WOLF:  You're the expert in this space.  I can just tell you, our pilots at  our drone company in Washington were so pumped.  It was like literally, you  know, we shut down for the, you know, the hour it was on.  I think they  were waiting for two hours as well.  But it was -- they were just so fired  up.</p><p> BELL:  I think watching the landing was so awesome, too.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes, it's one of those things where you just hold your breath.   And you're hoping that it's going to all workout.  But, you know, Dagen,  you make such a good point about how innovation has changed and how defense  used to lead innovation and now it's really industry that's leading  innovation.  And it's really, you know, it shows where our country can go  and where we can develop things in the future.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Inspiring kids everywhere, including Disney battling on a galaxy  far, far away to rocket to the Future, the earnings straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Disney CEO Bob Iger revealing the company's new ESPN streaming  service will launch later this spring as Disney reports its first-quarter  earnings.  Lauren Simonetti has all the details.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  What a report, Dagen.  So, OK, stronger-than-expected profits,  but taking a look here, you can see revenue $15.35 billion in the last  quarter that actually missed expectations.  And they did take a one-time  benefit related to the new tax law.  So, 1.6 billion there.  Nonetheless,  take a look at the share price reaction right now.  Shares are up to 2.2  percent at 108.50 in the premarket.  If you look at many of Disney's units  and we get revenue for these segments, you can see that their studio and  media units fell short of expectations, but they did see big strength in  the theme parks.  Goes to show you that customers are still willing to pay  sky-high prices for tickets.  By the way, we're going to find out of a  price increase for theme park tickets in the coming week.  You know, and  the higher hotel prices consumers are willing to spend this for  entertainment.  </p><p> Speaking of, struggling ESPN but we do have news for ESPN.  ESPN+, their  new streaming service, it's going to debut in the spring.  It's going to  cost $4.99 a month.  You can buy it as an add-on service and can be used  for the redesigned ESPN App.  It's basically going to give you live  programming that's not available on the current channels.  And then --</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KIT HARINGTON, ACTOR:  Reach out.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes, that's \"Game of Thrones\" from HBO.  And yes, the  masterminds behind that hit series are teaming up with Disney and  Lucasfilms to produce -- are you ready -- a new \"Star Wars\" series.  We  don't know how many movies or the release dates, but these are going to be  separate from the \"Star Wars\" the franchise that you've seen.  After two  iconic blockbusters getting together, this is -- this is good, this is good  stuff.  Disney also said that they have pre-ticket sales for one of their  new Marvel movies, Black Panthers, biggest they've ever seen for a  superhero franchise.  So, they're going all in on the -- on the movies and  the franchises.</p><p> BELL:  I think, this just goes to the quality of corporate earnings that  are coming out yesterday DowDuPont had a really solid report and now we're  seeing both of these stocks go up and on the day-to-day, the market is  down.  That's awesome.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes.  Good point.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what you want to say -- you want to say, individual  names trade on the underlying fundamentals whether it's strength in the  earnings, strength in the economy rather than like a washout.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  A lot of people are saying, Steven Mnuchin, said yesterday the  fundamentals of the market are strong and that's what we are seeing in this  report from Disney.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  The members of the administration forced to talk about the  stock market because the President has been (INAUDIBLE) as essentially  bragging repeatedly about the stock market going up.  So, now you have  Mnuchin, even Vice President Pence for us to talk about it.  So, I haven't  mentioned your Patriots loss, but let me take a moment to mention that.   But are you excited about \"Game of Thrones\" mixed with \"Star Wars\"?  </p><p> WOLF:  I'm glad you shifted to \"Game of Thrones\".  I can't wait.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I didn't want to rub it in.</p><p> WOLF: I couldn't wait for \"Game of Thrones\".  I am so bummed it's the last  season.  But I can't wait for it to come on.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Can you explain to me, I know you're huge in to \"Star Wars\" OK,  you're into \"Game of Thrones\", what's the matchup of these going to look  like?</p><p> WOLF:  I don't know, maybe it's John Snow fighting Darth Vader.  I mean,  you know, who knows what's going to happen and since he comes back and who  knows, we could be --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Dragons in space.</p><p> WOLF:  We could have so many different things going on.  Maybe HBO mergers  with Disney and then it's the \"Game of (INAUDIBLE).\"  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  So, should Netflix be worried?  Because, you know, now this new  streaming service is coming out at some point that's going to be cheaper  than Netflix, and Disney has its amazing content and they pulled so much of  it from Netflix.  </p><p> WOLF:  You know, everyone has enough money, they're now -- they're all  fighting for content.  Hulu, Amazon, and I mean, it's going to be a very  interesting years to come on where we're watching.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think this ESPN+ is going to be really popular because of how  people can sort of pick and choose from the menu of what they want to see  and when they are picking sports.  They really want to be able to pick  their teams and watch their game.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I streamed the Super Bowl and --</p><p> WOLF:  You're really killing me right now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was crystal clear watching those Patriots lose, crystal.</p><p> WOLF:  You know, I'll take -- you know what, I'm going to take my five  Super Bowls and I'm OK with that.  So, I'm --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> GABRIELLE:  See, I've heard a lot of Patriots fans say that.  It's like,  you know what --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> WOLF:  No.  Listen, no question you want your team to win.  But do you want  your team in in this -- listen, I actually like the Eagles, too, I want to  Pen, but I'm a staunch Patriots guy and they just didn't -- they came up  short.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, they did.  Thank you, Lauren, Sir.  Disney not coming up  short.  Coming up, tougher sanctions yet.  That tough warning from Vice  President Mike Pence to North Korea if the country doesn't end its nuclear  ambitions.  And why Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg says  that the Vice President's personal role about social gatherings with women  and alcohol is a huge setback for all women in the workforce.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, February 7th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Another  wild day on Wall Street, the Dow swinging more than 1,000 points from the  lows to the highs in trading yesterday, the major market gauges finishing  the session in the green.  The Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ are all back in  positive territory for the year, but volatility still reigns supreme.   Despite that, the White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said  the administration is not worried.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The economy is  incredibly strong right now.  The President's focus continues to be on the  long-term economic fundamentals were infinitely better off today than where  we were before the President took office, particularly on the economy.  We  have historically low unemployment and we actually have increasing wages  for American workers.  There's nothing that's taken place over the last  couple of days in our economy that's fundamentally different than it was  two weeks ago.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But volatility still front and center this morning, stability,  hard to find, 210-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, losses across  the board there.  In Europe, we do have some gains to report in England,  France, and Germany, although slight, the biggest winner at the moment, in  percentage term, is the FTSE-100 in England.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets mostly lower, the Nikkei managing to eke out a  small gain, but the KOSPI in South Korea, losing more than two percent.   And a strong warning for North Korea, Vice President Mike Pence says that  the U.S. will impose the toughest ever sanctions on the country.  Those  details as he holds a bilateral meeting with Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo  Abe.  </p><p> Sheryl Sandberg calling for fairness when it comes to the personal role, in  which the vice president won't eat alone with a woman, other than his wife,  and won't attend events that have alcohol without her either.  Sandberg  says women's careers are ultimately hurt by this, her fix, coming up.</p><p> Plus, America's source of innovation, under fire over diversity of  opinions, we have new study showing how conservatives feel out-of-place in  Silicon Valley.  I think the headline there is that there are any  conservatives in Silicon Valley.  But now, to the latest on Wall Street,  Futures reporting to decline at the open, losses across the board, this  after swinging wildly between gains and losses yesterday.  Volatility also  hitting the bond market, yields today, take a look at where yields are,  2.77 on the 10-year.</p><p> We had the yield on the ten-year hit a four-year high of -- it was 2.85  percent -- north of 2.85 percent that was on Friday, but money has been  going back into bonds in the face of the stock volatility.  Joining me now,  Wells Fargo Investment Institution President, Darrell Cronk, Darrell, what  is your take on the climate of fixed income and stock markets and how they  match up with --</p><p> DARRELL CRONK, PRESIDENT, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTION:  That's a  good question, Dagen.  This recent correction, actually, had both  correlated where yields were rising as stocks were falling, which is  somewhat atypical.  We broke that a little bit.  I think the bond market --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Last couple of days.</p><p> CRONK:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You had money go -- you know, volatility push money into bonds - -</p><p> CRONK:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  which is, kind of, what you'd want to see.</p><p> CRONK:  Monday afternoon, late in the session.  I actually think the bond  market has handled this correction very well.  You haven't seen a spill  over into what we'd see as traditional safe haven so, commodities, the U.S.  dollar, yields, there's no gap out in high yields spreads.  So the lower  tear sections of the credit market have behaved very well, actually.  So  this is a lot like the equity markets catching a bad bout of this flu  that's going around.  But the flu hasn't been contagious to the other asset  classes yet.</p><p> BELL:  So how do you see tax reform playing into interest rates and  inflation?  I mean, the way that this tax reform is structured, it seems to  be supply-side, so in that way, companies are investing in CAPEX which will  help increase productivity so you won't -- shouldn't see that much  inflation that do you agree with that assessment?  How do you see that  playing out?</p><p> CRONK:  I absolutely agree with that, Lindsey.  I think inflation will  trend mildly higher and some wage inflation is a good thing.  Wage  inflation with productivity growth to your point is actually a good thing.   Wage inflation without productivity growth, where it just increases unit  labor costs and squeezes profit margins for companies, is a bad thing.  We  don't expect a lot of inflation to take higher, but mild inflation higher  is actually a very healthy thing.</p><p> WOLF:  So, Darrell, at what point do you think rates have to back up too to  see a shift from equities back to fixed income?</p><p> CRONK:  I think --</p><p> WOLF:  Three and a half, four?</p><p> CRONK:  Yes, I think three percent is a psychological level right now for  the markets, as it tries the equity markets, as they try and find their  base.  North of three and a quarter to three and a half, I think starts to  squeeze profit margins at that point.</p><p> WOLF:  But where do you see for your clients?  Where do you see money  actually shifting out of -- out of stocks into bonds, at that type of  level?</p><p> CRONK:  Yes, I think it -- at three and a quarter to three and a half, you  start to get the equity risk premium, to be more equal.  Today, it still  favors equities over fixed income right now.</p><p> WOLF:  So where's Wells projecting, kind of, 10-year rates, year-end 2018?</p><p> CRONK:  275.  We've got a range of 250 to 300, 275 with the midway.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How is that possible with the economy growing as strongly as it  is, at least in -- because of tax reform and certainly in the first  quarter, but really the rest of the year that's what's expected.</p><p> CRONK:  Yes, I do think you will see stronger growth, we think 2.9, 3  percent GDP growth.  But when you look at the amount of supply issuance  that has to come on the market for treasuries, this has been the false  narrative (INAUDIBLE) forever which is, kind of, that higher growth has to  equal higher rates almost immediately.  And it may equal them in the  intermediate term, but in 2018, we don't see a big spike up in rates.</p><p> BELL:  So you will say invested in equities then --</p><p> CRONK:  Yes.</p><p> BEL:  for the remainder of the year and what sectors do you like?</p><p> CRONK:  Right now, we actually like financials, we like industrials, we  like consumer discretionary, and we actually like healthcare, so three of  those four, being more procyclical for better growth, better economic  environment.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And financials, just to name one, a benefit of deregulation  coming out of Washington.</p><p> CRONK:  Absolutely.  That's right, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to talk about what we've seen with the, kind of, bets  that were placed on stable markets, the bet against volatility over the  last couple of years?  And the losses that were abruptly and surprisingly  exposed just in the last couple of days.  </p><p> These two -- one, in particular, this XIV, it is a well-known product sold  by Credit Suisse, constructed by Credit Suisse that shut down yesterday  after it lost almost all of its money in trading.  It was really late  Monday, but again, when you have such loose monetary policy --</p><p> CRONK:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  money flooding the market anywhere and everywhere, you're just  beginning to see the overconfidence and the really -- the kinds of bets  that not just individuals took but institution investors.  And do you  expect -- because again, and I keep repeating this line, you find out who's  naked only when the tide goes out.</p><p> CRONK:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And do you worry that that kind of volatility in this kind of  law -- these losses could impact the stock markets and hold back the bull  market as it comes up on its ninth year anniversary?</p><p> CRONK:  Two points there, from the institutional side, you're exactly  right.  So, that's part of what we saw on Monday's action.  So you have  this -- it's a little complex but you have this risk parody and macro CTA  funds that when volatility is really low, their model suggests that they  overweight risk assets.  </p><p> And as soon as volatility spikes, those algorithms or that mass, and just  they have to sell those risk assets, which is why you saw flood in the  treasuries, Monday afternoon, and rates come back down.  To your second  point, the individual, when you see this kind of volatility, it can damage  psyche, right?  </p><p> So, the individual's -- you know, this year has been a narrative of two  months, right?  January was all about pro-tax reform's better growth.  We  walked in with the best earnings expectations for the whole year.  </p><p> Now, February has been all about -- well, wait a minute, what if the fed  goes too far, what if inflation becomes problematic, right?  And those two  narratives have to balance each other out over time.  And if the market,  even today, is still trying to figure out which one is going to play.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But you buy stocks here, is what you're saying?</p><p> CRONK:  We buy more of the January (INAUDIBLE) this point, than the  February.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What would change your mind?  Is there any kind of marker that  you're looking for?</p><p> CRONK:  Inflation.  Inflation is the primary marker.  So if you would see a  spike materially higher in inflation data, not just wage inflation but core  inflation as a whole.  And remember, the PCE that the fed uses, is still at  1-1/2 to 1.6 percent.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I said -- I said this yesterday.  Maybe all of that cheap  money from Central Banks, once it winds up in the hands of individuals who  don't just buy risky assets with it, they actually start going out and  spending it.  That's when you need to start worrying.  </p><p> CRONK:  Absolutely.  Yes, that's true.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  When mom and dad and brother and sister out there in the country  --</p><p> CRONK:  But you don't see that in the consumption patterns quite yet,  right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> CRONK:  I mean, yet.</p><p> WOLF:  Quick question.</p><p> CRONK:  Yes.</p><p> WOLF:  the volatility continues throughout '18?</p><p> CRONK:  Yes.  Well, certainly on a relative basis, from '17, right?</p><p> WOLF:  I've been told we're wrapping twice, though.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.  You said yes, but --</p><p> CRONK:  Yes, absolutely.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And you can't bet on stable markets at least in some of these  exchange trader products anymore.</p><p> CRONK:  And volatility is a healthy thing.  So, I think, we should welcome  on more normalized level of volatility, not the extreme low volatility we  had in 2016 and '17.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It has shaken some people out of this market, though.  Darrell,  thank you so much.</p><p> CRONK:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Sheryl Sandberg's knock against the Vice President,  why the Facebook Chief Operating Officer says Mike Pence's personal role  about social gatherings with alcohol and women, harms all women.  And  Silicon Valley's secret uncovered, a new survey details the climate for  conservatives in the tech business.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  Taking a quick look at Dow Futures  right now.  Meantime, Vice President Mike Pence -- you can take a look at  losses across the board, but you know what, well off their lows of the  morning so far, only 135-point loss on the Dow Futures.  I think it's safe  to say we should prepare ourselves for wild swings like we saw yesterday  where, again, the Dow ended the day up 567 points, but it was down more  than a thousand early on.  Still, we talked about Vice President Mike Pence  in Tokyo delivering a stern warning to North Korea.  Cheryl Casone has the  details, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  That's right, Dagen.  Vice President Pence continuing to put  pressure on North Korea.  On his way to the Winter Olympics in South Korea,  Pence stopped in Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.   Pence reiterated Washington's stance that all option are on the table to  deal with North Korea.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I'm announcing today that  the United States of America will soon unveil the toughest and most  aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea ever.  And we will  continue to isolate North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic  missile program once and for all.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Well, Pence is set to leave the U.S. allegation to the opening  ceremonies on Friday.  Despite the tough rhetoric, he has stopped short of  ruling out a meeting with Senior North Korean officials while he is there.   Meanwhile, Kim Jong-un is sending his younger sister to South Korea for the  Winter Olympics.  This is the first time any member of the Kim family has  crossed the border.  30-year-old, Kim Yo-jong plans to attend the opening  ceremony on Friday.  She was blacklisted last year by the U.S. Treasury  Department over human rights abuses and censorship.  Well, Vice President  Pence won't be having dinner alone with Kim Yo-jong at the Olympics.  </p><p> He's got a personal rule that's kind of common among Evangelical.  It  doesn't allow him to be alone with women, and he has also said in the past  he won't attend an event if there is alcohol there without his wife by his  side.  Well, Sheryl Sandberg has picked up on this.  She thinks this role  hurts women's growth in the workplace because of missed opportunities to  network with men.  Sandberg is the COO of Facebook, and, of course, the co- founder of Leanin Organization.  Says that if men follow the so-called Mike  Pence rule, it should apply to everyone not just to women.  </p><p> With the flood of each revelations, a recent survey show that half of male  manager say they are uncomfortable participating in basic activities with  women, Dagen.  So, she's saying this is going to hurt it -- because you've  already got, frankly, women already isolated.  That is her point, in  corporate America.  Most male senior managers, CEO, are men.  So, if you're  going to get take away that opportunity, that one-on-one networking, then  if you can't go to lunch with the CEO as a woman, then nobody should go to  lunch with the CEO, men included -- make it a rule for everybody.  </p><p> BELL:  I mean, I think one of the unfortunate responses to the #metoo  movement has been that men do feel like they can't go to lunch with females  that they work with, and be a man to them, or things like that.  </p><p> CASONE:  That's what the survey sounds.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  You know, this is something that I saw in the post Tail Hook  Navy -- because I joined the Navy in 1993.  When I first entered -- and  that was right after a woman who had been chained to a year (INAUDIBLE)  Academy; tail hook it happened.  And there was sort of this, this fear from  men to get close to women, to spend time with women, to socialize with  women, and I do think that it is damaging to women when they want to move  up, and when they need mentors in any workplace whether it's corporate  America or military.  I think that that applies.  And I think this type of,  you know, putting this idea out, you know, certainly is understandable from  a Christian marriage perspective on wanting to sort of protect your  relationship.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  But it is hurtful to people in the workplace.  And I see her  point, I see Sheryl Sandberg's point.</p><p> CASONE:  If that's Mike Pence's choice, that's one thing.  But to adopt  that rule, I think, across American culture, particularly in business, I  think is wrong.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes, I think I would like it as a wife, but as woman in the  workplace, I don't like it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you want to weigh in, because you ran -- I mean, you ran a  business. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I am completely supportive with Sheryl Sandberg's  perspective here.  You cannot, you know, have an environment where you say  you're comfortable with one sex and not the other in the workforce.  It  makes no sense at all.  And he should keep those type of use to himself.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's too late.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's a really interesting conversation, though.  Coming up,  creative, fun, closed minds?  The fired Google engineer who is suing the  company for allegedly discriminating against White male conservatives --  White conservative men, maybe onto something.  A revealing new look at how  some conservative employees in big tech, really feels, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A new survey claims conservatives are feeling out of place in  Silicon Valley.  This comes after a former Google engineer sued the tech  giant for discrimination.  Joining me now is Garrett Johnson, Lincoln  Network Co-Founder, and Executive Director.  Garrett, your company put  together this survey.  Tell us about it, what did you find?</p><p> GARRETT JOHNSON, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LINCOLN NETWORK:  Good  morning.  So, we put this survey together in response to all of the inbound  questions we get from journalist.  When a James Damore issue becomes a  national conversation, we get inbound, myself and Aaron Ginn, my co- founder, are things as bad as everyone says they are; what's the ground  level of truth.  Unfortunately, there was no data.  You have lots of  companies who report data on diverse issues as they relate to gender,  ethnicity, sexual orientation, but not viewpoint diversity.  So, this is  the first data that we know of on this issue.  And there's assumptions that  things are bad for people who are on the right of center spectrum  conservatives, libertarians.  But this data suggests that it is indeed the  case, and is probably worse than anyone thought.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bad, how?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I was going to ask a question as well, when you  say bias against, what actually are you meaning?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes, so, in addition to the raw data that we collected from a  little under 400 people, we also collected comments -- people open in the  comments.  We have 23 longer form conversations.  People -- one person said  that he was targeted by his manager because he was a delegate to the  Republican convention.  The manager tried to get him fired.  He recorded  some conversations, you know, behind the manager's back, and was able to  take that to be peace within the country, and save his job.  But the  manager was not fired; there was no repercussions.  You have some people,  you know, who say that, you know, they avoid at going to work the day after  the election because they knew the anti-Trump sentiment would be so strong  and obnoxious that they just didn't want to tolerate it.  So, just  generally, either targeting, feeling comfortable at work, there is this  notion within Silicon Valley -- SalesForce, Google -- that you should bring  your whole self to work.  Well, that's not really the case if you think a  certain way.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Do you think that's really unique to Silicon Valley, though?   When you talk about, like, the post-election sentiment and how they felt?   It seems like that might something that's broader than just looking at  Silicon Valley.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  I think that's right.  I think that Silicon Valley is consistent  with trends throughout the country, but you have to think about the echo  chambers that these tech companies have created with their technology.  You  know, they have enhanced the tribalization of our country with the  platforms that they've created.  And, you know, technology is most consumed  in tech hubs like Silicon Valley.  So, you know, you had your echo chamber,  you live in this bubble, and so it's more intense.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just wonder as they -- as the employee base at Silicon Valley  ages, is this going to change, which is something that Robert brought up?   Because people tend to get more conservative as they get older.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  I think it might.  You know, that's not data that we collected.   This was a pilot survey.  So, it only focused on Silicon Valley.  We're  going to be doing one later this year that will touch other tech hubs and  hopefully capture that data.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Garrett, good to see you.  Thank you so much, Garrett Johnson.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Still ahead, the very latest as investors hang on for another  wild ride in these markets in the next hour with MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, February 7th.</p><p> Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Volatility slamming Wall Street -- investors in for a wild ride yesterday.   The Dow did finish up 567 points but it was down -- there was about a  1,200-point range during the same trading day.</p><p> As of yesterday's close, all three major market gauges are back in positive  territory for the year but not the Dow Transports and not small cap stocks,  we should point out.</p><p> Let's take a look at the futures.  We're showing losses across the board  but they are mild compared to what we saw just one hour ago.  The Dow  futures were down more than 200 points.</p><p> Again, what does this volatility do to shake out the speculators who had  piled into the market and played some wonky bets in the last couple of  years?</p><p> The Atlanta Federal Reserve meantime has lowered its first quarter GDP  forecast.  We're talking about that 5.4 percent last week.  Now Atlanta Fed  thinks the economy is just going to grow at 4 percent -- still high.</p><p> In Europe stocks are moving higher but they're warm, shall we say.  We have  gains across the board.  FTSE 100 up almost 1 percent.  </p><p> In Asia overnight, stocks mostly lower.  The Kospi the worst performer down  there in South Korea -- or over there in South Korea down more than 2  percent.</p><p> Budget battle looming -- lawmakers have until tomorrow night to reach an  agreement to keep the federal government running.  So the House passes a  stopgap spending bill, the fight turns to the Senate where immigration  remains a top issue.</p><p> Speaker of the House Paul Ryan weighed in on the possibility of a shutdown.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  The only reason we do not  have a full budget agreement is because Democrats continue to hold funding  for our government hostage on an unrelated issue.  They must stop using our  troops as pawns in a game of politics.</p><p> I urge the Senate Democrats to stop their filibuster and provide our men  and women in uniform the resources that they need, the support that they  need.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The immigration debate is in full swing amid tragedy in Indiana.   The latest as the illegal immigrant suspected of killing Indianapolis Colts  linebacker Edwin Jackson is charged.</p><p> Plus, a bushel of headlines for Apple as the company says it could offer  rebate for customers who paid full price for battery replacement.  The tech  giant may team with Goldman Sachs to help shoppers finance their phone.   More details on that ahead.</p><p> And is the crypto crash fully upon us?  Why one firm is warning that the  days are numbered for several digital currencies.</p><p> And here with me to break it all down this morning:  Fox News correspondent  Lea Gabrielle; Fox News contributor, 32 Advisers founder and CEO and former  economic adviser to President Obama, he also ran a giant Wall Street bank,  Robert Wolf; and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.</p><p> You'd still be long stocks here though, wouldn't you?  You worry about  interest rates, inflation, deficits, debt -- but not yet.  </p><p> ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I missed the whole run.  But if I was  going to make a bet, I would bet stocks do better for the, you know, first  half of '18.  But then I would be nervous to the back half.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, but you didn't think even that Congress was going to get  tax reform done.  You talked about that all year long last year.  You  didn't think they would be able to come together to get it done.  </p><p> WOLF:  I've been wrong once in the last 30 years.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You were wrong about the Patriots, too at the Super Bowl.  </p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Ouch.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm just kidding.  But again, short run -- you worry longer run.  </p><p> WOLF:  I worry longer run because I think back-up rates will shift assets.   And then we're going to have a back-up of rates because we're going to have  growth.  We're going to have some wage inflation.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So we will talk about that as the morning rolls on.  We have  incredible guests coming up.  White House director of legislative affairs  Marc Short is here, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy, former chief of staff  under President Bush 43 and Business Roundtable president and CEO Josh  Bolton, and Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano, and  the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO\" Stuart Varney.</p><p> You don't want to miss it.</p><p> But first taking a look at futures this morning, we have losses across the  board but really off the lows of the morning -- the Dow futures down just  46 points.  Stocks rebounding yesterday after the biggest sell-off in more  than six years during a volatile session on Monday.  The Dow finishing the  day up 200, 2.3 percent higher; that was a gain of 567 points.</p><p> Joining us now to weigh in, New York Congresswoman Claudia Tenney and New  York Congressman Tom Suozzi.  Good to see you both.  Congresswoman Tenney - - </p><p> REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK:  Yes.  Suozzi.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Suozzi -- I said it right, didn't I Congressman?  </p><p> REP. TOM SUOZZI (D), NEW YORK:  It was close.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But Congresswoman Tenney -- your reaction on these markets  because I would argue that the President of your party has put you in a  tough bind where now you're going to get asked about the stock market.  </p><p> TENNEY:  I don't think so.  I mean to be honest with you, the stock market  is not the only determination of what's going on in the marketplace.  I, in  fact, sold a bunch of things last week because I had some things to pay  off.  So after Christmas and all those good things I sold some stuff.</p><p> So I think what you had yesterday was a bargain hunter's market.  And  people around -- all of a sudden the stocks rebounded.  I think when you  look at the interest rates, a little bit of adjustment in the interest  rates with a new fed chairman.  I think that makes a difference.  The  growth from the tax cuts and jobs act they're certainly important.</p><p> And I might cite an industry, the tax foundation has stated that New York  is going to be one of the biggest growth states because of the tax cuts and  jobs act.  So I think it's really interesting to see how this plays out  over the next few months.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman Suozzi -- do you agree with your fellow congressman  from the state of New York, but also have you been hearing from any of your  constituents, given just what happened in the market the last few days or  really in the last week or so?  </p><p> SUOZZI:  You know, people are worried about the effect of the tax plan,  because in my part of the state we're going to be hit very hard by the  elimination of the state and local tax deduction and the tax plan actually  increased the deficit significantly by about $1.5 trillion.</p><p> In addition, there's talk of a new infrastructure plan which will increase  the debt even further.  There's this plan of the CR that's going to be will  be coming up that will increase the debt even further.</p><p> All these things together increase the debt that may have an impact on  actually stimulating the economy in a way but it will cause interest rates  to go up.  When interest rates go up, our debt service goes up because of  our huge deficits in the federal government.  That could be what's scaring  the marketplace.</p><p> So right now, deficits are a big concern to the marketplace.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, Congressman Suozzi, were you worried about the debt  doubling under President Obama?  Was that a concern for you?  Were you  worried about it then?  That was over eight years.  </p><p> SUOZZI:  Actually I was in the private sector at the time.  I wasn't paying  quite as close attention at the time but the reality was is that the debt  that doubled during that time was because of the stimulus package, to try  and actually to force the economy to grow.</p><p> The economy has been growing since President Obama's administration and now  it's the Trump administration.  It's been growing, growing, growing,  growing.  And the concern is that by adding debt at this time, we're going  to hyper-inflate the market and get it moving too frothy and that scares  people that our deficits are going to grow and that's why we're seeing this  volatility in the marketplace right now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That also falls on members of Congress not in te3rms of cutting  spending.  And I want to point out that the House did pass another stopgap  spending bill yesterday.  It funds the government through March 23rd and  now goes to the senate.</p><p> Leaders there are really -- there's some issue with the defense part of the  stopgap that was passed by the House, what happens with that vote.  But the  Senate is working on a longer two-year budget deal.</p><p> President Trump is throwing an immigration grenade into the budget talks,  saying he's prepared to shut down the government if Congress doesn't pass  border security measures.  </p><p> Listen to this and I'll get your reaction.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  If we don't change the legislation, if we don't get rid of these  loopholes where killers are allowed to come in to our country and continue  to kill, gang members -- and we're just talking about MS-13. There are many  gang members that we don't even mention.</p><p> If we don't change it, let's have a shutdown.  We'll do a shutdown.  We  have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want safety -- and  unrelated but still related, they don't want to take care of our military.   Then shut it down.  We'll go with another shutdown.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman Tenney, is that helpful?  </p><p> TENNEY:  Let me first say something about Mr. Suozzi's comments.  First of  all, Democrats have no other issues to run and all of a sudden their new- found deficit hawks.  They care a lot about the deficit and the debt which  they never cared about before.  </p><p> And they cared about huge, you know, trillion-dollars in stimulus before  that didn't spur the economy to the levels of growth that we're expecting  to see just in one year of rolling back regulations, cutting taxes.  And  now we're predicting even bigger growth in spite of what the stock market's  fluctuation.</p><p> So I just say that I would not give credit to President Obama for this.  I  think this is clearly the enthusiasm from businesses knowing they're not  going to get sucker-punched by government and officials on the federal and  hopefully not the state side.  So Tom and I know what it's like to live and  work in New York State.</p><p> But on the President's side, I mean the President's a negotiator.  He wants  us to act on this.  He had a very, very generous offer during the State of  the Union on immigration which really shouldn't be impacting what we're  doing with the continuing resolution.</p><p> And I'm concerned about our military.  My son's an active duty Marine.  We  are giving less predictable funding to our military which puts them at risk  and also puts our country's security at risk.  So I'm concerned about that.</p><p> But as far as the immigration package, really what the President has  offered are very similar to things that Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi --  maybe not Nancy Pelosi -- maybe Senator Feinstein have voted on many times  in the past and they've supported, not just voted on but supported as well.</p><p> And so I think that those are things we've got to look to.  I think -- you  know, we have time with DACA.  I think let's sit down in a bipartisan way  and come up with a solution.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what's going on with the top senators pursuing the  two-year budget deal, separating for now stalled immigration fight and  actually increasing spending, Congressman Suozzi, $80 billion a year in  Defense and also on the non-Defense side as well which is what the  Democrats have pushed for, $63 billion.</p><p> So that's an increase of $143 billion a year in spending on Defense and  non-Defense.  If you're worried about the debt and deficits, Congressman  Suozzi, how do you get behind that?  </p><p> SUOZZI:  Yes.  That's something I'm thinking about right now.  You know,  I'm very interested in us working together to try and come up with a plan  to actually keep the government moving forward.  People that are concerned  about Defense and the military; Secretary Mattis was just testifying in our  committee yesterday and talking about how dangerous these continuing  resolutions are and we need long-term spending plans to help our military  and to help every single department that we have throughout the federal  government.</p><p> So I'm interested in a bipartisan plan.  But I'm also concerned about the  fact that we're increasing the deficit.  And you know, talk about new-found  Democrats, Republicans -- we're all in this together, ok.  Republicans and  Democrats, different people from each party have paid attention to deficits  for a long time.  Other people have not paid attention to it.</p><p> I'm concerned that as we increase the deficit, we're going to see an impact  on our interest rates and that's going to cause even more debt for the  federal government.</p><p> I work in a group called the Problem Solvers' Caucus.  I'm the vice  chairman.  That's 24 Democrats, 24 Republicans.  We have talked over and  over again about how we want to have plans working together but increasing  the deficit is one of the worst things we can do.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But how does it help with Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman  calling thousand-dollar bonuses \"pathetic crumbs\".  Do you think $1,000 to  one of your constituents, Congressman is crumbs?  </p><p> SUOZZI:  I absolutely don't think that's the case.  And I think that the  idea was that it was a small percentage was going to lower income people.   But in America there's 105 million full-time jobs; 59 million people make  less than $50,000 a year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.</p><p> SUOZZI:  86 million people make less than $75,000 a year so $1,000 is a big  impact on a lot of families especially these folks that are making $50,000  a year, $75,000 a year.  </p><p> TENNEY:  I agree.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've said it -- I was -- you know, I'm the child of small  business owners who were never helped by the government.  And to say $1,000  which where I grew up can feed a family of four for a month, I just found  that to be just completely deaf.</p><p> But I want to move on, Congresswoman Tenney, to President Trump facing some  backlash over what the White House says was a joke he made on Monday.  The  President was slamming Democrats for not standing and applauding during his  first state of the union address.  So watch this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  They were like deaf and un-American, un-American.  Somebody said  treasonous, I mean -- yes, I guess why not.  Can we call that treason?  Why  not?  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I know what treason is because Maria Bartiromo gave me a  pocket constitution for Christmas.</p><p> TENNEY:  Oh, good.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And it's Article 3, Section 3 of our constitution.  So the  definition of treason is very specific.  But you said, Congresswoman Tenney  that Democrats might not be treasonous but they're un-American and don't  love our country.  Do you still stand by that?</p><p> TENNEY:  Yes.  That's not what I said.  What I said was them not standing  for families who had their children murdered by MS-13, not standing for our  flag, not standing for God, not standing for all the things that we stand  for as Americans, yes I think the President has a point there.</p><p> I certainly don't support that he said treasonous.  I think he said it as a  joke.  But now, you know, the Democrats are out trying to raise money,  claiming I said Democrats are un-American.  Of course that's not true.   Many of my supporters are Democrats.</p><p> And the issue is this.  Why wouldn't they stand for things that were common  sense?  I know a lot of Republicans -- I looked back and looked the old  reels of Obama's state of the union addresses.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> TENNEY:  And when things he talked about Americanism and unity between us,  the Republicans stood on their feet and clapped for that.  There were real  easy chances for the Democrats to stand and I'm sure Mr. Suozzi would have  liked to stand if Nancy Pelosi would let them.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mr. Suozzi -- you get about 10 seconds to respond.  So quickly.  </p><p> TENNEY:  People are sick and tired of the politics back and forth.  They  want us to get things done.  Democrats, Republicans -- forget it.  We're  Americans.  We need to work together and solve problems.  People are sick  of all this personal stuff.</p><p> TENNEY:  I agree.</p><p> SUOZZI:  All this talk about treason, talking about shutting down  government, it's irresponsible.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Tenney, Suozzi -- Congressmen both, thank you.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Investors bracing for another crazy ride on Wall Street.  Take a  look at the futures right now.  92 point loss on the Dow futures.  Listen,  the futures were off by more than 200 points early in the session.  Again,  a return to volatility in this market where the markets had been so stable,  very few wild swings -- the Dow was up for 10 months in a row, including  January.  That's the longest run since the late 50s.  So again, we've been  on a rocket ship high.</p><p> Meantime a powerful winter storm pounding about 20 states.  Cheryl Casone  has the details -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.   A massive storm actually --  Dagen.</p><p> It's moving from Texas to Maine.  It's going to bring heavy snow to New  England, a mix of snow and freezing rain to the northeast and the mid- Atlantic regions, and ice and rain to the Midwest and the southeast.</p><p> According to FlightAware about 800 flights have been canceled so far today,  more than 100 of them at Newark Liberty International Airport here in the  New York area.</p><p> Well, the illegal immigrant suspected of killing Indianapolis Colts player  Edwin Jackson while driving drunk now faces federal immigration charges.   Manuel Orrego Savala charged with illegally re-entering the United States  for a second time after he was deported in 2007 and 2009.</p><p> Police say Jackson, who was 26 years old, as well as 54-year-old Jeffrey  Monroe, an Uber driver, died early Sunday morning as they were standing on  the side of I-70 in Indiana.</p><p> Orrego-Savala is due in court today in connection with that highway crash.   Orrego Savala is not the only illegal immigrant who keeps coming back to  the U.S., by the way.  The \"Washington Times\" reports that one Mexican has  managed to get deported 44 times in 15 years.  Of course, he has also  managed to sneak back across the border at least that many times.  The  runner up was ousted 40 times from the United States between 2001 to 2015 - - Dagen.  A lot of crossings.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p> Coming up, fake dirt for the dossier -- new details on the Clinton  associate who may have said allegations to the author of the anti-Trump  dossier.</p><p> And banking on Apple -- how Goldman Sachs reportedly wants to cash in on  expensive iPhones.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p> New revelations this morning about that anti-Trump dossier.  According to  South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy, a Clinton family confidant may have  played a key role in feeding information to Christopher Steele.   Christopher Steele being the former British spy who compiled the document  in the weeks leading up to the election.</p><p> Here's what Congressman Gowdy told Martha MacCallum last night on \"THE  STORY\".</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  When you hear who the source or one  of the sources of that information is, you're going to think oh my gosh,  I've heard that name somewhere before.  Where could it possibly have been?  </p><p> MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS HOST:  The foreign source? </p><p> GOWDY:  The domestic source.  And I'm trying to think how Secretary Clinton  defined him.  I think she said he was an old friend who e-mailed her from  time to time.  </p><p> MACCALLUM:  Sidney Blumenthal?  </p><p> GOWDY:  That would be really warm.  You're warm.  Yes.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us this morning is Fox News senior judicial analyst  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Lay it out for us.</p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  My thoughts --  my thought is that Trey Gowdy is basically a very decent, honest guy.  But  you cannot look at raw intelligence because you have a top secret security  clearance because you're a member of the House Intelligence Committee and  selectively release parts of it and retain parts of it to produce a  political narrative which is basically what he was doing with Martha.</p><p> Now, Martha did an absolute A plus, 2.0 job of interviewing him.  But he is  not taking seriously his top secret security clearance if he thinks he can  selectively release things.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about what he disclosed because we know from the -- Senator  Chuck Grassley released an unclassified version of this recent letter that  he sent to the Justice Department, in part urging criminal investigation  into Christopher Steele for lying to the FBI.</p><p> But it also revealed additional information that was provided to Steele.   And we knew that ultimately it went to him initially because from a friend  of the Clintons.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm also a fan and a friend of Chuck Grassley.  But here is  why Christopher Steele will never, take it to the bank, be prosecuted  because Christopher Steele was an FBI asset for many years, perhaps while  he was also an MI-6 agent.</p><p> So think about this.  You have a British spy who is also spying for the  Americans.  What do the British call that -- espionage.  The last thing  they want is to put him in a criminal courtroom where he'll say here's what  the Americans told me.  Here's what the British told me.  Here's what I  told the Americans.  Here's what I told the British.</p><p> We have a group called The Five Eyes, E-Y-E-S.  He knows this.  Countries  in the world that we regularly exchange intel with and they're our friends  -- Great Britain, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and the United States.  In  return for that, we have an agreement.  We will not solicit or recruit  agents from one of the others.</p><p> Guess what the FBI did -- recruited Chris Steele.  That violated the  agreement and exposed Chris Steele to criminal prosecution.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But to get back to the dossier.  This dossier based on the memo  that we've seen that was released by Devin Nunes, based on additional  information from the likes of Senator Chuck Grassley, it was funded -- the  dossier was funded by the Democrats. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was -- there was -- Chris Christie was being fed information  by at least one Clinton associate.  And it was used to get a warrant  through the FISA court on an American citizen.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I am going to withhold judgment on that until I see, if I ever  see it because it shouldn't come out, but maybe it will -- everything that  was presented to the FISA court.</p><p> Now, the FISA court is a weird court.  They meet in secret.  The judges are  not allowed to take any notes or pens or papers out of the building or  bring anything into the building.  And there's no adversary</p><p> You introduce a document into a real court, somebody else is going to  challenge that document.  In FISA it's only the government lawyers.  It's  up to the judge to challenge the document.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think the question is how much it was actually -- whether  that was a point of reference or one of many points of reference.  Because  I think, you know, as former clandestine case officer, working for --  trained by the CIA, I can tell you that when you put together a dossier of  this form that is essentially opposition research, you cannot call this  intelligence.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  This is opposition research.  So it depends on what else was  presented to the FISA court.  We don't know that.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Bobby and I were talking about this during the break.</p><p> WOLF:  I'm going to give you a soft ball but I want -- but I think it's  important for the viewers to hear it.  One, do you think the Nunes memo  should have been released?  Now, do you think the Democratic memo should be  released?  And do you think, you know, this opens a whole Pandora's Box for  future memos?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes to all of the above.  Once the Nunes memo came out.</p><p> WOLF:  Do you think that should have been released?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, if it hadn't been released, we wouldn't be going down  this warren hole.  But once it came out, you have a Republican version,  four-page summary version of hundreds of pages of intel, some of which Trey  Gowdy teased Martha MacCallum about.</p><p> Now you're going to have a Democratic version, it's going to come to the  opposite conclusion.  The American people are not children.  We now should  be entitled to see all the raw intel.  The intelligence committee would go  through the roof, you know this, if that raw intel is revealed.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But to many people it looks like abuse of power by the FBI -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Abuse of power by the Justice Department.  And I want to point  out -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It shouldn't be a surprise that they abused power.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know but we're disgusted by it.  And we are surprised.</p><p> And we found out this morning -- this is more breaking news this morning.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Go ahead.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The FBI texting saga continues.  Fox News has new information  after reviewing thousands of previously unseen text between Peter Strzok,  the FBI agent and his then-mistress, Lisa Page.</p><p> In one message from 2015, Strzok then said about people who voted against  FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe's wife in the Virginia state senate race  calling them, quote, \"ignorant hillbillies\".  I'm from that state -- thank  you.</p><p> In another text, Page told Strzok -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Lord, have mercy on him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In September of 2016 that, quote, \"POTUS wants to know  everything that we're doing\".  Senate investigators told Fox News -- and  that's POTUS, President Obama -- told Fox News that the last message is  raising questions about President Obama's personal involvement in the  Clinton e-mail investigation -- Judge.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There are about 8,000 FBI agents and we're going through the  text of two of them.  I'm going to tell you the 7,998 are not very happy  about this.  They have very, very strong political opinions.  They're  entitled to those political opinions.  They've say said things about groups  of people because of their origin, which is dumb.  But they're entitled to  be dumb.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But Peter Strzok was somebody who worked on the Clinton  investigation -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct -- so let me finish.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- and then worked on the Mueller team until he got kicked to  human resources because Mueller found out about it.  </p><p> WOLF:  Also Dagen -- and also brought back the Comey, Clinton investigation  that he was part of that the Democrats were not happy with. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So look, if -- </p><p> WOLF:  I mean there's a lot of he said-she said -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Final word.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  If a strong political opinion animates a law enforcement  decision; if decisions are made for political not bona fide law enforcement  reasons -- that is wrong and it can constitute misconduct in office.  But  words alone don't constitute misconduct in office.</p><p> MCDOWELL: And I just wonder if we'll ever get to the bottom of this.  And  I'm glad you're here.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's a -- </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p> I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p> It's Wednesday, February 7th; your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> (INAUDIBLE) on Wall Street, the Dow swinging more than a thousand points  from the lows to the highs of the day yesterday, adding 567 points, the  major market gauges (ph) finishing the session in the green and the Dow,  S&amp;P, and NASDAQ, are all back in positive territory for the year.</p><p> Despite the volatility, Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin isn't worried.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, SECRETARY, US TREASURY:  The stock market is up  significantly over 30 percent since President Trump was elected.</p><p> We're monitoring the stock markets.  They're functioning very well and we  continue to believe in the long-term impact of the stock market.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Checking on the action this morning we have an eighty-three- point loss on the Dow Futures but they were down more than 200 points when  we started this show at 6:00 a.m. Eastern; we have losses on the S&amp;P and  NASDAQ as well.</p><p> In Europe we have some buying to report, in England, France, and Germany.   Take a look at the green across the screen, the FTSE 100 now up more than  one percent.</p><p> But in Asia overnight markets mostly lower, there the KOSPI in South Korea  shedding more than two percent.</p><p> And we're watching Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin rebounding this  morning but one Wall Street firm warning that cryptocurrencies will crash,  to zero, more on that ahead.</p><p> And Goldman Sachs taking another bet on the consumer, the bank is said to  be looking to finance iPhones.  It comes some iPhone users may be getting a  rebate on replacement batteries.</p><p> And 'Gronk' robbed, we have the 911 call that the star Tight End hopes will  catch the suspect who broke into his home during the Super Bowl.</p><p> But now to the latest on Wall Street, volatile swings slamming stocks  yesterday, also on Monday, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee  Sanders weighing in on that wild ride, from Capitol Hill.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, PRESS SECRETARY, WHITE HOUSE:  Look, the economy is  incredibly strong right now.</p><p> The president's focus continues to be on the long-term economic  fundamentals which like I just said are very strong in this country.</p><p> We're infinitely better off today than where we were before the president  took office particularly on the economy, we have historically low  unemployment, and we actually have increasing wages for American workers.</p><p> There's nothing that's taken place over the last couple of days in our  economy that's fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This morning we have losses to report, 88-point loss on the Dow  Futures, 86-point loss there but again off the lows of the morning.</p><p> Joining me now is White House Director of Legislative Affairs, Marc Short.</p><p> Marc the president because he retweeted and talked about the record- breaking run in the stock market so much has put all of you folks working  at the White House in a pickle in the sense that you've now -- forced to  talk about the stock market, when in past administrations you could talk  about the economy but generally stayed away from those kind of day-to-day,  week-to-week, month-to-month, swings in stocks?</p><p> MARC SHORT, DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS, WHITE HOUSE &amp; ASSISTANT TO  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  Well, I guess the way we look at it is the markets  are up over 30 percent as you heard secretary Mnuchin say, since election  day, over $7 trillion in asset value, added to individuals' portfolios  since election day.</p><p> The reality is unemployment is at a 17-year low, the economy is growing  strong and in fact the Atlanta Fed estimated a 5.4 percent on GDP, that  sort of growth triggers inflation expectations.</p><p> And I think what you're seeing is simply a reaction from the market to  those expectations of higher inflation.</p><p> But that's not necessarily a bad thing when you consider that wage - wages  have been stuck and stagnant for so long particularly throughout the Obama  years and people are actually seeing higher wages today, and so there's  just a market recalibration going.</p><p> But as Sarah said from the podium, the fundamentals of the economy remain,  strong.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'll -- I'll just point out, the Atlanta Fed adjusted that  growth expectation down to four percent, that's still a very strong growth  number -</p><p> SHORT:  Yes -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - but do you -</p><p> SHORT:  - Dagen we -- during the Obama years it averaged 1.8 percent GDP  growth.  I think we'll take a four percent growth, we'd be pretty excited -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - That's a -</p><p> SHORT:  - about that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - that's a one quarter, people - now listen, some people are  calling for four percent growth for the whole year, Jamie Dimon has said  that to Maria Bartiromo.</p><p> But are you going to try and back away from talking about the stock market?</p><p> Have you had any discussions with the president about, 'let's stick to the  economy, let's stick to the wage growth, let's stick to how people feel at  home and their pocketbooks being more full because of the tax reform,'  rather than talking about a market that could be in for greater swings,  certainly in the coming years than we've seen, this very low volatility  environment the last couple of years?</p><p> SHORT:  Sure.  I think that's fair.</p><p> You would expect higher volatility throughout this year but at the same  time I think the president's proud of the gains in the turnaround in the  market, just as he's excited about the turnaround for mainstream Americans  too when they see 4.1 percent unemployment at a 17-year low, when they see  the economy growing, the last couple quarters averaging three percent, as I  said significantly better than 1.8 percent they experienced during eight  years of the Obama administration.</p><p> I think he's going to - he's going to tout although successes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There was some heavy - we're - we've been talking about  volatility and that just means swings but a lot of investors, even retail  investors have been betting on stable markets or betting against  volatility, the last couple of years, and with some of these exchange- traded products, there were couple of major ones, one run by Credit Suisse  that shut down on Tuesday because essentially all the money in them, a few  billion dollars, was wiped out late on Monday.</p><p> It kind of begs the question of, how are retail investors you know, did  they know what was going on, how were these things allowed to exist if they  were so volatile, is that something that you think that securities  regulators should look at?</p><p> SHORT:  I think that the president has a great team and Treasury and the  SEC that look at that.  I'm not expect - I'm not expecting any sort of  legislation on that front which is more my focus area -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> SHORT:  - Dagen, so I think that sure, there is a continued oversight of  that.</p><p> But if there's a greater volatility this year I think the reality is that  the fundamentals remain strong, the president has continued to roll back  the regulatory front, he's going to continue to make sure that there's tax  relief provided to the American people and we hope that the economy  continues to grow the way it has been.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well let's talk about Capitol Hill because there is a budget  battle to talk about, a government that -- if they can't come to some  agreement is going to shut down at midnight on Friday morning.</p><p> The House did approve another stop-gap spending bill yesterday --</p><p> SHORT:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:   -- the Senate looking to strike a longer-term deal -</p><p> SHORT:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - boosting spending for both domestic and military programs but  branching away from Immigration efforts so trying to separate that  Immigration fight from a funding bill.</p><p> President Trump reasserted his focus on Immigration, saying this at the  White House yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  If we don't  change it, let's have a shutdown; we'll do a shutdown and it's worth it for  country.</p><p> I'd love to see a shutdown, if we don't get this stuff taken care of.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What do you expect the budget outcome to be Marc and will the  president - would he - would he get behind this spending bill that's being  put together -</p><p> SHORT:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - in the Senate, if it separates Immigration from it?</p><p> SHORT:  So, it's a good question, there are couple things there.</p><p> One, keep in mind the president campaigned on rebuilding our military; the  budget cap deal that we expect to be announced perhaps as soon as today, I  think will provide the deliverance on the president's commitment to rebuild  our military, you'll see significant reinvestment there.</p><p> And I think that's one of the priorities that he set.</p><p> I do not expect a shutdown right now.</p><p> I think what the president is looking ahead to is the budget cap deal put  in place, higher caps on Defense spending that allows the appropriators to  then go write the bill that will come to the president's desk probably at  the end of March, on spending for 2018.</p><p> What he's saying once again is the same pledge he's made all along, which  is, he is expecting Congress to deliver on the promises we made on the  campaign that we would invest in border security and he's - he's going to  hold Congress' 'feet to the fire' on that and if they're not going to  deliver on that border security, he's saying, he's OK taking that extra  step.</p><p> But we're not expecting a shutdown this week, we are expecting a budget cap  deal to be in place and we're expecting it to be a victory on the  president's commitment to rebuild our military.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'll - I'll say that the Senate deal, the two-year budget deal  that's been pursued by senators, it actually, military spending comes in at  629 billion a year which is above the amount that the president sought in  his budget proposal to Congress last year.</p><p> It also increases Non-Defense spending so combined, 80 billion extra for  Defense, 63 billion extra for Non-Defense, that comes in at a hundred and  forty-three billion.</p><p> If somebody is worried about debt, deficits, and higher inflation, are you  OK with that?</p><p> SHORT:  I think that there is - there are concerns about the deficit  spending on this front.</p><p> Let me go back to the premise of your question, that was that, is that  secretary Mattis also said to Congress that he wants to see the numbers  stick to the NDA level, the National Defense Authorization Act that had it  at the six twenty-nine number plus 71 billion in overseas contingency  operations to bring it up to about 700 billion for the year.</p><p> So that is the number that the secretary had asked -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.</p><p> SHORT:  - for.</p><p> But I think that regarding the deficits, keep in mind that you'll see the  president put forward a budget that will cut spending when it comes forward  next week.</p><p> The challenge will be though, is just like last year, the president put  forward a budget that balanced in 10 years and yet Congress then summarily  dismissed it.</p><p> So, we do have serious concerns about the deficits and we do think that  Congress should do a stronger job of being responsible to taxpayers in- clearing those deficits.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick Marc, are we going to get some big infrastructure  announcement on Monday?</p><p> SHORT:  You're going to see the Infrastructure announcement rolled out and  we're expecting it on Monday.</p><p> The president spoke about it some, at the State of the Union and we do  expect that you'll see greater details of those plans coming forward on  Monday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Marc, good to see you.</p><p> We covered -</p><p> SHORT:  Thanks for having -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - a lot -</p><p> SHORT:  - me on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - of ground - Thank you so much.</p><p> Marc Short, from the White House.</p><p> Coming up, a Super Bowl title, not the only thing Rob Gronkowski was robbed  of, you'll hear the Patriots superstar's frantic 911 call after thieves  broke into his home and stole guns and safes.</p><p> Plus, Goldman Sachs eyeing Apple, the bank wants to cash in on some iPhone  customers.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Get ready for another wild ride on Wall Street.</p><p> Take a look at how the Futures are trading right now.</p><p>Dow Futures are down just 45 points, again a major bounce back, lots of  volatility again yesterday but after the worst percentage loss on Monday,  since August of 2011, the Dow - there was trading in a twelve hundred-point  range yesterday, managed to close up 567 points.</p><p>Dow Futures were down 200 points at 6:00 a.m., now look at them?  </p><p> Holding steady!</p><p> And Goldman Sachs is looking to help people buy the next iPhone and other  Apple gadgets.</p><p> Cheryl Casone has more details on this, hey Cheryl?</p><p> CASONE:  New twist for Goldman Dagen, \"The Wall Street Journal\" is  reporting that Goldman Sachs is in talks with Apple to finance customers  purchases of Apple products like, yes, the one thousand dollars iPhone X.   The Journal says, 'the customers will get a loan from Goldman instead of  using their credit card,' which can charge obviously a higher interest  rate.</p><p> And Dagen you spoke with the CEO of Citizens Financial last month, whose  bank already offers low-interest loans for the iPhone; here's what he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRUCE VAN SAUN, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP:  Apple has an  upgrade program for their phones and so we provide the installment credit  for Apple's customers.</p><p> We get to set the credit box in conjunction with Apple so it's - it's a  very nice program.</p><p>Apple has really high standards in terms of the customer experience in  their stores so we have very limited time to make the credit decision but  we've been I think living up to their standards.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well, meanwhile Apple says it sees strong demand for replacement  iPhone batteries and it may send consumers rebates to pay the full price  for a new battery.</p><p>Apple recently came under fire for using software to slowdown phones with  older batteries.</p><p> And then shares of Apple, we should say, little bit lowing the pre-market,  the stock is up though about 20 percent over the past year.</p><p> Well we're getting to hear the 911 call, Patriot's Tight End Rob Gronkowski  made to police, moments after realizing his house in Foxborough,  Massachusetts had been robbed.</p><p> ROB GRONKOWSKI, NFL TIGHT END, NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS:  Hello, this isn't -  this isn't an emergency.</p><p> This is just uh - this is Rob Gronkowski calling and while I was gone, my  whole house got robbed while on the Super Bowl trip and I just got back.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT:  \"This isn't an emergency.

So, I'm -- I'm a big believer in the Blockchain Technology.</p><p> I'm also a believer that crypto is an asset class</p><p> Whether Bitcoin is the end-all is to be determined but I think things like  Ripple and Ethereum, those that have an underlying platform; I've invested  in two that are in the pre-ICL stage by their legal services in Commerce.</p><p> It's to me if you have the underlying Blockchain and underlying  technological platforms, these are real asset classes.</p><p> I actually think Bitcoin is going to you know, -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But -</p><p> WOLF:  - have its volatility but it will be the one that people are using  to buy those asset -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - but people -</p><p> WOLF:  - classes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - have been using -</p><p> STREIBLE:  (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - but people have been using --</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA EQUITY AND FUND:  That's not well  known (ph).</p><p> MCDOWELL:   -- but people have been using it like they are betting on coin- toss -</p><p> STREIBLE:  - Yes.  And that is wrong.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - but if somebody on the other side of that trade that they  don't even know who they are betting against.</p><p> BELL:  Because they are not thinking like Robert, they should be analyzing  it like it's a true asset class.</p><p> WOLF:  That's why it went from 19,000 to 7,000, it's like catching knives,  if you don't know what you're investing in -</p><p> STREIBLE:  Hey -</p><p> WOLF:  - and it's just going down -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> WOLF:  - down, down, down.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Phil, real, quick, you've -</p><p> STREIBLE:  - Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - got 10 seconds.</p><p> STREIBLE:  Yes.  Here (ph) you know, something interesting is that your  State Farm insurance policy will state now that Bitcoins and  cryptocurrencies are not covered on your homeowner's insurance, if your  house burns down - </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you -</p><p> STREIBLE:  - or your computer -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - so much -</p><p> STREIBLE:  - is stolen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - Phil.</p><p> Phillip Streible.  </p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning.</p><p> I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.</p><p> It's Wednesday, February 7th; your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Wild swings on Wall Street, a fifth -- a five hundred and sixty-seven-point  gain yesterday but again, the range of swings about 1,200 points on  Tuesday.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

It's Wednesday, February 7th, your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Wild swings on Wall Street 567 point gain yesterday but again the  range of swings up 1,200 points on Tuesday.  Investors in for a volatile  ride yesterday and maybe today.  Take a look at how futures are trading  right now.  We had a more than 200-point loss on the Dow futures starting  to show 6:00 a.m. now down just 70 points but again volatility is back  after people got used to very calm markets, Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ start  today up for the year not the same story for the transports and small caps.  </p><p> Meantime, the Atlanta Federal Reserve has lowered its first-quarter GDP  forecast from 5.4 percent we reported that last week now down to four  percent, still strong.  In Europe stocks are heading higher across the  board, the biggest winner there being the FTSE 100 in England up more than  one percent.  In Asia overnight stocks mostly lower, the Nikkei eking out a  small gain, the KOSPI in South Korea the worst performer falling more than  two percent.  Budget battles looming, lawmakers have until tomorrow night  to reach an agreement to keep the federal government running.  The house  already passing a stopgap spending bill and now the fight turns to the  Senate how the Senate will vote on that and immigration is still a top  issue there.  White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short  weighed in on that debate last hour. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS:  We were expecting  Congress deliver on the promises we made on the campaign that we would  invest in border security.  And he's going to hold Congress' feet to fire  on that and if they're not going to deliver on that border security he's  saying he is okay taking that extra step.  But we are not expecting a  shutdown this week, we are expected a budget cut deal is to be in place and  we're expecting to be an evictee on the president's commitment to rebuild  our military. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The latest on that battle and the immigration straight fight  ahead.  Steve Wynn out, the details as the billionaire mogul stepped down  as CEO of his company following sexual misconduct allegations.  Sheryl  Sandberg calling for fairness when it comes to the Pence role.  The Vice  President won't eat alone with a woman other than his wife and he won't  attend events where alcohol is served without his wife either.  But Sheryl  Sandberg says women's careers are ultimately hurt by this.  And SpaceX  taking it to infinity and beyond!  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  3 2 1 -- </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The company launching their most powerful rocket since the  Apollo mission sending a test to roadster into orbit more on the giant leap  for the private space race ahead.  And here to break it all down Fox News  Correspondent Lea Gabrielle, Fox News Contributor 32 Advisory Founder and  CEO and Former Economic Advisory to President Obama Robert Wolf, And CFRA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  I was looking on Twitter, I think that  you were called tolerable this morning Mr. Wolff, how about that?</p><p> ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, that's -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm just -- I -- I am not making it up. </p><p> WOLF:  You know, this has been a really fun morning so I'm expect -- you  know, I see all you guys getting tweets saying, oh my God, I love seeing  you on.  I am waiting for one of those for me. </p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, sitting next to you I can  tell you they enjoyed to be with you.  It's more than tolerable to enjoy. </p><p> WOLF:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I think that the volatility that we saw in the market, the  massive sell-off on Monday, biggest point decline in the history of the Dow  but also the biggest percentage decline in since 2011.  It is important to  have somebody with experience who's here.  And that is no knock on your  age, I mean that -- I mean that from the bottom of my heart. </p><p> WOLF:  Thank you.  Well, I started really young on Wall Street 21, so when  I left at 50, you know, it was -- I felt like I had three great decades.  A  few things and -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, you want to -- we'll save it because we're going to talk  about the markets.  And you just have to tell people, some of the guests  are coming up later this hour.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  That's a tease, that's quite a tease.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get your -- I want to get your thoughts because again  this is just -- </p><p> WOLF:  Great guess what I was a going to say. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, so I -- the last few days felt like things that Mr. Wolf  and I have experienced covering the markets being involved in the markets  for so many years.  Joining the conversation this morning Louisiana Senator  John Kennedy, Former Chief of Staff under President George W. Bush,  Business Roundtable, CEO and President Joshua Bolten and Host of Varney &amp;  Company, Stuart Varney.  You don't want to miss it.  So volatility has come  back.  This is our top story.  Wall Street bouncing back but again they  kind of wild swings that we have seen in the market where many people have  bet billions of dollars on stable markets the last year or two was a big  winning bet.  And some people made 800 percent betting against volatility  but it came back and you had a couple of these exchange-traded products  wiped out, they closed -- they closed for good on Tuesday.  Now to you,  what were you going to say? </p><p> WOLF:  Yes, I mean listen.  We have spoken a lot since you know the Lehman  crisis where I spent you know a few days at the Fed there.  This is not  that type of crisis, this is not where on a one-directional down trade  everyone should be nervous that type of way where there's contagion coming.   This is actually just the opposite, you have a balancing equation right now  between the bears and the bulls that we spoke about between a rising rate  environment that makes people nervous versus very good corporate earnings  and growth.  </p><p> And the question is who wins and we have not seen a rising rate environment  for decades and so, you know, when I started in the 80s we were 12 percent,  we have been one directional, you know, for three decades.  And so at the  end of the day, we will be in an environment where we are not sure who is  going to win, it feels to me that the short term -- short term because of  tax reform corporate profits in the global growth will outperform for the  equity market versus a rising rate environment.  That's how it feels but  there is going to be incredible volatility. </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  I agree with that and what I  will say going back to your initial point about this isn't Lehman Brothers  days.  We have credit availability actually spreads on the 10 and the two- year have improved over the last several trading days.  So that's a good  sign and the inversion of the yield curve is a huge implication for us  going into a recession. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And that's a huge sign.  Inversion is where shorter-term rates  are higher than the longer term rates and -- because people are betting  basically buying longer-term debt thinking that there is going to be some  sort of calamity in the economy. </p><p> BELL:  Exactly.  And it's a key indicator. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But so can -- better economy can rising wages still drive this  market higher in coming year, Lindsey?</p><p> BELL:  I think so but we saw in the last couple days this market is a very  skittish market, they're going to be watching inflation, they're going to  be watching the 10 year, they're going to be watching wage data and wage  data that we got on Friday was good 2.9 percent but I mean when we are in a  boom times that wage growth is more like 3-1/2, four percent. </p><p> WOLF:  The one thing that is really different versus you know other  volatile times is the -- what Lea was talking earlier about the whole idea  of algorithmic and programmatic trading where it's not based on experience,  it's just based on -- there is no human touch to it and so the pendulum  swings farther each way. </p><p> BELL:  I was thinking about that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But is this something -- but this is -- I want to get to Kevin  Corke but this is something that we have known about though.  I remember  the flash crash 2010, this is why this 15-minute halts on stocks were put  in place.  So this is nothing new, you had to expect it, it was like people  got conned into thinking that volatility would never come back that  everything goes up in one direction that I can bet on Bitcoin, I can bet,  you know, a stable stock market, I can bet on anything and everything and  nothing ever goes down.  I mean again --</p><p> WOLF:  Yes, I know you were not going to like this but The President has  mentioned the great stock market at least 25 times just in the month of  January. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I -- listen, I -- </p><p> WOLF:  And I will just tell you if you're not -- I know but that it not a  gage for the economy that we actually usually look at -- we look at many  other gages and we should give him credit.  The economy is doing well, but  I think using the stock market as that key indicator is not the best way. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I said that from I think the day that he took office.   Even before -- no, I said you try to take credit for the record-breaking  run in the stock market on the way up and you are going to own it way down.   And I do think The President by talking about it so much even to the troops  during his Thanksgiving message that he puts all the people at the White  House in a position where now they have got to talk about it.  Whether it's  guest on this program whether it's Sarah Huckabee Sanders, whether it's the  treasury secretary, treasury secretary I understand he talks about the  stability of markets to make sure the markets are functioning properly that  is something the treasury secretary would talk about but in terms of --  now, they're trying to pivot back to just talking about the economy and it  is going to be hard.  Now I want to get to this budget issue because  lawmakers are scrambling to avoid a government shutdown set for tomorrow  night, tomorrow at midnight while President Trump trends to shut the  government down over his demands for border security.  Kevin Corke covering  the story from the White House and he has the very latest.  Hey, Kevin. </p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning to you,  Dagen.  Always nice to see you now the conventional wisdom in Washington is  typically speaking -- something will get done before Friday midnight but to  get to that C.R. that continuing resolution to give the government open and  funded, there are a lot of people who are concerned that they're probably  going to have to deal with most contentious issue and quite some time here  in Washington, you know, what I am talking about it's DACA, it's Dreamers  and most of all it is border security.  The President making it very plain  yesterday that look this is something that has got to be solved, he wants  it figured out now.  Now that is despite the threat of a democratic led  shutdown of the government. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I would love to see a  shutdown if we don't get this stuff taking care of.  So we have to strength  our borders not by a little bit but by a lot.  We are so far behind the  time and by the way, the world is laughing at us because they can't believe  these policies, they don't have it.  I could name 15 of them right now, no  other country in the world has what we have.  And we are going to get it  stopped and if we have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want  safety and unrelated but still related.  They don't want to take care of  our military then shut it down.  We will go with another shutdown.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CORKE:  You understand what they are doing here right?  What he is  basically saying is you will be on the side of taking nonresidents, aliens,  people who are here illegally versus picking to be on the side of the  American people, that is the strategy here.  But I should also tell you  this, Dagen, over on Capitol Hill, all is not lost, so says Masters, Mitch  McConnell, and Schumer. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I'm optimistic that  very soon we'll be able to reach an agreement.</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I have discussed some of  the outlines with my caucus that I think we are very happy with and  hopefully the Republicans are and then we can get something really good  done. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CORKE:  Now, let's be honest a lot of this is jesting for public  consumption but I don't think there's any of doubt.  We will see something  happen before Friday midnight, we'll be watching very carefully from our  perch.  And I promise that truck which is about to drive right by is far  enough away that I am safe, back to you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what -- you know what I fear the most Kevin for you  leaf blowers.  They are -- they are the worst thing on the plant, scarier  than a chainsaw. </p><p> CORKE:  Yes.  True story. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I brought it and it was so loud and so annoying.  Kevin, great  to see.  Kevin Corke from The White House for us.  Real quick everybody on  this budget deal, here is what bothers me about the Republicans show me  some spending restraints because again this deal that the senators are  putting through $80 billion a year more in defense spending, nondefense  spending, increasing by $63 billion a year and then we're going to be  talking about infrastructure. </p><p> GABRIELLE:  And that is the problem it's because they can't get it passed  without getting some Democrat support and Democrats won't support it unless  they get some sort of a match to the increasing defense spending, right? </p><p> WOLF:  But a few things.  That is not uncommon, that you have discretionary  spending and nondiscretionary go up equally.  That's not -- number two.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is the problem -- it's not --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- 20 trillion debt.</p><p> WOLF:  Number two, the Republicans have always been a pay go OK party.  Now  all of a sudden they are no longer fiscal, they find it --</p><p> GABRIELLE:  The military has been suffering since the budget control last  2011 the secret --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WOLF:  I'm not talking about the military.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm not talking about the military, we're talking about  the nondiscretionary.</p><p> WOLF:  And as you know Claire McCaskill went on the floor and said let's  pass all the spending we need for the military true or not true. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is true.</p><p> WOLF:  Is she a Democrat? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes. </p><p> WOLF:  And it didn't get passed, so listen, we can talk partisan politics  all day, we are all supportive of the military our -- my only point is the  Republican party has always been fiscal hoax and all of a sudden we have a  trillion-dollar deficit from the tax reform. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, and the Democrats said -- the Democrats have always wanted  to spend everybody else's money and not give it back to us and not give us  tax cuts.  And now all of a sudden they are worried about the sky falling  because of the budget deficit. </p><p> WOLF:  How about where we all agree -- how about where you all agree we  should not have a government shutdown, that does not --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think everyone does agree that. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I agree because the military doesn't get paid, that's what  shameful. </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think -- I think the only one who is not saying that right  now is President Trump and I think the reason he is saying what he is  saying is because he is appealing to his base.  And he's prone hyperbole.   Immigration. </p><p> WOLF:  Right.  But the -- but let's be clear, a government shutdown costs  over a billion dollars a day the last one, that's not a good thing for  anybody. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And doesn't make (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> WOLF:  And I'm not supportive of attaching DACA to a government shutdown  neither.  I think one is budgetary but we should -- we should --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want some spending restraints, Republicans spending  restraint.  Can we show it?  Can we see it?  More ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  Steve Wynn resigning as Chairman and CEO of Wynn  Resorts.  Cheryl Casone has more details.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Big news, Dagen.  Wynn has that Steve Wynn's  resignation, it's effective immediately.  This comes after sexual  misconduct allegations against the Las Vegas billionaire.  A number of  women have claimed that Wynn harassed or assaulted them, one case led to a  $7.5-million settlement.  Now, Wynn is still denying those allegations.   Shares of the company up nine percent in the premarket.  It was down  earlier.  Stock to watch today.</p><p> Well, a Facebook executive is taking issue with Mike Pence's rule about  being around women.  He has a personal rule that's common among a lot of  evangelicals.  Doesn't allow him to be alone with women.  He's also said in  the past, he won't attend an event with alcohol without his wife by his  side.  Well, Sheryl Sandberg thinks this rule hurts women's growth in the  workplace because missed opportunity to network with men.  A lot of times  they're superiors.  Sandberg, the CEO of Facebook and the co-founder of  Lennon says that if men followed the so-called Mike Pence Rule, it should  apply to everybody, not just women but the flood of #MeToo revolutions, a  recent survey showed half of male managers said their uncomfortable  participating in basic activities with women. </p><p> Well, President Trump like what he saw as a guest of honor at France's  Bastille Day parade last July, so much he wants a similar parade perhaps on  Pennsylvania Avenue to celebrate 4th of July.  Trump is asking the defense  department to throw a parade to show off American military power.  White  House officials and the Pentagon have confirmed that a military parade is - - well, they're talking about it.  Options are being put on table, they say  they're planning something.  Last time we had a full military parade in  D.C. was after the Gulf War back in '91.  It cost $12 million.  So you got  to throw out the --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think a parade to celebrate our troops, to celebrate our  defense, to celebrate our country is wonderful but we as a country are so  above these parades you see from other countries where they need to put on  display their weapons and need to show over what they have and if this in  any way smells of that type of parade I think will be resented by our  troops because we are above that. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WOLF:  There was a rule that President Trump may actually ride in one of  the tanks. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Did you just make that up? </p><p> WOLF:  I did. </p><p> BELL:  Oh my god.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That worked very well.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  You got me there.</p><p> WOLF:  I did.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No. That worked so well for Mike Dukakis, that basically ended  his presidential run but I want to point something out -- </p><p> WOLF:  Tuesday.  You got me there. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  So -- but one thing, but if that happens that you say the  military wouldn't like it but it would like the Soviet Union or North  Korea, I mean, that is the appearance. </p><p> BELL:  It is unnecessary, it looks silly.  I think something to celebrate  our troops is one thing, to celebrate country is something but if we start  making this look like a big display like we see in North Korea, it's silly,  it's unnecessary and we as a country are above it. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Wouldn't you rather have $20 million put towards new aircraft or  a new tank? </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that we should thank those who have served and do serve  who basically are protecting our freedom.  We say we're the land of the  free because we are the home of the brave.  We need to thank these  individuals every single day.  Thank you for your service. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Oh, thank you for saying that.  And let's thank them all of  those who serve and the families of those who serve by showing them off, by  not making them jump through you-know-what's to put on a parade.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I have my R. Riveter bag right here.  This is made  by the spouses of people of men and women who are serving in -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> WOLF:  And I have to show my wounded warriors here because I'm a big  supporter and to give the 20 million to wounded warriors.  So we have tons  of different ways to give the money versus the parade.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  You can see parades around the world as you see are vessels and  around the world supporting our country.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  The trickle-down effect of President Trump's tax  plan, how cutting corporate taxes could help millions of American workers.   Plus, Houston we have liftoff, more incredible video from the SpaceX rocket  launch, straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Investing in America.  A new blog post titled, America's workers  are the real winners from corporate tax reform. Hits back against critics  who say that the new tax law only benefits corporations.  It reads in part,  companies will also use some of the gains from tax reform to return capital  to investors.  Money returned to shareholders of any kind re-circulates  throughout the economy with some helping finance new star-ups, some being  reinvested in growing sectors to the economy.  Some being safe to increase  future consumption.  Let's bring in the writer of this blog post, he  happens to be the former chief of staff under President Bush 43, Business  Roundtable president and CEO, Josh Bolton.  Josh, you preach into the choir  right here, I have been saying that, I understand the way the tax reform  works both for individuals and corporations.  Are we hearing enough of that  from members of the Republican Party?  And those very lawmakers really  pushing back on the rhetoric from the likes of Nancy Pelosi?</p><p> JOSH BOLTON, CEO, BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE:  Yes, I hope so.  First of all,  thanks for having me this morning to talk about this.  But I hope we are  hearing it from the members who supported this tax bill because they have a  lot to be proud of.  It's not just the dividends and share buybacks that  the tax reform may release, the much more important part is the benefits  that are going directly to workers right now as a result of the extra cash  that companies have.  And even more important than that is the investments  that those corporations that companies all over America are going to be  able to do right here in America as a result of the more competitive tax  code.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I just want to point out we're looking at the vast list of  companies that are returning some of the tax savings to their workers  whether it's in thousand dollar bonuses and we just found out Chipotle has  said it's going to reinvest more than one-third of its savings from the new  tax law in its employees.  Some of the new benefits workers will get  include one-time bonuses of up to $1000 to hourly and salaried workers  along with life insurance, short-term disability insurance for hourly  restaurant managers.  This is just to name a few.  But to look at thousand  dollars in this country and say that it's pathetic crumbs, Josh, I don't --  I don't -- I know that that does not resonate with the American people.   I've said this, are people really looking at their bigger paychecks  thinking, I really wish Nancy Pelosi had her hands on this money instead of  me. </p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  I hope they are and comments like that I think just  reflected a fundamental misunderstanding of what tax reform was likely to  bring.  And the evidence is now overwhelming.  At the business roundtable  alone we represent 200 of America's biggest corporations.  We have members  of our organization alone have already announced over $700 million in  bonuses to their employees, lots of wage increases 401(k) enhancements.   Those are real substantial benefits for the workers of all those  corporations.  And that's just in the first six weeks after the enactment  of the tax reform.  I think there is a lot more to come in this economy.   Both in terms of short-term benefits that workers will realize more  importantly in the long-term competitiveness of American companies which is  where American workers need to work.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Josh, are you concerned though about the tax reform being part  of the reason that we were -- we're going to have higher inflation?  You  talk about wage growth.  But wage growth is part of the inflation equation,  you wind up with higher interest rates.  That is certainly last week was a  big concern for the stock market with that wage growth number we got from  the employment report.  </p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  That could have been a part of what's roiled the markets a  bit in the -- in the last few days is an expectation now of some  inflationary pressure from wage increases.  But look, that's -- that wasn't  the purpose of tax reform and it's not -- it's not really going to be the  effect.  What everybody across all political persuasions has been looking  for is real wage increases for American workers.  Tax reform is going to  unleash a lot of that and overall that's a huge benefit to the American  economy.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Josh, it was really good to see you.  Thank you for being here  as always.  </p><p> BOLTON:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Josh Bolton.  We will see you very soon.  As we go to break,  futures are trading like this right now, take a look.  Dow futures were  down more than 200 points when we started the show at 6:00 a.m. Eastern  down 87 points right now.  Wild swings on Wall Street, we will watch that  as the day moves on.  Plus, Tesla revving up to report fourth-quarter  earnings after the bell.  We break down the numbers ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  Welcome back,  everybody.  It's Wednesday, February 7th.  Your top stories at 8:32 a.m.  Eastern.  Another wild day on Wall Street, the Dow Jones swimming more than  1000 points, almost 1200 points in fact from loss to highs in yesterday's  session ending the day up 567 points, big bounce back from that kind of  epic loss on Monday.  The major market gages finishing yesterday in the  green and the Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ are all back in positive territory for  the year.  Checking action this morning.  Futures are off a little bit, the  Dow futures are down 98 points, they were off more than 200 early in the  morning about 6:00 a.m. when we started this program, started MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  </p><p> But again, this is the issue, volatility is back, people have become very  complacent, they weren't used to wild swings.  The Dow had a move of one  percent or more to seven times last year.  Over in Europe, you have gains  across the board to speak of.  The biggest gainer there being the FTSE 100  in England up more than one percent.  in Asia, markets were mostly lower,  heavy selling to report on the KOSPI in South Korea down more than two  percent.</p><p> Plus, Steve Wynn resigning from his namesake company.  The casino mogul  leaving amid allegations of sexual misconduct.  Stuart Varney's take coming  up.  To the budget battle on Capitol Hill.  One Senator unveiling  legislation to cut back on government waste.  The details ahead.  Investors  eyeing earnings of course back to fundamentals, Tesla gearing up to report  after the closing bell, the numbers that you need to watch ahead.  And  going to a place where there are no roads. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There might not be roads there but that didn't stop Elon Musk  from sending a Tesla into space.  More on the Falcon Heavy launch later  this hour.  Futures under pressure but well off the lows of the morning.   We are -- what are the traders on Wall Street saying about this have crazy  ride that we've seen really in the last week.  Nicole Petallides on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  Nicole? </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Good morning, Dagen.  So, obviously we've  seen from choppy (INAUDIBLE) action, there's no doubt about that, even this  morning as you have been covering there throughout the morning, we've seen  it down as much as close to 300 -- and the futures now we're down about  100, so that's what the traders are talking about.  They're also talking  about the heavy volume that we saw yesterday.  So there has been a lot of  action and talking about the people who were trying to get in, there were  some outages for people from T.D. Ameritrade and Fidelity trying to get --  try to navigate this difficult market.  And whether or not the bottom is  in.  That's been a big topic of conversation.  Yesterday we had obviously  the second largest-point swing ever in history in the day before.  The  biggest ever.  So, the question is whether or not the bottom is in and  yesterday 75 percent they said is likely in.  Back to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Nicole, thank you so much for that.  Nicole Petallides in the  New York Stock Exchange.  Turning to the shutdown showdown.  A bipartisan  budget deal in the works.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and  Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying that they are very close to finalizing  a budget that would boost military and nondefense spending, reportedly a  total $143 billion.  The new PAC makes no mention of immigration likely  tabling that debate for now.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SCHUMER:  The Republican leader and I have been working together quite  productively.  Of course, there is still some outstanding issues to be  resolved.  But we are closer to an agreement than we have ever been.</p><p> MCCONNELL:  Once we have established that the government is going to be  open which needs to happen by February the 8th.  We'll then go forward with  an immigration debate.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us now is Louisiana Senator John Kennedy.  This plan  comes just as the House approved a stopgap spending bill to fund the  government through March 23rd.  What do you think of the proposal from the  leadership in the Senate? </p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Well, I like the House deal, Dagen.  I  haven't seen the details of the leadership's proposal.  They say they are  close, I've been hearing that for four months.  I've got to see it to  believe it.  I think if they make a deal it will be two-year deal and  surprise-surprise they're going to increase spending.  I just got to see  how much and where they're going to spend the money.  And how much is going  to add to the he deficit and you can put me down as doubtful.  I'm not  saying I'm not going to vote for it, but every time there is a budget deal  it always includes bigger numbers not smaller numbers and while you and I  are talking today since we've been talking we've already borrowed a  million-dollars.  We've borrowed a million dollars a minute to operate the  Federal government.  $1.4 billion a day.  </p><p> BELL:  Senator, it's Lindsey Bell.  I absolutely can appreciate your  concern for the spending there and we need to cut back on some of these  costs but isn't a two-year deal better than another C.R. to just get --  take us out another six weeks, by the time we get to march, the fiscal year  only have six more months left. </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, the problem with the C.R. or continuing resolution, Dagen,  is that there is no certainty and it does hurt our military.  Because they  can't plan.  And I do support more spending for military.  Every Senator,  Republican and Democrat, has seen the classified information.  They can't  talk about it but they know we need more spending for the military.  I just  got to see how much of waste I've got to eat in order to help our military.   And I can't make that determination until I see the -- see the numbers.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Senator, this is Lea Gabrielle.  Nice to see you. </p><p> KENNEDY:  Nice to see you, Lea.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  It sounds like you're not very hot on what you expect to be  coming your but also acknowledge that a C.R. is a terrible solution for  what we have going on, so what are you proposing? </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, what I'm proposing is that we get serious about properly  funding our military and we get serious about living within our needs.   Nobody around here except some folks in the house and few Senators are  talking about how we can spend less.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  But how do you propose getting that done? </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, let me give you an example.  I'm introducing the bill with  Tom Carper, it's got a fancy title but I call it The Stop Paying Dead  People Act.  The federal government is paying I think between 10 and $20  billion dollars a year to dead people.  And they're cashing the checks.   Obviously, there is fraud.  I mean in some states dead people can vote but  cashing a check is a little bit too much.  </p><p> WOLF:  Senator --I</p><p> KENNEDY:  I'll give you an example over a three-year period, the auditors  found that the Federal government sent out $1 billion in foreign payments  to dead farmers.  There is another case over a five-year period, the  Federal government paid $600 million in Federal pension checks to dead  retirees.  And the checks are being cashed and you know what's being done  about it?  Nothing, zero, nada. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Senator, I'm going to let Robert Wolf ask you a question but  Robert, I think everybody is for getting rid of waste and fraud and paying  dead people but a few billion dollars a year is a drop in the doggone  bucket in terms of what we spend just on -- listen, the interest on our  national debt in a year or two is going to top what we spend on the  military, Robert.  </p><p> WOLF:  Yes.  Senator Kennedy, I just want to shift quickly because it seems  like either be a continuing resolution or a two-year budget deal with  respect to the -- with respect to the Senate.  It seems like there's not  going to be a government shutdown.  So I want to therefore just segue to  DACA which market is a really big gate for these 800,000 immigrants waiting  to see really what happens to them and just to be clear, you know, I'm a  supporter to protect the DREAMers.  And so I'm curious, where you are going  to March 5th and how do you see the outcome for these individuals? </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, number one, there are a lot of meetings being held in  groups of Senators are talking.  But what counts is 60 votes.  There are  several plans on the table right now, every single one of them are held  together with spit.  The only way to find out where everybody stands is to  vote.  And what I expect Senator McConnell to do is put some sort of  instrument bill on (INAUDIBLE) and let us start debating it and amending  it.  I'm much less sanguine than so my colleagues that we'll be able to 60  votes to do something meaningful.  Our Democratic friends want amnesty and  frankly nothing else.  I want to solve the problem.  I want to be here  talking about another DACA immigrant amnesty issue five or 10 years from  now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But Senator, that's one of the reasons that they're including  the people who never signed up for DACA, including the White House,  including that in that 1.8 million people who would be given a pass to  citizenship.  So, do you oppose any path to citizenship whatsoever?  You  can call it amnesty --</p><p> KENNEDY:  It just depends on the bill.  Look, here is the problem.  We've  got immigration laws about half of our public officials don't agree with  them so they don't enforce them.  I give you ask sanctuary cities are  exhibit number one.  What we need to do is agree on a set of laws and  enforce the damn things like every other country does.  Just doing amnesty  is not going to solve this problem.  We need to --</p><p> WOLF:  Just to shift.  So we know it's coming up on March 5th, so there's  not going to be a broad base immigration bill passed by March 5th, we know  this.  March 5th --</p><p> KENNEDY:  No.  We don't know that.  Excuse me.  But we don't know that.</p><p> WOLF:  OK.</p><p> KENNEDY:  We can start debating the immigration bill next week and come out  with a comprehensive bill.  We have 60 votes, now I'm not -- I don't think  we will but we could -- </p><p> WOLF:  So let's agree that the likelihood is unlikely.  So March 5th comes  and we have the situation with the DREAMers.  Where do you think it will --  what will happen on you March 5th?  What is your expectation? </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, if we don't do anything by March 5th, it's up to the  president.  Because he controls the enforcement of deportation, he sets  deportation policy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, Senator --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- the DACA recipients that is being held up in the courts.  So  there is this feeling in Washington that they can drag their feet and wait  on dealing with this because the court has said that the order to end DACA  that they're basically put a stop to it at least in -- for -- at least  temporarily.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  That's a very good point.  I can just tell you categorical,  unequivocally, I don't want there to be any doubt about where I stand.  I'm  not going to vote for amnesty unless I get a full bill that solves the  problem.  Now, you're going to ask me what that is, I've got my own ideas,  I'm not so arrogant that I think only my ideas will work but I'm not just  going to vote for amnesty and kick this problem down the road, I want to  solve it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good to see you but everybody who you're in -- at the -- in the  Senate and House with, you're kicking that debt problem down the road and  it's going to blow up in everybody's face.  That's my predictions.  Senator  John Kennedy.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Amen, amen, sister, amen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Futures are off by 102 points, that's much better than the  picture was at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  But again, wild swings on Wall  Street yesterday.  Meantime, Steve Wynn resigning as chairman and CEO of  Wynn Resorts.  Joining me now to weigh in is the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Mr. Stuart Varney.  What say you, sir?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Well, I don't think there was much choice here.   I think Steve Wynn had to go.  Look, he's been accused to buy, literally,  dozens of women of sexual misconduct.  He didn't get his day in court but  that is not the point.  Had this gone forward with him as CEO, the Chinese  government may well have withdrawn the licenses which Steve Wynn has for  his casinos in Macau.  You withdraw those licenses in Macau and you have  just about destroyed Wynn Casino, the stock.  He still got 12 percent of  it, but if you can operate in Macau and he's got 70 percent of his revenue  come from Macau, you can't operate, period.  He have to go even though he  didn't get his day in court.  That's my reading of it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But day in court, Stuart, though, means -- I mean, due process,  we all believe in that, right?</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That it means it leaves the company opening an internal  investigation with outside counsel to look into this, but I think when it  comes to light that an individual -- and this is according to all reports  in the Wall Street Journal -- Steve Wynn set up an LLC to pay one accuser,  took steps to conceal $7-1/2 million settlement.  It's those settlements  that we all well know dupe people in, in terms of their employment.</p><p> VARNEY:  Oh, you got a good point, Dagen.  No question about it.  I'm just  a little uncomfortable with the current trend towards utter dismissal,  total disgrace, you lose everything but you never get to plead your case in  court.  Now, in this particular instance, I can understand why not?  But  you know, we've gone a long way with this.  I'm not -- I'm not criticizing  the women who've come forward.  I enthrall it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart, no, no, no --</p><p> VARNEY:  I'm saying we better settle down a little here because maybe, in  some cases, some injustice is being done.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's not just men who are uncomfortable with some of this, it's  women like myself who is very uncomfortable with that story told about --  Aziz, I'm sorry, the comedian about this date that he had been on, and it  was a bad date, and he -- again, people's careers and lives are destroyed  in some instances by based on one headline.  Never read -- never reading  the allegations.  I just think that there is just -- there is definitely a  brewing discomfort among both men and women about how these allegations are  aired.</p><p> VARNEY:  Well said.  And there are no good answers here, period.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p> VARNEY:  None.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  None.  But we do want women to be heard, too.</p><p> VARNEY:  We do, indeed.  Absolutely, we do.  Yes, of course.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart, you're the best.  Your show starts in exactly 10  minutes.  There you go, Monday through Fridays, Stuart is all over this  market.  It is going to be incredible coverage as it is every day, Stuart  Varney 9:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Coming up, SpaceX successfully launching the Falcon Heavy rocket, sending a  Tesla Roadster into outer space.  More video that's out of this world,  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  To quote Robert Wolf, so cool.  3, 2, 1 liftoff.  SpaceX  successfully launching the Falcon Heavy Rocket yesterday, capable of  lifting up to 140,000 pounds, and now, holds the title of world's most  powerful rocket.  But how will Elon Musk auto company take off today?   Tesla set to report fourth-quarter results after the bell.  It's expected  to post a loss for $3.10 a share, revenue on revenue $3.28 billion.   Joining us now, ARK Invest Analyst, Tasha Keeney.  Tasha, what are  expectations for Tesla?</p><p> TASHA KEENEY, INVEST ANALYST, ARK:  So, I think most investors are worried  about the Model 3 production ramp cash burn.  But from our perspective, you  know, people are comparing Tesla to traditional auto companies.  It's an  autonomous car company.  And once that switch is flipped, and these cars  that are already on the road today become fully autonomous, they're going  to become revenue-generating assets.  So, from that perspective, we're  happy that Tesla is spending money to get this off the ground because we  think that opportunity is huge.  We think the global market for autonomous  driving, autonomous taxis could be around $10 trillion.</p><p> BELL:  But they do have competition in this space, Waymo, Lyft, a whole  slew of others.  How sure are you that they're going to get there first and  they're going to be the winners in this race?</p><p> KEENEY:  They do have competition but what Tesla has is scale.  So, every  car that's on the road today is basically like a mini R&amp;D center.  It's  gathering data that Tesla then uses to train its autonomous driving  algorithms.  And no other automaker has been able to do this, get cars on  the road with that capability.  So, this puts Tesla years ahead of others  and, you know, yesterday, we heard on G.M.'s earnings call that they have  about 100 test cars on the road.  I mean, Tesla has thousands of cars.   Think about that information and what it's capable of.</p><p> WOLF:  So, being an old-school Wall Street guy, at what point do you get  nervous about cash burn, and what -- this is much more like almost a  biotech company?</p><p> KEENEY:  Because it's being -- the cash burn has been getting worse each  quarter.  Yes, yes.  So, to give you an idea of roughly what we expect in  earnings from these vehicles, so right now, each car is generating about  $3,000 worth of earnings for Tesla.  We think once you turn that  autonomous, that could be a net present value about over $80,000 per  vehicle, and --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, we've -- go ahead, finish your --</p><p> KEENEY:  And, you know, so we're happy that they're spending money.  I  think we'd be happy if they raised another $20 billion to get this off the  ground.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, you get the Tesla in space but you also have the CEO Elon  Musk, the founder of the company who's busy with all these other pursuits  including SpaceX.  Concerned.</p><p> KEENEY:  That's a valid point.  You know, I think Elon Musk is a really  amazing person.  We saw in this rocket launch, he is capable of making the  impossible possible, and so, you know, while no one has achieved this feat  yet, I wouldn't put it past him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.  Tasha, Tasha Keeney, thank you so much.</p><p> KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.  Final thoughts when we come back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Final thoughts.  Lindsey?</p><p> BELL:  Get ready for this political uncertainty to drive that volatility.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Robert?</p><p> WOLF:  Congrats to the Eagles, great year for the Pats, and I've already  moved to the Celtics.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I would, too.  Lea?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Ask for a military parade, that you can see our ships on  parade, our submarines on parade, our soldiers, our sailors, airmen, and  marines around the world.  From Stephen LeClair who's a former marine, he  says he wants to spend time with his family on July 4th, not in a parade.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I say to the Democrats, stop talking down the economy and  essentially rooting for a downfall for the markets, bad for them.  Stuart,  over to you.</p><p> VARNEY:  Oh, I'll take it, Dagen.  Thank you very much, indeed.  It is not  over but is it calming down a bit?  OK.  I'm on dangerous ground.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Over to Dagen McDowell,  in for Maria Bartiromo this morning.  Hey Dagen.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning ladies.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for  Maria Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, February 7th.  Your top stories at 6:00  a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Volatility slamming Wall Street investors from Coast-to-Coast.  They were  in for a wild ride yesterday as the DOW finish the day up nearly 600 points  after falling by about the same amount in earlier trading.  All of the --  as of yesterday's close, all three of those major market gauges are back in  positive territory for the year.  </p><p>But Futures are telling a different story, 243 point loss on the DOW  Futures this morning.  Again, will volatility end this bull market coming  on its nine-year anniversary next month, we will ask that question.   Meantime, the economy still looks strong, the Atlanta Federal Reserve did  lower its first-quarter GDP forecast to four percent, still hot but that's  down from 5.4 percent last week.  </p><p>In Europe, stocks are heading higher.  We have some modest gains across the  board in England, France, and Germany but in Asia overnight, stocks mostly  lower.  The Kospi in South Korea, the worst performer there.  The Nikkei  managing to eke out a small gain but the Kospi up by more than two percent.</p><p>The budget battles looming, lawmakers have until tomorrow night to reach an  agreement to keep the federal government running as the House passes a  stopgap spending bill, the fight now turns to the Senate where immigration  remains a top issue.  President Trump weighing in from the White House  yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't change it, let's  have a shutdown, we'll do a shutdown and it's worth it for our country.   I'd love to see a shutdown if we don't get this stuff taken care of.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The latest on the immigration battle ahead.  Steve Wynn, out.   The details as the billionaire mogul steps down as CEO of his company  following sexual misconduct claims.  </p><p>SpaceX takes it to infinity and beyond.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The company launching their most powerful rocket since the  Apollo mission.  Sending a Tesla Roadster into orbit as well, more on the  giant leap for the private space race ahead.</p><p>Plus, winter is coming to a galaxy far, far away.  From ESPN to \"Star  Wars\", the Disney earnings, a fan's dream.  The new details on the  company's fourth streaming service and its plans that came with the mind  behind \"Game of Thrones.\"</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, FOX News Correspondent,  Lea Gabrielle is here.  FOX News Contributor, 32Advisors Founder and CEO  and Former Economic Advisor to President Obama, Robert Wolf.  And CFRA  Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Good morning to everybody.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Great too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is when I'm very happy.  We have some age on the panel,  myself included because we remember what this kind of all feels it looks  like.</p><p>WOLF:  You know, I'm thinking that -- I think I was in middle school when  we had this volatility.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Really?</p><p>WOLF:  It's been like a -- let's be honest, outside of the dot-com bubble  and the Asia crisis and the 2008 recession, we've kind of been on a three- decade, one directional ride.  We haven't seen the 1,200 point swing, I  can't remember.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We want to make it there, yes.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  I mean, it turns out the stock  market actually goes down sometimes, right?  It should be a really -- this  should be a wakeup call for investors, retail investors especially.  What  do you have in your portfolio?  You need to know.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well I think that people already got a wakeup call Lindsey and  we will talk about that with people betting on stable markets with these  inverse volatility funds, a couple of them shutting down yesterday.  We're  talking about massive losses, so it's not just individuals, that some of  the smartest minds, some of the smartest guys and gals in the room, again,  also losing money.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And a lot of computers involved in what was going on, of  course, to those algorithms have certainly changed how the work is being  done.</p><p>WOLF:  No question.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're going to talk about it all this morning.  Coming up, White  House Director of Legislative Affairs, Marc Short is here.  New York  Congressman Tom Suozzi, New York Congresswoman, Claudia Tenney, that's on  the left and the right, we'll have them on together.  Louisiana Senator,  John Kennedy, and former George W. Bush Chief of Staff Business Roundtable  President and CEO, Josh Bolton.</p><p>You don't want to miss any of those guests but first for our top story,  Wall Street bouncing back, U.S. markets rallying to regain almost half  their losses from the day before when stocks took the largest plunge in six  and a half years, that is the percentage loss that we saw on the DOW.  The  DOW ending the day with a gain of 567 points.  After closing, down more  than 1,100 points on Monday.  Futures right now are showing losses across  the board, 243 point loss on the DOW Futures.</p><p>Despite the turbulence, Treasury Secretary Steve MNuchin telling lawmakers  on Capitol Hill that the markets are functioning, \"Very well.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  We are very focused on the long- term economic growth and we believe that the policies that we've enacted  including tax reform are very positive for a long-term economic growth.   We're already beginning to see that in terms of corporate investments back  into the United States and the impact on corporate earnings.</p><p>I think as you said that the stock market is up significantly over 30  percent since President Trump was elected, we're monitoring the stock  markets, they're functioning very well, and we continue to believe in the  long-term impact of the stock market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, your take on what Secretary MNuchin is saying but also  in volatility going to threaten this nine-year bull market?</p><p>BELL:  I think volatility certainly has a shot at ruining it but look, last  year, there were eight days that we saw a move of one percent plus or minus  on the S&amp;P500.  Historically, we usually see about 50 of those days.  And  when you have a year like that, the next year, you're bound to have more  volatility.  So, I think people should buckle in and get ready for more of  that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What all this referencing is, again, it was this sense of calm  leads to overconfidence.  Among individual investors and professional  investors that people kind of become delusional about their ability and you  had all these bets on stable markets, this inverse volatility.</p><p>These were exchange-traded retail products, two of which including the XIV  closed down to investors after they lost most of their money of late  Monday.  So, again, these losses, the tide goes out and you see who was  swimming naked.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, I won't comment on the swimming naked but what I will say is  we realize financial engineering doesn't always work and program trading  sometimes the pendulum goes too far each lane, you have these types of  swings.  </p><p>My concerns are two-fold, one, I think the administration is talking way  too much about the stock market.  I think President Trump, I think he  should take a lot of credit for the rally but to talk about it literally  every day, it's not the gauge on the economy we should be using as 50  percent of the nation doesn't even own stocks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well I've been saying that literally since he took office.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well that's where I took it from.  And I think secondly, I think  that I know as the oldest one on this desk, I have not been in a market  that we've seen this type of back up and rates starting, inflation feeling  protectionist environment, problems with the fiscal deficit on one side,  and then the other side, decent growth, you have the tax cuts that are  going to be almost like its own quantitative easing and then lastly, good  corporate profits.  There's a real tug of war that's going to go in 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well who's going to win because I will push back because I've  been concerned about interest rate moving up since really the end of last  year but with inflation now come -- with wages now growing at close to  three percent which happened in the most recent month.</p><p>That's -- still, wages are still -- growth is still very muted, inflation  is still muted.  And all the signs in the market, for the most part, do say  that the economy is OK if not, great.  </p><p>WOLF:  So I would say -- first of all, I would say the bulls will win  short-term because the tax reform is going to be the sugar candy for  corporate growth.  And I think you're going to see that short-term soft  buybacks, dividend, some M&amp;A activity.</p><p>But I think long-term, people are going to project out a backup of rates  and when we start getting three and a half, four percent, you're going to  see a shift take place from equity to fixed income, you're just going to  see it because risk free returns are going to start to look good versus a  market that's been pretty buoyant.  I mean, that's just one thing I do have  as experience 30 years.  I can't say how much in the market today.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It sounds like you're calling longer term for a bear market in  stocks and bonds because, again, if -- because we've had a bull market in  bonds since the early 1980s.  Did you --</p><p>WOLF:  I wouldn't say a bear market but I think the bears will beat the  bulls probably come towards late 2018, early 2019 as we see in just to my  opinion this nervousness.  We're going to do better, growth is here, wages  will do better, the labor force is starting to tighten.  Those are just  facts.  And we have a whole new Fed environment with Powell coming in.</p><p>BELL:  I think it's going to depend largely on inflation and interest rates  as well and inflation is going to be driven by that wage number.  If we get  productivity which it seems like we should get better productivity, the  inflation won't come in high-speed manner that is sort of expected kind of  market right now.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Any concerns about the impact to the economy because of tax  reform if the Fed ends up tightening at monetary policy because of  inflation as some are talking about right now and also -- MCDOWELL:  Well they are tightening monetary policies.  They're reducing  their balance sheets, it's already down to $4 trillion and they're already  raising interesting rates.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Right.  But the question is, if interest rates if we get four  instead of three, if things change as they are trying to cool down the  economy getting too heated up, do you have any concerns over the tax cuts  and how that might have an impact on the deficit and debt?</p><p>WOLF:  Well I do.  I mean, I've been speaking about it, yes, I'm a pro- growth Democrat but I have been -- I am fiscally pretty hawkish in a sense  that I think if everything should have been revenue neutral, I believe in  the PAYGO system.  And so my view is although I was supportive of tax  reform, I probably would have looked to have done -- I would have done it - -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you were up -- so you were concerned that that --</p><p>WOLF:  I was concerned on the fiscal side sometimes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- so you were also concerned when the national debt  doubled under President Obama.</p><p>WOLF:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you fell in that as his economic advisor?</p><p>WOLF:  We're talking about -- we're looking -- the answer -- you know, I've  been with you for a decade, so the answer is yes.  I mean, listen, I --  when I was his economics advisor, very clear we want the tax reform to go  to 28 percent, for corporate it's 25 percent for manufacturing.  We will  also -- we had a Republican Senate in the House, it had to be revenue  neutral.</p><p>That was the only dialogue we ever had was revenue neutral.  That being  said, corporate tax reform is a good thing, I am not going to push back on  that.  I just think that we have not been in an environment with raising  rates, high debt, fiscal deficit and think that's good for the stock  market.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I agree with you that we've never been an environment where  the Federal Reserve.  We had easy, such easy money for so long that we're  entering this unprecedented era of where the Fed has to unwind this balance  sheet where the easy money starts disappearing and you're just beginning to  see the risky, even idiotic debts that people took because everything was  going up in lockstep. </p><p>I want to get to this though Lindsey, just to mention that the Atlanta  Federal Reserve did lower its first-quarter GDP forecast to four percent  from 5.4 percent, that was what it released last week.  The change in the  space of a week, what do you make of it?  BELL:  I mean, it was related to consumption and fixed investment.  So I  think consumption is still good at 3 percent, we saw 3.8 percent in the  fourth quarter, the consumer is very, very strong.  And 4 percent, let's be  honest, when was the last time we saw 4 percent GDP growth?  That's an  outstanding number.  And the Atlanta Fed has been pretty decent about their  -- with the accuracy for the initial estimate of GDP.</p><p>WOLF:  We should ring the bell if we have four percent GDP.</p><p>BELL:  Thank you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we're getting that four percent in part because of the tax  reform.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  See?  We all agree.</p><p>WOLF:  You got them two for two.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We all agree. </p><p>BELL:  You don't have to worry about that deficit if we get (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, I worry -- I've said this repeatedly but like you saw all  the speculation going on in like Bitcoin in these assets, speculating with  these exchange rate of products on stable low volatility markets and you  get a snapback and you see what kind of risk people are taking.  I don't  think that this -- I mean, this clearly is not over with the loss on the  Futures this morning.</p><p>Coming up, losing Wynn, real estate and casino mogul Steve Wynn stepping  down from his own company after being accused of sexual misconduct  allegations.  What this means for the future of Wynn's global empire,  that's ahead.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Roaring toward a new chapter in the American space race, Elon  Musk, Falcon Heavy makes history but he doesn't lose his sense of humor  while doing it.  We'll explain.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  Investors are strapping in for another busy day  in the market.  Take a look at the Dow Futures right now, 236-point gain on  the Dow Futures.  Volatility came back with a vengeance and the question  remains: How long will it last?  What kind of wild swings are we going to  see in the market and what kind of losses it shakes out?  And do some  people lose confidence in their trading ability?  Meantime, Steve Wynn now  resigning as Chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts.  Cheryl Casone has more  details -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right.  Dagen, good morning.  Wynn Resorts says that Steve  Wynn's resignation is effective immediately, this comes after sexual  misconduct allegations against the Las Vegas billionaire.  A number of  women claimed that Wynn harassed or assaulted them.  One case led to $7.5  million settlement.  Wynn denies these allegations but looking at what's  happening in the premarket here, the stock is actually down almost 1-1/2  percent in the premarket.  Again, Steve Wynn, his resignation effective  immediately.  So, we're also watching shares of Snap this morning.  Get  this, the stock soaring in the premarket up 23 percent, almost 24 percent.   Well, there you go.  Now, it's 24 percent.  They reported better-than- expected quarterly results after the bell.  The stock's back above that  $17.00 IPO price for now.  Revenues soaring more than 70 percent from a  year ago.  That a sharp increase in daily active users.  </p><p>Also this morning, we're going to get earnings from Hasbro and Michael  Kors, 21st Century Fox, the parent company of the FBN reports after the  bell later today.  And we are going to hear from Tesla, Elon Musk's company  later today as well.  And a little flicking for higher revenue from rising  sales of their Model S, their Model X, and their Model 3 vehicles.  Tesla  shares, however, are having, of course of that earnings report, moving  lower in the premarket a little more than a quarter percent.  But let's  stay with Tesla and Elon Musk, he made some news by launching the world's  biggest rocket.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CROWD OF PEOPLE:  Three, two, one.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launched yesterday to the delight of  employees, space fans, of course.  The 230-foot rocket featured 27 engines,  three boosters.  It cost SpaceX about a billion dollars to build.  Now, two  reusable side boosters did come back to Earth, they landed at the same  time.  That was flawless.  Remember that saves your money in space travel.   Now, this is neat though, Dagen, a Tesla Roadster was hidden onboard.  It  served as a test payload and they put basically a space guy in the driver's  seat.  The pictures have been amazing.  That roadster has now exceeded  Mars' orbit, but loving the pictures from there.  And for any dame that may  take a closer look at the Roadster, they're going to find this on the  circuit board, quote, \"Made on Earth by humans.\"  So, we'll see if little  space travel guy makes some alien friends while he's out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love it.  </p><p>CASONE:  It was fun, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I was a NASA nerd when I was growing up.  So, I love seeing  these pictures in school, and Lea was a pilot.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  This is one of those things that could have been like, massive  success or a massive scale and what a massive success it was.  I mean,  looking at the two boosters land that way was just spectacular.  And then - - I mean, really, that car is space trash, let's admit it.  But if it's the  first thing that we see just heading out into space like this, it's pretty  neat to see this car cruising around.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And also, just the fact that you have private industries  stepping up where the government has pulled away.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, that's just that.  It's just that it's the way  innovations do this.</p><p>WOLF:  You're the expert in this space.  I can just tell you, our pilots at  our drone company in Washington were so pumped.  It was like literally, you  know, we shut down for the, you know, the hour it was on.  I think they  were waiting for two hours as well.  But it was -- they were just so fired  up.</p><p>BELL:  I think watching the landing was so awesome, too.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes, it's one of those things where you just hold your breath.   And you're hoping that it's going to all workout.  But, you know, Dagen,  you make such a good point about how innovation has changed and how defense  used to lead innovation and now it's really industry that's leading  innovation.  And it's really, you know, it shows where our country can go  and where we can develop things in the future.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Inspiring kids everywhere, including Disney battling on a galaxy  far, far away to rocket to the Future, the earnings straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Disney CEO Bob Iger revealing the company's new ESPN streaming  service will launch later this spring as Disney reports its first-quarter  earnings.  Lauren Simonetti has all the details.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  What a report, Dagen.  So, OK, stronger-than-expected profits,  but taking a look here, you can see revenue $15.35 billion in the last  quarter that actually missed expectations.  And they did take a one-time  benefit related to the new tax law.  So, 1.6 billion there.  Nonetheless,  take a look at the share price reaction right now.  Shares are up to 2.2  percent at 108.50 in the premarket.  If you look at many of Disney's units  and we get revenue for these segments, you can see that their studio and  media units fell short of expectations, but they did see big strength in  the theme parks.  Goes to show you that customers are still willing to pay  sky-high prices for tickets.  By the way, we're going to find out of a  price increase for theme park tickets in the coming week.  You know, and  the higher hotel prices consumers are willing to spend this for  entertainment.  </p><p>Speaking of, struggling ESPN but we do have news for ESPN.  ESPN+, their  new streaming service, it's going to debut in the spring.  It's going to  cost $4.99 a month.  You can buy it as an add-on service and can be used  for the redesigned ESPN App.  It's basically going to give you live  programming that's not available on the current channels.  And then --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIT HARINGTON, ACTOR:  Reach out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, that's \"Game of Thrones\" from HBO.  And yes, the  masterminds behind that hit series are teaming up with Disney and  Lucasfilms to produce -- are you ready -- a new \"Star Wars\" series.  We  don't know how many movies or the release dates, but these are going to be  separate from the \"Star Wars\" the franchise that you've seen.  After two  iconic blockbusters getting together, this is -- this is good, this is good  stuff.  Disney also said that they have pre-ticket sales for one of their  new Marvel movies, Black Panthers, biggest they've ever seen for a  superhero franchise.  So, they're going all in on the -- on the movies and  the franchises.</p><p>BELL:  I think, this just goes to the quality of corporate earnings that  are coming out yesterday DowDuPont had a really solid report and now we're  seeing both of these stocks go up and on the day-to-day, the market is  down.  That's awesome.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what you want to say -- you want to say, individual  names trade on the underlying fundamentals whether it's strength in the  earnings, strength in the economy rather than like a washout.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  A lot of people are saying, Steven Mnuchin, said yesterday the  fundamentals of the market are strong and that's what we are seeing in this  report from Disney.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  The members of the administration forced to talk about the  stock market because the President has been (INAUDIBLE) as essentially  bragging repeatedly about the stock market going up.  So, now you have  Mnuchin, even Vice President Pence for us to talk about it.  So, I haven't  mentioned your Patriots loss, but let me take a moment to mention that.   But are you excited about \"Game of Thrones\" mixed with \"Star Wars\"?  </p><p>WOLF:  I'm glad you shifted to \"Game of Thrones\".  I can't wait.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I didn't want to rub it in.</p><p>WOLF: I couldn't wait for \"Game of Thrones\".  I am so bummed it's the last  season.  But I can't wait for it to come on.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Can you explain to me, I know you're huge in to \"Star Wars\" OK,  you're into \"Game of Thrones\", what's the matchup of these going to look  like?</p><p>WOLF:  I don't know, maybe it's John Snow fighting Darth Vader.  I mean,  you know, who knows what's going to happen and since he comes back and who  knows, we could be --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dragons in space.</p><p>WOLF:  We could have so many different things going on.  Maybe HBO mergers  with Disney and then it's the \"Game of (INAUDIBLE).\"  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, should Netflix be worried?  Because, you know, now this new  streaming service is coming out at some point that's going to be cheaper  than Netflix, and Disney has its amazing content and they pulled so much of  it from Netflix.  </p><p>WOLF:  You know, everyone has enough money, they're now -- they're all  fighting for content.  Hulu, Amazon, and I mean, it's going to be a very  interesting years to come on where we're watching.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think this ESPN+ is going to be really popular because of how  people can sort of pick and choose from the menu of what they want to see  and when they are picking sports.  They really want to be able to pick  their teams and watch their game.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I streamed the Super Bowl and --</p><p>WOLF:  You're really killing me right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was crystal clear watching those Patriots lose, crystal.</p><p>WOLF:  You know, I'll take -- you know what, I'm going to take my five  Super Bowls and I'm OK with that.  So, I'm --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GABRIELLE:  See, I've heard a lot of Patriots fans say that.  It's like,  you know what --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>WOLF:  No.  Listen, no question you want your team to win.  But do you want  your team in in this -- listen, I actually like the Eagles, too, I want to  Pen, but I'm a staunch Patriots guy and they just didn't -- they came up  short.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, they did.  Thank you, Lauren, Sir.  Disney not coming up  short.  Coming up, tougher sanctions yet.  That tough warning from Vice  President Mike Pence to North Korea if the country doesn't end its nuclear  ambitions.  And why Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg says  that the Vice President's personal role about social gatherings with women  and alcohol is a huge setback for all women in the workforce.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, February 7th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Another  wild day on Wall Street, the Dow swinging more than 1,000 points from the  lows to the highs in trading yesterday, the major market gauges finishing  the session in the green.  The Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ are all back in  positive territory for the year, but volatility still reigns supreme.   Despite that, the White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said  the administration is not worried.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The economy is  incredibly strong right now.  The President's focus continues to be on the  long-term economic fundamentals were infinitely better off today than where  we were before the President took office, particularly on the economy.  We  have historically low unemployment and we actually have increasing wages  for American workers.  There's nothing that's taken place over the last  couple of days in our economy that's fundamentally different than it was  two weeks ago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But volatility still front and center this morning, stability,  hard to find, 210-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, losses across  the board there.  In Europe, we do have some gains to report in England,  France, and Germany, although slight, the biggest winner at the moment, in  percentage term, is the FTSE-100 in England.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets mostly lower, the Nikkei managing to eke out a  small gain, but the KOSPI in South Korea, losing more than two percent.   And a strong warning for North Korea, Vice President Mike Pence says that  the U.S. will impose the toughest ever sanctions on the country.  Those  details as he holds a bilateral meeting with Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo  Abe.  </p><p>Sheryl Sandberg calling for fairness when it comes to the personal role, in  which the vice president won't eat alone with a woman, other than his wife,  and won't attend events that have alcohol without her either.  Sandberg  says women's careers are ultimately hurt by this, her fix, coming up.</p><p>Plus, America's source of innovation, under fire over diversity of  opinions, we have new study showing how conservatives feel out-of-place in  Silicon Valley.  I think the headline there is that there are any  conservatives in Silicon Valley.  But now, to the latest on Wall Street,  Futures reporting to decline at the open, losses across the board, this  after swinging wildly between gains and losses yesterday.  Volatility also  hitting the bond market, yields today, take a look at where yields are,  2.77 on the 10-year.</p><p>We had the yield on the ten-year hit a four-year high of -- it was 2.85  percent -- north of 2.85 percent that was on Friday, but money has been  going back into bonds in the face of the stock volatility.  Joining me now,  Wells Fargo Investment Institution President, Darrell Cronk, Darrell, what  is your take on the climate of fixed income and stock markets and how they  match up with --</p><p>DARRELL CRONK, PRESIDENT, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTION:  That's a  good question, Dagen.  This recent correction, actually, had both  correlated where yields were rising as stocks were falling, which is  somewhat atypical.  We broke that a little bit.  I think the bond market --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Last couple of days.</p><p>CRONK:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You had money go -- you know, volatility push money into bonds - -</p><p>CRONK:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  which is, kind of, what you'd want to see.</p><p>CRONK:  Monday afternoon, late in the session.  I actually think the bond  market has handled this correction very well.  You haven't seen a spill  over into what we'd see as traditional safe haven so, commodities, the U.S.  dollar, yields, there's no gap out in high yields spreads.  So the lower  tear sections of the credit market have behaved very well, actually.  So  this is a lot like the equity markets catching a bad bout of this flu  that's going around.  But the flu hasn't been contagious to the other asset  classes yet.</p><p>BELL:  So how do you see tax reform playing into interest rates and  inflation?  I mean, the way that this tax reform is structured, it seems to  be supply-side, so in that way, companies are investing in CAPEX which will  help increase productivity so you won't -- shouldn't see that much  inflation that do you agree with that assessment?  How do you see that  playing out?</p><p>CRONK:  I absolutely agree with that, Lindsey.  I think inflation will  trend mildly higher and some wage inflation is a good thing.  Wage  inflation with productivity growth to your point is actually a good thing.   Wage inflation without productivity growth, where it just increases unit  labor costs and squeezes profit margins for companies, is a bad thing.  We  don't expect a lot of inflation to take higher, but mild inflation higher  is actually a very healthy thing.</p><p>WOLF:  So, Darrell, at what point do you think rates have to back up too to  see a shift from equities back to fixed income?</p><p>CRONK:  I think --</p><p>WOLF:  Three and a half, four?</p><p>CRONK:  Yes, I think three percent is a psychological level right now for  the markets, as it tries the equity markets, as they try and find their  base.  North of three and a quarter to three and a half, I think starts to  squeeze profit margins at that point.</p><p>WOLF:  But where do you see for your clients?  Where do you see money  actually shifting out of -- out of stocks into bonds, at that type of  level?</p><p>CRONK:  Yes, I think it -- at three and a quarter to three and a half, you  start to get the equity risk premium, to be more equal.  Today, it still  favors equities over fixed income right now.</p><p>WOLF:  So where's Wells projecting, kind of, 10-year rates, year-end 2018?</p><p>CRONK:  275.  We've got a range of 250 to 300, 275 with the midway.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How is that possible with the economy growing as strongly as it  is, at least in -- because of tax reform and certainly in the first  quarter, but really the rest of the year that's what's expected.</p><p>CRONK:  Yes, I do think you will see stronger growth, we think 2.9, 3  percent GDP growth.  But when you look at the amount of supply issuance  that has to come on the market for treasuries, this has been the false  narrative (INAUDIBLE) forever which is, kind of, that higher growth has to  equal higher rates almost immediately.  And it may equal them in the  intermediate term, but in 2018, we don't see a big spike up in rates.</p><p>BELL:  So you will say invested in equities then --</p><p>CRONK:  Yes.</p><p>BEL:  for the remainder of the year and what sectors do you like?</p><p>CRONK:  Right now, we actually like financials, we like industrials, we  like consumer discretionary, and we actually like healthcare, so three of  those four, being more procyclical for better growth, better economic  environment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And financials, just to name one, a benefit of deregulation  coming out of Washington.</p><p>CRONK:  Absolutely.  That's right, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to talk about what we've seen with the, kind of, bets  that were placed on stable markets, the bet against volatility over the  last couple of years?  And the losses that were abruptly and surprisingly  exposed just in the last couple of days.  </p><p>These two -- one, in particular, this XIV, it is a well-known product sold  by Credit Suisse, constructed by Credit Suisse that shut down yesterday  after it lost almost all of its money in trading.  It was really late  Monday, but again, when you have such loose monetary policy --</p><p>CRONK:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  money flooding the market anywhere and everywhere, you're just  beginning to see the overconfidence and the really -- the kinds of bets  that not just individuals took but institution investors.  And do you  expect -- because again, and I keep repeating this line, you find out who's  naked only when the tide goes out.</p><p>CRONK:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And do you worry that that kind of volatility in this kind of  law -- these losses could impact the stock markets and hold back the bull  market as it comes up on its ninth year anniversary?</p><p>CRONK:  Two points there, from the institutional side, you're exactly  right.  So, that's part of what we saw on Monday's action.  So you have  this -- it's a little complex but you have this risk parody and macro CTA  funds that when volatility is really low, their model suggests that they  overweight risk assets.  </p><p>And as soon as volatility spikes, those algorithms or that mass, and just  they have to sell those risk assets, which is why you saw flood in the  treasuries, Monday afternoon, and rates come back down.  To your second  point, the individual, when you see this kind of volatility, it can damage  psyche, right?  </p><p>So, the individual's -- you know, this year has been a narrative of two  months, right?  January was all about pro-tax reform's better growth.  We  walked in with the best earnings expectations for the whole year.  </p><p>Now, February has been all about -- well, wait a minute, what if the fed  goes too far, what if inflation becomes problematic, right?  And those two  narratives have to balance each other out over time.  And if the market,  even today, is still trying to figure out which one is going to play.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you buy stocks here, is what you're saying?</p><p>CRONK:  We buy more of the January (INAUDIBLE) this point, than the  February.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What would change your mind?  Is there any kind of marker that  you're looking for?</p><p>CRONK:  Inflation.  Inflation is the primary marker.  So if you would see a  spike materially higher in inflation data, not just wage inflation but core  inflation as a whole.  And remember, the PCE that the fed uses, is still at  1-1/2 to 1.6 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I said -- I said this yesterday.  Maybe all of that cheap  money from Central Banks, once it winds up in the hands of individuals who  don't just buy risky assets with it, they actually start going out and  spending it.  That's when you need to start worrying.  </p><p>CRONK:  Absolutely.  Yes, that's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When mom and dad and brother and sister out there in the country  --</p><p>CRONK:  But you don't see that in the consumption patterns quite yet,  right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>CRONK:  I mean, yet.</p><p>WOLF:  Quick question.</p><p>CRONK:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  the volatility continues throughout '18?</p><p>CRONK:  Yes.  Well, certainly on a relative basis, from '17, right?</p><p>WOLF:  I've been told we're wrapping twice, though.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  You said yes, but --</p><p>CRONK:  Yes, absolutely.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you can't bet on stable markets at least in some of these  exchange trader products anymore.</p><p>CRONK:  And volatility is a healthy thing.  So, I think, we should welcome  on more normalized level of volatility, not the extreme low volatility we  had in 2016 and '17.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It has shaken some people out of this market, though.  Darrell,  thank you so much.</p><p>CRONK:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Sheryl Sandberg's knock against the Vice President,  why the Facebook Chief Operating Officer says Mike Pence's personal role  about social gatherings with alcohol and women, harms all women.  And  Silicon Valley's secret uncovered, a new survey details the climate for  conservatives in the tech business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  Taking a quick look at Dow Futures  right now.  Meantime, Vice President Mike Pence -- you can take a look at  losses across the board, but you know what, well off their lows of the  morning so far, only 135-point loss on the Dow Futures.  I think it's safe  to say we should prepare ourselves for wild swings like we saw yesterday  where, again, the Dow ended the day up 567 points, but it was down more  than a thousand early on.  Still, we talked about Vice President Mike Pence  in Tokyo delivering a stern warning to North Korea.  Cheryl Casone has the  details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Dagen.  Vice President Pence continuing to put  pressure on North Korea.  On his way to the Winter Olympics in South Korea,  Pence stopped in Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.   Pence reiterated Washington's stance that all option are on the table to  deal with North Korea.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I'm announcing today that  the United States of America will soon unveil the toughest and most  aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea ever.  And we will  continue to isolate North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic  missile program once and for all.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Pence is set to leave the U.S. allegation to the opening  ceremonies on Friday.  Despite the tough rhetoric, he has stopped short of  ruling out a meeting with Senior North Korean officials while he is there.   Meanwhile, Kim Jong-un is sending his younger sister to South Korea for the  Winter Olympics.  This is the first time any member of the Kim family has  crossed the border.  30-year-old, Kim Yo-jong plans to attend the opening  ceremony on Friday.  She was blacklisted last year by the U.S. Treasury  Department over human rights abuses and censorship.  Well, Vice President  Pence won't be having dinner alone with Kim Yo-jong at the Olympics.  </p><p>He's got a personal rule that's kind of common among Evangelical.  It  doesn't allow him to be alone with women, and he has also said in the past  he won't attend an event if there is alcohol there without his wife by his  side.  Well, Sheryl Sandberg has picked up on this.  She thinks this role  hurts women's growth in the workplace because of missed opportunities to  network with men.  Sandberg is the COO of Facebook, and, of course, the co- founder of Leanin Organization.  Says that if men follow the so-called Mike  Pence rule, it should apply to everyone not just to women.  </p><p>With the flood of each revelations, a recent survey show that half of male  manager say they are uncomfortable participating in basic activities with  women, Dagen.  So, she's saying this is going to hurt it -- because you've  already got, frankly, women already isolated.  That is her point, in  corporate America.  Most male senior managers, CEO, are men.  So, if you're  going to get take away that opportunity, that one-on-one networking, then  if you can't go to lunch with the CEO as a woman, then nobody should go to  lunch with the CEO, men included -- make it a rule for everybody.  </p><p>BELL:  I mean, I think one of the unfortunate responses to the #metoo  movement has been that men do feel like they can't go to lunch with females  that they work with, and be a man to them, or things like that.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's what the survey sounds.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, this is something that I saw in the post Tail Hook  Navy -- because I joined the Navy in 1993.  When I first entered -- and  that was right after a woman who had been chained to a year (INAUDIBLE)  Academy; tail hook it happened.  And there was sort of this, this fear from  men to get close to women, to spend time with women, to socialize with  women, and I do think that it is damaging to women when they want to move  up, and when they need mentors in any workplace whether it's corporate  America or military.  I think that that applies.  And I think this type of,  you know, putting this idea out, you know, certainly is understandable from  a Christian marriage perspective on wanting to sort of protect your  relationship.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  But it is hurtful to people in the workplace.  And I see her  point, I see Sheryl Sandberg's point.</p><p>CASONE:  If that's Mike Pence's choice, that's one thing.  But to adopt  that rule, I think, across American culture, particularly in business, I  think is wrong.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes, I think I would like it as a wife, but as woman in the  workplace, I don't like it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you want to weigh in, because you ran -- I mean, you ran a  business. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I am completely supportive with Sheryl Sandberg's  perspective here.  You cannot, you know, have an environment where you say  you're comfortable with one sex and not the other in the workforce.  It  makes no sense at all.  And he should keep those type of use to himself.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's too late.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a really interesting conversation, though.  Coming up,  creative, fun, closed minds?  The fired Google engineer who is suing the  company for allegedly discriminating against White male conservatives --  White conservative men, maybe onto something.  A revealing new look at how  some conservative employees in big tech, really feels, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A new survey claims conservatives are feeling out of place in  Silicon Valley.  This comes after a former Google engineer sued the tech  giant for discrimination.  Joining me now is Garrett Johnson, Lincoln  Network Co-Founder, and Executive Director.  Garrett, your company put  together this survey.  Tell us about it, what did you find?</p><p>GARRETT JOHNSON, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LINCOLN NETWORK:  Good  morning.  So, we put this survey together in response to all of the inbound  questions we get from journalist.  When a James Damore issue becomes a  national conversation, we get inbound, myself and Aaron Ginn, my co- founder, are things as bad as everyone says they are; what's the ground  level of truth.  Unfortunately, there was no data.  You have lots of  companies who report data on diverse issues as they relate to gender,  ethnicity, sexual orientation, but not viewpoint diversity.  So, this is  the first data that we know of on this issue.  And there's assumptions that  things are bad for people who are on the right of center spectrum  conservatives, libertarians.  But this data suggests that it is indeed the  case, and is probably worse than anyone thought.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bad, how?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I was going to ask a question as well, when you  say bias against, what actually are you meaning?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes, so, in addition to the raw data that we collected from a  little under 400 people, we also collected comments -- people open in the  comments.  We have 23 longer form conversations.  People -- one person said  that he was targeted by his manager because he was a delegate to the  Republican convention.  The manager tried to get him fired.  He recorded  some conversations, you know, behind the manager's back, and was able to  take that to be peace within the country, and save his job.  But the  manager was not fired; there was no repercussions.  You have some people,  you know, who say that, you know, they avoid at going to work the day after  the election because they knew the anti-Trump sentiment would be so strong  and obnoxious that they just didn't want to tolerate it.  So, just  generally, either targeting, feeling comfortable at work, there is this  notion within Silicon Valley -- SalesForce, Google -- that you should bring  your whole self to work.  Well, that's not really the case if you think a  certain way.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Do you think that's really unique to Silicon Valley, though?   When you talk about, like, the post-election sentiment and how they felt?   It seems like that might something that's broader than just looking at  Silicon Valley.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  I think that's right.  I think that Silicon Valley is consistent  with trends throughout the country, but you have to think about the echo  chambers that these tech companies have created with their technology.  You  know, they have enhanced the tribalization of our country with the  platforms that they've created.  And, you know, technology is most consumed  in tech hubs like Silicon Valley.  So, you know, you had your echo chamber,  you live in this bubble, and so it's more intense.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just wonder as they -- as the employee base at Silicon Valley  ages, is this going to change, which is something that Robert brought up?   Because people tend to get more conservative as they get older.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  I think it might.  You know, that's not data that we collected.   This was a pilot survey.  So, it only focused on Silicon Valley.  We're  going to be doing one later this year that will touch other tech hubs and  hopefully capture that data.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Garrett, good to see you.  Thank you so much, Garrett Johnson.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Still ahead, the very latest as investors hang on for another  wild ride in these markets in the next hour with MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, February 7th.</p><p>Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Volatility slamming Wall Street -- investors in for a wild ride yesterday.   The Dow did finish up 567 points but it was down -- there was about a  1,200-point range during the same trading day.</p><p>As of yesterday's close, all three major market gauges are back in positive  territory for the year but not the Dow Transports and not small cap stocks,  we should point out.</p><p>Let's take a look at the futures.  We're showing losses across the board  but they are mild compared to what we saw just one hour ago.  The Dow  futures were down more than 200 points.</p><p>Again, what does this volatility do to shake out the speculators who had  piled into the market and played some wonky bets in the last couple of  years?</p><p>The Atlanta Federal Reserve meantime has lowered its first quarter GDP  forecast.  We're talking about that 5.4 percent last week.  Now Atlanta Fed  thinks the economy is just going to grow at 4 percent -- still high.</p><p>In Europe stocks are moving higher but they're warm, shall we say.  We have  gains across the board.  FTSE 100 up almost 1 percent.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks mostly lower.  The Kospi the worst performer down  there in South Korea -- or over there in South Korea down more than 2  percent.</p><p>Budget battle looming -- lawmakers have until tomorrow night to reach an  agreement to keep the federal government running.  So the House passes a  stopgap spending bill, the fight turns to the Senate where immigration  remains a top issue.</p><p>Speaker of the House Paul Ryan weighed in on the possibility of a shutdown.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  The only reason we do not  have a full budget agreement is because Democrats continue to hold funding  for our government hostage on an unrelated issue.  They must stop using our  troops as pawns in a game of politics.</p><p>I urge the Senate Democrats to stop their filibuster and provide our men  and women in uniform the resources that they need, the support that they  need.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The immigration debate is in full swing amid tragedy in Indiana.   The latest as the illegal immigrant suspected of killing Indianapolis Colts  linebacker Edwin Jackson is charged.</p><p>Plus, a bushel of headlines for Apple as the company says it could offer  rebate for customers who paid full price for battery replacement.  The tech  giant may team with Goldman Sachs to help shoppers finance their phone.   More details on that ahead.</p><p>And is the crypto crash fully upon us?  Why one firm is warning that the  days are numbered for several digital currencies.</p><p>And here with me to break it all down this morning:  Fox News correspondent  Lea Gabrielle; Fox News contributor, 32 Advisers founder and CEO and former  economic adviser to President Obama, he also ran a giant Wall Street bank,  Robert Wolf; and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.</p><p>You'd still be long stocks here though, wouldn't you?  You worry about  interest rates, inflation, deficits, debt -- but not yet.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I missed the whole run.  But if I was  going to make a bet, I would bet stocks do better for the, you know, first  half of '18.  But then I would be nervous to the back half.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but you didn't think even that Congress was going to get  tax reform done.  You talked about that all year long last year.  You  didn't think they would be able to come together to get it done.  </p><p>WOLF:  I've been wrong once in the last 30 years.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You were wrong about the Patriots, too at the Super Bowl.  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Ouch.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just kidding.  But again, short run -- you worry longer run.  </p><p>WOLF:  I worry longer run because I think back-up rates will shift assets.   And then we're going to have a back-up of rates because we're going to have  growth.  We're going to have some wage inflation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So we will talk about that as the morning rolls on.  We have  incredible guests coming up.  White House director of legislative affairs  Marc Short is here, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy, former chief of staff  under President Bush 43 and Business Roundtable president and CEO Josh  Bolton, and Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano, and  the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO\" Stuart Varney.</p><p>You don't want to miss it.</p><p>But first taking a look at futures this morning, we have losses across the  board but really off the lows of the morning -- the Dow futures down just  46 points.  Stocks rebounding yesterday after the biggest sell-off in more  than six years during a volatile session on Monday.  The Dow finishing the  day up 200, 2.3 percent higher; that was a gain of 567 points.</p><p>Joining us now to weigh in, New York Congresswoman Claudia Tenney and New  York Congressman Tom Suozzi.  Good to see you both.  Congresswoman Tenney - - </p><p>REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK:  Yes.  Suozzi.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Suozzi -- I said it right, didn't I Congressman?  </p><p>REP. TOM SUOZZI (D), NEW YORK:  It was close.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Congresswoman Tenney -- your reaction on these markets  because I would argue that the President of your party has put you in a  tough bind where now you're going to get asked about the stock market.  </p><p>TENNEY:  I don't think so.  I mean to be honest with you, the stock market  is not the only determination of what's going on in the marketplace.  I, in  fact, sold a bunch of things last week because I had some things to pay  off.  So after Christmas and all those good things I sold some stuff.</p><p>So I think what you had yesterday was a bargain hunter's market.  And  people around -- all of a sudden the stocks rebounded.  I think when you  look at the interest rates, a little bit of adjustment in the interest  rates with a new fed chairman.  I think that makes a difference.  The  growth from the tax cuts and jobs act they're certainly important.</p><p>And I might cite an industry, the tax foundation has stated that New York  is going to be one of the biggest growth states because of the tax cuts and  jobs act.  So I think it's really interesting to see how this plays out  over the next few months.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman Suozzi -- do you agree with your fellow congressman  from the state of New York, but also have you been hearing from any of your  constituents, given just what happened in the market the last few days or  really in the last week or so?  </p><p>SUOZZI:  You know, people are worried about the effect of the tax plan,  because in my part of the state we're going to be hit very hard by the  elimination of the state and local tax deduction and the tax plan actually  increased the deficit significantly by about $1.5 trillion.</p><p>In addition, there's talk of a new infrastructure plan which will increase  the debt even further.  There's this plan of the CR that's going to be will  be coming up that will increase the debt even further.</p><p>All these things together increase the debt that may have an impact on  actually stimulating the economy in a way but it will cause interest rates  to go up.  When interest rates go up, our debt service goes up because of  our huge deficits in the federal government.  That could be what's scaring  the marketplace.</p><p>So right now, deficits are a big concern to the marketplace.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Congressman Suozzi, were you worried about the debt  doubling under President Obama?  Was that a concern for you?  Were you  worried about it then?  That was over eight years.  </p><p>SUOZZI:  Actually I was in the private sector at the time.  I wasn't paying  quite as close attention at the time but the reality was is that the debt  that doubled during that time was because of the stimulus package, to try  and actually to force the economy to grow.</p><p>The economy has been growing since President Obama's administration and now  it's the Trump administration.  It's been growing, growing, growing,  growing.  And the concern is that by adding debt at this time, we're going  to hyper-inflate the market and get it moving too frothy and that scares  people that our deficits are going to grow and that's why we're seeing this  volatility in the marketplace right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That also falls on members of Congress not in te3rms of cutting  spending.  And I want to point out that the House did pass another stopgap  spending bill yesterday.  It funds the government through March 23rd and  now goes to the senate.</p><p>Leaders there are really -- there's some issue with the defense part of the  stopgap that was passed by the House, what happens with that vote.  But the  Senate is working on a longer two-year budget deal.</p><p>President Trump is throwing an immigration grenade into the budget talks,  saying he's prepared to shut down the government if Congress doesn't pass  border security measures.  </p><p>Listen to this and I'll get your reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If we don't change the legislation, if we don't get rid of these  loopholes where killers are allowed to come in to our country and continue  to kill, gang members -- and we're just talking about MS-13. There are many  gang members that we don't even mention.</p><p>If we don't change it, let's have a shutdown.  We'll do a shutdown.  We  have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want safety -- and  unrelated but still related, they don't want to take care of our military.   Then shut it down.  We'll go with another shutdown.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman Tenney, is that helpful?  </p><p>TENNEY:  Let me first say something about Mr. Suozzi's comments.  First of  all, Democrats have no other issues to run and all of a sudden their new- found deficit hawks.  They care a lot about the deficit and the debt which  they never cared about before.  </p><p>And they cared about huge, you know, trillion-dollars in stimulus before  that didn't spur the economy to the levels of growth that we're expecting  to see just in one year of rolling back regulations, cutting taxes.  And  now we're predicting even bigger growth in spite of what the stock market's  fluctuation.</p><p>So I just say that I would not give credit to President Obama for this.  I  think this is clearly the enthusiasm from businesses knowing they're not  going to get sucker-punched by government and officials on the federal and  hopefully not the state side.  So Tom and I know what it's like to live and  work in New York State.</p><p>But on the President's side, I mean the President's a negotiator.  He wants  us to act on this.  He had a very, very generous offer during the State of  the Union on immigration which really shouldn't be impacting what we're  doing with the continuing resolution.</p><p>And I'm concerned about our military.  My son's an active duty Marine.  We  are giving less predictable funding to our military which puts them at risk  and also puts our country's security at risk.  So I'm concerned about that.</p><p>But as far as the immigration package, really what the President has  offered are very similar to things that Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi --  maybe not Nancy Pelosi -- maybe Senator Feinstein have voted on many times  in the past and they've supported, not just voted on but supported as well.</p><p>And so I think that those are things we've got to look to.  I think -- you  know, we have time with DACA.  I think let's sit down in a bipartisan way  and come up with a solution.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what's going on with the top senators pursuing the  two-year budget deal, separating for now stalled immigration fight and  actually increasing spending, Congressman Suozzi, $80 billion a year in  Defense and also on the non-Defense side as well which is what the  Democrats have pushed for, $63 billion.</p><p>So that's an increase of $143 billion a year in spending on Defense and  non-Defense.  If you're worried about the debt and deficits, Congressman  Suozzi, how do you get behind that?  </p><p>SUOZZI:  Yes.  That's something I'm thinking about right now.  You know,  I'm very interested in us working together to try and come up with a plan  to actually keep the government moving forward.  People that are concerned  about Defense and the military; Secretary Mattis was just testifying in our  committee yesterday and talking about how dangerous these continuing  resolutions are and we need long-term spending plans to help our military  and to help every single department that we have throughout the federal  government.</p><p>So I'm interested in a bipartisan plan.  But I'm also concerned about the  fact that we're increasing the deficit.  And you know, talk about new-found  Democrats, Republicans -- we're all in this together, ok.  Republicans and  Democrats, different people from each party have paid attention to deficits  for a long time.  Other people have not paid attention to it.</p><p>I'm concerned that as we increase the deficit, we're going to see an impact  on our interest rates and that's going to cause even more debt for the  federal government.</p><p>I work in a group called the Problem Solvers' Caucus.  I'm the vice  chairman.  That's 24 Democrats, 24 Republicans.  We have talked over and  over again about how we want to have plans working together but increasing  the deficit is one of the worst things we can do.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But how does it help with Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman  calling thousand-dollar bonuses \"pathetic crumbs\".  Do you think $1,000 to  one of your constituents, Congressman is crumbs?  </p><p>SUOZZI:  I absolutely don't think that's the case.  And I think that the  idea was that it was a small percentage was going to lower income people.   But in America there's 105 million full-time jobs; 59 million people make  less than $50,000 a year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.</p><p>SUOZZI:  86 million people make less than $75,000 a year so $1,000 is a big  impact on a lot of families especially these folks that are making $50,000  a year, $75,000 a year.  </p><p>TENNEY:  I agree.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've said it -- I was -- you know, I'm the child of small  business owners who were never helped by the government.  And to say $1,000  which where I grew up can feed a family of four for a month, I just found  that to be just completely deaf.</p><p>But I want to move on, Congresswoman Tenney, to President Trump facing some  backlash over what the White House says was a joke he made on Monday.  The  President was slamming Democrats for not standing and applauding during his  first state of the union address.  So watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  They were like deaf and un-American, un-American.  Somebody said  treasonous, I mean -- yes, I guess why not.  Can we call that treason?  Why  not?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I know what treason is because Maria Bartiromo gave me a  pocket constitution for Christmas.</p><p>TENNEY:  Oh, good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's Article 3, Section 3 of our constitution.  So the  definition of treason is very specific.  But you said, Congresswoman Tenney  that Democrats might not be treasonous but they're un-American and don't  love our country.  Do you still stand by that?</p><p>TENNEY:  Yes.  That's not what I said.  What I said was them not standing  for families who had their children murdered by MS-13, not standing for our  flag, not standing for God, not standing for all the things that we stand  for as Americans, yes I think the President has a point there.</p><p>I certainly don't support that he said treasonous.  I think he said it as a  joke.  But now, you know, the Democrats are out trying to raise money,  claiming I said Democrats are un-American.  Of course that's not true.   Many of my supporters are Democrats.</p><p>And the issue is this.  Why wouldn't they stand for things that were common  sense?  I know a lot of Republicans -- I looked back and looked the old  reels of Obama's state of the union addresses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>TENNEY:  And when things he talked about Americanism and unity between us,  the Republicans stood on their feet and clapped for that.  There were real  easy chances for the Democrats to stand and I'm sure Mr. Suozzi would have  liked to stand if Nancy Pelosi would let them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mr. Suozzi -- you get about 10 seconds to respond.  So quickly.  </p><p>TENNEY:  People are sick and tired of the politics back and forth.  They  want us to get things done.  Democrats, Republicans -- forget it.  We're  Americans.  We need to work together and solve problems.  People are sick  of all this personal stuff.</p><p>TENNEY:  I agree.</p><p>SUOZZI:  All this talk about treason, talking about shutting down  government, it's irresponsible.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tenney, Suozzi -- Congressmen both, thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Investors bracing for another crazy ride on Wall Street.  Take a  look at the futures right now.  92 point loss on the Dow futures.  Listen,  the futures were off by more than 200 points early in the session.  Again,  a return to volatility in this market where the markets had been so stable,  very few wild swings -- the Dow was up for 10 months in a row, including  January.  That's the longest run since the late 50s.  So again, we've been  on a rocket ship high.</p><p>Meantime a powerful winter storm pounding about 20 states.  Cheryl Casone  has the details -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.   A massive storm actually --  Dagen.</p><p>It's moving from Texas to Maine.  It's going to bring heavy snow to New  England, a mix of snow and freezing rain to the northeast and the mid- Atlantic regions, and ice and rain to the Midwest and the southeast.</p><p>According to FlightAware about 800 flights have been canceled so far today,  more than 100 of them at Newark Liberty International Airport here in the  New York area.</p><p>Well, the illegal immigrant suspected of killing Indianapolis Colts player  Edwin Jackson while driving drunk now faces federal immigration charges.   Manuel Orrego Savala charged with illegally re-entering the United States  for a second time after he was deported in 2007 and 2009.</p><p>Police say Jackson, who was 26 years old, as well as 54-year-old Jeffrey  Monroe, an Uber driver, died early Sunday morning as they were standing on  the side of I-70 in Indiana.</p><p>Orrego-Savala is due in court today in connection with that highway crash.   Orrego Savala is not the only illegal immigrant who keeps coming back to  the U.S., by the way.  The \"Washington Times\" reports that one Mexican has  managed to get deported 44 times in 15 years.  Of course, he has also  managed to sneak back across the border at least that many times.  The  runner up was ousted 40 times from the United States between 2001 to 2015 - - Dagen.  A lot of crossings.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, fake dirt for the dossier -- new details on the Clinton  associate who may have said allegations to the author of the anti-Trump  dossier.</p><p>And banking on Apple -- how Goldman Sachs reportedly wants to cash in on  expensive iPhones.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations this morning about that anti-Trump dossier.  According to  South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy, a Clinton family confidant may have  played a key role in feeding information to Christopher Steele.   Christopher Steele being the former British spy who compiled the document  in the weeks leading up to the election.</p><p>Here's what Congressman Gowdy told Martha MacCallum last night on \"THE  STORY\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  When you hear who the source or one  of the sources of that information is, you're going to think oh my gosh,  I've heard that name somewhere before.  Where could it possibly have been?  </p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS HOST:  The foreign source? </p><p>GOWDY:  The domestic source.  And I'm trying to think how Secretary Clinton  defined him.  I think she said he was an old friend who e-mailed her from  time to time.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Sidney Blumenthal?  </p><p>GOWDY:  That would be really warm.  You're warm.  Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us this morning is Fox News senior judicial analyst  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Lay it out for us.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  My thoughts --  my thought is that Trey Gowdy is basically a very decent, honest guy.  But  you cannot look at raw intelligence because you have a top secret security  clearance because you're a member of the House Intelligence Committee and  selectively release parts of it and retain parts of it to produce a  political narrative which is basically what he was doing with Martha.</p><p>Now, Martha did an absolute A plus, 2.0 job of interviewing him.  But he is  not taking seriously his top secret security clearance if he thinks he can  selectively release things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about what he disclosed because we know from the -- Senator  Chuck Grassley released an unclassified version of this recent letter that  he sent to the Justice Department, in part urging criminal investigation  into Christopher Steele for lying to the FBI.</p><p>But it also revealed additional information that was provided to Steele.   And we knew that ultimately it went to him initially because from a friend  of the Clintons.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm also a fan and a friend of Chuck Grassley.  But here is  why Christopher Steele will never, take it to the bank, be prosecuted  because Christopher Steele was an FBI asset for many years, perhaps while  he was also an MI-6 agent.</p><p>So think about this.  You have a British spy who is also spying for the  Americans.  What do the British call that -- espionage.  The last thing  they want is to put him in a criminal courtroom where he'll say here's what  the Americans told me.  Here's what the British told me.  Here's what I  told the Americans.  Here's what I told the British.</p><p>We have a group called The Five Eyes, E-Y-E-S.  He knows this.  Countries  in the world that we regularly exchange intel with and they're our friends  -- Great Britain, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and the United States.  In  return for that, we have an agreement.  We will not solicit or recruit  agents from one of the others.</p><p>Guess what the FBI did -- recruited Chris Steele.  That violated the  agreement and exposed Chris Steele to criminal prosecution.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to get back to the dossier.  This dossier based on the memo  that we've seen that was released by Devin Nunes, based on additional  information from the likes of Senator Chuck Grassley, it was funded -- the  dossier was funded by the Democrats. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was -- there was -- Chris Christie was being fed information  by at least one Clinton associate.  And it was used to get a warrant  through the FISA court on an American citizen.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I am going to withhold judgment on that until I see, if I ever  see it because it shouldn't come out, but maybe it will -- everything that  was presented to the FISA court.</p><p>Now, the FISA court is a weird court.  They meet in secret.  The judges are  not allowed to take any notes or pens or papers out of the building or  bring anything into the building.  And there's no adversary</p><p>You introduce a document into a real court, somebody else is going to  challenge that document.  In FISA it's only the government lawyers.  It's  up to the judge to challenge the document.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think the question is how much it was actually -- whether  that was a point of reference or one of many points of reference.  Because  I think, you know, as former clandestine case officer, working for --  trained by the CIA, I can tell you that when you put together a dossier of  this form that is essentially opposition research, you cannot call this  intelligence.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  This is opposition research.  So it depends on what else was  presented to the FISA court.  We don't know that.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Bobby and I were talking about this during the break.</p><p>WOLF:  I'm going to give you a soft ball but I want -- but I think it's  important for the viewers to hear it.  One, do you think the Nunes memo  should have been released?  Now, do you think the Democratic memo should be  released?  And do you think, you know, this opens a whole Pandora's Box for  future memos?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes to all of the above.  Once the Nunes memo came out.</p><p>WOLF:  Do you think that should have been released?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, if it hadn't been released, we wouldn't be going down  this warren hole.  But once it came out, you have a Republican version,  four-page summary version of hundreds of pages of intel, some of which Trey  Gowdy teased Martha MacCallum about.</p><p>Now you're going to have a Democratic version, it's going to come to the  opposite conclusion.  The American people are not children.  We now should  be entitled to see all the raw intel.  The intelligence committee would go  through the roof, you know this, if that raw intel is revealed.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to many people it looks like abuse of power by the FBI -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Abuse of power by the Justice Department.  And I want to point  out -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It shouldn't be a surprise that they abused power.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know but we're disgusted by it.  And we are surprised.</p><p>And we found out this morning -- this is more breaking news this morning.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The FBI texting saga continues.  Fox News has new information  after reviewing thousands of previously unseen text between Peter Strzok,  the FBI agent and his then-mistress, Lisa Page.</p><p>In one message from 2015, Strzok then said about people who voted against  FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe's wife in the Virginia state senate race  calling them, quote, \"ignorant hillbillies\".  I'm from that state -- thank  you.</p><p>In another text, Page told Strzok -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Lord, have mercy on him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In September of 2016 that, quote, \"POTUS wants to know  everything that we're doing\".  Senate investigators told Fox News -- and  that's POTUS, President Obama -- told Fox News that the last message is  raising questions about President Obama's personal involvement in the  Clinton e-mail investigation -- Judge.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There are about 8,000 FBI agents and we're going through the  text of two of them.  I'm going to tell you the 7,998 are not very happy  about this.  They have very, very strong political opinions.  They're  entitled to those political opinions.  They've say said things about groups  of people because of their origin, which is dumb.  But they're entitled to  be dumb.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Peter Strzok was somebody who worked on the Clinton  investigation -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct -- so let me finish.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and then worked on the Mueller team until he got kicked to  human resources because Mueller found out about it.  </p><p>WOLF:  Also Dagen -- and also brought back the Comey, Clinton investigation  that he was part of that the Democrats were not happy with. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So look, if -- </p><p>WOLF:  I mean there's a lot of he said-she said -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Final word.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  If a strong political opinion animates a law enforcement  decision; if decisions are made for political not bona fide law enforcement  reasons -- that is wrong and it can constitute misconduct in office.  But  words alone don't constitute misconduct in office.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I just wonder if we'll ever get to the bottom of this.  And  I'm glad you're here.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's a -- </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p>I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p>It's Wednesday, February 7th; your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) on Wall Street, the Dow swinging more than a thousand points  from the lows to the highs of the day yesterday, adding 567 points, the  major market gauges (ph) finishing the session in the green and the Dow,  S&amp;P, and NASDAQ, are all back in positive territory for the year.</p><p>Despite the volatility, Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin isn't worried.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, SECRETARY, US TREASURY:  The stock market is up  significantly over 30 percent since President Trump was elected.</p><p>We're monitoring the stock markets.

I think we'll take a four percent growth, we'd be pretty excited -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - That's a -</p><p>SHORT:  - about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - that's a one quarter, people - now listen, some people are  calling for four percent growth for the whole year, Jamie Dimon has said  that to Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>But are you going to try and back away from talking about the stock market?</p><p>Have you had any discussions with the president about, 'let's stick to the  economy, let's stick to the wage growth, let's stick to how people feel at  home and their pocketbooks being more full because of the tax reform,'  rather than talking about a market that could be in for greater swings,  certainly in the coming years than we've seen, this very low volatility  environment the last couple of years?</p><p>SHORT:  Sure.  I think that's fair.</p><p>You would expect higher volatility throughout this year but at the same  time I think the president's proud of the gains in the turnaround in the  market, just as he's excited about the turnaround for mainstream Americans  too when they see 4.1 percent unemployment at a 17-year low, when they see  the economy growing, the last couple quarters averaging three percent, as I  said significantly better than 1.8 percent they experienced during eight  years of the Obama administration.</p><p>I think he's going to - he's going to tout although successes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was some heavy - we're - we've been talking about  volatility and that just means swings but a lot of investors, even retail  investors have been betting on stable markets or betting against  volatility, the last couple of years, and with some of these exchange- traded products, there were couple of major ones, one run by Credit Suisse  that shut down on Tuesday because essentially all the money in them, a few  billion dollars, was wiped out late on Monday.</p><p>It kind of begs the question of, how are retail investors you know, did  they know what was going on, how were these things allowed to exist if they  were so volatile, is that something that you think that securities  regulators should look at?</p><p>SHORT:  I think that the president has a great team and Treasury and the  SEC that look at that.  I'm not expect - I'm not expecting any sort of  legislation on that front which is more my focus area -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>SHORT:  - Dagen, so I think that sure, there is a continued oversight of  that.</p><p>But if there's a greater volatility this year I think the reality is that  the fundamentals remain strong, the president has continued to roll back  the regulatory front, he's going to continue to make sure that there's tax  relief provided to the American people and we hope that the economy  continues to grow the way it has been.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well let's talk about Capitol Hill because there is a budget  battle to talk about, a government that -- if they can't come to some  agreement is going to shut down at midnight on Friday morning.</p><p>The House did approve another stop-gap spending bill yesterday --</p><p>SHORT:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:   -- the Senate looking to strike a longer-term deal -</p><p>SHORT:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - boosting spending for both domestic and military programs but  branching away from Immigration efforts so trying to separate that  Immigration fight from a funding bill.</p><p>President Trump reasserted his focus on Immigration, saying this at the  White House yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  If we don't  change it, let's have a shutdown; we'll do a shutdown and it's worth it for  country.</p><p>I'd love to see a shutdown, if we don't get this stuff taken care of.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you expect the budget outcome to be Marc and will the  president - would he - would he get behind this spending bill that's being  put together -</p><p>SHORT:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - in the Senate, if it separates Immigration from it?</p><p>SHORT:  So, it's a good question, there are couple things there.</p><p>One, keep in mind the president campaigned on rebuilding our military; the  budget cap deal that we expect to be announced perhaps as soon as today, I  think will provide the deliverance on the president's commitment to rebuild  our military, you'll see significant reinvestment there.</p><p>And I think that's one of the priorities that he set.</p><p>I do not expect a shutdown right now.</p><p>I think what the president is looking ahead to is the budget cap deal put  in place, higher caps on Defense spending that allows the appropriators to  then go write the bill that will come to the president's desk probably at  the end of March, on spending for 2018.</p><p>What he's saying once again is the same pledge he's made all along, which  is, he is expecting Congress to deliver on the promises we made on the  campaign that we would invest in border security and he's - he's going to  hold Congress' 'feet to the fire' on that and if they're not going to  deliver on that border security, he's saying, he's OK taking that extra  step.</p><p>But we're not expecting a shutdown this week, we are expecting a budget cap  deal to be in place and we're expecting it to be a victory on the  president's commitment to rebuild our military.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll - I'll say that the Senate deal, the two-year budget deal  that's been pursued by senators, it actually, military spending comes in at  629 billion a year which is above the amount that the president sought in  his budget proposal to Congress last year.</p><p>It also increases Non-Defense spending so combined, 80 billion extra for  Defense, 63 billion extra for Non-Defense, that comes in at a hundred and  forty-three billion.</p><p>If somebody is worried about debt, deficits, and higher inflation, are you  OK with that?</p><p>SHORT:  I think that there is - there are concerns about the deficit  spending on this front.</p><p>Let me go back to the premise of your question, that was that, is that  secretary Mattis also said to Congress that he wants to see the numbers  stick to the NDA level, the National Defense Authorization Act that had it  at the six twenty-nine number plus 71 billion in overseas contingency  operations to bring it up to about 700 billion for the year.</p><p>So that is the number that the secretary had asked -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.</p><p>SHORT:  - for.</p><p>But I think that regarding the deficits, keep in mind that you'll see the  president put forward a budget that will cut spending when it comes forward  next week.</p><p>The challenge will be though, is just like last year, the president put  forward a budget that balanced in 10 years and yet Congress then summarily  dismissed it.</p><p>So, we do have serious concerns about the deficits and we do think that  Congress should do a stronger job of being responsible to taxpayers in- clearing those deficits.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick Marc, are we going to get some big infrastructure  announcement on Monday?</p><p>SHORT:  You're going to see the Infrastructure announcement rolled out and  we're expecting it on Monday.</p><p>The president spoke about it some, at the State of the Union and we do  expect that you'll see greater details of those plans coming forward on  Monday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Marc, good to see you.</p><p>We covered -</p><p>SHORT:  Thanks for having -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - a lot -</p><p>SHORT:  - me on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - of ground - Thank you so much.</p><p>Marc Short, from the White House.</p><p>Coming up, a Super Bowl title, not the only thing Rob Gronkowski was robbed  of, you'll hear the Patriots superstar's frantic 911 call after thieves  broke into his home and stole guns and safes.</p><p>Plus, Goldman Sachs eyeing Apple, the bank wants to cash in on some iPhone  customers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get ready for another wild ride on Wall Street.</p><p>Take a look at how the Futures are trading right now.</p><p>Dow Futures are down just 45 points, again a major bounce back, lots of  volatility again yesterday but after the worst percentage loss on Monday,  since August of 2011, the Dow - there was trading in a twelve hundred-point  range yesterday, managed to close up 567 points.</p><p>Dow Futures were down 200 points at 6:00 a.m., now look at them?  </p><p>Holding steady!</p><p>And Goldman Sachs is looking to help people buy the next iPhone and other  Apple gadgets.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has more details on this, hey Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  New twist for Goldman Dagen, \"The Wall Street Journal\" is  reporting that Goldman Sachs is in talks with Apple to finance customers  purchases of Apple products like, yes, the one thousand dollars iPhone X.

It's Wednesday, February 7th, your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Wild swings on Wall Street 567 point gain yesterday but again the  range of swings up 1,200 points on Tuesday.  Investors in for a volatile  ride yesterday and maybe today.  Take a look at how futures are trading  right now.  We had a more than 200-point loss on the Dow futures starting  to show 6:00 a.m. now down just 70 points but again volatility is back  after people got used to very calm markets, Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ start  today up for the year not the same story for the transports and small caps.  </p><p>Meantime, the Atlanta Federal Reserve has lowered its first-quarter GDP  forecast from 5.4 percent we reported that last week now down to four  percent, still strong.  In Europe stocks are heading higher across the  board, the biggest winner there being the FTSE 100 in England up more than  one percent.  In Asia overnight stocks mostly lower, the Nikkei eking out a  small gain, the KOSPI in South Korea the worst performer falling more than  two percent.  Budget battles looming, lawmakers have until tomorrow night  to reach an agreement to keep the federal government running.  The house  already passing a stopgap spending bill and now the fight turns to the  Senate how the Senate will vote on that and immigration is still a top  issue there.  White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short  weighed in on that debate last hour. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS:  We were expecting  Congress deliver on the promises we made on the campaign that we would  invest in border security.  And he's going to hold Congress' feet to fire  on that and if they're not going to deliver on that border security he's  saying he is okay taking that extra step.  But we are not expecting a  shutdown this week, we are expected a budget cut deal is to be in place and  we're expecting to be an evictee on the president's commitment to rebuild  our military. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The latest on that battle and the immigration straight fight  ahead.  Steve Wynn out, the details as the billionaire mogul stepped down  as CEO of his company following sexual misconduct allegations.  Sheryl  Sandberg calling for fairness when it comes to the Pence role.  The Vice  President won't eat alone with a woman other than his wife and he won't  attend events where alcohol is served without his wife either.  But Sheryl  Sandberg says women's careers are ultimately hurt by this.  And SpaceX  taking it to infinity and beyond!  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  3 2 1 -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The company launching their most powerful rocket since the  Apollo mission sending a test to roadster into orbit more on the giant leap  for the private space race ahead.  And here to break it all down Fox News  Correspondent Lea Gabrielle, Fox News Contributor 32 Advisory Founder and  CEO and Former Economic Advisory to President Obama Robert Wolf, And CFRA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  I was looking on Twitter, I think that  you were called tolerable this morning Mr. Wolff, how about that?</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, that's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just -- I -- I am not making it up. </p><p>WOLF:  You know, this has been a really fun morning so I'm expect -- you  know, I see all you guys getting tweets saying, oh my God, I love seeing  you on.  I am waiting for one of those for me. </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, sitting next to you I can  tell you they enjoyed to be with you.  It's more than tolerable to enjoy. </p><p>WOLF:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I think that the volatility that we saw in the market, the  massive sell-off on Monday, biggest point decline in the history of the Dow  but also the biggest percentage decline in since 2011.  It is important to  have somebody with experience who's here.  And that is no knock on your  age, I mean that -- I mean that from the bottom of my heart. </p><p>WOLF:  Thank you.  Well, I started really young on Wall Street 21, so when  I left at 50, you know, it was -- I felt like I had three great decades.  A  few things and -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you want to -- we'll save it because we're going to talk  about the markets.  And you just have to tell people, some of the guests  are coming up later this hour.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  That's a tease, that's quite a tease.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get your -- I want to get your thoughts because again  this is just -- </p><p>WOLF:  Great guess what I was a going to say. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, so I -- the last few days felt like things that Mr. Wolf  and I have experienced covering the markets being involved in the markets  for so many years.  Joining the conversation this morning Louisiana Senator  John Kennedy, Former Chief of Staff under President George W. Bush,  Business Roundtable, CEO and President Joshua Bolten and Host of Varney &amp;  Company, Stuart Varney.  You don't want to miss it.  So volatility has come  back.  This is our top story.  Wall Street bouncing back but again they  kind of wild swings that we have seen in the market where many people have  bet billions of dollars on stable markets the last year or two was a big  winning bet.  And some people made 800 percent betting against volatility  but it came back and you had a couple of these exchange-traded products  wiped out, they closed -- they closed for good on Tuesday.  Now to you,  what were you going to say? </p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I mean listen.  We have spoken a lot since you know the Lehman  crisis where I spent you know a few days at the Fed there.  This is not  that type of crisis, this is not where on a one-directional down trade  everyone should be nervous that type of way where there's contagion coming.   This is actually just the opposite, you have a balancing equation right now  between the bears and the bulls that we spoke about between a rising rate  environment that makes people nervous versus very good corporate earnings  and growth.  </p><p>And the question is who wins and we have not seen a rising rate environment  for decades and so, you know, when I started in the 80s we were 12 percent,  we have been one directional, you know, for three decades.  And so at the  end of the day, we will be in an environment where we are not sure who is  going to win, it feels to me that the short term -- short term because of  tax reform corporate profits in the global growth will outperform for the  equity market versus a rising rate environment.  That's how it feels but  there is going to be incredible volatility. </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  I agree with that and what I  will say going back to your initial point about this isn't Lehman Brothers  days.  We have credit availability actually spreads on the 10 and the two- year have improved over the last several trading days.  So that's a good  sign and the inversion of the yield curve is a huge implication for us  going into a recession. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's a huge sign.  Inversion is where shorter-term rates  are higher than the longer term rates and -- because people are betting  basically buying longer-term debt thinking that there is going to be some  sort of calamity in the economy. </p><p>BELL:  Exactly.  And it's a key indicator. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But so can -- better economy can rising wages still drive this  market higher in coming year, Lindsey?</p><p>BELL:  I think so but we saw in the last couple days this market is a very  skittish market, they're going to be watching inflation, they're going to  be watching the 10 year, they're going to be watching wage data and wage  data that we got on Friday was good 2.9 percent but I mean when we are in a  boom times that wage growth is more like 3-1/2, four percent. </p><p>WOLF:  The one thing that is really different versus you know other  volatile times is the -- what Lea was talking earlier about the whole idea  of algorithmic and programmatic trading where it's not based on experience,  it's just based on -- there is no human touch to it and so the pendulum  swings farther each way. </p><p>BELL:  I was thinking about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But is this something -- but this is -- I want to get to Kevin  Corke but this is something that we have known about though.  I remember  the flash crash 2010, this is why this 15-minute halts on stocks were put  in place.  So this is nothing new, you had to expect it, it was like people  got conned into thinking that volatility would never come back that  everything goes up in one direction that I can bet on Bitcoin, I can bet,  you know, a stable stock market, I can bet on anything and everything and  nothing ever goes down.  I mean again --</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I know you were not going to like this but The President has  mentioned the great stock market at least 25 times just in the month of  January. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I -- listen, I -- </p><p>WOLF:  And I will just tell you if you're not -- I know but that it not a  gage for the economy that we actually usually look at -- we look at many  other gages and we should give him credit.  The economy is doing well, but  I think using the stock market as that key indicator is not the best way. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I said that from I think the day that he took office.   Even before -- no, I said you try to take credit for the record-breaking  run in the stock market on the way up and you are going to own it way down.   And I do think The President by talking about it so much even to the troops  during his Thanksgiving message that he puts all the people at the White  House in a position where now they have got to talk about it.  Whether it's  guest on this program whether it's Sarah Huckabee Sanders, whether it's the  treasury secretary, treasury secretary I understand he talks about the  stability of markets to make sure the markets are functioning properly that  is something the treasury secretary would talk about but in terms of --  now, they're trying to pivot back to just talking about the economy and it  is going to be hard.  Now I want to get to this budget issue because  lawmakers are scrambling to avoid a government shutdown set for tomorrow  night, tomorrow at midnight while President Trump trends to shut the  government down over his demands for border security.  Kevin Corke covering  the story from the White House and he has the very latest.  Hey, Kevin. </p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning to you,  Dagen.  Always nice to see you now the conventional wisdom in Washington is  typically speaking -- something will get done before Friday midnight but to  get to that C.R. that continuing resolution to give the government open and  funded, there are a lot of people who are concerned that they're probably  going to have to deal with most contentious issue and quite some time here  in Washington, you know, what I am talking about it's DACA, it's Dreamers  and most of all it is border security.  The President making it very plain  yesterday that look this is something that has got to be solved, he wants  it figured out now.  Now that is despite the threat of a democratic led  shutdown of the government. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I would love to see a  shutdown if we don't get this stuff taking care of.  So we have to strength  our borders not by a little bit but by a lot.  We are so far behind the  time and by the way, the world is laughing at us because they can't believe  these policies, they don't have it.  I could name 15 of them right now, no  other country in the world has what we have.  And we are going to get it  stopped and if we have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want  safety and unrelated but still related.  They don't want to take care of  our military then shut it down.  We will go with another shutdown.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE:  You understand what they are doing here right?  What he is  basically saying is you will be on the side of taking nonresidents, aliens,  people who are here illegally versus picking to be on the side of the  American people, that is the strategy here.  But I should also tell you  this, Dagen, over on Capitol Hill, all is not lost, so says Masters, Mitch  McConnell, and Schumer. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I'm optimistic that  very soon we'll be able to reach an agreement.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I have discussed some of  the outlines with my caucus that I think we are very happy with and  hopefully the Republicans are and then we can get something really good  done. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE:  Now, let's be honest a lot of this is jesting for public  consumption but I don't think there's any of doubt.  We will see something  happen before Friday midnight, we'll be watching very carefully from our  perch.  And I promise that truck which is about to drive right by is far  enough away that I am safe, back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what -- you know what I fear the most Kevin for you  leaf blowers.  They are -- they are the worst thing on the plant, scarier  than a chainsaw. </p><p>CORKE:  Yes.  True story. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I brought it and it was so loud and so annoying.  Kevin, great  to see.  Kevin Corke from The White House for us.  Real quick everybody on  this budget deal, here is what bothers me about the Republicans show me  some spending restraints because again this deal that the senators are  putting through $80 billion a year more in defense spending, nondefense  spending, increasing by $63 billion a year and then we're going to be  talking about infrastructure. </p><p>GABRIELLE:  And that is the problem it's because they can't get it passed  without getting some Democrat support and Democrats won't support it unless  they get some sort of a match to the increasing defense spending, right? </p><p>WOLF:  But a few things.  That is not uncommon, that you have discretionary  spending and nondiscretionary go up equally.  That's not -- number two.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is the problem -- it's not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- 20 trillion debt.</p><p>WOLF:  Number two, the Republicans have always been a pay go OK party.  Now  all of a sudden they are no longer fiscal, they find it --</p><p>GABRIELLE:  The military has been suffering since the budget control last  2011 the secret --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF:  I'm not talking about the military.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm not talking about the military, we're talking about  the nondiscretionary.</p><p>WOLF:  And as you know Claire McCaskill went on the floor and said let's  pass all the spending we need for the military true or not true. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is true.</p><p>WOLF:  Is she a Democrat? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes. </p><p>WOLF:  And it didn't get passed, so listen, we can talk partisan politics  all day, we are all supportive of the military our -- my only point is the  Republican party has always been fiscal hoax and all of a sudden we have a  trillion-dollar deficit from the tax reform. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and the Democrats said -- the Democrats have always wanted  to spend everybody else's money and not give it back to us and not give us  tax cuts.  And now all of a sudden they are worried about the sky falling  because of the budget deficit. </p><p>WOLF:  How about where we all agree -- how about where you all agree we  should not have a government shutdown, that does not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think everyone does agree that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I agree because the military doesn't get paid, that's what  shameful. </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think -- I think the only one who is not saying that right  now is President Trump and I think the reason he is saying what he is  saying is because he is appealing to his base.  And he's prone hyperbole.   Immigration. </p><p>WOLF:  Right.  But the -- but let's be clear, a government shutdown costs  over a billion dollars a day the last one, that's not a good thing for  anybody. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And doesn't make (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>WOLF:  And I'm not supportive of attaching DACA to a government shutdown  neither.  I think one is budgetary but we should -- we should --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want some spending restraints, Republicans spending  restraint.  Can we show it?  Can we see it?  More ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  Steve Wynn resigning as Chairman and CEO of Wynn  Resorts.  Cheryl Casone has more details.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Big news, Dagen.  Wynn has that Steve Wynn's  resignation, it's effective immediately.  This comes after sexual  misconduct allegations against the Las Vegas billionaire.  A number of  women have claimed that Wynn harassed or assaulted them, one case led to a  $7.5-million settlement.  Now, Wynn is still denying those allegations.   Shares of the company up nine percent in the premarket.  It was down  earlier.  Stock to watch today.</p><p>Well, a Facebook executive is taking issue with Mike Pence's rule about  being around women.  He has a personal rule that's common among a lot of  evangelicals.  Doesn't allow him to be alone with women.  He's also said in  the past, he won't attend an event with alcohol without his wife by his  side.  Well, Sheryl Sandberg thinks this rule hurts women's growth in the  workplace because missed opportunity to network with men.  A lot of times  they're superiors.  Sandberg, the CEO of Facebook and the co-founder of  Lennon says that if men followed the so-called Mike Pence Rule, it should  apply to everybody, not just women but the flood of #MeToo revolutions, a  recent survey showed half of male managers said their uncomfortable  participating in basic activities with women. </p><p>Well, President Trump like what he saw as a guest of honor at France's  Bastille Day parade last July, so much he wants a similar parade perhaps on  Pennsylvania Avenue to celebrate 4th of July.  Trump is asking the defense  department to throw a parade to show off American military power.  White  House officials and the Pentagon have confirmed that a military parade is - - well, they're talking about it.  Options are being put on table, they say  they're planning something.  Last time we had a full military parade in  D.C. was after the Gulf War back in '91.  It cost $12 million.  So you got  to throw out the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think a parade to celebrate our troops, to celebrate our  defense, to celebrate our country is wonderful but we as a country are so  above these parades you see from other countries where they need to put on  display their weapons and need to show over what they have and if this in  any way smells of that type of parade I think will be resented by our  troops because we are above that. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF:  There was a rule that President Trump may actually ride in one of  the tanks. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you just make that up? </p><p>WOLF:  I did. </p><p>BELL:  Oh my god.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That worked very well.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  You got me there.</p><p>WOLF:  I did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No. That worked so well for Mike Dukakis, that basically ended  his presidential run but I want to point something out -- </p><p>WOLF:  Tuesday.  You got me there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  So -- but one thing, but if that happens that you say the  military wouldn't like it but it would like the Soviet Union or North  Korea, I mean, that is the appearance. </p><p>BELL:  It is unnecessary, it looks silly.  I think something to celebrate  our troops is one thing, to celebrate country is something but if we start  making this look like a big display like we see in North Korea, it's silly,  it's unnecessary and we as a country are above it. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wouldn't you rather have $20 million put towards new aircraft or  a new tank? </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that we should thank those who have served and do serve  who basically are protecting our freedom.  We say we're the land of the  free because we are the home of the brave.  We need to thank these  individuals every single day.  Thank you for your service. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Oh, thank you for saying that.  And let's thank them all of  those who serve and the families of those who serve by showing them off, by  not making them jump through you-know-what's to put on a parade.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I have my R. Riveter bag right here.  This is made  by the spouses of people of men and women who are serving in -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>WOLF:  And I have to show my wounded warriors here because I'm a big  supporter and to give the 20 million to wounded warriors.  So we have tons  of different ways to give the money versus the parade.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You can see parades around the world as you see are vessels and  around the world supporting our country.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  The trickle-down effect of President Trump's tax  plan, how cutting corporate taxes could help millions of American workers.   Plus, Houston we have liftoff, more incredible video from the SpaceX rocket  launch, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Investing in America.  A new blog post titled, America's workers  are the real winners from corporate tax reform. Hits back against critics  who say that the new tax law only benefits corporations.  It reads in part,  companies will also use some of the gains from tax reform to return capital  to investors.  Money returned to shareholders of any kind re-circulates  throughout the economy with some helping finance new star-ups, some being  reinvested in growing sectors to the economy.  Some being safe to increase  future consumption.  Let's bring in the writer of this blog post, he  happens to be the former chief of staff under President Bush 43, Business  Roundtable president and CEO, Josh Bolton.  Josh, you preach into the choir  right here, I have been saying that, I understand the way the tax reform  works both for individuals and corporations.  Are we hearing enough of that  from members of the Republican Party?  And those very lawmakers really  pushing back on the rhetoric from the likes of Nancy Pelosi?</p><p>JOSH BOLTON, CEO, BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE:  Yes, I hope so.  First of all,  thanks for having me this morning to talk about this.  But I hope we are  hearing it from the members who supported this tax bill because they have a  lot to be proud of.  It's not just the dividends and share buybacks that  the tax reform may release, the much more important part is the benefits  that are going directly to workers right now as a result of the extra cash  that companies have.  And even more important than that is the investments  that those corporations that companies all over America are going to be  able to do right here in America as a result of the more competitive tax  code.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I just want to point out we're looking at the vast list of  companies that are returning some of the tax savings to their workers  whether it's in thousand dollar bonuses and we just found out Chipotle has  said it's going to reinvest more than one-third of its savings from the new  tax law in its employees.  Some of the new benefits workers will get  include one-time bonuses of up to $1000 to hourly and salaried workers  along with life insurance, short-term disability insurance for hourly  restaurant managers.  This is just to name a few.  But to look at thousand  dollars in this country and say that it's pathetic crumbs, Josh, I don't --  I don't -- I know that that does not resonate with the American people.   I've said this, are people really looking at their bigger paychecks  thinking, I really wish Nancy Pelosi had her hands on this money instead of  me. </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  I hope they are and comments like that I think just  reflected a fundamental misunderstanding of what tax reform was likely to  bring.  And the evidence is now overwhelming.  At the business roundtable  alone we represent 200 of America's biggest corporations.  We have members  of our organization alone have already announced over $700 million in  bonuses to their employees, lots of wage increases 401(k) enhancements.   Those are real substantial benefits for the workers of all those  corporations.  And that's just in the first six weeks after the enactment  of the tax reform.  I think there is a lot more to come in this economy.   Both in terms of short-term benefits that workers will realize more  importantly in the long-term competitiveness of American companies which is  where American workers need to work.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Josh, are you concerned though about the tax reform being part  of the reason that we were -- we're going to have higher inflation?  You  talk about wage growth.  But wage growth is part of the inflation equation,  you wind up with higher interest rates.  That is certainly last week was a  big concern for the stock market with that wage growth number we got from  the employment report.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  That could have been a part of what's roiled the markets a  bit in the -- in the last few days is an expectation now of some  inflationary pressure from wage increases.  But look, that's -- that wasn't  the purpose of tax reform and it's not -- it's not really going to be the  effect.  What everybody across all political persuasions has been looking  for is real wage increases for American workers.  Tax reform is going to  unleash a lot of that and overall that's a huge benefit to the American  economy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Josh, it was really good to see you.  Thank you for being here  as always.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Josh Bolton.  We will see you very soon.  As we go to break,  futures are trading like this right now, take a look.  Dow futures were  down more than 200 points when we started the show at 6:00 a.m. Eastern  down 87 points right now.  Wild swings on Wall Street, we will watch that  as the day moves on.  Plus, Tesla revving up to report fourth-quarter  earnings after the bell.  We break down the numbers ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  Welcome back,  everybody.  It's Wednesday, February 7th.  Your top stories at 8:32 a.m.  Eastern.  Another wild day on Wall Street, the Dow Jones swimming more than  1000 points, almost 1200 points in fact from loss to highs in yesterday's  session ending the day up 567 points, big bounce back from that kind of  epic loss on Monday.  The major market gages finishing yesterday in the  green and the Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ are all back in positive territory for  the year.  Checking action this morning.  Futures are off a little bit, the  Dow futures are down 98 points, they were off more than 200 early in the  morning about 6:00 a.m. when we started this program, started MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  </p><p>But again, this is the issue, volatility is back, people have become very  complacent, they weren't used to wild swings.  The Dow had a move of one  percent or more to seven times last year.  Over in Europe, you have gains  across the board to speak of.  The biggest gainer there being the FTSE 100  in England up more than one percent.  in Asia, markets were mostly lower,  heavy selling to report on the KOSPI in South Korea down more than two  percent.</p><p>Plus, Steve Wynn resigning from his namesake company.  The casino mogul  leaving amid allegations of sexual misconduct.  Stuart Varney's take coming  up.  To the budget battle on Capitol Hill.  One Senator unveiling  legislation to cut back on government waste.  The details ahead.  Investors  eyeing earnings of course back to fundamentals, Tesla gearing up to report  after the closing bell, the numbers that you need to watch ahead.  And  going to a place where there are no roads. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There might not be roads there but that didn't stop Elon Musk  from sending a Tesla into space.  More on the Falcon Heavy launch later  this hour.  Futures under pressure but well off the lows of the morning.   We are -- what are the traders on Wall Street saying about this have crazy  ride that we've seen really in the last week.  Nicole Petallides on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  Nicole? </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Good morning, Dagen.  So, obviously we've  seen from choppy (INAUDIBLE) action, there's no doubt about that, even this  morning as you have been covering there throughout the morning, we've seen  it down as much as close to 300 -- and the futures now we're down about  100, so that's what the traders are talking about.  They're also talking  about the heavy volume that we saw yesterday.  So there has been a lot of  action and talking about the people who were trying to get in, there were  some outages for people from T.D. Ameritrade and Fidelity trying to get --  try to navigate this difficult market.  And whether or not the bottom is  in.  That's been a big topic of conversation.  Yesterday we had obviously  the second largest-point swing ever in history in the day before.  The  biggest ever.  So, the question is whether or not the bottom is in and  yesterday 75 percent they said is likely in.  Back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nicole, thank you so much for that.  Nicole Petallides in the  New York Stock Exchange.  Turning to the shutdown showdown.  A bipartisan  budget deal in the works.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and  Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying that they are very close to finalizing  a budget that would boost military and nondefense spending, reportedly a  total $143 billion.  The new PAC makes no mention of immigration likely  tabling that debate for now.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER:  The Republican leader and I have been working together quite  productively.  Of course, there is still some outstanding issues to be  resolved.  But we are closer to an agreement than we have ever been.</p><p>MCCONNELL:  Once we have established that the government is going to be  open which needs to happen by February the 8th.  We'll then go forward with  an immigration debate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now is Louisiana Senator John Kennedy.  This plan  comes just as the House approved a stopgap spending bill to fund the  government through March 23rd.  What do you think of the proposal from the  leadership in the Senate? </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Well, I like the House deal, Dagen.  I  haven't seen the details of the leadership's proposal.  They say they are  close, I've been hearing that for four months.  I've got to see it to  believe it.  I think if they make a deal it will be two-year deal and  surprise-surprise they're going to increase spending.  I just got to see  how much and where they're going to spend the money.  And how much is going  to add to the he deficit and you can put me down as doubtful.  I'm not  saying I'm not going to vote for it, but every time there is a budget deal  it always includes bigger numbers not smaller numbers and while you and I  are talking today since we've been talking we've already borrowed a  million-dollars.  We've borrowed a million dollars a minute to operate the  Federal government.  $1.4 billion a day.  </p><p>BELL:  Senator, it's Lindsey Bell.  I absolutely can appreciate your  concern for the spending there and we need to cut back on some of these  costs but isn't a two-year deal better than another C.R. to just get --  take us out another six weeks, by the time we get to march, the fiscal year  only have six more months left. </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, the problem with the C.R. or continuing resolution, Dagen,  is that there is no certainty and it does hurt our military.  Because they  can't plan.  And I do support more spending for military.  Every Senator,  Republican and Democrat, has seen the classified information.  They can't  talk about it but they know we need more spending for the military.  I just  got to see how much of waste I've got to eat in order to help our military.   And I can't make that determination until I see the -- see the numbers.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Senator, this is Lea Gabrielle.  Nice to see you. </p><p>KENNEDY:  Nice to see you, Lea.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  It sounds like you're not very hot on what you expect to be  coming your but also acknowledge that a C.R. is a terrible solution for  what we have going on, so what are you proposing? </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, what I'm proposing is that we get serious about properly  funding our military and we get serious about living within our needs.   Nobody around here except some folks in the house and few Senators are  talking about how we can spend less.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  But how do you propose getting that done? </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, let me give you an example.  I'm introducing the bill with  Tom Carper, it's got a fancy title but I call it The Stop Paying Dead  People Act.  The federal government is paying I think between 10 and $20  billion dollars a year to dead people.  And they're cashing the checks.   Obviously, there is fraud.  I mean in some states dead people can vote but  cashing a check is a little bit too much.  </p><p>WOLF:  Senator --I</p><p>KENNEDY:  I'll give you an example over a three-year period, the auditors  found that the Federal government sent out $1 billion in foreign payments  to dead farmers.  There is another case over a five-year period, the  Federal government paid $600 million in Federal pension checks to dead  retirees.  And the checks are being cashed and you know what's being done  about it?  Nothing, zero, nada. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Senator, I'm going to let Robert Wolf ask you a question but  Robert, I think everybody is for getting rid of waste and fraud and paying  dead people but a few billion dollars a year is a drop in the doggone  bucket in terms of what we spend just on -- listen, the interest on our  national debt in a year or two is going to top what we spend on the  military, Robert.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  Senator Kennedy, I just want to shift quickly because it seems  like either be a continuing resolution or a two-year budget deal with  respect to the -- with respect to the Senate.  It seems like there's not  going to be a government shutdown.  So I want to therefore just segue to  DACA which market is a really big gate for these 800,000 immigrants waiting  to see really what happens to them and just to be clear, you know, I'm a  supporter to protect the DREAMers.  And so I'm curious, where you are going  to March 5th and how do you see the outcome for these individuals? </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, number one, there are a lot of meetings being held in  groups of Senators are talking.  But what counts is 60 votes.  There are  several plans on the table right now, every single one of them are held  together with spit.  The only way to find out where everybody stands is to  vote.  And what I expect Senator McConnell to do is put some sort of  instrument bill on (INAUDIBLE) and let us start debating it and amending  it.  I'm much less sanguine than so my colleagues that we'll be able to 60  votes to do something meaningful.  Our Democratic friends want amnesty and  frankly nothing else.  I want to solve the problem.  I want to be here  talking about another DACA immigrant amnesty issue five or 10 years from  now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Senator, that's one of the reasons that they're including  the people who never signed up for DACA, including the White House,  including that in that 1.8 million people who would be given a pass to  citizenship.  So, do you oppose any path to citizenship whatsoever?  You  can call it amnesty --</p><p>KENNEDY:  It just depends on the bill.  Look, here is the problem.  We've  got immigration laws about half of our public officials don't agree with  them so they don't enforce them.  I give you ask sanctuary cities are  exhibit number one.  What we need to do is agree on a set of laws and  enforce the damn things like every other country does.  Just doing amnesty  is not going to solve this problem.  We need to --</p><p>WOLF:  Just to shift.  So we know it's coming up on March 5th, so there's  not going to be a broad base immigration bill passed by March 5th, we know  this.  March 5th --</p><p>KENNEDY:  No.  We don't know that.  Excuse me.  But we don't know that.</p><p>WOLF:  OK.</p><p>KENNEDY:  We can start debating the immigration bill next week and come out  with a comprehensive bill.  We have 60 votes, now I'm not -- I don't think  we will but we could -- </p><p>WOLF:  So let's agree that the likelihood is unlikely.  So March 5th comes  and we have the situation with the DREAMers.  Where do you think it will --  what will happen on you March 5th?  What is your expectation? </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, if we don't do anything by March 5th, it's up to the  president.  Because he controls the enforcement of deportation, he sets  deportation policy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Senator --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- the DACA recipients that is being held up in the courts.  So  there is this feeling in Washington that they can drag their feet and wait  on dealing with this because the court has said that the order to end DACA  that they're basically put a stop to it at least in -- for -- at least  temporarily.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  That's a very good point.  I can just tell you categorical,  unequivocally, I don't want there to be any doubt about where I stand.  I'm  not going to vote for amnesty unless I get a full bill that solves the  problem.  Now, you're going to ask me what that is, I've got my own ideas,  I'm not so arrogant that I think only my ideas will work but I'm not just  going to vote for amnesty and kick this problem down the road, I want to  solve it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you but everybody who you're in -- at the -- in the  Senate and House with, you're kicking that debt problem down the road and  it's going to blow up in everybody's face.  That's my predictions.  Senator  John Kennedy.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Amen, amen, sister, amen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Futures are off by 102 points, that's much better than the  picture was at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  But again, wild swings on Wall  Street yesterday.  Meantime, Steve Wynn resigning as chairman and CEO of  Wynn Resorts.  Joining me now to weigh in is the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Mr. Stuart Varney.  What say you, sir?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Well, I don't think there was much choice here.   I think Steve Wynn had to go.  Look, he's been accused to buy, literally,  dozens of women of sexual misconduct.  He didn't get his day in court but  that is not the point.  Had this gone forward with him as CEO, the Chinese  government may well have withdrawn the licenses which Steve Wynn has for  his casinos in Macau.  You withdraw those licenses in Macau and you have  just about destroyed Wynn Casino, the stock.  He still got 12 percent of  it, but if you can operate in Macau and he's got 70 percent of his revenue  come from Macau, you can't operate, period.  He have to go even though he  didn't get his day in court.  That's my reading of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But day in court, Stuart, though, means -- I mean, due process,  we all believe in that, right?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That it means it leaves the company opening an internal  investigation with outside counsel to look into this, but I think when it  comes to light that an individual -- and this is according to all reports  in the Wall Street Journal -- Steve Wynn set up an LLC to pay one accuser,  took steps to conceal $7-1/2 million settlement.  It's those settlements  that we all well know dupe people in, in terms of their employment.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, you got a good point, Dagen.  No question about it.  I'm just  a little uncomfortable with the current trend towards utter dismissal,  total disgrace, you lose everything but you never get to plead your case in  court.  Now, in this particular instance, I can understand why not?  But  you know, we've gone a long way with this.  I'm not -- I'm not criticizing  the women who've come forward.  I enthrall it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart, no, no, no --</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm saying we better settle down a little here because maybe, in  some cases, some injustice is being done.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not just men who are uncomfortable with some of this, it's  women like myself who is very uncomfortable with that story told about --  Aziz, I'm sorry, the comedian about this date that he had been on, and it  was a bad date, and he -- again, people's careers and lives are destroyed  in some instances by based on one headline.  Never read -- never reading  the allegations.  I just think that there is just -- there is definitely a  brewing discomfort among both men and women about how these allegations are  aired.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well said.  And there are no good answers here, period.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>VARNEY:  None.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  None.  But we do want women to be heard, too.</p><p>VARNEY:  We do, indeed.  Absolutely, we do.  Yes, of course.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart, you're the best.  Your show starts in exactly 10  minutes.  There you go, Monday through Fridays, Stuart is all over this  market.  It is going to be incredible coverage as it is every day, Stuart  Varney 9:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Coming up, SpaceX successfully launching the Falcon Heavy rocket, sending a  Tesla Roadster into outer space.  More video that's out of this world,  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  To quote Robert Wolf, so cool.  3, 2, 1 liftoff.  SpaceX  successfully launching the Falcon Heavy Rocket yesterday, capable of  lifting up to 140,000 pounds, and now, holds the title of world's most  powerful rocket.  But how will Elon Musk auto company take off today?   Tesla set to report fourth-quarter results after the bell.  It's expected  to post a loss for $3.10 a share, revenue on revenue $3.28 billion.   Joining us now, ARK Invest Analyst, Tasha Keeney.  Tasha, what are  expectations for Tesla?</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, INVEST ANALYST, ARK:  So, I think most investors are worried  about the Model 3 production ramp cash burn.  But from our perspective, you  know, people are comparing Tesla to traditional auto companies.  It's an  autonomous car company.  And once that switch is flipped, and these cars  that are already on the road today become fully autonomous, they're going  to become revenue-generating assets.  So, from that perspective, we're  happy that Tesla is spending money to get this off the ground because we  think that opportunity is huge.  We think the global market for autonomous  driving, autonomous taxis could be around $10 trillion.</p><p>BELL:  But they do have competition in this space, Waymo, Lyft, a whole  slew of others.  How sure are you that they're going to get there first and  they're going to be the winners in this race?</p><p>KEENEY:  They do have competition but what Tesla has is scale.  So, every  car that's on the road today is basically like a mini R&amp;D center.  It's  gathering data that Tesla then uses to train its autonomous driving  algorithms.  And no other automaker has been able to do this, get cars on  the road with that capability.  So, this puts Tesla years ahead of others  and, you know, yesterday, we heard on G.M.'s earnings call that they have  about 100 test cars on the road.  I mean, Tesla has thousands of cars.   Think about that information and what it's capable of.</p><p>WOLF:  So, being an old-school Wall Street guy, at what point do you get  nervous about cash burn, and what -- this is much more like almost a  biotech company?</p><p>KEENEY:  Because it's being -- the cash burn has been getting worse each  quarter.  Yes, yes.  So, to give you an idea of roughly what we expect in  earnings from these vehicles, so right now, each car is generating about  $3,000 worth of earnings for Tesla.  We think once you turn that  autonomous, that could be a net present value about over $80,000 per  vehicle, and --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, we've -- go ahead, finish your --</p><p>KEENEY:  And, you know, so we're happy that they're spending money.  I  think we'd be happy if they raised another $20 billion to get this off the  ground.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, you get the Tesla in space but you also have the CEO Elon  Musk, the founder of the company who's busy with all these other pursuits  including SpaceX.  Concerned.</p><p>KEENEY:  That's a valid point.  You know, I think Elon Musk is a really  amazing person.  We saw in this rocket launch, he is capable of making the  impossible possible, and so, you know, while no one has achieved this feat  yet, I wouldn't put it past him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  Tasha, Tasha Keeney, thank you so much.</p><p>KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.  Final thoughts when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Final thoughts.  Lindsey?</p><p>BELL:  Get ready for this political uncertainty to drive that volatility.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Robert?</p><p>WOLF:  Congrats to the Eagles, great year for the Pats, and I've already  moved to the Celtics.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I would, too.  Lea?</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Ask for a military parade, that you can see our ships on  parade, our submarines on parade, our soldiers, our sailors, airmen, and  marines around the world.  From Stephen LeClair who's a former marine, he  says he wants to spend time with his family on July 4th, not in a parade.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I say to the Democrats, stop talking down the economy and  essentially rooting for a downfall for the markets, bad for them.  Stuart,  over to you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, I'll take it, Dagen.  Thank you very much, indeed.  It is not  over but is it calming down a bit?  OK.  I'm on dangerous ground.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Over to Dagen McDowell,  in for Maria Bartiromo this morning.  Hey Dagen.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning ladies.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for  Maria Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, February 7th.  Your top stories at 6:00  a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Volatility slamming Wall Street investors from Coast-to-Coast.  They were  in for a wild ride yesterday as the DOW finish the day up nearly 600 points  after falling by about the same amount in earlier trading.  All of the --  as of yesterday's close, all three of those major market gauges are back in  positive territory for the year.  </p><p> But Futures are telling a different story, 243 point loss on the DOW  Futures this morning.  Again, will volatility end this bull market coming  on its nine-year anniversary next month, we will ask that question.   Meantime, the economy still looks strong, the Atlanta Federal Reserve did  lower its first-quarter GDP forecast to four percent, still hot but that's  down from 5.4 percent last week.  </p><p> In Europe, stocks are heading higher.  We have some modest gains across the  board in England, France, and Germany but in Asia overnight, stocks mostly  lower.  The Kospi in South Korea, the worst performer there.  The Nikkei  managing to eke out a small gain but the Kospi up by more than two percent.</p><p> The budget battles looming, lawmakers have until tomorrow night to reach an  agreement to keep the federal government running as the House passes a  stopgap spending bill, the fight now turns to the Senate where immigration  remains a top issue.  President Trump weighing in from the White House  yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't change it, let's  have a shutdown, we'll do a shutdown and it's worth it for our country.   I'd love to see a shutdown if we don't get this stuff taken care of.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The latest on the immigration battle ahead.  Steve Wynn, out.   The details as the billionaire mogul steps down as CEO of his company  following sexual misconduct claims.  </p><p> SpaceX takes it to infinity and beyond.</p><p> (VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The company launching their most powerful rocket since the  Apollo mission.  Sending a Tesla Roadster into orbit as well, more on the  giant leap for the private space race ahead.</p><p> Plus, winter is coming to a galaxy far, far away.  From ESPN to \"Star  Wars\", the Disney earnings, a fan's dream.  The new details on the  company's fourth streaming service and its plans that came with the mind  behind \"Game of Thrones.\"</p><p> All that and so much more coming up this morning, FOX News Correspondent,  Lea Gabrielle is here.  FOX News Contributor, 32Advisors Founder and CEO  and Former Economic Advisor to President Obama, Robert Wolf.  And CFRA  Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Good morning to everybody.</p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p> ROBERT WOLF, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Great too.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is when I'm very happy.  We have some age on the panel,  myself included because we remember what this kind of all feels it looks  like.</p><p> WOLF:  You know, I'm thinking that -- I think I was in middle school when  we had this volatility.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Really?</p><p> WOLF:  It's been like a -- let's be honest, outside of the dot-com bubble  and the Asia crisis and the 2008 recession, we've kind of been on a three- decade, one directional ride.  We haven't seen the 1,200 point swing, I  can't remember.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We want to make it there, yes.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  I mean, it turns out the stock  market actually goes down sometimes, right?  It should be a really -- this  should be a wakeup call for investors, retail investors especially.  What  do you have in your portfolio?  You need to know.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well I think that people already got a wakeup call Lindsey and  we will talk about that with people betting on stable markets with these  inverse volatility funds, a couple of them shutting down yesterday.  We're  talking about massive losses, so it's not just individuals, that some of  the smartest minds, some of the smartest guys and gals in the room, again,  also losing money.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  And a lot of computers involved in what was going on, of  course, to those algorithms have certainly changed how the work is being  done.</p><p> WOLF:  No question.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're going to talk about it all this morning.  Coming up, White  House Director of Legislative Affairs, Marc Short is here.  New York  Congressman Tom Suozzi, New York Congresswoman, Claudia Tenney, that's on  the left and the right, we'll have them on together.  Louisiana Senator,  John Kennedy, and former George W. Bush Chief of Staff Business Roundtable  President and CEO, Josh Bolton.</p><p> You don't want to miss any of those guests but first for our top story,  Wall Street bouncing back, U.S. markets rallying to regain almost half  their losses from the day before when stocks took the largest plunge in six  and a half years, that is the percentage loss that we saw on the DOW.  The  DOW ending the day with a gain of 567 points.  After closing, down more  than 1,100 points on Monday.  Futures right now are showing losses across  the board, 243 point loss on the DOW Futures.</p><p> Despite the turbulence, Treasury Secretary Steve MNuchin telling lawmakers  on Capitol Hill that the markets are functioning, \"Very well.\"</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  We are very focused on the long- term economic growth and we believe that the policies that we've enacted  including tax reform are very positive for a long-term economic growth.   We're already beginning to see that in terms of corporate investments back  into the United States and the impact on corporate earnings.</p><p> I think as you said that the stock market is up significantly over 30  percent since President Trump was elected, we're monitoring the stock  markets, they're functioning very well, and we continue to believe in the  long-term impact of the stock market.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, your take on what Secretary MNuchin is saying but also  in volatility going to threaten this nine-year bull market?</p><p> BELL:  I think volatility certainly has a shot at ruining it but look, last  year, there were eight days that we saw a move of one percent plus or minus  on the S&amp;P500.  Historically, we usually see about 50 of those days.  And  when you have a year like that, the next year, you're bound to have more  volatility.  So, I think people should buckle in and get ready for more of  that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What all this referencing is, again, it was this sense of calm  leads to overconfidence.  Among individual investors and professional  investors that people kind of become delusional about their ability and you  had all these bets on stable markets, this inverse volatility.</p><p> These were exchange-traded retail products, two of which including the XIV  closed down to investors after they lost most of their money of late  Monday.  So, again, these losses, the tide goes out and you see who was  swimming naked.  </p><p> WOLF:  Well, I won't comment on the swimming naked but what I will say is  we realize financial engineering doesn't always work and program trading  sometimes the pendulum goes too far each lane, you have these types of  swings.  </p><p> My concerns are two-fold, one, I think the administration is talking way  too much about the stock market.  I think President Trump, I think he  should take a lot of credit for the rally but to talk about it literally  every day, it's not the gauge on the economy we should be using as 50  percent of the nation doesn't even own stocks.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well I've been saying that literally since he took office.  </p><p> WOLF:  Well that's where I took it from.  And I think secondly, I think  that I know as the oldest one on this desk, I have not been in a market  that we've seen this type of back up and rates starting, inflation feeling  protectionist environment, problems with the fiscal deficit on one side,  and then the other side, decent growth, you have the tax cuts that are  going to be almost like its own quantitative easing and then lastly, good  corporate profits.  There's a real tug of war that's going to go in 2018.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well who's going to win because I will push back because I've  been concerned about interest rate moving up since really the end of last  year but with inflation now come -- with wages now growing at close to  three percent which happened in the most recent month.</p><p> That's -- still, wages are still -- growth is still very muted, inflation  is still muted.  And all the signs in the market, for the most part, do say  that the economy is OK if not, great.  </p><p> WOLF:  So I would say -- first of all, I would say the bulls will win  short-term because the tax reform is going to be the sugar candy for  corporate growth.  And I think you're going to see that short-term soft  buybacks, dividend, some M&amp;A activity.</p><p> But I think long-term, people are going to project out a backup of rates  and when we start getting three and a half, four percent, you're going to  see a shift take place from equity to fixed income, you're just going to  see it because risk free returns are going to start to look good versus a  market that's been pretty buoyant.  I mean, that's just one thing I do have  as experience 30 years.  I can't say how much in the market today.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It sounds like you're calling longer term for a bear market in  stocks and bonds because, again, if -- because we've had a bull market in  bonds since the early 1980s.  Did you --</p><p> WOLF:  I wouldn't say a bear market but I think the bears will beat the  bulls probably come towards late 2018, early 2019 as we see in just to my  opinion this nervousness.  We're going to do better, growth is here, wages  will do better, the labor force is starting to tighten.  Those are just  facts.  And we have a whole new Fed environment with Powell coming in.</p><p> BELL:  I think it's going to depend largely on inflation and interest rates  as well and inflation is going to be driven by that wage number.  If we get  productivity which it seems like we should get better productivity, the  inflation won't come in high-speed manner that is sort of expected kind of  market right now.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Any concerns about the impact to the economy because of tax  reform if the Fed ends up tightening at monetary policy because of  inflation as some are talking about right now and also -- MCDOWELL:  Well they are tightening monetary policies.  They're reducing  their balance sheets, it's already down to $4 trillion and they're already  raising interesting rates.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Right.  But the question is, if interest rates if we get four  instead of three, if things change as they are trying to cool down the  economy getting too heated up, do you have any concerns over the tax cuts  and how that might have an impact on the deficit and debt?</p><p> WOLF:  Well I do.  I mean, I've been speaking about it, yes, I'm a pro- growth Democrat but I have been -- I am fiscally pretty hawkish in a sense  that I think if everything should have been revenue neutral, I believe in  the PAYGO system.  And so my view is although I was supportive of tax  reform, I probably would have looked to have done -- I would have done it - -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So you were up -- so you were concerned that that --</p><p> WOLF:  I was concerned on the fiscal side sometimes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well -- so you were also concerned when the national debt  doubled under President Obama.</p><p> WOLF:  Absolutely.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Did you fell in that as his economic advisor?</p><p> WOLF:  We're talking about -- we're looking -- the answer -- you know, I've  been with you for a decade, so the answer is yes.  I mean, listen, I --  when I was his economics advisor, very clear we want the tax reform to go  to 28 percent, for corporate it's 25 percent for manufacturing.  We will  also -- we had a Republican Senate in the House, it had to be revenue  neutral.</p><p> That was the only dialogue we ever had was revenue neutral.  That being  said, corporate tax reform is a good thing, I am not going to push back on  that.  I just think that we have not been in an environment with raising  rates, high debt, fiscal deficit and think that's good for the stock  market.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I agree with you that we've never been an environment where  the Federal Reserve.  We had easy, such easy money for so long that we're  entering this unprecedented era of where the Fed has to unwind this balance  sheet where the easy money starts disappearing and you're just beginning to  see the risky, even idiotic debts that people took because everything was  going up in lockstep. </p><p> I want to get to this though Lindsey, just to mention that the Atlanta  Federal Reserve did lower its first-quarter GDP forecast to four percent  from 5.4 percent, that was what it released last week.  The change in the  space of a week, what do you make of it?  BELL:  I mean, it was related to consumption and fixed investment.  So I  think consumption is still good at 3 percent, we saw 3.8 percent in the  fourth quarter, the consumer is very, very strong.  And 4 percent, let's be  honest, when was the last time we saw 4 percent GDP growth?  That's an  outstanding number.  And the Atlanta Fed has been pretty decent about their  -- with the accuracy for the initial estimate of GDP.</p><p> WOLF:  We should ring the bell if we have four percent GDP.</p><p> BELL:  Thank you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And we're getting that four percent in part because of the tax  reform.</p><p> WOLF:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.  See?  We all agree.</p><p> WOLF:  You got them two for two.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We all agree. </p><p> BELL:  You don't have to worry about that deficit if we get (INAUDIBLE)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Again, I worry -- I've said this repeatedly but like you saw all  the speculation going on in like Bitcoin in these assets, speculating with  these exchange rate of products on stable low volatility markets and you  get a snapback and you see what kind of risk people are taking.  I don't  think that this -- I mean, this clearly is not over with the loss on the  Futures this morning.</p><p> Coming up, losing Wynn, real estate and casino mogul Steve Wynn stepping  down from his own company after being accused of sexual misconduct  allegations.  What this means for the future of Wynn's global empire,  that's ahead.</p><p> (VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Roaring toward a new chapter in the American space race, Elon  Musk, Falcon Heavy makes history but he doesn't lose his sense of humor  while doing it.  We'll explain.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  Investors are strapping in for another busy day  in the market.  Take a look at the Dow Futures right now, 236-point gain on  the Dow Futures.  Volatility came back with a vengeance and the question  remains: How long will it last?  What kind of wild swings are we going to  see in the market and what kind of losses it shakes out?  And do some  people lose confidence in their trading ability?  Meantime, Steve Wynn now  resigning as Chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts.  Cheryl Casone has more  details -- Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  That's right.  Dagen, good morning.  Wynn Resorts says that Steve  Wynn's resignation is effective immediately, this comes after sexual  misconduct allegations against the Las Vegas billionaire.  A number of  women claimed that Wynn harassed or assaulted them.  One case led to $7.5  million settlement.  Wynn denies these allegations but looking at what's  happening in the premarket here, the stock is actually down almost 1-1/2  percent in the premarket.  Again, Steve Wynn, his resignation effective  immediately.  So, we're also watching shares of Snap this morning.  Get  this, the stock soaring in the premarket up 23 percent, almost 24 percent.   Well, there you go.  Now, it's 24 percent.  They reported better-than- expected quarterly results after the bell.  The stock's back above that  $17.00 IPO price for now.  Revenues soaring more than 70 percent from a  year ago.  That a sharp increase in daily active users.  </p><p> Also this morning, we're going to get earnings from Hasbro and Michael  Kors, 21st Century Fox, the parent company of the FBN reports after the  bell later today.  And we are going to hear from Tesla, Elon Musk's company  later today as well.  And a little flicking for higher revenue from rising  sales of their Model S, their Model X, and their Model 3 vehicles.  Tesla  shares, however, are having, of course of that earnings report, moving  lower in the premarket a little more than a quarter percent.  But let's  stay with Tesla and Elon Musk, he made some news by launching the world's  biggest rocket.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CROWD OF PEOPLE:  Three, two, one.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launched yesterday to the delight of  employees, space fans, of course.  The 230-foot rocket featured 27 engines,  three boosters.  It cost SpaceX about a billion dollars to build.  Now, two  reusable side boosters did come back to Earth, they landed at the same  time.  That was flawless.  Remember that saves your money in space travel.   Now, this is neat though, Dagen, a Tesla Roadster was hidden onboard.  It  served as a test payload and they put basically a space guy in the driver's  seat.  The pictures have been amazing.  That roadster has now exceeded  Mars' orbit, but loving the pictures from there.  And for any dame that may  take a closer look at the Roadster, they're going to find this on the  circuit board, quote, \"Made on Earth by humans.\"  So, we'll see if little  space travel guy makes some alien friends while he's out there.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love it.  </p><p> CASONE:  It was fun, right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I was a NASA nerd when I was growing up.  So, I love seeing  these pictures in school, and Lea was a pilot.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  This is one of those things that could have been like, massive  success or a massive scale and what a massive success it was.  I mean,  looking at the two boosters land that way was just spectacular.  And then - - I mean, really, that car is space trash, let's admit it.  But if it's the  first thing that we see just heading out into space like this, it's pretty  neat to see this car cruising around.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And also, just the fact that you have private industries  stepping up where the government has pulled away.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Well, that's just that.  It's just that it's the way  innovations do this.</p><p> WOLF:  You're the expert in this space.  I can just tell you, our pilots at  our drone company in Washington were so pumped.  It was like literally, you  know, we shut down for the, you know, the hour it was on.  I think they  were waiting for two hours as well.  But it was -- they were just so fired  up.</p><p> BELL:  I think watching the landing was so awesome, too.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes, it's one of those things where you just hold your breath.   And you're hoping that it's going to all workout.  But, you know, Dagen,  you make such a good point about how innovation has changed and how defense  used to lead innovation and now it's really industry that's leading  innovation.  And it's really, you know, it shows where our country can go  and where we can develop things in the future.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Inspiring kids everywhere, including Disney battling on a galaxy  far, far away to rocket to the Future, the earnings straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Disney CEO Bob Iger revealing the company's new ESPN streaming  service will launch later this spring as Disney reports its first-quarter  earnings.  Lauren Simonetti has all the details.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  What a report, Dagen.  So, OK, stronger-than-expected profits,  but taking a look here, you can see revenue $15.35 billion in the last  quarter that actually missed expectations.  And they did take a one-time  benefit related to the new tax law.  So, 1.6 billion there.  Nonetheless,  take a look at the share price reaction right now.  Shares are up to 2.2  percent at 108.50 in the premarket.  If you look at many of Disney's units  and we get revenue for these segments, you can see that their studio and  media units fell short of expectations, but they did see big strength in  the theme parks.  Goes to show you that customers are still willing to pay  sky-high prices for tickets.  By the way, we're going to find out of a  price increase for theme park tickets in the coming week.  You know, and  the higher hotel prices consumers are willing to spend this for  entertainment.  </p><p> Speaking of, struggling ESPN but we do have news for ESPN.  ESPN+, their  new streaming service, it's going to debut in the spring.  It's going to  cost $4.99 a month.  You can buy it as an add-on service and can be used  for the redesigned ESPN App.  It's basically going to give you live  programming that's not available on the current channels.  And then --</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KIT HARINGTON, ACTOR:  Reach out.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes, that's \"Game of Thrones\" from HBO.  And yes, the  masterminds behind that hit series are teaming up with Disney and  Lucasfilms to produce -- are you ready -- a new \"Star Wars\" series.  We  don't know how many movies or the release dates, but these are going to be  separate from the \"Star Wars\" the franchise that you've seen.  After two  iconic blockbusters getting together, this is -- this is good, this is good  stuff.  Disney also said that they have pre-ticket sales for one of their  new Marvel movies, Black Panthers, biggest they've ever seen for a  superhero franchise.  So, they're going all in on the -- on the movies and  the franchises.</p><p> BELL:  I think, this just goes to the quality of corporate earnings that  are coming out yesterday DowDuPont had a really solid report and now we're  seeing both of these stocks go up and on the day-to-day, the market is  down.  That's awesome.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes.  Good point.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what you want to say -- you want to say, individual  names trade on the underlying fundamentals whether it's strength in the  earnings, strength in the economy rather than like a washout.  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  A lot of people are saying, Steven Mnuchin, said yesterday the  fundamentals of the market are strong and that's what we are seeing in this  report from Disney.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  The members of the administration forced to talk about the  stock market because the President has been (INAUDIBLE) as essentially  bragging repeatedly about the stock market going up.  So, now you have  Mnuchin, even Vice President Pence for us to talk about it.  So, I haven't  mentioned your Patriots loss, but let me take a moment to mention that.   But are you excited about \"Game of Thrones\" mixed with \"Star Wars\"?  </p><p> WOLF:  I'm glad you shifted to \"Game of Thrones\".  I can't wait.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I didn't want to rub it in.</p><p> WOLF: I couldn't wait for \"Game of Thrones\".  I am so bummed it's the last  season.  But I can't wait for it to come on.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Can you explain to me, I know you're huge in to \"Star Wars\" OK,  you're into \"Game of Thrones\", what's the matchup of these going to look  like?</p><p> WOLF:  I don't know, maybe it's John Snow fighting Darth Vader.  I mean,  you know, who knows what's going to happen and since he comes back and who  knows, we could be --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Dragons in space.</p><p> WOLF:  We could have so many different things going on.  Maybe HBO mergers  with Disney and then it's the \"Game of (INAUDIBLE).\"  </p><p> SIMONETTI:  So, should Netflix be worried?  Because, you know, now this new  streaming service is coming out at some point that's going to be cheaper  than Netflix, and Disney has its amazing content and they pulled so much of  it from Netflix.  </p><p> WOLF:  You know, everyone has enough money, they're now -- they're all  fighting for content.  Hulu, Amazon, and I mean, it's going to be a very  interesting years to come on where we're watching.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think this ESPN+ is going to be really popular because of how  people can sort of pick and choose from the menu of what they want to see  and when they are picking sports.  They really want to be able to pick  their teams and watch their game.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I streamed the Super Bowl and --</p><p> WOLF:  You're really killing me right now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was crystal clear watching those Patriots lose, crystal.</p><p> WOLF:  You know, I'll take -- you know what, I'm going to take my five  Super Bowls and I'm OK with that.  So, I'm --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> GABRIELLE:  See, I've heard a lot of Patriots fans say that.  It's like,  you know what --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> WOLF:  No.  Listen, no question you want your team to win.  But do you want  your team in in this -- listen, I actually like the Eagles, too, I want to  Pen, but I'm a staunch Patriots guy and they just didn't -- they came up  short.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, they did.  Thank you, Lauren, Sir.  Disney not coming up  short.  Coming up, tougher sanctions yet.  That tough warning from Vice  President Mike Pence to North Korea if the country doesn't end its nuclear  ambitions.  And why Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg says  that the Vice President's personal role about social gatherings with women  and alcohol is a huge setback for all women in the workforce.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, February 7th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Another  wild day on Wall Street, the Dow swinging more than 1,000 points from the  lows to the highs in trading yesterday, the major market gauges finishing  the session in the green.  The Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ are all back in  positive territory for the year, but volatility still reigns supreme.   Despite that, the White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said  the administration is not worried.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The economy is  incredibly strong right now.  The President's focus continues to be on the  long-term economic fundamentals were infinitely better off today than where  we were before the President took office, particularly on the economy.  We  have historically low unemployment and we actually have increasing wages  for American workers.  There's nothing that's taken place over the last  couple of days in our economy that's fundamentally different than it was  two weeks ago.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But volatility still front and center this morning, stability,  hard to find, 210-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, losses across  the board there.  In Europe, we do have some gains to report in England,  France, and Germany, although slight, the biggest winner at the moment, in  percentage term, is the FTSE-100 in England.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets mostly lower, the Nikkei managing to eke out a  small gain, but the KOSPI in South Korea, losing more than two percent.   And a strong warning for North Korea, Vice President Mike Pence says that  the U.S. will impose the toughest ever sanctions on the country.  Those  details as he holds a bilateral meeting with Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo  Abe.  </p><p> Sheryl Sandberg calling for fairness when it comes to the personal role, in  which the vice president won't eat alone with a woman, other than his wife,  and won't attend events that have alcohol without her either.  Sandberg  says women's careers are ultimately hurt by this, her fix, coming up.</p><p> Plus, America's source of innovation, under fire over diversity of  opinions, we have new study showing how conservatives feel out-of-place in  Silicon Valley.  I think the headline there is that there are any  conservatives in Silicon Valley.  But now, to the latest on Wall Street,  Futures reporting to decline at the open, losses across the board, this  after swinging wildly between gains and losses yesterday.  Volatility also  hitting the bond market, yields today, take a look at where yields are,  2.77 on the 10-year.</p><p> We had the yield on the ten-year hit a four-year high of -- it was 2.85  percent -- north of 2.85 percent that was on Friday, but money has been  going back into bonds in the face of the stock volatility.  Joining me now,  Wells Fargo Investment Institution President, Darrell Cronk, Darrell, what  is your take on the climate of fixed income and stock markets and how they  match up with --</p><p> DARRELL CRONK, PRESIDENT, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTION:  That's a  good question, Dagen.  This recent correction, actually, had both  correlated where yields were rising as stocks were falling, which is  somewhat atypical.  We broke that a little bit.  I think the bond market --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Last couple of days.</p><p> CRONK:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You had money go -- you know, volatility push money into bonds - -</p><p> CRONK:  That's right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  which is, kind of, what you'd want to see.</p><p> CRONK:  Monday afternoon, late in the session.  I actually think the bond  market has handled this correction very well.  You haven't seen a spill  over into what we'd see as traditional safe haven so, commodities, the U.S.  dollar, yields, there's no gap out in high yields spreads.  So the lower  tear sections of the credit market have behaved very well, actually.  So  this is a lot like the equity markets catching a bad bout of this flu  that's going around.  But the flu hasn't been contagious to the other asset  classes yet.</p><p> BELL:  So how do you see tax reform playing into interest rates and  inflation?  I mean, the way that this tax reform is structured, it seems to  be supply-side, so in that way, companies are investing in CAPEX which will  help increase productivity so you won't -- shouldn't see that much  inflation that do you agree with that assessment?  How do you see that  playing out?</p><p> CRONK:  I absolutely agree with that, Lindsey.  I think inflation will  trend mildly higher and some wage inflation is a good thing.  Wage  inflation with productivity growth to your point is actually a good thing.   Wage inflation without productivity growth, where it just increases unit  labor costs and squeezes profit margins for companies, is a bad thing.  We  don't expect a lot of inflation to take higher, but mild inflation higher  is actually a very healthy thing.</p><p> WOLF:  So, Darrell, at what point do you think rates have to back up too to  see a shift from equities back to fixed income?</p><p> CRONK:  I think --</p><p> WOLF:  Three and a half, four?</p><p> CRONK:  Yes, I think three percent is a psychological level right now for  the markets, as it tries the equity markets, as they try and find their  base.  North of three and a quarter to three and a half, I think starts to  squeeze profit margins at that point.</p><p> WOLF:  But where do you see for your clients?  Where do you see money  actually shifting out of -- out of stocks into bonds, at that type of  level?</p><p> CRONK:  Yes, I think it -- at three and a quarter to three and a half, you  start to get the equity risk premium, to be more equal.  Today, it still  favors equities over fixed income right now.</p><p> WOLF:  So where's Wells projecting, kind of, 10-year rates, year-end 2018?</p><p> CRONK:  275.  We've got a range of 250 to 300, 275 with the midway.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  How is that possible with the economy growing as strongly as it  is, at least in -- because of tax reform and certainly in the first  quarter, but really the rest of the year that's what's expected.</p><p> CRONK:  Yes, I do think you will see stronger growth, we think 2.9, 3  percent GDP growth.  But when you look at the amount of supply issuance  that has to come on the market for treasuries, this has been the false  narrative (INAUDIBLE) forever which is, kind of, that higher growth has to  equal higher rates almost immediately.  And it may equal them in the  intermediate term, but in 2018, we don't see a big spike up in rates.</p><p> BELL:  So you will say invested in equities then --</p><p> CRONK:  Yes.</p><p> BEL:  for the remainder of the year and what sectors do you like?</p><p> CRONK:  Right now, we actually like financials, we like industrials, we  like consumer discretionary, and we actually like healthcare, so three of  those four, being more procyclical for better growth, better economic  environment.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And financials, just to name one, a benefit of deregulation  coming out of Washington.</p><p> CRONK:  Absolutely.  That's right, Dagen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to talk about what we've seen with the, kind of, bets  that were placed on stable markets, the bet against volatility over the  last couple of years?  And the losses that were abruptly and surprisingly  exposed just in the last couple of days.  </p><p> These two -- one, in particular, this XIV, it is a well-known product sold  by Credit Suisse, constructed by Credit Suisse that shut down yesterday  after it lost almost all of its money in trading.  It was really late  Monday, but again, when you have such loose monetary policy --</p><p> CRONK:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  money flooding the market anywhere and everywhere, you're just  beginning to see the overconfidence and the really -- the kinds of bets  that not just individuals took but institution investors.  And do you  expect -- because again, and I keep repeating this line, you find out who's  naked only when the tide goes out.</p><p> CRONK:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And do you worry that that kind of volatility in this kind of  law -- these losses could impact the stock markets and hold back the bull  market as it comes up on its ninth year anniversary?</p><p> CRONK:  Two points there, from the institutional side, you're exactly  right.  So, that's part of what we saw on Monday's action.  So you have  this -- it's a little complex but you have this risk parody and macro CTA  funds that when volatility is really low, their model suggests that they  overweight risk assets.  </p><p> And as soon as volatility spikes, those algorithms or that mass, and just  they have to sell those risk assets, which is why you saw flood in the  treasuries, Monday afternoon, and rates come back down.  To your second  point, the individual, when you see this kind of volatility, it can damage  psyche, right?  </p><p> So, the individual's -- you know, this year has been a narrative of two  months, right?  January was all about pro-tax reform's better growth.  We  walked in with the best earnings expectations for the whole year.  </p><p> Now, February has been all about -- well, wait a minute, what if the fed  goes too far, what if inflation becomes problematic, right?  And those two  narratives have to balance each other out over time.  And if the market,  even today, is still trying to figure out which one is going to play.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But you buy stocks here, is what you're saying?</p><p> CRONK:  We buy more of the January (INAUDIBLE) this point, than the  February.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What would change your mind?  Is there any kind of marker that  you're looking for?</p><p> CRONK:  Inflation.  Inflation is the primary marker.  So if you would see a  spike materially higher in inflation data, not just wage inflation but core  inflation as a whole.  And remember, the PCE that the fed uses, is still at  1-1/2 to 1.6 percent.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But I said -- I said this yesterday.  Maybe all of that cheap  money from Central Banks, once it winds up in the hands of individuals who  don't just buy risky assets with it, they actually start going out and  spending it.  That's when you need to start worrying.  </p><p> CRONK:  Absolutely.  Yes, that's true.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  When mom and dad and brother and sister out there in the country  --</p><p> CRONK:  But you don't see that in the consumption patterns quite yet,  right?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> CRONK:  I mean, yet.</p><p> WOLF:  Quick question.</p><p> CRONK:  Yes.</p><p> WOLF:  the volatility continues throughout '18?</p><p> CRONK:  Yes.  Well, certainly on a relative basis, from '17, right?</p><p> WOLF:  I've been told we're wrapping twice, though.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.  You said yes, but --</p><p> CRONK:  Yes, absolutely.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And you can't bet on stable markets at least in some of these  exchange trader products anymore.</p><p> CRONK:  And volatility is a healthy thing.  So, I think, we should welcome  on more normalized level of volatility, not the extreme low volatility we  had in 2016 and '17.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It has shaken some people out of this market, though.  Darrell,  thank you so much.</p><p> CRONK:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Sheryl Sandberg's knock against the Vice President,  why the Facebook Chief Operating Officer says Mike Pence's personal role  about social gatherings with alcohol and women, harms all women.  And  Silicon Valley's secret uncovered, a new survey details the climate for  conservatives in the tech business.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  Taking a quick look at Dow Futures  right now.  Meantime, Vice President Mike Pence -- you can take a look at  losses across the board, but you know what, well off their lows of the  morning so far, only 135-point loss on the Dow Futures.  I think it's safe  to say we should prepare ourselves for wild swings like we saw yesterday  where, again, the Dow ended the day up 567 points, but it was down more  than a thousand early on.  Still, we talked about Vice President Mike Pence  in Tokyo delivering a stern warning to North Korea.  Cheryl Casone has the  details, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  That's right, Dagen.  Vice President Pence continuing to put  pressure on North Korea.  On his way to the Winter Olympics in South Korea,  Pence stopped in Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.   Pence reiterated Washington's stance that all option are on the table to  deal with North Korea.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I'm announcing today that  the United States of America will soon unveil the toughest and most  aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea ever.  And we will  continue to isolate North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic  missile program once and for all.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  Well, Pence is set to leave the U.S. allegation to the opening  ceremonies on Friday.  Despite the tough rhetoric, he has stopped short of  ruling out a meeting with Senior North Korean officials while he is there.   Meanwhile, Kim Jong-un is sending his younger sister to South Korea for the  Winter Olympics.  This is the first time any member of the Kim family has  crossed the border.  30-year-old, Kim Yo-jong plans to attend the opening  ceremony on Friday.  She was blacklisted last year by the U.S. Treasury  Department over human rights abuses and censorship.  Well, Vice President  Pence won't be having dinner alone with Kim Yo-jong at the Olympics.  </p><p> He's got a personal rule that's kind of common among Evangelical.  It  doesn't allow him to be alone with women, and he has also said in the past  he won't attend an event if there is alcohol there without his wife by his  side.  Well, Sheryl Sandberg has picked up on this.  She thinks this role  hurts women's growth in the workplace because of missed opportunities to  network with men.  Sandberg is the COO of Facebook, and, of course, the co- founder of Leanin Organization.  Says that if men follow the so-called Mike  Pence rule, it should apply to everyone not just to women.  </p><p> With the flood of each revelations, a recent survey show that half of male  manager say they are uncomfortable participating in basic activities with  women, Dagen.  So, she's saying this is going to hurt it -- because you've  already got, frankly, women already isolated.  That is her point, in  corporate America.  Most male senior managers, CEO, are men.  So, if you're  going to get take away that opportunity, that one-on-one networking, then  if you can't go to lunch with the CEO as a woman, then nobody should go to  lunch with the CEO, men included -- make it a rule for everybody.  </p><p> BELL:  I mean, I think one of the unfortunate responses to the #metoo  movement has been that men do feel like they can't go to lunch with females  that they work with, and be a man to them, or things like that.  </p><p> CASONE:  That's what the survey sounds.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  You know, this is something that I saw in the post Tail Hook  Navy -- because I joined the Navy in 1993.  When I first entered -- and  that was right after a woman who had been chained to a year (INAUDIBLE)  Academy; tail hook it happened.  And there was sort of this, this fear from  men to get close to women, to spend time with women, to socialize with  women, and I do think that it is damaging to women when they want to move  up, and when they need mentors in any workplace whether it's corporate  America or military.  I think that that applies.  And I think this type of,  you know, putting this idea out, you know, certainly is understandable from  a Christian marriage perspective on wanting to sort of protect your  relationship.  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  But it is hurtful to people in the workplace.  And I see her  point, I see Sheryl Sandberg's point.</p><p> CASONE:  If that's Mike Pence's choice, that's one thing.  But to adopt  that rule, I think, across American culture, particularly in business, I  think is wrong.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes, I think I would like it as a wife, but as woman in the  workplace, I don't like it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you want to weigh in, because you ran -- I mean, you ran a  business. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I am completely supportive with Sheryl Sandberg's  perspective here.  You cannot, you know, have an environment where you say  you're comfortable with one sex and not the other in the workforce.  It  makes no sense at all.  And he should keep those type of use to himself.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's too late.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  You bet.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's a really interesting conversation, though.  Coming up,  creative, fun, closed minds?  The fired Google engineer who is suing the  company for allegedly discriminating against White male conservatives --  White conservative men, maybe onto something.  A revealing new look at how  some conservative employees in big tech, really feels, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  A new survey claims conservatives are feeling out of place in  Silicon Valley.  This comes after a former Google engineer sued the tech  giant for discrimination.  Joining me now is Garrett Johnson, Lincoln  Network Co-Founder, and Executive Director.  Garrett, your company put  together this survey.  Tell us about it, what did you find?</p><p> GARRETT JOHNSON, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LINCOLN NETWORK:  Good  morning.  So, we put this survey together in response to all of the inbound  questions we get from journalist.  When a James Damore issue becomes a  national conversation, we get inbound, myself and Aaron Ginn, my co- founder, are things as bad as everyone says they are; what's the ground  level of truth.  Unfortunately, there was no data.  You have lots of  companies who report data on diverse issues as they relate to gender,  ethnicity, sexual orientation, but not viewpoint diversity.  So, this is  the first data that we know of on this issue.  And there's assumptions that  things are bad for people who are on the right of center spectrum  conservatives, libertarians.  But this data suggests that it is indeed the  case, and is probably worse than anyone thought.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Bad, how?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I was going to ask a question as well, when you  say bias against, what actually are you meaning?  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes, so, in addition to the raw data that we collected from a  little under 400 people, we also collected comments -- people open in the  comments.  We have 23 longer form conversations.  People -- one person said  that he was targeted by his manager because he was a delegate to the  Republican convention.  The manager tried to get him fired.  He recorded  some conversations, you know, behind the manager's back, and was able to  take that to be peace within the country, and save his job.  But the  manager was not fired; there was no repercussions.  You have some people,  you know, who say that, you know, they avoid at going to work the day after  the election because they knew the anti-Trump sentiment would be so strong  and obnoxious that they just didn't want to tolerate it.  So, just  generally, either targeting, feeling comfortable at work, there is this  notion within Silicon Valley -- SalesForce, Google -- that you should bring  your whole self to work.  Well, that's not really the case if you think a  certain way.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Do you think that's really unique to Silicon Valley, though?   When you talk about, like, the post-election sentiment and how they felt?   It seems like that might something that's broader than just looking at  Silicon Valley.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  I think that's right.  I think that Silicon Valley is consistent  with trends throughout the country, but you have to think about the echo  chambers that these tech companies have created with their technology.  You  know, they have enhanced the tribalization of our country with the  platforms that they've created.  And, you know, technology is most consumed  in tech hubs like Silicon Valley.  So, you know, you had your echo chamber,  you live in this bubble, and so it's more intense.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just wonder as they -- as the employee base at Silicon Valley  ages, is this going to change, which is something that Robert brought up?   Because people tend to get more conservative as they get older.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  I think it might.  You know, that's not data that we collected.   This was a pilot survey.  So, it only focused on Silicon Valley.  We're  going to be doing one later this year that will touch other tech hubs and  hopefully capture that data.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Garrett, good to see you.  Thank you so much, Garrett Johnson.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Still ahead, the very latest as investors hang on for another  wild ride in these markets in the next hour with MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, February 7th.</p><p> Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Volatility slamming Wall Street -- investors in for a wild ride yesterday.   The Dow did finish up 567 points but it was down -- there was about a  1,200-point range during the same trading day.</p><p> As of yesterday's close, all three major market gauges are back in positive  territory for the year but not the Dow Transports and not small cap stocks,  we should point out.</p><p> Let's take a look at the futures.  We're showing losses across the board  but they are mild compared to what we saw just one hour ago.  The Dow  futures were down more than 200 points.</p><p> Again, what does this volatility do to shake out the speculators who had  piled into the market and played some wonky bets in the last couple of  years?</p><p> The Atlanta Federal Reserve meantime has lowered its first quarter GDP  forecast.  We're talking about that 5.4 percent last week.  Now Atlanta Fed  thinks the economy is just going to grow at 4 percent -- still high.</p><p> In Europe stocks are moving higher but they're warm, shall we say.  We have  gains across the board.  FTSE 100 up almost 1 percent.  </p><p> In Asia overnight, stocks mostly lower.  The Kospi the worst performer down  there in South Korea -- or over there in South Korea down more than 2  percent.</p><p> Budget battle looming -- lawmakers have until tomorrow night to reach an  agreement to keep the federal government running.  So the House passes a  stopgap spending bill, the fight turns to the Senate where immigration  remains a top issue.</p><p> Speaker of the House Paul Ryan weighed in on the possibility of a shutdown.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  The only reason we do not  have a full budget agreement is because Democrats continue to hold funding  for our government hostage on an unrelated issue.  They must stop using our  troops as pawns in a game of politics.</p><p> I urge the Senate Democrats to stop their filibuster and provide our men  and women in uniform the resources that they need, the support that they  need.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The immigration debate is in full swing amid tragedy in Indiana.   The latest as the illegal immigrant suspected of killing Indianapolis Colts  linebacker Edwin Jackson is charged.</p><p> Plus, a bushel of headlines for Apple as the company says it could offer  rebate for customers who paid full price for battery replacement.  The tech  giant may team with Goldman Sachs to help shoppers finance their phone.   More details on that ahead.</p><p> And is the crypto crash fully upon us?  Why one firm is warning that the  days are numbered for several digital currencies.</p><p> And here with me to break it all down this morning:  Fox News correspondent  Lea Gabrielle; Fox News contributor, 32 Advisers founder and CEO and former  economic adviser to President Obama, he also ran a giant Wall Street bank,  Robert Wolf; and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.</p><p> You'd still be long stocks here though, wouldn't you?  You worry about  interest rates, inflation, deficits, debt -- but not yet.  </p><p> ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I missed the whole run.  But if I was  going to make a bet, I would bet stocks do better for the, you know, first  half of '18.  But then I would be nervous to the back half.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, but you didn't think even that Congress was going to get  tax reform done.  You talked about that all year long last year.  You  didn't think they would be able to come together to get it done.  </p><p> WOLF:  I've been wrong once in the last 30 years.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You were wrong about the Patriots, too at the Super Bowl.  </p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Ouch.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm just kidding.  But again, short run -- you worry longer run.  </p><p> WOLF:  I worry longer run because I think back-up rates will shift assets.   And then we're going to have a back-up of rates because we're going to have  growth.  We're going to have some wage inflation.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So we will talk about that as the morning rolls on.  We have  incredible guests coming up.  White House director of legislative affairs  Marc Short is here, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy, former chief of staff  under President Bush 43 and Business Roundtable president and CEO Josh  Bolton, and Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano, and  the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO\" Stuart Varney.</p><p> You don't want to miss it.</p><p> But first taking a look at futures this morning, we have losses across the  board but really off the lows of the morning -- the Dow futures down just  46 points.  Stocks rebounding yesterday after the biggest sell-off in more  than six years during a volatile session on Monday.  The Dow finishing the  day up 200, 2.3 percent higher; that was a gain of 567 points.</p><p> Joining us now to weigh in, New York Congresswoman Claudia Tenney and New  York Congressman Tom Suozzi.  Good to see you both.  Congresswoman Tenney - - </p><p> REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK:  Yes.  Suozzi.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Suozzi -- I said it right, didn't I Congressman?  </p><p> REP. TOM SUOZZI (D), NEW YORK:  It was close.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But Congresswoman Tenney -- your reaction on these markets  because I would argue that the President of your party has put you in a  tough bind where now you're going to get asked about the stock market.  </p><p> TENNEY:  I don't think so.  I mean to be honest with you, the stock market  is not the only determination of what's going on in the marketplace.  I, in  fact, sold a bunch of things last week because I had some things to pay  off.  So after Christmas and all those good things I sold some stuff.</p><p> So I think what you had yesterday was a bargain hunter's market.  And  people around -- all of a sudden the stocks rebounded.  I think when you  look at the interest rates, a little bit of adjustment in the interest  rates with a new fed chairman.  I think that makes a difference.  The  growth from the tax cuts and jobs act they're certainly important.</p><p> And I might cite an industry, the tax foundation has stated that New York  is going to be one of the biggest growth states because of the tax cuts and  jobs act.  So I think it's really interesting to see how this plays out  over the next few months.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman Suozzi -- do you agree with your fellow congressman  from the state of New York, but also have you been hearing from any of your  constituents, given just what happened in the market the last few days or  really in the last week or so?  </p><p> SUOZZI:  You know, people are worried about the effect of the tax plan,  because in my part of the state we're going to be hit very hard by the  elimination of the state and local tax deduction and the tax plan actually  increased the deficit significantly by about $1.5 trillion.</p><p> In addition, there's talk of a new infrastructure plan which will increase  the debt even further.  There's this plan of the CR that's going to be will  be coming up that will increase the debt even further.</p><p> All these things together increase the debt that may have an impact on  actually stimulating the economy in a way but it will cause interest rates  to go up.  When interest rates go up, our debt service goes up because of  our huge deficits in the federal government.  That could be what's scaring  the marketplace.</p><p> So right now, deficits are a big concern to the marketplace.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, Congressman Suozzi, were you worried about the debt  doubling under President Obama?  Was that a concern for you?  Were you  worried about it then?  That was over eight years.  </p><p> SUOZZI:  Actually I was in the private sector at the time.  I wasn't paying  quite as close attention at the time but the reality was is that the debt  that doubled during that time was because of the stimulus package, to try  and actually to force the economy to grow.</p><p> The economy has been growing since President Obama's administration and now  it's the Trump administration.  It's been growing, growing, growing,  growing.  And the concern is that by adding debt at this time, we're going  to hyper-inflate the market and get it moving too frothy and that scares  people that our deficits are going to grow and that's why we're seeing this  volatility in the marketplace right now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That also falls on members of Congress not in te3rms of cutting  spending.  And I want to point out that the House did pass another stopgap  spending bill yesterday.  It funds the government through March 23rd and  now goes to the senate.</p><p> Leaders there are really -- there's some issue with the defense part of the  stopgap that was passed by the House, what happens with that vote.  But the  Senate is working on a longer two-year budget deal.</p><p> President Trump is throwing an immigration grenade into the budget talks,  saying he's prepared to shut down the government if Congress doesn't pass  border security measures.  </p><p> Listen to this and I'll get your reaction.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  If we don't change the legislation, if we don't get rid of these  loopholes where killers are allowed to come in to our country and continue  to kill, gang members -- and we're just talking about MS-13. There are many  gang members that we don't even mention.</p><p> If we don't change it, let's have a shutdown.  We'll do a shutdown.  We  have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want safety -- and  unrelated but still related, they don't want to take care of our military.   Then shut it down.  We'll go with another shutdown.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman Tenney, is that helpful?  </p><p> TENNEY:  Let me first say something about Mr. Suozzi's comments.  First of  all, Democrats have no other issues to run and all of a sudden their new- found deficit hawks.  They care a lot about the deficit and the debt which  they never cared about before.  </p><p> And they cared about huge, you know, trillion-dollars in stimulus before  that didn't spur the economy to the levels of growth that we're expecting  to see just in one year of rolling back regulations, cutting taxes.  And  now we're predicting even bigger growth in spite of what the stock market's  fluctuation.</p><p> So I just say that I would not give credit to President Obama for this.  I  think this is clearly the enthusiasm from businesses knowing they're not  going to get sucker-punched by government and officials on the federal and  hopefully not the state side.  So Tom and I know what it's like to live and  work in New York State.</p><p> But on the President's side, I mean the President's a negotiator.  He wants  us to act on this.  He had a very, very generous offer during the State of  the Union on immigration which really shouldn't be impacting what we're  doing with the continuing resolution.</p><p> And I'm concerned about our military.  My son's an active duty Marine.  We  are giving less predictable funding to our military which puts them at risk  and also puts our country's security at risk.  So I'm concerned about that.</p><p> But as far as the immigration package, really what the President has  offered are very similar to things that Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi --  maybe not Nancy Pelosi -- maybe Senator Feinstein have voted on many times  in the past and they've supported, not just voted on but supported as well.</p><p> And so I think that those are things we've got to look to.  I think -- you  know, we have time with DACA.  I think let's sit down in a bipartisan way  and come up with a solution.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what's going on with the top senators pursuing the  two-year budget deal, separating for now stalled immigration fight and  actually increasing spending, Congressman Suozzi, $80 billion a year in  Defense and also on the non-Defense side as well which is what the  Democrats have pushed for, $63 billion.</p><p> So that's an increase of $143 billion a year in spending on Defense and  non-Defense.  If you're worried about the debt and deficits, Congressman  Suozzi, how do you get behind that?  </p><p> SUOZZI:  Yes.  That's something I'm thinking about right now.  You know,  I'm very interested in us working together to try and come up with a plan  to actually keep the government moving forward.  People that are concerned  about Defense and the military; Secretary Mattis was just testifying in our  committee yesterday and talking about how dangerous these continuing  resolutions are and we need long-term spending plans to help our military  and to help every single department that we have throughout the federal  government.</p><p> So I'm interested in a bipartisan plan.  But I'm also concerned about the  fact that we're increasing the deficit.  And you know, talk about new-found  Democrats, Republicans -- we're all in this together, ok.  Republicans and  Democrats, different people from each party have paid attention to deficits  for a long time.  Other people have not paid attention to it.</p><p> I'm concerned that as we increase the deficit, we're going to see an impact  on our interest rates and that's going to cause even more debt for the  federal government.</p><p> I work in a group called the Problem Solvers' Caucus.  I'm the vice  chairman.  That's 24 Democrats, 24 Republicans.  We have talked over and  over again about how we want to have plans working together but increasing  the deficit is one of the worst things we can do.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But how does it help with Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman  calling thousand-dollar bonuses \"pathetic crumbs\".  Do you think $1,000 to  one of your constituents, Congressman is crumbs?  </p><p> SUOZZI:  I absolutely don't think that's the case.  And I think that the  idea was that it was a small percentage was going to lower income people.   But in America there's 105 million full-time jobs; 59 million people make  less than $50,000 a year.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.</p><p> SUOZZI:  86 million people make less than $75,000 a year so $1,000 is a big  impact on a lot of families especially these folks that are making $50,000  a year, $75,000 a year.  </p><p> TENNEY:  I agree.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I've said it -- I was -- you know, I'm the child of small  business owners who were never helped by the government.  And to say $1,000  which where I grew up can feed a family of four for a month, I just found  that to be just completely deaf.</p><p> But I want to move on, Congresswoman Tenney, to President Trump facing some  backlash over what the White House says was a joke he made on Monday.  The  President was slamming Democrats for not standing and applauding during his  first state of the union address.  So watch this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  They were like deaf and un-American, un-American.  Somebody said  treasonous, I mean -- yes, I guess why not.  Can we call that treason?  Why  not?  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I know what treason is because Maria Bartiromo gave me a  pocket constitution for Christmas.</p><p> TENNEY:  Oh, good.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And it's Article 3, Section 3 of our constitution.  So the  definition of treason is very specific.  But you said, Congresswoman Tenney  that Democrats might not be treasonous but they're un-American and don't  love our country.  Do you still stand by that?</p><p> TENNEY:  Yes.  That's not what I said.  What I said was them not standing  for families who had their children murdered by MS-13, not standing for our  flag, not standing for God, not standing for all the things that we stand  for as Americans, yes I think the President has a point there.</p><p> I certainly don't support that he said treasonous.  I think he said it as a  joke.  But now, you know, the Democrats are out trying to raise money,  claiming I said Democrats are un-American.  Of course that's not true.   Many of my supporters are Democrats.</p><p> And the issue is this.  Why wouldn't they stand for things that were common  sense?  I know a lot of Republicans -- I looked back and looked the old  reels of Obama's state of the union addresses.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> TENNEY:  And when things he talked about Americanism and unity between us,  the Republicans stood on their feet and clapped for that.  There were real  easy chances for the Democrats to stand and I'm sure Mr. Suozzi would have  liked to stand if Nancy Pelosi would let them.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Mr. Suozzi -- you get about 10 seconds to respond.  So quickly.  </p><p> TENNEY:  People are sick and tired of the politics back and forth.  They  want us to get things done.  Democrats, Republicans -- forget it.  We're  Americans.  We need to work together and solve problems.  People are sick  of all this personal stuff.</p><p> TENNEY:  I agree.</p><p> SUOZZI:  All this talk about treason, talking about shutting down  government, it's irresponsible.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Tenney, Suozzi -- Congressmen both, thank you.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Investors bracing for another crazy ride on Wall Street.  Take a  look at the futures right now.  92 point loss on the Dow futures.  Listen,  the futures were off by more than 200 points early in the session.  Again,  a return to volatility in this market where the markets had been so stable,  very few wild swings -- the Dow was up for 10 months in a row, including  January.  That's the longest run since the late 50s.  So again, we've been  on a rocket ship high.</p><p> Meantime a powerful winter storm pounding about 20 states.  Cheryl Casone  has the details -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.   A massive storm actually --  Dagen.</p><p> It's moving from Texas to Maine.  It's going to bring heavy snow to New  England, a mix of snow and freezing rain to the northeast and the mid- Atlantic regions, and ice and rain to the Midwest and the southeast.</p><p> According to FlightAware about 800 flights have been canceled so far today,  more than 100 of them at Newark Liberty International Airport here in the  New York area.</p><p> Well, the illegal immigrant suspected of killing Indianapolis Colts player  Edwin Jackson while driving drunk now faces federal immigration charges.   Manuel Orrego Savala charged with illegally re-entering the United States  for a second time after he was deported in 2007 and 2009.</p><p> Police say Jackson, who was 26 years old, as well as 54-year-old Jeffrey  Monroe, an Uber driver, died early Sunday morning as they were standing on  the side of I-70 in Indiana.</p><p> Orrego-Savala is due in court today in connection with that highway crash.   Orrego Savala is not the only illegal immigrant who keeps coming back to  the U.S., by the way.  The \"Washington Times\" reports that one Mexican has  managed to get deported 44 times in 15 years.  Of course, he has also  managed to sneak back across the border at least that many times.  The  runner up was ousted 40 times from the United States between 2001 to 2015 - - Dagen.  A lot of crossings.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p> Coming up, fake dirt for the dossier -- new details on the Clinton  associate who may have said allegations to the author of the anti-Trump  dossier.</p><p> And banking on Apple -- how Goldman Sachs reportedly wants to cash in on  expensive iPhones.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p> New revelations this morning about that anti-Trump dossier.  According to  South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy, a Clinton family confidant may have  played a key role in feeding information to Christopher Steele.   Christopher Steele being the former British spy who compiled the document  in the weeks leading up to the election.</p><p> Here's what Congressman Gowdy told Martha MacCallum last night on \"THE  STORY\".</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  When you hear who the source or one  of the sources of that information is, you're going to think oh my gosh,  I've heard that name somewhere before.  Where could it possibly have been?  </p><p> MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS HOST:  The foreign source? </p><p> GOWDY:  The domestic source.  And I'm trying to think how Secretary Clinton  defined him.  I think she said he was an old friend who e-mailed her from  time to time.  </p><p> MACCALLUM:  Sidney Blumenthal?  </p><p> GOWDY:  That would be really warm.  You're warm.  Yes.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us this morning is Fox News senior judicial analyst  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Lay it out for us.</p><p> JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  My thoughts --  my thought is that Trey Gowdy is basically a very decent, honest guy.  But  you cannot look at raw intelligence because you have a top secret security  clearance because you're a member of the House Intelligence Committee and  selectively release parts of it and retain parts of it to produce a  political narrative which is basically what he was doing with Martha.</p><p> Now, Martha did an absolute A plus, 2.0 job of interviewing him.  But he is  not taking seriously his top secret security clearance if he thinks he can  selectively release things.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What about what he disclosed because we know from the -- Senator  Chuck Grassley released an unclassified version of this recent letter that  he sent to the Justice Department, in part urging criminal investigation  into Christopher Steele for lying to the FBI.</p><p> But it also revealed additional information that was provided to Steele.   And we knew that ultimately it went to him initially because from a friend  of the Clintons.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm also a fan and a friend of Chuck Grassley.  But here is  why Christopher Steele will never, take it to the bank, be prosecuted  because Christopher Steele was an FBI asset for many years, perhaps while  he was also an MI-6 agent.</p><p> So think about this.  You have a British spy who is also spying for the  Americans.  What do the British call that -- espionage.  The last thing  they want is to put him in a criminal courtroom where he'll say here's what  the Americans told me.  Here's what the British told me.  Here's what I  told the Americans.  Here's what I told the British.</p><p> We have a group called The Five Eyes, E-Y-E-S.  He knows this.  Countries  in the world that we regularly exchange intel with and they're our friends  -- Great Britain, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and the United States.  In  return for that, we have an agreement.  We will not solicit or recruit  agents from one of the others.</p><p> Guess what the FBI did -- recruited Chris Steele.  That violated the  agreement and exposed Chris Steele to criminal prosecution.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But to get back to the dossier.  This dossier based on the memo  that we've seen that was released by Devin Nunes, based on additional  information from the likes of Senator Chuck Grassley, it was funded -- the  dossier was funded by the Democrats. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was -- there was -- Chris Christie was being fed information  by at least one Clinton associate.  And it was used to get a warrant  through the FISA court on an American citizen.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I am going to withhold judgment on that until I see, if I ever  see it because it shouldn't come out, but maybe it will -- everything that  was presented to the FISA court.</p><p> Now, the FISA court is a weird court.  They meet in secret.  The judges are  not allowed to take any notes or pens or papers out of the building or  bring anything into the building.  And there's no adversary</p><p> You introduce a document into a real court, somebody else is going to  challenge that document.  In FISA it's only the government lawyers.  It's  up to the judge to challenge the document.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think the question is how much it was actually -- whether  that was a point of reference or one of many points of reference.  Because  I think, you know, as former clandestine case officer, working for --  trained by the CIA, I can tell you that when you put together a dossier of  this form that is essentially opposition research, you cannot call this  intelligence.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  This is opposition research.  So it depends on what else was  presented to the FISA court.  We don't know that.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Bobby and I were talking about this during the break.</p><p> WOLF:  I'm going to give you a soft ball but I want -- but I think it's  important for the viewers to hear it.  One, do you think the Nunes memo  should have been released?  Now, do you think the Democratic memo should be  released?  And do you think, you know, this opens a whole Pandora's Box for  future memos?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes to all of the above.  Once the Nunes memo came out.</p><p> WOLF:  Do you think that should have been released?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, if it hadn't been released, we wouldn't be going down  this warren hole.  But once it came out, you have a Republican version,  four-page summary version of hundreds of pages of intel, some of which Trey  Gowdy teased Martha MacCallum about.</p><p> Now you're going to have a Democratic version, it's going to come to the  opposite conclusion.  The American people are not children.  We now should  be entitled to see all the raw intel.  The intelligence committee would go  through the roof, you know this, if that raw intel is revealed.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But to many people it looks like abuse of power by the FBI -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Abuse of power by the Justice Department.  And I want to point  out -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It shouldn't be a surprise that they abused power.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I know but we're disgusted by it.  And we are surprised.</p><p> And we found out this morning -- this is more breaking news this morning.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Go ahead.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The FBI texting saga continues.  Fox News has new information  after reviewing thousands of previously unseen text between Peter Strzok,  the FBI agent and his then-mistress, Lisa Page.</p><p> In one message from 2015, Strzok then said about people who voted against  FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe's wife in the Virginia state senate race  calling them, quote, \"ignorant hillbillies\".  I'm from that state -- thank  you.</p><p> In another text, Page told Strzok -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Lord, have mercy on him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  In September of 2016 that, quote, \"POTUS wants to know  everything that we're doing\".  Senate investigators told Fox News -- and  that's POTUS, President Obama -- told Fox News that the last message is  raising questions about President Obama's personal involvement in the  Clinton e-mail investigation -- Judge.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There are about 8,000 FBI agents and we're going through the  text of two of them.  I'm going to tell you the 7,998 are not very happy  about this.  They have very, very strong political opinions.  They're  entitled to those political opinions.  They've say said things about groups  of people because of their origin, which is dumb.  But they're entitled to  be dumb.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But Peter Strzok was somebody who worked on the Clinton  investigation -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct -- so let me finish.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- and then worked on the Mueller team until he got kicked to  human resources because Mueller found out about it.  </p><p> WOLF:  Also Dagen -- and also brought back the Comey, Clinton investigation  that he was part of that the Democrats were not happy with. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So look, if -- </p><p> WOLF:  I mean there's a lot of he said-she said -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Final word.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  If a strong political opinion animates a law enforcement  decision; if decisions are made for political not bona fide law enforcement  reasons -- that is wrong and it can constitute misconduct in office.  But  words alone don't constitute misconduct in office.</p><p> MCDOWELL: And I just wonder if we'll ever get to the bottom of this.  And  I'm glad you're here.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's a -- </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p> I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p> It's Wednesday, February 7th; your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> (INAUDIBLE) on Wall Street, the Dow swinging more than a thousand points  from the lows to the highs of the day yesterday, adding 567 points, the  major market gauges (ph) finishing the session in the green and the Dow,  S&amp;P, and NASDAQ, are all back in positive territory for the year.</p><p> Despite the volatility, Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin isn't worried.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, SECRETARY, US TREASURY:  The stock market is up  significantly over 30 percent since President Trump was elected.</p><p> We're monitoring the stock markets.  They're functioning very well and we  continue to believe in the long-term impact of the stock market.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Checking on the action this morning we have an eighty-three- point loss on the Dow Futures but they were down more than 200 points when  we started this show at 6:00 a.m. Eastern; we have losses on the S&amp;P and  NASDAQ as well.</p><p> In Europe we have some buying to report, in England, France, and Germany.   Take a look at the green across the screen, the FTSE 100 now up more than  one percent.</p><p> But in Asia overnight markets mostly lower, there the KOSPI in South Korea  shedding more than two percent.</p><p> And we're watching Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin rebounding this  morning but one Wall Street firm warning that cryptocurrencies will crash,  to zero, more on that ahead.</p><p> And Goldman Sachs taking another bet on the consumer, the bank is said to  be looking to finance iPhones.  It comes some iPhone users may be getting a  rebate on replacement batteries.</p><p> And 'Gronk' robbed, we have the 911 call that the star Tight End hopes will  catch the suspect who broke into his home during the Super Bowl.</p><p> But now to the latest on Wall Street, volatile swings slamming stocks  yesterday, also on Monday, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee  Sanders weighing in on that wild ride, from Capitol Hill.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, PRESS SECRETARY, WHITE HOUSE:  Look, the economy is  incredibly strong right now.</p><p> The president's focus continues to be on the long-term economic  fundamentals which like I just said are very strong in this country.</p><p> We're infinitely better off today than where we were before the president  took office particularly on the economy, we have historically low  unemployment, and we actually have increasing wages for American workers.</p><p> There's nothing that's taken place over the last couple of days in our  economy that's fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This morning we have losses to report, 88-point loss on the Dow  Futures, 86-point loss there but again off the lows of the morning.</p><p> Joining me now is White House Director of Legislative Affairs, Marc Short.</p><p> Marc the president because he retweeted and talked about the record- breaking run in the stock market so much has put all of you folks working  at the White House in a pickle in the sense that you've now -- forced to  talk about the stock market, when in past administrations you could talk  about the economy but generally stayed away from those kind of day-to-day,  week-to-week, month-to-month, swings in stocks?</p><p> MARC SHORT, DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS, WHITE HOUSE &amp; ASSISTANT TO  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  Well, I guess the way we look at it is the markets  are up over 30 percent as you heard secretary Mnuchin say, since election  day, over $7 trillion in asset value, added to individuals' portfolios  since election day.</p><p> The reality is unemployment is at a 17-year low, the economy is growing  strong and in fact the Atlanta Fed estimated a 5.4 percent on GDP, that  sort of growth triggers inflation expectations.</p><p> And I think what you're seeing is simply a reaction from the market to  those expectations of higher inflation.</p><p> But that's not necessarily a bad thing when you consider that wage - wages  have been stuck and stagnant for so long particularly throughout the Obama  years and people are actually seeing higher wages today, and so there's  just a market recalibration going.</p><p> But as Sarah said from the podium, the fundamentals of the economy remain,  strong.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'll -- I'll just point out, the Atlanta Fed adjusted that  growth expectation down to four percent, that's still a very strong growth  number -</p><p> SHORT:  Yes -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - but do you -</p><p> SHORT:  - Dagen we -- during the Obama years it averaged 1.8 percent GDP  growth.  I think we'll take a four percent growth, we'd be pretty excited -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - That's a -</p><p> SHORT:  - about that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - that's a one quarter, people - now listen, some people are  calling for four percent growth for the whole year, Jamie Dimon has said  that to Maria Bartiromo.</p><p> But are you going to try and back away from talking about the stock market?</p><p> Have you had any discussions with the president about, 'let's stick to the  economy, let's stick to the wage growth, let's stick to how people feel at  home and their pocketbooks being more full because of the tax reform,'  rather than talking about a market that could be in for greater swings,  certainly in the coming years than we've seen, this very low volatility  environment the last couple of years?</p><p> SHORT:  Sure.  I think that's fair.</p><p> You would expect higher volatility throughout this year but at the same  time I think the president's proud of the gains in the turnaround in the  market, just as he's excited about the turnaround for mainstream Americans  too when they see 4.1 percent unemployment at a 17-year low, when they see  the economy growing, the last couple quarters averaging three percent, as I  said significantly better than 1.8 percent they experienced during eight  years of the Obama administration.</p><p> I think he's going to - he's going to tout although successes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  There was some heavy - we're - we've been talking about  volatility and that just means swings but a lot of investors, even retail  investors have been betting on stable markets or betting against  volatility, the last couple of years, and with some of these exchange- traded products, there were couple of major ones, one run by Credit Suisse  that shut down on Tuesday because essentially all the money in them, a few  billion dollars, was wiped out late on Monday.</p><p> It kind of begs the question of, how are retail investors you know, did  they know what was going on, how were these things allowed to exist if they  were so volatile, is that something that you think that securities  regulators should look at?</p><p> SHORT:  I think that the president has a great team and Treasury and the  SEC that look at that.  I'm not expect - I'm not expecting any sort of  legislation on that front which is more my focus area -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> SHORT:  - Dagen, so I think that sure, there is a continued oversight of  that.</p><p> But if there's a greater volatility this year I think the reality is that  the fundamentals remain strong, the president has continued to roll back  the regulatory front, he's going to continue to make sure that there's tax  relief provided to the American people and we hope that the economy  continues to grow the way it has been.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well let's talk about Capitol Hill because there is a budget  battle to talk about, a government that -- if they can't come to some  agreement is going to shut down at midnight on Friday morning.</p><p> The House did approve another stop-gap spending bill yesterday --</p><p> SHORT:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:   -- the Senate looking to strike a longer-term deal -</p><p> SHORT:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - boosting spending for both domestic and military programs but  branching away from Immigration efforts so trying to separate that  Immigration fight from a funding bill.</p><p> President Trump reasserted his focus on Immigration, saying this at the  White House yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  If we don't  change it, let's have a shutdown; we'll do a shutdown and it's worth it for  country.</p><p> I'd love to see a shutdown, if we don't get this stuff taken care of.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What do you expect the budget outcome to be Marc and will the  president - would he - would he get behind this spending bill that's being  put together -</p><p> SHORT:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - in the Senate, if it separates Immigration from it?</p><p> SHORT:  So, it's a good question, there are couple things there.</p><p> One, keep in mind the president campaigned on rebuilding our military; the  budget cap deal that we expect to be announced perhaps as soon as today, I  think will provide the deliverance on the president's commitment to rebuild  our military, you'll see significant reinvestment there.</p><p> And I think that's one of the priorities that he set.</p><p> I do not expect a shutdown right now.</p><p> I think what the president is looking ahead to is the budget cap deal put  in place, higher caps on Defense spending that allows the appropriators to  then go write the bill that will come to the president's desk probably at  the end of March, on spending for 2018.</p><p> What he's saying once again is the same pledge he's made all along, which  is, he is expecting Congress to deliver on the promises we made on the  campaign that we would invest in border security and he's - he's going to  hold Congress' 'feet to the fire' on that and if they're not going to  deliver on that border security, he's saying, he's OK taking that extra  step.</p><p> But we're not expecting a shutdown this week, we are expecting a budget cap  deal to be in place and we're expecting it to be a victory on the  president's commitment to rebuild our military.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'll - I'll say that the Senate deal, the two-year budget deal  that's been pursued by senators, it actually, military spending comes in at  629 billion a year which is above the amount that the president sought in  his budget proposal to Congress last year.</p><p> It also increases Non-Defense spending so combined, 80 billion extra for  Defense, 63 billion extra for Non-Defense, that comes in at a hundred and  forty-three billion.</p><p> If somebody is worried about debt, deficits, and higher inflation, are you  OK with that?</p><p> SHORT:  I think that there is - there are concerns about the deficit  spending on this front.</p><p> Let me go back to the premise of your question, that was that, is that  secretary Mattis also said to Congress that he wants to see the numbers  stick to the NDA level, the National Defense Authorization Act that had it  at the six twenty-nine number plus 71 billion in overseas contingency  operations to bring it up to about 700 billion for the year.</p><p> So that is the number that the secretary had asked -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.</p><p> SHORT:  - for.</p><p> But I think that regarding the deficits, keep in mind that you'll see the  president put forward a budget that will cut spending when it comes forward  next week.</p><p> The challenge will be though, is just like last year, the president put  forward a budget that balanced in 10 years and yet Congress then summarily  dismissed it.</p><p> So, we do have serious concerns about the deficits and we do think that  Congress should do a stronger job of being responsible to taxpayers in- clearing those deficits.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Real quick Marc, are we going to get some big infrastructure  announcement on Monday?</p><p> SHORT:  You're going to see the Infrastructure announcement rolled out and  we're expecting it on Monday.</p><p> The president spoke about it some, at the State of the Union and we do  expect that you'll see greater details of those plans coming forward on  Monday.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Marc, good to see you.</p><p> We covered -</p><p> SHORT:  Thanks for having -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - a lot -</p><p> SHORT:  - me on.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - of ground - Thank you so much.</p><p> Marc Short, from the White House.</p><p> Coming up, a Super Bowl title, not the only thing Rob Gronkowski was robbed  of, you'll hear the Patriots superstar's frantic 911 call after thieves  broke into his home and stole guns and safes.</p><p> Plus, Goldman Sachs eyeing Apple, the bank wants to cash in on some iPhone  customers.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Get ready for another wild ride on Wall Street.</p><p> Take a look at how the Futures are trading right now.</p><p>Dow Futures are down just 45 points, again a major bounce back, lots of  volatility again yesterday but after the worst percentage loss on Monday,  since August of 2011, the Dow - there was trading in a twelve hundred-point  range yesterday, managed to close up 567 points.</p><p>Dow Futures were down 200 points at 6:00 a.m., now look at them?  </p><p> Holding steady!</p><p> And Goldman Sachs is looking to help people buy the next iPhone and other  Apple gadgets.</p><p> Cheryl Casone has more details on this, hey Cheryl?</p><p> CASONE:  New twist for Goldman Dagen, \"The Wall Street Journal\" is  reporting that Goldman Sachs is in talks with Apple to finance customers  purchases of Apple products like, yes, the one thousand dollars iPhone X.   The Journal says, 'the customers will get a loan from Goldman instead of  using their credit card,' which can charge obviously a higher interest  rate.</p><p> And Dagen you spoke with the CEO of Citizens Financial last month, whose  bank already offers low-interest loans for the iPhone; here's what he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRUCE VAN SAUN, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP:  Apple has an  upgrade program for their phones and so we provide the installment credit  for Apple's customers.</p><p> We get to set the credit box in conjunction with Apple so it's - it's a  very nice program.</p><p>Apple has really high standards in terms of the customer experience in  their stores so we have very limited time to make the credit decision but  we've been I think living up to their standards.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well, meanwhile Apple says it sees strong demand for replacement  iPhone batteries and it may send consumers rebates to pay the full price  for a new battery.</p><p>Apple recently came under fire for using software to slowdown phones with  older batteries.</p><p> And then shares of Apple, we should say, little bit lowing the pre-market,  the stock is up though about 20 percent over the past year.</p><p> Well we're getting to hear the 911 call, Patriot's Tight End Rob Gronkowski  made to police, moments after realizing his house in Foxborough,  Massachusetts had been robbed.</p><p> ROB GRONKOWSKI, NFL TIGHT END, NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS:  Hello, this isn't -  this isn't an emergency.</p><p> This is just uh - this is Rob Gronkowski calling and while I was gone, my  whole house got robbed while on the Super Bowl trip and I just got back.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT:  \"This isn't an emergency.

So, I'm -- I'm a big believer in the Blockchain Technology.</p><p> I'm also a believer that crypto is an asset class</p><p> Whether Bitcoin is the end-all is to be determined but I think things like  Ripple and Ethereum, those that have an underlying platform; I've invested  in two that are in the pre-ICL stage by their legal services in Commerce.</p><p> It's to me if you have the underlying Blockchain and underlying  technological platforms, these are real asset classes.</p><p> I actually think Bitcoin is going to you know, -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But -</p><p> WOLF:  - have its volatility but it will be the one that people are using  to buy those asset -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - but people -</p><p> WOLF:  - classes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - have been using -</p><p> STREIBLE:  (INAUDIBLE) -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - but people have been using --</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA EQUITY AND FUND:  That's not well  known (ph).</p><p> MCDOWELL:   -- but people have been using it like they are betting on coin- toss -</p><p> STREIBLE:  - Yes.  And that is wrong.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - but if somebody on the other side of that trade that they  don't even know who they are betting against.</p><p> BELL:  Because they are not thinking like Robert, they should be analyzing  it like it's a true asset class.</p><p> WOLF:  That's why it went from 19,000 to 7,000, it's like catching knives,  if you don't know what you're investing in -</p><p> STREIBLE:  Hey -</p><p> WOLF:  - and it's just going down -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> WOLF:  - down, down, down.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Phil, real, quick, you've -</p><p> STREIBLE:  - Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - got 10 seconds.</p><p> STREIBLE:  Yes.  Here (ph) you know, something interesting is that your  State Farm insurance policy will state now that Bitcoins and  cryptocurrencies are not covered on your homeowner's insurance, if your  house burns down - </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you -</p><p> STREIBLE:  - or your computer -</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - so much -</p><p> STREIBLE:  - is stolen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  - Phil.</p><p> Phillip Streible.  </p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good morning.</p><p> I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.</p><p> It's Wednesday, February 7th; your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Wild swings on Wall Street, a fifth -- a five hundred and sixty-seven-point  gain yesterday but again, the range of swings about 1,200 points on  Tuesday.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

It's Wednesday, February 7th, your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Wild swings on Wall Street 567 point gain yesterday but again the  range of swings up 1,200 points on Tuesday.  Investors in for a volatile  ride yesterday and maybe today.  Take a look at how futures are trading  right now.  We had a more than 200-point loss on the Dow futures starting  to show 6:00 a.m. now down just 70 points but again volatility is back  after people got used to very calm markets, Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ start  today up for the year not the same story for the transports and small caps.  </p><p> Meantime, the Atlanta Federal Reserve has lowered its first-quarter GDP  forecast from 5.4 percent we reported that last week now down to four  percent, still strong.  In Europe stocks are heading higher across the  board, the biggest winner there being the FTSE 100 in England up more than  one percent.  In Asia overnight stocks mostly lower, the Nikkei eking out a  small gain, the KOSPI in South Korea the worst performer falling more than  two percent.  Budget battles looming, lawmakers have until tomorrow night  to reach an agreement to keep the federal government running.  The house  already passing a stopgap spending bill and now the fight turns to the  Senate how the Senate will vote on that and immigration is still a top  issue there.  White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short  weighed in on that debate last hour. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS:  We were expecting  Congress deliver on the promises we made on the campaign that we would  invest in border security.  And he's going to hold Congress' feet to fire  on that and if they're not going to deliver on that border security he's  saying he is okay taking that extra step.  But we are not expecting a  shutdown this week, we are expected a budget cut deal is to be in place and  we're expecting to be an evictee on the president's commitment to rebuild  our military. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The latest on that battle and the immigration straight fight  ahead.  Steve Wynn out, the details as the billionaire mogul stepped down  as CEO of his company following sexual misconduct allegations.  Sheryl  Sandberg calling for fairness when it comes to the Pence role.  The Vice  President won't eat alone with a woman other than his wife and he won't  attend events where alcohol is served without his wife either.  But Sheryl  Sandberg says women's careers are ultimately hurt by this.  And SpaceX  taking it to infinity and beyond!  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  3 2 1 -- </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The company launching their most powerful rocket since the  Apollo mission sending a test to roadster into orbit more on the giant leap  for the private space race ahead.  And here to break it all down Fox News  Correspondent Lea Gabrielle, Fox News Contributor 32 Advisory Founder and  CEO and Former Economic Advisory to President Obama Robert Wolf, And CFRA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  I was looking on Twitter, I think that  you were called tolerable this morning Mr. Wolff, how about that?</p><p> ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, that's -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm just -- I -- I am not making it up. </p><p> WOLF:  You know, this has been a really fun morning so I'm expect -- you  know, I see all you guys getting tweets saying, oh my God, I love seeing  you on.  I am waiting for one of those for me. </p><p> LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, sitting next to you I can  tell you they enjoyed to be with you.  It's more than tolerable to enjoy. </p><p> WOLF:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I think that the volatility that we saw in the market, the  massive sell-off on Monday, biggest point decline in the history of the Dow  but also the biggest percentage decline in since 2011.  It is important to  have somebody with experience who's here.  And that is no knock on your  age, I mean that -- I mean that from the bottom of my heart. </p><p> WOLF:  Thank you.  Well, I started really young on Wall Street 21, so when  I left at 50, you know, it was -- I felt like I had three great decades.  A  few things and -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, you want to -- we'll save it because we're going to talk  about the markets.  And you just have to tell people, some of the guests  are coming up later this hour.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  That's a tease, that's quite a tease.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I want to get your -- I want to get your thoughts because again  this is just -- </p><p> WOLF:  Great guess what I was a going to say. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, so I -- the last few days felt like things that Mr. Wolf  and I have experienced covering the markets being involved in the markets  for so many years.  Joining the conversation this morning Louisiana Senator  John Kennedy, Former Chief of Staff under President George W. Bush,  Business Roundtable, CEO and President Joshua Bolten and Host of Varney &amp;  Company, Stuart Varney.  You don't want to miss it.  So volatility has come  back.  This is our top story.  Wall Street bouncing back but again they  kind of wild swings that we have seen in the market where many people have  bet billions of dollars on stable markets the last year or two was a big  winning bet.  And some people made 800 percent betting against volatility  but it came back and you had a couple of these exchange-traded products  wiped out, they closed -- they closed for good on Tuesday.  Now to you,  what were you going to say? </p><p> WOLF:  Yes, I mean listen.  We have spoken a lot since you know the Lehman  crisis where I spent you know a few days at the Fed there.  This is not  that type of crisis, this is not where on a one-directional down trade  everyone should be nervous that type of way where there's contagion coming.   This is actually just the opposite, you have a balancing equation right now  between the bears and the bulls that we spoke about between a rising rate  environment that makes people nervous versus very good corporate earnings  and growth.  </p><p> And the question is who wins and we have not seen a rising rate environment  for decades and so, you know, when I started in the 80s we were 12 percent,  we have been one directional, you know, for three decades.  And so at the  end of the day, we will be in an environment where we are not sure who is  going to win, it feels to me that the short term -- short term because of  tax reform corporate profits in the global growth will outperform for the  equity market versus a rising rate environment.  That's how it feels but  there is going to be incredible volatility. </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  I agree with that and what I  will say going back to your initial point about this isn't Lehman Brothers  days.  We have credit availability actually spreads on the 10 and the two- year have improved over the last several trading days.  So that's a good  sign and the inversion of the yield curve is a huge implication for us  going into a recession. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And that's a huge sign.  Inversion is where shorter-term rates  are higher than the longer term rates and -- because people are betting  basically buying longer-term debt thinking that there is going to be some  sort of calamity in the economy. </p><p> BELL:  Exactly.  And it's a key indicator. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But so can -- better economy can rising wages still drive this  market higher in coming year, Lindsey?</p><p> BELL:  I think so but we saw in the last couple days this market is a very  skittish market, they're going to be watching inflation, they're going to  be watching the 10 year, they're going to be watching wage data and wage  data that we got on Friday was good 2.9 percent but I mean when we are in a  boom times that wage growth is more like 3-1/2, four percent. </p><p> WOLF:  The one thing that is really different versus you know other  volatile times is the -- what Lea was talking earlier about the whole idea  of algorithmic and programmatic trading where it's not based on experience,  it's just based on -- there is no human touch to it and so the pendulum  swings farther each way. </p><p> BELL:  I was thinking about that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But is this something -- but this is -- I want to get to Kevin  Corke but this is something that we have known about though.  I remember  the flash crash 2010, this is why this 15-minute halts on stocks were put  in place.  So this is nothing new, you had to expect it, it was like people  got conned into thinking that volatility would never come back that  everything goes up in one direction that I can bet on Bitcoin, I can bet,  you know, a stable stock market, I can bet on anything and everything and  nothing ever goes down.  I mean again --</p><p> WOLF:  Yes, I know you were not going to like this but The President has  mentioned the great stock market at least 25 times just in the month of  January. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I -- listen, I -- </p><p> WOLF:  And I will just tell you if you're not -- I know but that it not a  gage for the economy that we actually usually look at -- we look at many  other gages and we should give him credit.  The economy is doing well, but  I think using the stock market as that key indicator is not the best way. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I said that from I think the day that he took office.   Even before -- no, I said you try to take credit for the record-breaking  run in the stock market on the way up and you are going to own it way down.   And I do think The President by talking about it so much even to the troops  during his Thanksgiving message that he puts all the people at the White  House in a position where now they have got to talk about it.  Whether it's  guest on this program whether it's Sarah Huckabee Sanders, whether it's the  treasury secretary, treasury secretary I understand he talks about the  stability of markets to make sure the markets are functioning properly that  is something the treasury secretary would talk about but in terms of --  now, they're trying to pivot back to just talking about the economy and it  is going to be hard.  Now I want to get to this budget issue because  lawmakers are scrambling to avoid a government shutdown set for tomorrow  night, tomorrow at midnight while President Trump trends to shut the  government down over his demands for border security.  Kevin Corke covering  the story from the White House and he has the very latest.  Hey, Kevin. </p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning to you,  Dagen.  Always nice to see you now the conventional wisdom in Washington is  typically speaking -- something will get done before Friday midnight but to  get to that C.R. that continuing resolution to give the government open and  funded, there are a lot of people who are concerned that they're probably  going to have to deal with most contentious issue and quite some time here  in Washington, you know, what I am talking about it's DACA, it's Dreamers  and most of all it is border security.  The President making it very plain  yesterday that look this is something that has got to be solved, he wants  it figured out now.  Now that is despite the threat of a democratic led  shutdown of the government. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I would love to see a  shutdown if we don't get this stuff taking care of.  So we have to strength  our borders not by a little bit but by a lot.  We are so far behind the  time and by the way, the world is laughing at us because they can't believe  these policies, they don't have it.  I could name 15 of them right now, no  other country in the world has what we have.  And we are going to get it  stopped and if we have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want  safety and unrelated but still related.  They don't want to take care of  our military then shut it down.  We will go with another shutdown.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CORKE:  You understand what they are doing here right?  What he is  basically saying is you will be on the side of taking nonresidents, aliens,  people who are here illegally versus picking to be on the side of the  American people, that is the strategy here.  But I should also tell you  this, Dagen, over on Capitol Hill, all is not lost, so says Masters, Mitch  McConnell, and Schumer. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I'm optimistic that  very soon we'll be able to reach an agreement.</p><p> SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I have discussed some of  the outlines with my caucus that I think we are very happy with and  hopefully the Republicans are and then we can get something really good  done. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CORKE:  Now, let's be honest a lot of this is jesting for public  consumption but I don't think there's any of doubt.  We will see something  happen before Friday midnight, we'll be watching very carefully from our  perch.  And I promise that truck which is about to drive right by is far  enough away that I am safe, back to you. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what -- you know what I fear the most Kevin for you  leaf blowers.  They are -- they are the worst thing on the plant, scarier  than a chainsaw. </p><p> CORKE:  Yes.  True story. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I brought it and it was so loud and so annoying.  Kevin, great  to see.  Kevin Corke from The White House for us.  Real quick everybody on  this budget deal, here is what bothers me about the Republicans show me  some spending restraints because again this deal that the senators are  putting through $80 billion a year more in defense spending, nondefense  spending, increasing by $63 billion a year and then we're going to be  talking about infrastructure. </p><p> GABRIELLE:  And that is the problem it's because they can't get it passed  without getting some Democrat support and Democrats won't support it unless  they get some sort of a match to the increasing defense spending, right? </p><p> WOLF:  But a few things.  That is not uncommon, that you have discretionary  spending and nondiscretionary go up equally.  That's not -- number two.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is the problem -- it's not --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- 20 trillion debt.</p><p> WOLF:  Number two, the Republicans have always been a pay go OK party.  Now  all of a sudden they are no longer fiscal, they find it --</p><p> GABRIELLE:  The military has been suffering since the budget control last  2011 the secret --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WOLF:  I'm not talking about the military.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm not talking about the military, we're talking about  the nondiscretionary.</p><p> WOLF:  And as you know Claire McCaskill went on the floor and said let's  pass all the spending we need for the military true or not true. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is true.</p><p> WOLF:  Is she a Democrat? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes. </p><p> WOLF:  And it didn't get passed, so listen, we can talk partisan politics  all day, we are all supportive of the military our -- my only point is the  Republican party has always been fiscal hoax and all of a sudden we have a  trillion-dollar deficit from the tax reform. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, and the Democrats said -- the Democrats have always wanted  to spend everybody else's money and not give it back to us and not give us  tax cuts.  And now all of a sudden they are worried about the sky falling  because of the budget deficit. </p><p> WOLF:  How about where we all agree -- how about where you all agree we  should not have a government shutdown, that does not --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think everyone does agree that. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I agree because the military doesn't get paid, that's what  shameful. </p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think -- I think the only one who is not saying that right  now is President Trump and I think the reason he is saying what he is  saying is because he is appealing to his base.  And he's prone hyperbole.   Immigration. </p><p> WOLF:  Right.  But the -- but let's be clear, a government shutdown costs  over a billion dollars a day the last one, that's not a good thing for  anybody. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And doesn't make (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> WOLF:  And I'm not supportive of attaching DACA to a government shutdown  neither.  I think one is budgetary but we should -- we should --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want some spending restraints, Republicans spending  restraint.  Can we show it?  Can we see it?  More ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  Steve Wynn resigning as Chairman and CEO of Wynn  Resorts.  Cheryl Casone has more details.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Big news, Dagen.  Wynn has that Steve Wynn's  resignation, it's effective immediately.  This comes after sexual  misconduct allegations against the Las Vegas billionaire.  A number of  women have claimed that Wynn harassed or assaulted them, one case led to a  $7.5-million settlement.  Now, Wynn is still denying those allegations.   Shares of the company up nine percent in the premarket.  It was down  earlier.  Stock to watch today.</p><p> Well, a Facebook executive is taking issue with Mike Pence's rule about  being around women.  He has a personal rule that's common among a lot of  evangelicals.  Doesn't allow him to be alone with women.  He's also said in  the past, he won't attend an event with alcohol without his wife by his  side.  Well, Sheryl Sandberg thinks this rule hurts women's growth in the  workplace because missed opportunity to network with men.  A lot of times  they're superiors.  Sandberg, the CEO of Facebook and the co-founder of  Lennon says that if men followed the so-called Mike Pence Rule, it should  apply to everybody, not just women but the flood of #MeToo revolutions, a  recent survey showed half of male managers said their uncomfortable  participating in basic activities with women. </p><p> Well, President Trump like what he saw as a guest of honor at France's  Bastille Day parade last July, so much he wants a similar parade perhaps on  Pennsylvania Avenue to celebrate 4th of July.  Trump is asking the defense  department to throw a parade to show off American military power.  White  House officials and the Pentagon have confirmed that a military parade is - - well, they're talking about it.  Options are being put on table, they say  they're planning something.  Last time we had a full military parade in  D.C. was after the Gulf War back in '91.  It cost $12 million.  So you got  to throw out the --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GABRIELLE:  I think a parade to celebrate our troops, to celebrate our  defense, to celebrate our country is wonderful but we as a country are so  above these parades you see from other countries where they need to put on  display their weapons and need to show over what they have and if this in  any way smells of that type of parade I think will be resented by our  troops because we are above that. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> WOLF:  There was a rule that President Trump may actually ride in one of  the tanks. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Did you just make that up? </p><p> WOLF:  I did. </p><p> BELL:  Oh my god.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That worked very well.</p><p> GABRIELLE:  You got me there.</p><p> WOLF:  I did.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No. That worked so well for Mike Dukakis, that basically ended  his presidential run but I want to point something out -- </p><p> WOLF:  Tuesday.  You got me there. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  So -- but one thing, but if that happens that you say the  military wouldn't like it but it would like the Soviet Union or North  Korea, I mean, that is the appearance. </p><p> BELL:  It is unnecessary, it looks silly.  I think something to celebrate  our troops is one thing, to celebrate country is something but if we start  making this look like a big display like we see in North Korea, it's silly,  it's unnecessary and we as a country are above it. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Wouldn't you rather have $20 million put towards new aircraft or  a new tank? </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think that we should thank those who have served and do serve  who basically are protecting our freedom.  We say we're the land of the  free because we are the home of the brave.  We need to thank these  individuals every single day.  Thank you for your service. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Oh, thank you for saying that.  And let's thank them all of  those who serve and the families of those who serve by showing them off, by  not making them jump through you-know-what's to put on a parade.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I have my R. Riveter bag right here.  This is made  by the spouses of people of men and women who are serving in -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> WOLF:  And I have to show my wounded warriors here because I'm a big  supporter and to give the 20 million to wounded warriors.  So we have tons  of different ways to give the money versus the parade.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  You can see parades around the world as you see are vessels and  around the world supporting our country.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  The trickle-down effect of President Trump's tax  plan, how cutting corporate taxes could help millions of American workers.   Plus, Houston we have liftoff, more incredible video from the SpaceX rocket  launch, straight ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Investing in America.  A new blog post titled, America's workers  are the real winners from corporate tax reform. Hits back against critics  who say that the new tax law only benefits corporations.  It reads in part,  companies will also use some of the gains from tax reform to return capital  to investors.  Money returned to shareholders of any kind re-circulates  throughout the economy with some helping finance new star-ups, some being  reinvested in growing sectors to the economy.  Some being safe to increase  future consumption.  Let's bring in the writer of this blog post, he  happens to be the former chief of staff under President Bush 43, Business  Roundtable president and CEO, Josh Bolton.  Josh, you preach into the choir  right here, I have been saying that, I understand the way the tax reform  works both for individuals and corporations.  Are we hearing enough of that  from members of the Republican Party?  And those very lawmakers really  pushing back on the rhetoric from the likes of Nancy Pelosi?</p><p> JOSH BOLTON, CEO, BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE:  Yes, I hope so.  First of all,  thanks for having me this morning to talk about this.  But I hope we are  hearing it from the members who supported this tax bill because they have a  lot to be proud of.  It's not just the dividends and share buybacks that  the tax reform may release, the much more important part is the benefits  that are going directly to workers right now as a result of the extra cash  that companies have.  And even more important than that is the investments  that those corporations that companies all over America are going to be  able to do right here in America as a result of the more competitive tax  code.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I just want to point out we're looking at the vast list of  companies that are returning some of the tax savings to their workers  whether it's in thousand dollar bonuses and we just found out Chipotle has  said it's going to reinvest more than one-third of its savings from the new  tax law in its employees.  Some of the new benefits workers will get  include one-time bonuses of up to $1000 to hourly and salaried workers  along with life insurance, short-term disability insurance for hourly  restaurant managers.  This is just to name a few.  But to look at thousand  dollars in this country and say that it's pathetic crumbs, Josh, I don't --  I don't -- I know that that does not resonate with the American people.   I've said this, are people really looking at their bigger paychecks  thinking, I really wish Nancy Pelosi had her hands on this money instead of  me. </p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  I hope they are and comments like that I think just  reflected a fundamental misunderstanding of what tax reform was likely to  bring.  And the evidence is now overwhelming.  At the business roundtable  alone we represent 200 of America's biggest corporations.  We have members  of our organization alone have already announced over $700 million in  bonuses to their employees, lots of wage increases 401(k) enhancements.   Those are real substantial benefits for the workers of all those  corporations.  And that's just in the first six weeks after the enactment  of the tax reform.  I think there is a lot more to come in this economy.   Both in terms of short-term benefits that workers will realize more  importantly in the long-term competitiveness of American companies which is  where American workers need to work.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Josh, are you concerned though about the tax reform being part  of the reason that we were -- we're going to have higher inflation?  You  talk about wage growth.  But wage growth is part of the inflation equation,  you wind up with higher interest rates.  That is certainly last week was a  big concern for the stock market with that wage growth number we got from  the employment report.  </p><p> BOLTON:  Yes.  That could have been a part of what's roiled the markets a  bit in the -- in the last few days is an expectation now of some  inflationary pressure from wage increases.  But look, that's -- that wasn't  the purpose of tax reform and it's not -- it's not really going to be the  effect.  What everybody across all political persuasions has been looking  for is real wage increases for American workers.  Tax reform is going to  unleash a lot of that and overall that's a huge benefit to the American  economy.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Josh, it was really good to see you.  Thank you for being here  as always.  </p><p> BOLTON:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Josh Bolton.  We will see you very soon.  As we go to break,  futures are trading like this right now, take a look.  Dow futures were  down more than 200 points when we started the show at 6:00 a.m. Eastern  down 87 points right now.  Wild swings on Wall Street, we will watch that  as the day moves on.  Plus, Tesla revving up to report fourth-quarter  earnings after the bell.  We break down the numbers ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  Welcome back,  everybody.  It's Wednesday, February 7th.  Your top stories at 8:32 a.m.  Eastern.  Another wild day on Wall Street, the Dow Jones swimming more than  1000 points, almost 1200 points in fact from loss to highs in yesterday's  session ending the day up 567 points, big bounce back from that kind of  epic loss on Monday.  The major market gages finishing yesterday in the  green and the Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ are all back in positive territory for  the year.  Checking action this morning.  Futures are off a little bit, the  Dow futures are down 98 points, they were off more than 200 early in the  morning about 6:00 a.m. when we started this program, started MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  </p><p> But again, this is the issue, volatility is back, people have become very  complacent, they weren't used to wild swings.  The Dow had a move of one  percent or more to seven times last year.  Over in Europe, you have gains  across the board to speak of.  The biggest gainer there being the FTSE 100  in England up more than one percent.  in Asia, markets were mostly lower,  heavy selling to report on the KOSPI in South Korea down more than two  percent.</p><p> Plus, Steve Wynn resigning from his namesake company.  The casino mogul  leaving amid allegations of sexual misconduct.  Stuart Varney's take coming  up.  To the budget battle on Capitol Hill.  One Senator unveiling  legislation to cut back on government waste.  The details ahead.  Investors  eyeing earnings of course back to fundamentals, Tesla gearing up to report  after the closing bell, the numbers that you need to watch ahead.  And  going to a place where there are no roads. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There might not be roads there but that didn't stop Elon Musk  from sending a Tesla into space.  More on the Falcon Heavy launch later  this hour.  Futures under pressure but well off the lows of the morning.   We are -- what are the traders on Wall Street saying about this have crazy  ride that we've seen really in the last week.  Nicole Petallides on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  Nicole? </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Good morning, Dagen.  So, obviously we've  seen from choppy (INAUDIBLE) action, there's no doubt about that, even this  morning as you have been covering there throughout the morning, we've seen  it down as much as close to 300 -- and the futures now we're down about  100, so that's what the traders are talking about.  They're also talking  about the heavy volume that we saw yesterday.  So there has been a lot of  action and talking about the people who were trying to get in, there were  some outages for people from T.D. Ameritrade and Fidelity trying to get --  try to navigate this difficult market.  And whether or not the bottom is  in.  That's been a big topic of conversation.  Yesterday we had obviously  the second largest-point swing ever in history in the day before.  The  biggest ever.  So, the question is whether or not the bottom is in and  yesterday 75 percent they said is likely in.  Back to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Nicole, thank you so much for that.  Nicole Petallides in the  New York Stock Exchange.  Turning to the shutdown showdown.  A bipartisan  budget deal in the works.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and  Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying that they are very close to finalizing  a budget that would boost military and nondefense spending, reportedly a  total $143 billion.  The new PAC makes no mention of immigration likely  tabling that debate for now.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SCHUMER:  The Republican leader and I have been working together quite  productively.  Of course, there is still some outstanding issues to be  resolved.  But we are closer to an agreement than we have ever been.</p><p> MCCONNELL:  Once we have established that the government is going to be  open which needs to happen by February the 8th.  We'll then go forward with  an immigration debate.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining us now is Louisiana Senator John Kennedy.  This plan  comes just as the House approved a stopgap spending bill to fund the  government through March 23rd.  What do you think of the proposal from the  leadership in the Senate? </p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Well, I like the House deal, Dagen.  I  haven't seen the details of the leadership's proposal.  They say they are  close, I've been hearing that for four months.  I've got to see it to  believe it.  I think if they make a deal it will be two-year deal and  surprise-surprise they're going to increase spending.  I just got to see  how much and where they're going to spend the money.  And how much is going  to add to the he deficit and you can put me down as doubtful.  I'm not  saying I'm not going to vote for it, but every time there is a budget deal  it always includes bigger numbers not smaller numbers and while you and I  are talking today since we've been talking we've already borrowed a  million-dollars.  We've borrowed a million dollars a minute to operate the  Federal government.  $1.4 billion a day.  </p><p> BELL:  Senator, it's Lindsey Bell.  I absolutely can appreciate your  concern for the spending there and we need to cut back on some of these  costs but isn't a two-year deal better than another C.R. to just get --  take us out another six weeks, by the time we get to march, the fiscal year  only have six more months left. </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, the problem with the C.R. or continuing resolution, Dagen,  is that there is no certainty and it does hurt our military.  Because they  can't plan.  And I do support more spending for military.  Every Senator,  Republican and Democrat, has seen the classified information.  They can't  talk about it but they know we need more spending for the military.  I just  got to see how much of waste I've got to eat in order to help our military.   And I can't make that determination until I see the -- see the numbers.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  Senator, this is Lea Gabrielle.  Nice to see you. </p><p> KENNEDY:  Nice to see you, Lea.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  It sounds like you're not very hot on what you expect to be  coming your but also acknowledge that a C.R. is a terrible solution for  what we have going on, so what are you proposing? </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, what I'm proposing is that we get serious about properly  funding our military and we get serious about living within our needs.   Nobody around here except some folks in the house and few Senators are  talking about how we can spend less.  </p><p> GABRIELLE:  But how do you propose getting that done? </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, let me give you an example.  I'm introducing the bill with  Tom Carper, it's got a fancy title but I call it The Stop Paying Dead  People Act.  The federal government is paying I think between 10 and $20  billion dollars a year to dead people.  And they're cashing the checks.   Obviously, there is fraud.  I mean in some states dead people can vote but  cashing a check is a little bit too much.  </p><p> WOLF:  Senator --I</p><p> KENNEDY:  I'll give you an example over a three-year period, the auditors  found that the Federal government sent out $1 billion in foreign payments  to dead farmers.  There is another case over a five-year period, the  Federal government paid $600 million in Federal pension checks to dead  retirees.  And the checks are being cashed and you know what's being done  about it?  Nothing, zero, nada. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Senator, I'm going to let Robert Wolf ask you a question but  Robert, I think everybody is for getting rid of waste and fraud and paying  dead people but a few billion dollars a year is a drop in the doggone  bucket in terms of what we spend just on -- listen, the interest on our  national debt in a year or two is going to top what we spend on the  military, Robert.  </p><p> WOLF:  Yes.  Senator Kennedy, I just want to shift quickly because it seems  like either be a continuing resolution or a two-year budget deal with  respect to the -- with respect to the Senate.  It seems like there's not  going to be a government shutdown.  So I want to therefore just segue to  DACA which market is a really big gate for these 800,000 immigrants waiting  to see really what happens to them and just to be clear, you know, I'm a  supporter to protect the DREAMers.  And so I'm curious, where you are going  to March 5th and how do you see the outcome for these individuals? </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, number one, there are a lot of meetings being held in  groups of Senators are talking.  But what counts is 60 votes.  There are  several plans on the table right now, every single one of them are held  together with spit.  The only way to find out where everybody stands is to  vote.  And what I expect Senator McConnell to do is put some sort of  instrument bill on (INAUDIBLE) and let us start debating it and amending  it.  I'm much less sanguine than so my colleagues that we'll be able to 60  votes to do something meaningful.  Our Democratic friends want amnesty and  frankly nothing else.  I want to solve the problem.  I want to be here  talking about another DACA immigrant amnesty issue five or 10 years from  now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But Senator, that's one of the reasons that they're including  the people who never signed up for DACA, including the White House,  including that in that 1.8 million people who would be given a pass to  citizenship.  So, do you oppose any path to citizenship whatsoever?  You  can call it amnesty --</p><p> KENNEDY:  It just depends on the bill.  Look, here is the problem.  We've  got immigration laws about half of our public officials don't agree with  them so they don't enforce them.  I give you ask sanctuary cities are  exhibit number one.  What we need to do is agree on a set of laws and  enforce the damn things like every other country does.  Just doing amnesty  is not going to solve this problem.  We need to --</p><p> WOLF:  Just to shift.  So we know it's coming up on March 5th, so there's  not going to be a broad base immigration bill passed by March 5th, we know  this.  March 5th --</p><p> KENNEDY:  No.  We don't know that.  Excuse me.  But we don't know that.</p><p> WOLF:  OK.</p><p> KENNEDY:  We can start debating the immigration bill next week and come out  with a comprehensive bill.  We have 60 votes, now I'm not -- I don't think  we will but we could -- </p><p> WOLF:  So let's agree that the likelihood is unlikely.  So March 5th comes  and we have the situation with the DREAMers.  Where do you think it will --  what will happen on you March 5th?  What is your expectation? </p><p> KENNEDY:  Well, if we don't do anything by March 5th, it's up to the  president.  Because he controls the enforcement of deportation, he sets  deportation policy.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, Senator --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- the DACA recipients that is being held up in the courts.  So  there is this feeling in Washington that they can drag their feet and wait  on dealing with this because the court has said that the order to end DACA  that they're basically put a stop to it at least in -- for -- at least  temporarily.  </p><p> KENNEDY:  That's a very good point.  I can just tell you categorical,  unequivocally, I don't want there to be any doubt about where I stand.  I'm  not going to vote for amnesty unless I get a full bill that solves the  problem.  Now, you're going to ask me what that is, I've got my own ideas,  I'm not so arrogant that I think only my ideas will work but I'm not just  going to vote for amnesty and kick this problem down the road, I want to  solve it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good to see you but everybody who you're in -- at the -- in the  Senate and House with, you're kicking that debt problem down the road and  it's going to blow up in everybody's face.  That's my predictions.  Senator  John Kennedy.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Amen, amen, sister, amen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Futures are off by 102 points, that's much better than the  picture was at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  But again, wild swings on Wall  Street yesterday.  Meantime, Steve Wynn resigning as chairman and CEO of  Wynn Resorts.  Joining me now to weigh in is the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Mr. Stuart Varney.  What say you, sir?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Well, I don't think there was much choice here.   I think Steve Wynn had to go.  Look, he's been accused to buy, literally,  dozens of women of sexual misconduct.  He didn't get his day in court but  that is not the point.  Had this gone forward with him as CEO, the Chinese  government may well have withdrawn the licenses which Steve Wynn has for  his casinos in Macau.  You withdraw those licenses in Macau and you have  just about destroyed Wynn Casino, the stock.  He still got 12 percent of  it, but if you can operate in Macau and he's got 70 percent of his revenue  come from Macau, you can't operate, period.  He have to go even though he  didn't get his day in court.  That's my reading of it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But day in court, Stuart, though, means -- I mean, due process,  we all believe in that, right?</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That it means it leaves the company opening an internal  investigation with outside counsel to look into this, but I think when it  comes to light that an individual -- and this is according to all reports  in the Wall Street Journal -- Steve Wynn set up an LLC to pay one accuser,  took steps to conceal $7-1/2 million settlement.  It's those settlements  that we all well know dupe people in, in terms of their employment.</p><p> VARNEY:  Oh, you got a good point, Dagen.  No question about it.  I'm just  a little uncomfortable with the current trend towards utter dismissal,  total disgrace, you lose everything but you never get to plead your case in  court.  Now, in this particular instance, I can understand why not?  But  you know, we've gone a long way with this.  I'm not -- I'm not criticizing  the women who've come forward.  I enthrall it.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart, no, no, no --</p><p> VARNEY:  I'm saying we better settle down a little here because maybe, in  some cases, some injustice is being done.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's not just men who are uncomfortable with some of this, it's  women like myself who is very uncomfortable with that story told about --  Aziz, I'm sorry, the comedian about this date that he had been on, and it  was a bad date, and he -- again, people's careers and lives are destroyed  in some instances by based on one headline.  Never read -- never reading  the allegations.  I just think that there is just -- there is definitely a  brewing discomfort among both men and women about how these allegations are  aired.</p><p> VARNEY:  Well said.  And there are no good answers here, period.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p> VARNEY:  None.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  None.  But we do want women to be heard, too.</p><p> VARNEY:  We do, indeed.  Absolutely, we do.  Yes, of course.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Stuart, you're the best.  Your show starts in exactly 10  minutes.  There you go, Monday through Fridays, Stuart is all over this  market.  It is going to be incredible coverage as it is every day, Stuart  Varney 9:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p> Coming up, SpaceX successfully launching the Falcon Heavy rocket, sending a  Tesla Roadster into outer space.  More video that's out of this world,  next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  To quote Robert Wolf, so cool.  3, 2, 1 liftoff.  SpaceX  successfully launching the Falcon Heavy Rocket yesterday, capable of  lifting up to 140,000 pounds, and now, holds the title of world's most  powerful rocket.  But how will Elon Musk auto company take off today?   Tesla set to report fourth-quarter results after the bell.  It's expected  to post a loss for $3.10 a share, revenue on revenue $3.28 billion.   Joining us now, ARK Invest Analyst, Tasha Keeney.  Tasha, what are  expectations for Tesla?</p><p> TASHA KEENEY, INVEST ANALYST, ARK:  So, I think most investors are worried  about the Model 3 production ramp cash burn.  But from our perspective, you  know, people are comparing Tesla to traditional auto companies.  It's an  autonomous car company.  And once that switch is flipped, and these cars  that are already on the road today become fully autonomous, they're going  to become revenue-generating assets.  So, from that perspective, we're  happy that Tesla is spending money to get this off the ground because we  think that opportunity is huge.  We think the global market for autonomous  driving, autonomous taxis could be around $10 trillion.</p><p> BELL:  But they do have competition in this space, Waymo, Lyft, a whole  slew of others.  How sure are you that they're going to get there first and  they're going to be the winners in this race?</p><p> KEENEY:  They do have competition but what Tesla has is scale.  So, every  car that's on the road today is basically like a mini R&amp;D center.  It's  gathering data that Tesla then uses to train its autonomous driving  algorithms.  And no other automaker has been able to do this, get cars on  the road with that capability.  So, this puts Tesla years ahead of others  and, you know, yesterday, we heard on G.M.'s earnings call that they have  about 100 test cars on the road.  I mean, Tesla has thousands of cars.   Think about that information and what it's capable of.</p><p> WOLF:  So, being an old-school Wall Street guy, at what point do you get  nervous about cash burn, and what -- this is much more like almost a  biotech company?</p><p> KEENEY:  Because it's being -- the cash burn has been getting worse each  quarter.  Yes, yes.  So, to give you an idea of roughly what we expect in  earnings from these vehicles, so right now, each car is generating about  $3,000 worth of earnings for Tesla.  We think once you turn that  autonomous, that could be a net present value about over $80,000 per  vehicle, and --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, we've -- go ahead, finish your --</p><p> KEENEY:  And, you know, so we're happy that they're spending money.  I  think we'd be happy if they raised another $20 billion to get this off the  ground.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, you get the Tesla in space but you also have the CEO Elon  Musk, the founder of the company who's busy with all these other pursuits  including SpaceX.  Concerned.</p><p> KEENEY:  That's a valid point.  You know, I think Elon Musk is a really  amazing person.  We saw in this rocket launch, he is capable of making the  impossible possible, and so, you know, while no one has achieved this feat  yet, I wouldn't put it past him.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.  Tasha, Tasha Keeney, thank you so much.</p><p> KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.  Final thoughts when we come back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Final thoughts.  Lindsey?</p><p> BELL:  Get ready for this political uncertainty to drive that volatility.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Robert?</p><p> WOLF:  Congrats to the Eagles, great year for the Pats, and I've already  moved to the Celtics.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, I would, too.  Lea?</p><p> GABRIELLE:  Ask for a military parade, that you can see our ships on  parade, our submarines on parade, our soldiers, our sailors, airmen, and  marines around the world.  From Stephen LeClair who's a former marine, he  says he wants to spend time with his family on July 4th, not in a parade.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I say to the Democrats, stop talking down the economy and  essentially rooting for a downfall for the markets, bad for them.  Stuart,  over to you.</p><p> VARNEY:  Oh, I'll take it, Dagen.  Thank you very much, indeed.  It is not  over but is it calming down a bit?  OK.  I'm on dangerous ground.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Over to Dagen McDowell,  in for Maria Bartiromo this morning.  Hey Dagen.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning ladies.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for  Maria Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, February 7th.  Your top stories at 6:00  a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Volatility slamming Wall Street investors from Coast-to-Coast.  They were  in for a wild ride yesterday as the DOW finish the day up nearly 600 points  after falling by about the same amount in earlier trading.  All of the --  as of yesterday's close, all three of those major market gauges are back in  positive territory for the year.  </p><p>But Futures are telling a different story, 243 point loss on the DOW  Futures this morning.  Again, will volatility end this bull market coming  on its nine-year anniversary next month, we will ask that question.   Meantime, the economy still looks strong, the Atlanta Federal Reserve did  lower its first-quarter GDP forecast to four percent, still hot but that's  down from 5.4 percent last week.  </p><p>In Europe, stocks are heading higher.  We have some modest gains across the  board in England, France, and Germany but in Asia overnight, stocks mostly  lower.  The Kospi in South Korea, the worst performer there.  The Nikkei  managing to eke out a small gain but the Kospi up by more than two percent.</p><p>The budget battles looming, lawmakers have until tomorrow night to reach an  agreement to keep the federal government running as the House passes a  stopgap spending bill, the fight now turns to the Senate where immigration  remains a top issue.  President Trump weighing in from the White House  yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If we don't change it, let's  have a shutdown, we'll do a shutdown and it's worth it for our country.   I'd love to see a shutdown if we don't get this stuff taken care of.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The latest on the immigration battle ahead.  Steve Wynn, out.   The details as the billionaire mogul steps down as CEO of his company  following sexual misconduct claims.  </p><p>SpaceX takes it to infinity and beyond.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The company launching their most powerful rocket since the  Apollo mission.  Sending a Tesla Roadster into orbit as well, more on the  giant leap for the private space race ahead.</p><p>Plus, winter is coming to a galaxy far, far away.  From ESPN to \"Star  Wars\", the Disney earnings, a fan's dream.  The new details on the  company's fourth streaming service and its plans that came with the mind  behind \"Game of Thrones.\"</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, FOX News Correspondent,  Lea Gabrielle is here.  FOX News Contributor, 32Advisors Founder and CEO  and Former Economic Advisor to President Obama, Robert Wolf.  And CFRA  Investment Strategist, Lindsey Bell.  Good morning to everybody.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Great too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is when I'm very happy.  We have some age on the panel,  myself included because we remember what this kind of all feels it looks  like.</p><p>WOLF:  You know, I'm thinking that -- I think I was in middle school when  we had this volatility.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Really?</p><p>WOLF:  It's been like a -- let's be honest, outside of the dot-com bubble  and the Asia crisis and the 2008 recession, we've kind of been on a three- decade, one directional ride.  We haven't seen the 1,200 point swing, I  can't remember.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We want to make it there, yes.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  I mean, it turns out the stock  market actually goes down sometimes, right?  It should be a really -- this  should be a wakeup call for investors, retail investors especially.  What  do you have in your portfolio?  You need to know.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well I think that people already got a wakeup call Lindsey and  we will talk about that with people betting on stable markets with these  inverse volatility funds, a couple of them shutting down yesterday.  We're  talking about massive losses, so it's not just individuals, that some of  the smartest minds, some of the smartest guys and gals in the room, again,  also losing money.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  And a lot of computers involved in what was going on, of  course, to those algorithms have certainly changed how the work is being  done.</p><p>WOLF:  No question.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're going to talk about it all this morning.  Coming up, White  House Director of Legislative Affairs, Marc Short is here.  New York  Congressman Tom Suozzi, New York Congresswoman, Claudia Tenney, that's on  the left and the right, we'll have them on together.  Louisiana Senator,  John Kennedy, and former George W. Bush Chief of Staff Business Roundtable  President and CEO, Josh Bolton.</p><p>You don't want to miss any of those guests but first for our top story,  Wall Street bouncing back, U.S. markets rallying to regain almost half  their losses from the day before when stocks took the largest plunge in six  and a half years, that is the percentage loss that we saw on the DOW.  The  DOW ending the day with a gain of 567 points.  After closing, down more  than 1,100 points on Monday.  Futures right now are showing losses across  the board, 243 point loss on the DOW Futures.</p><p>Despite the turbulence, Treasury Secretary Steve MNuchin telling lawmakers  on Capitol Hill that the markets are functioning, \"Very well.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  We are very focused on the long- term economic growth and we believe that the policies that we've enacted  including tax reform are very positive for a long-term economic growth.   We're already beginning to see that in terms of corporate investments back  into the United States and the impact on corporate earnings.</p><p>I think as you said that the stock market is up significantly over 30  percent since President Trump was elected, we're monitoring the stock  markets, they're functioning very well, and we continue to believe in the  long-term impact of the stock market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey, your take on what Secretary MNuchin is saying but also  in volatility going to threaten this nine-year bull market?</p><p>BELL:  I think volatility certainly has a shot at ruining it but look, last  year, there were eight days that we saw a move of one percent plus or minus  on the S&amp;P500.  Historically, we usually see about 50 of those days.  And  when you have a year like that, the next year, you're bound to have more  volatility.  So, I think people should buckle in and get ready for more of  that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What all this referencing is, again, it was this sense of calm  leads to overconfidence.  Among individual investors and professional  investors that people kind of become delusional about their ability and you  had all these bets on stable markets, this inverse volatility.</p><p>These were exchange-traded retail products, two of which including the XIV  closed down to investors after they lost most of their money of late  Monday.  So, again, these losses, the tide goes out and you see who was  swimming naked.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, I won't comment on the swimming naked but what I will say is  we realize financial engineering doesn't always work and program trading  sometimes the pendulum goes too far each lane, you have these types of  swings.  </p><p>My concerns are two-fold, one, I think the administration is talking way  too much about the stock market.  I think President Trump, I think he  should take a lot of credit for the rally but to talk about it literally  every day, it's not the gauge on the economy we should be using as 50  percent of the nation doesn't even own stocks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well I've been saying that literally since he took office.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well that's where I took it from.  And I think secondly, I think  that I know as the oldest one on this desk, I have not been in a market  that we've seen this type of back up and rates starting, inflation feeling  protectionist environment, problems with the fiscal deficit on one side,  and then the other side, decent growth, you have the tax cuts that are  going to be almost like its own quantitative easing and then lastly, good  corporate profits.  There's a real tug of war that's going to go in 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well who's going to win because I will push back because I've  been concerned about interest rate moving up since really the end of last  year but with inflation now come -- with wages now growing at close to  three percent which happened in the most recent month.</p><p>That's -- still, wages are still -- growth is still very muted, inflation  is still muted.  And all the signs in the market, for the most part, do say  that the economy is OK if not, great.  </p><p>WOLF:  So I would say -- first of all, I would say the bulls will win  short-term because the tax reform is going to be the sugar candy for  corporate growth.  And I think you're going to see that short-term soft  buybacks, dividend, some M&amp;A activity.</p><p>But I think long-term, people are going to project out a backup of rates  and when we start getting three and a half, four percent, you're going to  see a shift take place from equity to fixed income, you're just going to  see it because risk free returns are going to start to look good versus a  market that's been pretty buoyant.  I mean, that's just one thing I do have  as experience 30 years.  I can't say how much in the market today.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It sounds like you're calling longer term for a bear market in  stocks and bonds because, again, if -- because we've had a bull market in  bonds since the early 1980s.  Did you --</p><p>WOLF:  I wouldn't say a bear market but I think the bears will beat the  bulls probably come towards late 2018, early 2019 as we see in just to my  opinion this nervousness.  We're going to do better, growth is here, wages  will do better, the labor force is starting to tighten.  Those are just  facts.  And we have a whole new Fed environment with Powell coming in.</p><p>BELL:  I think it's going to depend largely on inflation and interest rates  as well and inflation is going to be driven by that wage number.  If we get  productivity which it seems like we should get better productivity, the  inflation won't come in high-speed manner that is sort of expected kind of  market right now.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Any concerns about the impact to the economy because of tax  reform if the Fed ends up tightening at monetary policy because of  inflation as some are talking about right now and also -- MCDOWELL:  Well they are tightening monetary policies.  They're reducing  their balance sheets, it's already down to $4 trillion and they're already  raising interesting rates.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Right.  But the question is, if interest rates if we get four  instead of three, if things change as they are trying to cool down the  economy getting too heated up, do you have any concerns over the tax cuts  and how that might have an impact on the deficit and debt?</p><p>WOLF:  Well I do.  I mean, I've been speaking about it, yes, I'm a pro- growth Democrat but I have been -- I am fiscally pretty hawkish in a sense  that I think if everything should have been revenue neutral, I believe in  the PAYGO system.  And so my view is although I was supportive of tax  reform, I probably would have looked to have done -- I would have done it - -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you were up -- so you were concerned that that --</p><p>WOLF:  I was concerned on the fiscal side sometimes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- so you were also concerned when the national debt  doubled under President Obama.</p><p>WOLF:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you fell in that as his economic advisor?</p><p>WOLF:  We're talking about -- we're looking -- the answer -- you know, I've  been with you for a decade, so the answer is yes.  I mean, listen, I --  when I was his economics advisor, very clear we want the tax reform to go  to 28 percent, for corporate it's 25 percent for manufacturing.  We will  also -- we had a Republican Senate in the House, it had to be revenue  neutral.</p><p>That was the only dialogue we ever had was revenue neutral.  That being  said, corporate tax reform is a good thing, I am not going to push back on  that.  I just think that we have not been in an environment with raising  rates, high debt, fiscal deficit and think that's good for the stock  market.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I agree with you that we've never been an environment where  the Federal Reserve.  We had easy, such easy money for so long that we're  entering this unprecedented era of where the Fed has to unwind this balance  sheet where the easy money starts disappearing and you're just beginning to  see the risky, even idiotic debts that people took because everything was  going up in lockstep. </p><p>I want to get to this though Lindsey, just to mention that the Atlanta  Federal Reserve did lower its first-quarter GDP forecast to four percent  from 5.4 percent, that was what it released last week.  The change in the  space of a week, what do you make of it?  BELL:  I mean, it was related to consumption and fixed investment.  So I  think consumption is still good at 3 percent, we saw 3.8 percent in the  fourth quarter, the consumer is very, very strong.  And 4 percent, let's be  honest, when was the last time we saw 4 percent GDP growth?  That's an  outstanding number.  And the Atlanta Fed has been pretty decent about their  -- with the accuracy for the initial estimate of GDP.</p><p>WOLF:  We should ring the bell if we have four percent GDP.</p><p>BELL:  Thank you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we're getting that four percent in part because of the tax  reform.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.  See?  We all agree.</p><p>WOLF:  You got them two for two.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We all agree. </p><p>BELL:  You don't have to worry about that deficit if we get (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, I worry -- I've said this repeatedly but like you saw all  the speculation going on in like Bitcoin in these assets, speculating with  these exchange rate of products on stable low volatility markets and you  get a snapback and you see what kind of risk people are taking.  I don't  think that this -- I mean, this clearly is not over with the loss on the  Futures this morning.</p><p>Coming up, losing Wynn, real estate and casino mogul Steve Wynn stepping  down from his own company after being accused of sexual misconduct  allegations.  What this means for the future of Wynn's global empire,  that's ahead.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Roaring toward a new chapter in the American space race, Elon  Musk, Falcon Heavy makes history but he doesn't lose his sense of humor  while doing it.  We'll explain.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  Investors are strapping in for another busy day  in the market.  Take a look at the Dow Futures right now, 236-point gain on  the Dow Futures.  Volatility came back with a vengeance and the question  remains: How long will it last?  What kind of wild swings are we going to  see in the market and what kind of losses it shakes out?  And do some  people lose confidence in their trading ability?  Meantime, Steve Wynn now  resigning as Chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts.  Cheryl Casone has more  details -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right.  Dagen, good morning.  Wynn Resorts says that Steve  Wynn's resignation is effective immediately, this comes after sexual  misconduct allegations against the Las Vegas billionaire.  A number of  women claimed that Wynn harassed or assaulted them.  One case led to $7.5  million settlement.  Wynn denies these allegations but looking at what's  happening in the premarket here, the stock is actually down almost 1-1/2  percent in the premarket.  Again, Steve Wynn, his resignation effective  immediately.  So, we're also watching shares of Snap this morning.  Get  this, the stock soaring in the premarket up 23 percent, almost 24 percent.   Well, there you go.  Now, it's 24 percent.  They reported better-than- expected quarterly results after the bell.  The stock's back above that  $17.00 IPO price for now.  Revenues soaring more than 70 percent from a  year ago.  That a sharp increase in daily active users.  </p><p>Also this morning, we're going to get earnings from Hasbro and Michael  Kors, 21st Century Fox, the parent company of the FBN reports after the  bell later today.  And we are going to hear from Tesla, Elon Musk's company  later today as well.  And a little flicking for higher revenue from rising  sales of their Model S, their Model X, and their Model 3 vehicles.  Tesla  shares, however, are having, of course of that earnings report, moving  lower in the premarket a little more than a quarter percent.  But let's  stay with Tesla and Elon Musk, he made some news by launching the world's  biggest rocket.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CROWD OF PEOPLE:  Three, two, one.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy launched yesterday to the delight of  employees, space fans, of course.  The 230-foot rocket featured 27 engines,  three boosters.  It cost SpaceX about a billion dollars to build.  Now, two  reusable side boosters did come back to Earth, they landed at the same  time.  That was flawless.  Remember that saves your money in space travel.   Now, this is neat though, Dagen, a Tesla Roadster was hidden onboard.  It  served as a test payload and they put basically a space guy in the driver's  seat.  The pictures have been amazing.  That roadster has now exceeded  Mars' orbit, but loving the pictures from there.  And for any dame that may  take a closer look at the Roadster, they're going to find this on the  circuit board, quote, \"Made on Earth by humans.\"  So, we'll see if little  space travel guy makes some alien friends while he's out there.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love it.  </p><p>CASONE:  It was fun, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I was a NASA nerd when I was growing up.  So, I love seeing  these pictures in school, and Lea was a pilot.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  This is one of those things that could have been like, massive  success or a massive scale and what a massive success it was.  I mean,  looking at the two boosters land that way was just spectacular.  And then - - I mean, really, that car is space trash, let's admit it.  But if it's the  first thing that we see just heading out into space like this, it's pretty  neat to see this car cruising around.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And also, just the fact that you have private industries  stepping up where the government has pulled away.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Well, that's just that.  It's just that it's the way  innovations do this.</p><p>WOLF:  You're the expert in this space.  I can just tell you, our pilots at  our drone company in Washington were so pumped.  It was like literally, you  know, we shut down for the, you know, the hour it was on.  I think they  were waiting for two hours as well.  But it was -- they were just so fired  up.</p><p>BELL:  I think watching the landing was so awesome, too.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes, it's one of those things where you just hold your breath.   And you're hoping that it's going to all workout.  But, you know, Dagen,  you make such a good point about how innovation has changed and how defense  used to lead innovation and now it's really industry that's leading  innovation.  And it's really, you know, it shows where our country can go  and where we can develop things in the future.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Inspiring kids everywhere, including Disney battling on a galaxy  far, far away to rocket to the Future, the earnings straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Disney CEO Bob Iger revealing the company's new ESPN streaming  service will launch later this spring as Disney reports its first-quarter  earnings.  Lauren Simonetti has all the details.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  What a report, Dagen.  So, OK, stronger-than-expected profits,  but taking a look here, you can see revenue $15.35 billion in the last  quarter that actually missed expectations.  And they did take a one-time  benefit related to the new tax law.  So, 1.6 billion there.  Nonetheless,  take a look at the share price reaction right now.  Shares are up to 2.2  percent at 108.50 in the premarket.  If you look at many of Disney's units  and we get revenue for these segments, you can see that their studio and  media units fell short of expectations, but they did see big strength in  the theme parks.  Goes to show you that customers are still willing to pay  sky-high prices for tickets.  By the way, we're going to find out of a  price increase for theme park tickets in the coming week.  You know, and  the higher hotel prices consumers are willing to spend this for  entertainment.  </p><p>Speaking of, struggling ESPN but we do have news for ESPN.  ESPN+, their  new streaming service, it's going to debut in the spring.  It's going to  cost $4.99 a month.  You can buy it as an add-on service and can be used  for the redesigned ESPN App.  It's basically going to give you live  programming that's not available on the current channels.  And then --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIT HARINGTON, ACTOR:  Reach out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, that's \"Game of Thrones\" from HBO.  And yes, the  masterminds behind that hit series are teaming up with Disney and  Lucasfilms to produce -- are you ready -- a new \"Star Wars\" series.  We  don't know how many movies or the release dates, but these are going to be  separate from the \"Star Wars\" the franchise that you've seen.  After two  iconic blockbusters getting together, this is -- this is good, this is good  stuff.  Disney also said that they have pre-ticket sales for one of their  new Marvel movies, Black Panthers, biggest they've ever seen for a  superhero franchise.  So, they're going all in on the -- on the movies and  the franchises.</p><p>BELL:  I think, this just goes to the quality of corporate earnings that  are coming out yesterday DowDuPont had a really solid report and now we're  seeing both of these stocks go up and on the day-to-day, the market is  down.  That's awesome.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what you want to say -- you want to say, individual  names trade on the underlying fundamentals whether it's strength in the  earnings, strength in the economy rather than like a washout.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  A lot of people are saying, Steven Mnuchin, said yesterday the  fundamentals of the market are strong and that's what we are seeing in this  report from Disney.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  The members of the administration forced to talk about the  stock market because the President has been (INAUDIBLE) as essentially  bragging repeatedly about the stock market going up.  So, now you have  Mnuchin, even Vice President Pence for us to talk about it.  So, I haven't  mentioned your Patriots loss, but let me take a moment to mention that.   But are you excited about \"Game of Thrones\" mixed with \"Star Wars\"?  </p><p>WOLF:  I'm glad you shifted to \"Game of Thrones\".  I can't wait.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I didn't want to rub it in.</p><p>WOLF: I couldn't wait for \"Game of Thrones\".  I am so bummed it's the last  season.  But I can't wait for it to come on.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Can you explain to me, I know you're huge in to \"Star Wars\" OK,  you're into \"Game of Thrones\", what's the matchup of these going to look  like?</p><p>WOLF:  I don't know, maybe it's John Snow fighting Darth Vader.  I mean,  you know, who knows what's going to happen and since he comes back and who  knows, we could be --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Dragons in space.</p><p>WOLF:  We could have so many different things going on.  Maybe HBO mergers  with Disney and then it's the \"Game of (INAUDIBLE).\"  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, should Netflix be worried?  Because, you know, now this new  streaming service is coming out at some point that's going to be cheaper  than Netflix, and Disney has its amazing content and they pulled so much of  it from Netflix.  </p><p>WOLF:  You know, everyone has enough money, they're now -- they're all  fighting for content.  Hulu, Amazon, and I mean, it's going to be a very  interesting years to come on where we're watching.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think this ESPN+ is going to be really popular because of how  people can sort of pick and choose from the menu of what they want to see  and when they are picking sports.  They really want to be able to pick  their teams and watch their game.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I streamed the Super Bowl and --</p><p>WOLF:  You're really killing me right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was crystal clear watching those Patriots lose, crystal.</p><p>WOLF:  You know, I'll take -- you know what, I'm going to take my five  Super Bowls and I'm OK with that.  So, I'm --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GABRIELLE:  See, I've heard a lot of Patriots fans say that.  It's like,  you know what --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>WOLF:  No.  Listen, no question you want your team to win.  But do you want  your team in in this -- listen, I actually like the Eagles, too, I want to  Pen, but I'm a staunch Patriots guy and they just didn't -- they came up  short.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, they did.  Thank you, Lauren, Sir.  Disney not coming up  short.  Coming up, tougher sanctions yet.  That tough warning from Vice  President Mike Pence to North Korea if the country doesn't end its nuclear  ambitions.  And why Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg says  that the Vice President's personal role about social gatherings with women  and alcohol is a huge setback for all women in the workforce.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, February 7th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.  Another  wild day on Wall Street, the Dow swinging more than 1,000 points from the  lows to the highs in trading yesterday, the major market gauges finishing  the session in the green.  The Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ are all back in  positive territory for the year, but volatility still reigns supreme.   Despite that, the White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said  the administration is not worried.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The economy is  incredibly strong right now.  The President's focus continues to be on the  long-term economic fundamentals were infinitely better off today than where  we were before the President took office, particularly on the economy.  We  have historically low unemployment and we actually have increasing wages  for American workers.  There's nothing that's taken place over the last  couple of days in our economy that's fundamentally different than it was  two weeks ago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But volatility still front and center this morning, stability,  hard to find, 210-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, losses across  the board there.  In Europe, we do have some gains to report in England,  France, and Germany, although slight, the biggest winner at the moment, in  percentage term, is the FTSE-100 in England.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets mostly lower, the Nikkei managing to eke out a  small gain, but the KOSPI in South Korea, losing more than two percent.   And a strong warning for North Korea, Vice President Mike Pence says that  the U.S. will impose the toughest ever sanctions on the country.  Those  details as he holds a bilateral meeting with Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo  Abe.  </p><p>Sheryl Sandberg calling for fairness when it comes to the personal role, in  which the vice president won't eat alone with a woman, other than his wife,  and won't attend events that have alcohol without her either.  Sandberg  says women's careers are ultimately hurt by this, her fix, coming up.</p><p>Plus, America's source of innovation, under fire over diversity of  opinions, we have new study showing how conservatives feel out-of-place in  Silicon Valley.  I think the headline there is that there are any  conservatives in Silicon Valley.  But now, to the latest on Wall Street,  Futures reporting to decline at the open, losses across the board, this  after swinging wildly between gains and losses yesterday.  Volatility also  hitting the bond market, yields today, take a look at where yields are,  2.77 on the 10-year.</p><p>We had the yield on the ten-year hit a four-year high of -- it was 2.85  percent -- north of 2.85 percent that was on Friday, but money has been  going back into bonds in the face of the stock volatility.  Joining me now,  Wells Fargo Investment Institution President, Darrell Cronk, Darrell, what  is your take on the climate of fixed income and stock markets and how they  match up with --</p><p>DARRELL CRONK, PRESIDENT, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTION:  That's a  good question, Dagen.  This recent correction, actually, had both  correlated where yields were rising as stocks were falling, which is  somewhat atypical.  We broke that a little bit.  I think the bond market --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Last couple of days.</p><p>CRONK:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You had money go -- you know, volatility push money into bonds - -</p><p>CRONK:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  which is, kind of, what you'd want to see.</p><p>CRONK:  Monday afternoon, late in the session.  I actually think the bond  market has handled this correction very well.  You haven't seen a spill  over into what we'd see as traditional safe haven so, commodities, the U.S.  dollar, yields, there's no gap out in high yields spreads.  So the lower  tear sections of the credit market have behaved very well, actually.  So  this is a lot like the equity markets catching a bad bout of this flu  that's going around.  But the flu hasn't been contagious to the other asset  classes yet.</p><p>BELL:  So how do you see tax reform playing into interest rates and  inflation?  I mean, the way that this tax reform is structured, it seems to  be supply-side, so in that way, companies are investing in CAPEX which will  help increase productivity so you won't -- shouldn't see that much  inflation that do you agree with that assessment?  How do you see that  playing out?</p><p>CRONK:  I absolutely agree with that, Lindsey.  I think inflation will  trend mildly higher and some wage inflation is a good thing.  Wage  inflation with productivity growth to your point is actually a good thing.   Wage inflation without productivity growth, where it just increases unit  labor costs and squeezes profit margins for companies, is a bad thing.  We  don't expect a lot of inflation to take higher, but mild inflation higher  is actually a very healthy thing.</p><p>WOLF:  So, Darrell, at what point do you think rates have to back up too to  see a shift from equities back to fixed income?</p><p>CRONK:  I think --</p><p>WOLF:  Three and a half, four?</p><p>CRONK:  Yes, I think three percent is a psychological level right now for  the markets, as it tries the equity markets, as they try and find their  base.  North of three and a quarter to three and a half, I think starts to  squeeze profit margins at that point.</p><p>WOLF:  But where do you see for your clients?  Where do you see money  actually shifting out of -- out of stocks into bonds, at that type of  level?</p><p>CRONK:  Yes, I think it -- at three and a quarter to three and a half, you  start to get the equity risk premium, to be more equal.  Today, it still  favors equities over fixed income right now.</p><p>WOLF:  So where's Wells projecting, kind of, 10-year rates, year-end 2018?</p><p>CRONK:  275.  We've got a range of 250 to 300, 275 with the midway.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How is that possible with the economy growing as strongly as it  is, at least in -- because of tax reform and certainly in the first  quarter, but really the rest of the year that's what's expected.</p><p>CRONK:  Yes, I do think you will see stronger growth, we think 2.9, 3  percent GDP growth.  But when you look at the amount of supply issuance  that has to come on the market for treasuries, this has been the false  narrative (INAUDIBLE) forever which is, kind of, that higher growth has to  equal higher rates almost immediately.  And it may equal them in the  intermediate term, but in 2018, we don't see a big spike up in rates.</p><p>BELL:  So you will say invested in equities then --</p><p>CRONK:  Yes.</p><p>BEL:  for the remainder of the year and what sectors do you like?</p><p>CRONK:  Right now, we actually like financials, we like industrials, we  like consumer discretionary, and we actually like healthcare, so three of  those four, being more procyclical for better growth, better economic  environment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And financials, just to name one, a benefit of deregulation  coming out of Washington.</p><p>CRONK:  Absolutely.  That's right, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to talk about what we've seen with the, kind of, bets  that were placed on stable markets, the bet against volatility over the  last couple of years?  And the losses that were abruptly and surprisingly  exposed just in the last couple of days.  </p><p>These two -- one, in particular, this XIV, it is a well-known product sold  by Credit Suisse, constructed by Credit Suisse that shut down yesterday  after it lost almost all of its money in trading.  It was really late  Monday, but again, when you have such loose monetary policy --</p><p>CRONK:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  money flooding the market anywhere and everywhere, you're just  beginning to see the overconfidence and the really -- the kinds of bets  that not just individuals took but institution investors.  And do you  expect -- because again, and I keep repeating this line, you find out who's  naked only when the tide goes out.</p><p>CRONK:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And do you worry that that kind of volatility in this kind of  law -- these losses could impact the stock markets and hold back the bull  market as it comes up on its ninth year anniversary?</p><p>CRONK:  Two points there, from the institutional side, you're exactly  right.  So, that's part of what we saw on Monday's action.  So you have  this -- it's a little complex but you have this risk parody and macro CTA  funds that when volatility is really low, their model suggests that they  overweight risk assets.  </p><p>And as soon as volatility spikes, those algorithms or that mass, and just  they have to sell those risk assets, which is why you saw flood in the  treasuries, Monday afternoon, and rates come back down.  To your second  point, the individual, when you see this kind of volatility, it can damage  psyche, right?  </p><p>So, the individual's -- you know, this year has been a narrative of two  months, right?  January was all about pro-tax reform's better growth.  We  walked in with the best earnings expectations for the whole year.  </p><p>Now, February has been all about -- well, wait a minute, what if the fed  goes too far, what if inflation becomes problematic, right?  And those two  narratives have to balance each other out over time.  And if the market,  even today, is still trying to figure out which one is going to play.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you buy stocks here, is what you're saying?</p><p>CRONK:  We buy more of the January (INAUDIBLE) this point, than the  February.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What would change your mind?  Is there any kind of marker that  you're looking for?</p><p>CRONK:  Inflation.  Inflation is the primary marker.  So if you would see a  spike materially higher in inflation data, not just wage inflation but core  inflation as a whole.  And remember, the PCE that the fed uses, is still at  1-1/2 to 1.6 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I said -- I said this yesterday.  Maybe all of that cheap  money from Central Banks, once it winds up in the hands of individuals who  don't just buy risky assets with it, they actually start going out and  spending it.  That's when you need to start worrying.  </p><p>CRONK:  Absolutely.  Yes, that's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  When mom and dad and brother and sister out there in the country  --</p><p>CRONK:  But you don't see that in the consumption patterns quite yet,  right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>CRONK:  I mean, yet.</p><p>WOLF:  Quick question.</p><p>CRONK:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  the volatility continues throughout '18?</p><p>CRONK:  Yes.  Well, certainly on a relative basis, from '17, right?</p><p>WOLF:  I've been told we're wrapping twice, though.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  You said yes, but --</p><p>CRONK:  Yes, absolutely.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you can't bet on stable markets at least in some of these  exchange trader products anymore.</p><p>CRONK:  And volatility is a healthy thing.  So, I think, we should welcome  on more normalized level of volatility, not the extreme low volatility we  had in 2016 and '17.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It has shaken some people out of this market, though.  Darrell,  thank you so much.</p><p>CRONK:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, Sheryl Sandberg's knock against the Vice President,  why the Facebook Chief Operating Officer says Mike Pence's personal role  about social gatherings with alcohol and women, harms all women.  And  Silicon Valley's secret uncovered, a new survey details the climate for  conservatives in the tech business.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back, everybody.  Taking a quick look at Dow Futures  right now.  Meantime, Vice President Mike Pence -- you can take a look at  losses across the board, but you know what, well off their lows of the  morning so far, only 135-point loss on the Dow Futures.  I think it's safe  to say we should prepare ourselves for wild swings like we saw yesterday  where, again, the Dow ended the day up 567 points, but it was down more  than a thousand early on.  Still, we talked about Vice President Mike Pence  in Tokyo delivering a stern warning to North Korea.  Cheryl Casone has the  details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Dagen.  Vice President Pence continuing to put  pressure on North Korea.  On his way to the Winter Olympics in South Korea,  Pence stopped in Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.   Pence reiterated Washington's stance that all option are on the table to  deal with North Korea.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I'm announcing today that  the United States of America will soon unveil the toughest and most  aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea ever.  And we will  continue to isolate North Korea until it abandons its nuclear and ballistic  missile program once and for all.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Well, Pence is set to leave the U.S. allegation to the opening  ceremonies on Friday.  Despite the tough rhetoric, he has stopped short of  ruling out a meeting with Senior North Korean officials while he is there.   Meanwhile, Kim Jong-un is sending his younger sister to South Korea for the  Winter Olympics.  This is the first time any member of the Kim family has  crossed the border.  30-year-old, Kim Yo-jong plans to attend the opening  ceremony on Friday.  She was blacklisted last year by the U.S. Treasury  Department over human rights abuses and censorship.  Well, Vice President  Pence won't be having dinner alone with Kim Yo-jong at the Olympics.  </p><p>He's got a personal rule that's kind of common among Evangelical.  It  doesn't allow him to be alone with women, and he has also said in the past  he won't attend an event if there is alcohol there without his wife by his  side.  Well, Sheryl Sandberg has picked up on this.  She thinks this role  hurts women's growth in the workplace because of missed opportunities to  network with men.  Sandberg is the COO of Facebook, and, of course, the co- founder of Leanin Organization.  Says that if men follow the so-called Mike  Pence rule, it should apply to everyone not just to women.  </p><p>With the flood of each revelations, a recent survey show that half of male  manager say they are uncomfortable participating in basic activities with  women, Dagen.  So, she's saying this is going to hurt it -- because you've  already got, frankly, women already isolated.  That is her point, in  corporate America.  Most male senior managers, CEO, are men.  So, if you're  going to get take away that opportunity, that one-on-one networking, then  if you can't go to lunch with the CEO as a woman, then nobody should go to  lunch with the CEO, men included -- make it a rule for everybody.  </p><p>BELL:  I mean, I think one of the unfortunate responses to the #metoo  movement has been that men do feel like they can't go to lunch with females  that they work with, and be a man to them, or things like that.  </p><p>CASONE:  That's what the survey sounds.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  You know, this is something that I saw in the post Tail Hook  Navy -- because I joined the Navy in 1993.  When I first entered -- and  that was right after a woman who had been chained to a year (INAUDIBLE)  Academy; tail hook it happened.  And there was sort of this, this fear from  men to get close to women, to spend time with women, to socialize with  women, and I do think that it is damaging to women when they want to move  up, and when they need mentors in any workplace whether it's corporate  America or military.  I think that that applies.  And I think this type of,  you know, putting this idea out, you know, certainly is understandable from  a Christian marriage perspective on wanting to sort of protect your  relationship.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  But it is hurtful to people in the workplace.  And I see her  point, I see Sheryl Sandberg's point.</p><p>CASONE:  If that's Mike Pence's choice, that's one thing.  But to adopt  that rule, I think, across American culture, particularly in business, I  think is wrong.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes, I think I would like it as a wife, but as woman in the  workplace, I don't like it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you want to weigh in, because you ran -- I mean, you ran a  business. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I am completely supportive with Sheryl Sandberg's  perspective here.  You cannot, you know, have an environment where you say  you're comfortable with one sex and not the other in the workforce.  It  makes no sense at all.  And he should keep those type of use to himself.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's too late.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a really interesting conversation, though.  Coming up,  creative, fun, closed minds?  The fired Google engineer who is suing the  company for allegedly discriminating against White male conservatives --  White conservative men, maybe onto something.  A revealing new look at how  some conservative employees in big tech, really feels, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A new survey claims conservatives are feeling out of place in  Silicon Valley.  This comes after a former Google engineer sued the tech  giant for discrimination.  Joining me now is Garrett Johnson, Lincoln  Network Co-Founder, and Executive Director.  Garrett, your company put  together this survey.  Tell us about it, what did you find?</p><p>GARRETT JOHNSON, CO-FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, LINCOLN NETWORK:  Good  morning.  So, we put this survey together in response to all of the inbound  questions we get from journalist.  When a James Damore issue becomes a  national conversation, we get inbound, myself and Aaron Ginn, my co- founder, are things as bad as everyone says they are; what's the ground  level of truth.  Unfortunately, there was no data.  You have lots of  companies who report data on diverse issues as they relate to gender,  ethnicity, sexual orientation, but not viewpoint diversity.  So, this is  the first data that we know of on this issue.  And there's assumptions that  things are bad for people who are on the right of center spectrum  conservatives, libertarians.  But this data suggests that it is indeed the  case, and is probably worse than anyone thought.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bad, how?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I was going to ask a question as well, when you  say bias against, what actually are you meaning?  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes, so, in addition to the raw data that we collected from a  little under 400 people, we also collected comments -- people open in the  comments.  We have 23 longer form conversations.  People -- one person said  that he was targeted by his manager because he was a delegate to the  Republican convention.  The manager tried to get him fired.  He recorded  some conversations, you know, behind the manager's back, and was able to  take that to be peace within the country, and save his job.  But the  manager was not fired; there was no repercussions.  You have some people,  you know, who say that, you know, they avoid at going to work the day after  the election because they knew the anti-Trump sentiment would be so strong  and obnoxious that they just didn't want to tolerate it.  So, just  generally, either targeting, feeling comfortable at work, there is this  notion within Silicon Valley -- SalesForce, Google -- that you should bring  your whole self to work.  Well, that's not really the case if you think a  certain way.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Do you think that's really unique to Silicon Valley, though?   When you talk about, like, the post-election sentiment and how they felt?   It seems like that might something that's broader than just looking at  Silicon Valley.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  I think that's right.  I think that Silicon Valley is consistent  with trends throughout the country, but you have to think about the echo  chambers that these tech companies have created with their technology.  You  know, they have enhanced the tribalization of our country with the  platforms that they've created.  And, you know, technology is most consumed  in tech hubs like Silicon Valley.  So, you know, you had your echo chamber,  you live in this bubble, and so it's more intense.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just wonder as they -- as the employee base at Silicon Valley  ages, is this going to change, which is something that Robert brought up?   Because people tend to get more conservative as they get older.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  I think it might.  You know, that's not data that we collected.   This was a pilot survey.  So, it only focused on Silicon Valley.  We're  going to be doing one later this year that will touch other tech hubs and  hopefully capture that data.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Garrett, good to see you.  Thank you so much, Garrett Johnson.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Still ahead, the very latest as investors hang on for another  wild ride in these markets in the next hour with MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, February 7th.</p><p>Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Volatility slamming Wall Street -- investors in for a wild ride yesterday.   The Dow did finish up 567 points but it was down -- there was about a  1,200-point range during the same trading day.</p><p>As of yesterday's close, all three major market gauges are back in positive  territory for the year but not the Dow Transports and not small cap stocks,  we should point out.</p><p>Let's take a look at the futures.  We're showing losses across the board  but they are mild compared to what we saw just one hour ago.  The Dow  futures were down more than 200 points.</p><p>Again, what does this volatility do to shake out the speculators who had  piled into the market and played some wonky bets in the last couple of  years?</p><p>The Atlanta Federal Reserve meantime has lowered its first quarter GDP  forecast.  We're talking about that 5.4 percent last week.  Now Atlanta Fed  thinks the economy is just going to grow at 4 percent -- still high.</p><p>In Europe stocks are moving higher but they're warm, shall we say.  We have  gains across the board.  FTSE 100 up almost 1 percent.  </p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks mostly lower.  The Kospi the worst performer down  there in South Korea -- or over there in South Korea down more than 2  percent.</p><p>Budget battle looming -- lawmakers have until tomorrow night to reach an  agreement to keep the federal government running.  So the House passes a  stopgap spending bill, the fight turns to the Senate where immigration  remains a top issue.</p><p>Speaker of the House Paul Ryan weighed in on the possibility of a shutdown.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  The only reason we do not  have a full budget agreement is because Democrats continue to hold funding  for our government hostage on an unrelated issue.  They must stop using our  troops as pawns in a game of politics.</p><p>I urge the Senate Democrats to stop their filibuster and provide our men  and women in uniform the resources that they need, the support that they  need.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The immigration debate is in full swing amid tragedy in Indiana.   The latest as the illegal immigrant suspected of killing Indianapolis Colts  linebacker Edwin Jackson is charged.</p><p>Plus, a bushel of headlines for Apple as the company says it could offer  rebate for customers who paid full price for battery replacement.  The tech  giant may team with Goldman Sachs to help shoppers finance their phone.   More details on that ahead.</p><p>And is the crypto crash fully upon us?  Why one firm is warning that the  days are numbered for several digital currencies.</p><p>And here with me to break it all down this morning:  Fox News correspondent  Lea Gabrielle; Fox News contributor, 32 Advisers founder and CEO and former  economic adviser to President Obama, he also ran a giant Wall Street bank,  Robert Wolf; and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.</p><p>You'd still be long stocks here though, wouldn't you?  You worry about  interest rates, inflation, deficits, debt -- but not yet.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I missed the whole run.  But if I was  going to make a bet, I would bet stocks do better for the, you know, first  half of '18.  But then I would be nervous to the back half.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but you didn't think even that Congress was going to get  tax reform done.  You talked about that all year long last year.  You  didn't think they would be able to come together to get it done.  </p><p>WOLF:  I've been wrong once in the last 30 years.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You were wrong about the Patriots, too at the Super Bowl.  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Ouch.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just kidding.  But again, short run -- you worry longer run.  </p><p>WOLF:  I worry longer run because I think back-up rates will shift assets.   And then we're going to have a back-up of rates because we're going to have  growth.  We're going to have some wage inflation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So we will talk about that as the morning rolls on.  We have  incredible guests coming up.  White House director of legislative affairs  Marc Short is here, Louisiana Senator John Kennedy, former chief of staff  under President Bush 43 and Business Roundtable president and CEO Josh  Bolton, and Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano, and  the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO\" Stuart Varney.</p><p>You don't want to miss it.</p><p>But first taking a look at futures this morning, we have losses across the  board but really off the lows of the morning -- the Dow futures down just  46 points.  Stocks rebounding yesterday after the biggest sell-off in more  than six years during a volatile session on Monday.  The Dow finishing the  day up 200, 2.3 percent higher; that was a gain of 567 points.</p><p>Joining us now to weigh in, New York Congresswoman Claudia Tenney and New  York Congressman Tom Suozzi.  Good to see you both.  Congresswoman Tenney - - </p><p>REP. CLAUDIA TENNEY (R), NEW YORK:  Yes.  Suozzi.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Suozzi -- I said it right, didn't I Congressman?  </p><p>REP. TOM SUOZZI (D), NEW YORK:  It was close.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Congresswoman Tenney -- your reaction on these markets  because I would argue that the President of your party has put you in a  tough bind where now you're going to get asked about the stock market.  </p><p>TENNEY:  I don't think so.  I mean to be honest with you, the stock market  is not the only determination of what's going on in the marketplace.  I, in  fact, sold a bunch of things last week because I had some things to pay  off.  So after Christmas and all those good things I sold some stuff.</p><p>So I think what you had yesterday was a bargain hunter's market.  And  people around -- all of a sudden the stocks rebounded.  I think when you  look at the interest rates, a little bit of adjustment in the interest  rates with a new fed chairman.  I think that makes a difference.  The  growth from the tax cuts and jobs act they're certainly important.</p><p>And I might cite an industry, the tax foundation has stated that New York  is going to be one of the biggest growth states because of the tax cuts and  jobs act.  So I think it's really interesting to see how this plays out  over the next few months.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman Suozzi -- do you agree with your fellow congressman  from the state of New York, but also have you been hearing from any of your  constituents, given just what happened in the market the last few days or  really in the last week or so?  </p><p>SUOZZI:  You know, people are worried about the effect of the tax plan,  because in my part of the state we're going to be hit very hard by the  elimination of the state and local tax deduction and the tax plan actually  increased the deficit significantly by about $1.5 trillion.</p><p>In addition, there's talk of a new infrastructure plan which will increase  the debt even further.  There's this plan of the CR that's going to be will  be coming up that will increase the debt even further.</p><p>All these things together increase the debt that may have an impact on  actually stimulating the economy in a way but it will cause interest rates  to go up.  When interest rates go up, our debt service goes up because of  our huge deficits in the federal government.  That could be what's scaring  the marketplace.</p><p>So right now, deficits are a big concern to the marketplace.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Congressman Suozzi, were you worried about the debt  doubling under President Obama?  Was that a concern for you?  Were you  worried about it then?  That was over eight years.  </p><p>SUOZZI:  Actually I was in the private sector at the time.  I wasn't paying  quite as close attention at the time but the reality was is that the debt  that doubled during that time was because of the stimulus package, to try  and actually to force the economy to grow.</p><p>The economy has been growing since President Obama's administration and now  it's the Trump administration.  It's been growing, growing, growing,  growing.  And the concern is that by adding debt at this time, we're going  to hyper-inflate the market and get it moving too frothy and that scares  people that our deficits are going to grow and that's why we're seeing this  volatility in the marketplace right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That also falls on members of Congress not in te3rms of cutting  spending.  And I want to point out that the House did pass another stopgap  spending bill yesterday.  It funds the government through March 23rd and  now goes to the senate.</p><p>Leaders there are really -- there's some issue with the defense part of the  stopgap that was passed by the House, what happens with that vote.  But the  Senate is working on a longer two-year budget deal.</p><p>President Trump is throwing an immigration grenade into the budget talks,  saying he's prepared to shut down the government if Congress doesn't pass  border security measures.  </p><p>Listen to this and I'll get your reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  If we don't change the legislation, if we don't get rid of these  loopholes where killers are allowed to come in to our country and continue  to kill, gang members -- and we're just talking about MS-13. There are many  gang members that we don't even mention.</p><p>If we don't change it, let's have a shutdown.  We'll do a shutdown.  We  have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want safety -- and  unrelated but still related, they don't want to take care of our military.   Then shut it down.  We'll go with another shutdown.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congresswoman Tenney, is that helpful?  </p><p>TENNEY:  Let me first say something about Mr. Suozzi's comments.  First of  all, Democrats have no other issues to run and all of a sudden their new- found deficit hawks.  They care a lot about the deficit and the debt which  they never cared about before.  </p><p>And they cared about huge, you know, trillion-dollars in stimulus before  that didn't spur the economy to the levels of growth that we're expecting  to see just in one year of rolling back regulations, cutting taxes.  And  now we're predicting even bigger growth in spite of what the stock market's  fluctuation.</p><p>So I just say that I would not give credit to President Obama for this.  I  think this is clearly the enthusiasm from businesses knowing they're not  going to get sucker-punched by government and officials on the federal and  hopefully not the state side.  So Tom and I know what it's like to live and  work in New York State.</p><p>But on the President's side, I mean the President's a negotiator.  He wants  us to act on this.  He had a very, very generous offer during the State of  the Union on immigration which really shouldn't be impacting what we're  doing with the continuing resolution.</p><p>And I'm concerned about our military.  My son's an active duty Marine.  We  are giving less predictable funding to our military which puts them at risk  and also puts our country's security at risk.  So I'm concerned about that.</p><p>But as far as the immigration package, really what the President has  offered are very similar to things that Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi --  maybe not Nancy Pelosi -- maybe Senator Feinstein have voted on many times  in the past and they've supported, not just voted on but supported as well.</p><p>And so I think that those are things we've got to look to.  I think -- you  know, we have time with DACA.  I think let's sit down in a bipartisan way  and come up with a solution.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, that's what's going on with the top senators pursuing the  two-year budget deal, separating for now stalled immigration fight and  actually increasing spending, Congressman Suozzi, $80 billion a year in  Defense and also on the non-Defense side as well which is what the  Democrats have pushed for, $63 billion.</p><p>So that's an increase of $143 billion a year in spending on Defense and  non-Defense.  If you're worried about the debt and deficits, Congressman  Suozzi, how do you get behind that?  </p><p>SUOZZI:  Yes.  That's something I'm thinking about right now.  You know,  I'm very interested in us working together to try and come up with a plan  to actually keep the government moving forward.  People that are concerned  about Defense and the military; Secretary Mattis was just testifying in our  committee yesterday and talking about how dangerous these continuing  resolutions are and we need long-term spending plans to help our military  and to help every single department that we have throughout the federal  government.</p><p>So I'm interested in a bipartisan plan.  But I'm also concerned about the  fact that we're increasing the deficit.  And you know, talk about new-found  Democrats, Republicans -- we're all in this together, ok.  Republicans and  Democrats, different people from each party have paid attention to deficits  for a long time.  Other people have not paid attention to it.</p><p>I'm concerned that as we increase the deficit, we're going to see an impact  on our interest rates and that's going to cause even more debt for the  federal government.</p><p>I work in a group called the Problem Solvers' Caucus.  I'm the vice  chairman.  That's 24 Democrats, 24 Republicans.  We have talked over and  over again about how we want to have plans working together but increasing  the deficit is one of the worst things we can do.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But how does it help with Nancy Pelosi, the congresswoman  calling thousand-dollar bonuses \"pathetic crumbs\".  Do you think $1,000 to  one of your constituents, Congressman is crumbs?  </p><p>SUOZZI:  I absolutely don't think that's the case.  And I think that the  idea was that it was a small percentage was going to lower income people.   But in America there's 105 million full-time jobs; 59 million people make  less than $50,000 a year.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Right.</p><p>SUOZZI:  86 million people make less than $75,000 a year so $1,000 is a big  impact on a lot of families especially these folks that are making $50,000  a year, $75,000 a year.  </p><p>TENNEY:  I agree.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've said it -- I was -- you know, I'm the child of small  business owners who were never helped by the government.  And to say $1,000  which where I grew up can feed a family of four for a month, I just found  that to be just completely deaf.</p><p>But I want to move on, Congresswoman Tenney, to President Trump facing some  backlash over what the White House says was a joke he made on Monday.  The  President was slamming Democrats for not standing and applauding during his  first state of the union address.  So watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  They were like deaf and un-American, un-American.  Somebody said  treasonous, I mean -- yes, I guess why not.  Can we call that treason?  Why  not?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I know what treason is because Maria Bartiromo gave me a  pocket constitution for Christmas.</p><p>TENNEY:  Oh, good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's Article 3, Section 3 of our constitution.  So the  definition of treason is very specific.  But you said, Congresswoman Tenney  that Democrats might not be treasonous but they're un-American and don't  love our country.  Do you still stand by that?</p><p>TENNEY:  Yes.  That's not what I said.  What I said was them not standing  for families who had their children murdered by MS-13, not standing for our  flag, not standing for God, not standing for all the things that we stand  for as Americans, yes I think the President has a point there.</p><p>I certainly don't support that he said treasonous.  I think he said it as a  joke.  But now, you know, the Democrats are out trying to raise money,  claiming I said Democrats are un-American.  Of course that's not true.   Many of my supporters are Democrats.</p><p>And the issue is this.  Why wouldn't they stand for things that were common  sense?  I know a lot of Republicans -- I looked back and looked the old  reels of Obama's state of the union addresses.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>TENNEY:  And when things he talked about Americanism and unity between us,  the Republicans stood on their feet and clapped for that.  There were real  easy chances for the Democrats to stand and I'm sure Mr. Suozzi would have  liked to stand if Nancy Pelosi would let them.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mr. Suozzi -- you get about 10 seconds to respond.  So quickly.  </p><p>TENNEY:  People are sick and tired of the politics back and forth.  They  want us to get things done.  Democrats, Republicans -- forget it.  We're  Americans.  We need to work together and solve problems.  People are sick  of all this personal stuff.</p><p>TENNEY:  I agree.</p><p>SUOZZI:  All this talk about treason, talking about shutting down  government, it's irresponsible.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tenney, Suozzi -- Congressmen both, thank you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Investors bracing for another crazy ride on Wall Street.  Take a  look at the futures right now.  92 point loss on the Dow futures.  Listen,  the futures were off by more than 200 points early in the session.  Again,  a return to volatility in this market where the markets had been so stable,  very few wild swings -- the Dow was up for 10 months in a row, including  January.  That's the longest run since the late 50s.  So again, we've been  on a rocket ship high.</p><p>Meantime a powerful winter storm pounding about 20 states.  Cheryl Casone  has the details -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.   A massive storm actually --  Dagen.</p><p>It's moving from Texas to Maine.  It's going to bring heavy snow to New  England, a mix of snow and freezing rain to the northeast and the mid- Atlantic regions, and ice and rain to the Midwest and the southeast.</p><p>According to FlightAware about 800 flights have been canceled so far today,  more than 100 of them at Newark Liberty International Airport here in the  New York area.</p><p>Well, the illegal immigrant suspected of killing Indianapolis Colts player  Edwin Jackson while driving drunk now faces federal immigration charges.   Manuel Orrego Savala charged with illegally re-entering the United States  for a second time after he was deported in 2007 and 2009.</p><p>Police say Jackson, who was 26 years old, as well as 54-year-old Jeffrey  Monroe, an Uber driver, died early Sunday morning as they were standing on  the side of I-70 in Indiana.</p><p>Orrego-Savala is due in court today in connection with that highway crash.   Orrego Savala is not the only illegal immigrant who keeps coming back to  the U.S., by the way.  The \"Washington Times\" reports that one Mexican has  managed to get deported 44 times in 15 years.  Of course, he has also  managed to sneak back across the border at least that many times.  The  runner up was ousted 40 times from the United States between 2001 to 2015 - - Dagen.  A lot of crossings.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, fake dirt for the dossier -- new details on the Clinton  associate who may have said allegations to the author of the anti-Trump  dossier.</p><p>And banking on Apple -- how Goldman Sachs reportedly wants to cash in on  expensive iPhones.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p>New revelations this morning about that anti-Trump dossier.  According to  South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy, a Clinton family confidant may have  played a key role in feeding information to Christopher Steele.   Christopher Steele being the former British spy who compiled the document  in the weeks leading up to the election.</p><p>Here's what Congressman Gowdy told Martha MacCallum last night on \"THE  STORY\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TREY GOWDY (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  When you hear who the source or one  of the sources of that information is, you're going to think oh my gosh,  I've heard that name somewhere before.  Where could it possibly have been?  </p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS HOST:  The foreign source? </p><p>GOWDY:  The domestic source.  And I'm trying to think how Secretary Clinton  defined him.  I think she said he was an old friend who e-mailed her from  time to time.  </p><p>MACCALLUM:  Sidney Blumenthal?  </p><p>GOWDY:  That would be really warm.  You're warm.  Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us this morning is Fox News senior judicial analyst  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  Lay it out for us.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  My thoughts --  my thought is that Trey Gowdy is basically a very decent, honest guy.  But  you cannot look at raw intelligence because you have a top secret security  clearance because you're a member of the House Intelligence Committee and  selectively release parts of it and retain parts of it to produce a  political narrative which is basically what he was doing with Martha.</p><p>Now, Martha did an absolute A plus, 2.0 job of interviewing him.  But he is  not taking seriously his top secret security clearance if he thinks he can  selectively release things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about what he disclosed because we know from the -- Senator  Chuck Grassley released an unclassified version of this recent letter that  he sent to the Justice Department, in part urging criminal investigation  into Christopher Steele for lying to the FBI.</p><p>But it also revealed additional information that was provided to Steele.   And we knew that ultimately it went to him initially because from a friend  of the Clintons.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm also a fan and a friend of Chuck Grassley.  But here is  why Christopher Steele will never, take it to the bank, be prosecuted  because Christopher Steele was an FBI asset for many years, perhaps while  he was also an MI-6 agent.</p><p>So think about this.  You have a British spy who is also spying for the  Americans.  What do the British call that -- espionage.  The last thing  they want is to put him in a criminal courtroom where he'll say here's what  the Americans told me.  Here's what the British told me.  Here's what I  told the Americans.  Here's what I told the British.</p><p>We have a group called The Five Eyes, E-Y-E-S.  He knows this.  Countries  in the world that we regularly exchange intel with and they're our friends  -- Great Britain, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and the United States.  In  return for that, we have an agreement.  We will not solicit or recruit  agents from one of the others.</p><p>Guess what the FBI did -- recruited Chris Steele.  That violated the  agreement and exposed Chris Steele to criminal prosecution.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to get back to the dossier.  This dossier based on the memo  that we've seen that was released by Devin Nunes, based on additional  information from the likes of Senator Chuck Grassley, it was funded -- the  dossier was funded by the Democrats. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was -- there was -- Chris Christie was being fed information  by at least one Clinton associate.  And it was used to get a warrant  through the FISA court on an American citizen.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I am going to withhold judgment on that until I see, if I ever  see it because it shouldn't come out, but maybe it will -- everything that  was presented to the FISA court.</p><p>Now, the FISA court is a weird court.  They meet in secret.  The judges are  not allowed to take any notes or pens or papers out of the building or  bring anything into the building.  And there's no adversary</p><p>You introduce a document into a real court, somebody else is going to  challenge that document.  In FISA it's only the government lawyers.  It's  up to the judge to challenge the document.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think the question is how much it was actually -- whether  that was a point of reference or one of many points of reference.  Because  I think, you know, as former clandestine case officer, working for --  trained by the CIA, I can tell you that when you put together a dossier of  this form that is essentially opposition research, you cannot call this  intelligence.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  This is opposition research.  So it depends on what else was  presented to the FISA court.  We don't know that.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Bobby and I were talking about this during the break.</p><p>WOLF:  I'm going to give you a soft ball but I want -- but I think it's  important for the viewers to hear it.  One, do you think the Nunes memo  should have been released?  Now, do you think the Democratic memo should be  released?  And do you think, you know, this opens a whole Pandora's Box for  future memos?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes to all of the above.  Once the Nunes memo came out.</p><p>WOLF:  Do you think that should have been released?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, if it hadn't been released, we wouldn't be going down  this warren hole.  But once it came out, you have a Republican version,  four-page summary version of hundreds of pages of intel, some of which Trey  Gowdy teased Martha MacCallum about.</p><p>Now you're going to have a Democratic version, it's going to come to the  opposite conclusion.  The American people are not children.  We now should  be entitled to see all the raw intel.  The intelligence committee would go  through the roof, you know this, if that raw intel is revealed.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to many people it looks like abuse of power by the FBI -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Abuse of power by the Justice Department.  And I want to point  out -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It shouldn't be a surprise that they abused power.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I know but we're disgusted by it.  And we are surprised.</p><p>And we found out this morning -- this is more breaking news this morning.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The FBI texting saga continues.  Fox News has new information  after reviewing thousands of previously unseen text between Peter Strzok,  the FBI agent and his then-mistress, Lisa Page.</p><p>In one message from 2015, Strzok then said about people who voted against  FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe's wife in the Virginia state senate race  calling them, quote, \"ignorant hillbillies\".  I'm from that state -- thank  you.</p><p>In another text, Page told Strzok -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Lord, have mercy on him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In September of 2016 that, quote, \"POTUS wants to know  everything that we're doing\".  Senate investigators told Fox News -- and  that's POTUS, President Obama -- told Fox News that the last message is  raising questions about President Obama's personal involvement in the  Clinton e-mail investigation -- Judge.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There are about 8,000 FBI agents and we're going through the  text of two of them.  I'm going to tell you the 7,998 are not very happy  about this.  They have very, very strong political opinions.  They're  entitled to those political opinions.  They've say said things about groups  of people because of their origin, which is dumb.  But they're entitled to  be dumb.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Peter Strzok was somebody who worked on the Clinton  investigation -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct -- so let me finish.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and then worked on the Mueller team until he got kicked to  human resources because Mueller found out about it.  </p><p>WOLF:  Also Dagen -- and also brought back the Comey, Clinton investigation  that he was part of that the Democrats were not happy with. </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So look, if -- </p><p>WOLF:  I mean there's a lot of he said-she said -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Final word.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  If a strong political opinion animates a law enforcement  decision; if decisions are made for political not bona fide law enforcement  reasons -- that is wrong and it can constitute misconduct in office.  But  words alone don't constitute misconduct in office.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I just wonder if we'll ever get to the bottom of this.  And  I'm glad you're here.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's a -- </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.</p><p>I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p>It's Wednesday, February 7th; your top stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) on Wall Street, the Dow swinging more than a thousand points  from the lows to the highs of the day yesterday, adding 567 points, the  major market gauges (ph) finishing the session in the green and the Dow,  S&amp;P, and NASDAQ, are all back in positive territory for the year.</p><p>Despite the volatility, Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin isn't worried.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, SECRETARY, US TREASURY:  The stock market is up  significantly over 30 percent since President Trump was elected.</p><p>We're monitoring the stock markets.

It comes some iPhone users may be getting a  rebate on replacement batteries.</p><p>And 'Gronk' robbed, we have the 911 call that the star Tight End hopes will  catch the suspect who broke into his home during the Super Bowl.</p><p>But now to the latest on Wall Street, volatile swings slamming stocks  yesterday, also on Monday, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee  Sanders weighing in on that wild ride, from Capitol Hill.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, PRESS SECRETARY, WHITE HOUSE:  Look, the economy is  incredibly strong right now.</p><p>The president's focus continues to be on the long-term economic  fundamentals which like I just said are very strong in this country.</p><p>We're infinitely better off today than where we were before the president  took office particularly on the economy, we have historically low  unemployment, and we actually have increasing wages for American workers.</p><p>There's nothing that's taken place over the last couple of days in our  economy that's fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This morning we have losses to report, 88-point loss on the Dow  Futures, 86-point loss there but again off the lows of the morning.</p><p>Joining me now is White House Director of Legislative Affairs, Marc Short.</p><p>Marc the president because he retweeted and talked about the record- breaking run in the stock market so much has put all of you folks working  at the White House in a pickle in the sense that you've now -- forced to  talk about the stock market, when in past administrations you could talk  about the economy but generally stayed away from those kind of day-to-day,  week-to-week, month-to-month, swings in stocks?</p><p>MARC SHORT, DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS, WHITE HOUSE &amp; ASSISTANT TO  PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:  Well, I guess the way we look at it is the markets  are up over 30 percent as you heard secretary Mnuchin say, since election  day, over $7 trillion in asset value, added to individuals' portfolios  since election day.</p><p>The reality is unemployment is at a 17-year low, the economy is growing  strong and in fact the Atlanta Fed estimated a 5.4 percent on GDP, that  sort of growth triggers inflation expectations.</p><p>And I think what you're seeing is simply a reaction from the market to  those expectations of higher inflation.</p><p>But that's not necessarily a bad thing when you consider that wage - wages  have been stuck and stagnant for so long particularly throughout the Obama  years and people are actually seeing higher wages today, and so there's  just a market recalibration going.</p><p>But as Sarah said from the podium, the fundamentals of the economy remain,  strong.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll -- I'll just point out, the Atlanta Fed adjusted that  growth expectation down to four percent, that's still a very strong growth  number -</p><p>SHORT:  Yes -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - but do you -</p><p>SHORT:  - Dagen we -- during the Obama years it averaged 1.8 percent GDP  growth.  I think we'll take a four percent growth, we'd be pretty excited -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - That's a -</p><p>SHORT:  - about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - that's a one quarter, people - now listen, some people are  calling for four percent growth for the whole year, Jamie Dimon has said  that to Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>But are you going to try and back away from talking about the stock market?</p><p>Have you had any discussions with the president about, 'let's stick to the  economy, let's stick to the wage growth, let's stick to how people feel at  home and their pocketbooks being more full because of the tax reform,'  rather than talking about a market that could be in for greater swings,  certainly in the coming years than we've seen, this very low volatility  environment the last couple of years?</p><p>SHORT:  Sure.  I think that's fair.</p><p>You would expect higher volatility throughout this year but at the same  time I think the president's proud of the gains in the turnaround in the  market, just as he's excited about the turnaround for mainstream Americans  too when they see 4.1 percent unemployment at a 17-year low, when they see  the economy growing, the last couple quarters averaging three percent, as I  said significantly better than 1.8 percent they experienced during eight  years of the Obama administration.</p><p>I think he's going to - he's going to tout although successes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was some heavy - we're - we've been talking about  volatility and that just means swings but a lot of investors, even retail  investors have been betting on stable markets or betting against  volatility, the last couple of years, and with some of these exchange- traded products, there were couple of major ones, one run by Credit Suisse  that shut down on Tuesday because essentially all the money in them, a few  billion dollars, was wiped out late on Monday.</p><p>It kind of begs the question of, how are retail investors you know, did  they know what was going on, how were these things allowed to exist if they  were so volatile, is that something that you think that securities  regulators should look at?</p><p>SHORT:  I think that the president has a great team and Treasury and the  SEC that look at that.  I'm not expect - I'm not expecting any sort of  legislation on that front which is more my focus area -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>SHORT:  - Dagen, so I think that sure, there is a continued oversight of  that.</p><p>But if there's a greater volatility this year I think the reality is that  the fundamentals remain strong, the president has continued to roll back  the regulatory front, he's going to continue to make sure that there's tax  relief provided to the American people and we hope that the economy  continues to grow the way it has been.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well let's talk about Capitol Hill because there is a budget  battle to talk about, a government that -- if they can't come to some  agreement is going to shut down at midnight on Friday morning.</p><p>The House did approve another stop-gap spending bill yesterday --</p><p>SHORT:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:   -- the Senate looking to strike a longer-term deal -</p><p>SHORT:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - boosting spending for both domestic and military programs but  branching away from Immigration efforts so trying to separate that  Immigration fight from a funding bill.</p><p>President Trump reasserted his focus on Immigration, saying this at the  White House yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  If we don't  change it, let's have a shutdown; we'll do a shutdown and it's worth it for  country.</p><p>I'd love to see a shutdown, if we don't get this stuff taken care of.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What do you expect the budget outcome to be Marc and will the  president - would he - would he get behind this spending bill that's being  put together -</p><p>SHORT:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - in the Senate, if it separates Immigration from it?</p><p>SHORT:  So, it's a good question, there are couple things there.</p><p>One, keep in mind the president campaigned on rebuilding our military; the  budget cap deal that we expect to be announced perhaps as soon as today, I  think will provide the deliverance on the president's commitment to rebuild  our military, you'll see significant reinvestment there.</p><p>And I think that's one of the priorities that he set.</p><p>I do not expect a shutdown right now.</p><p>I think what the president is looking ahead to is the budget cap deal put  in place, higher caps on Defense spending that allows the appropriators to  then go write the bill that will come to the president's desk probably at  the end of March, on spending for 2018.</p><p>What he's saying once again is the same pledge he's made all along, which  is, he is expecting Congress to deliver on the promises we made on the  campaign that we would invest in border security and he's - he's going to  hold Congress' 'feet to the fire' on that and if they're not going to  deliver on that border security, he's saying, he's OK taking that extra  step.</p><p>But we're not expecting a shutdown this week, we are expecting a budget cap  deal to be in place and we're expecting it to be a victory on the  president's commitment to rebuild our military.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll - I'll say that the Senate deal, the two-year budget deal  that's been pursued by senators, it actually, military spending comes in at  629 billion a year which is above the amount that the president sought in  his budget proposal to Congress last year.</p><p>It also increases Non-Defense spending so combined, 80 billion extra for  Defense, 63 billion extra for Non-Defense, that comes in at a hundred and  forty-three billion.</p><p>If somebody is worried about debt, deficits, and higher inflation, are you  OK with that?</p><p>SHORT:  I think that there is - there are concerns about the deficit  spending on this front.</p><p>Let me go back to the premise of your question, that was that, is that  secretary Mattis also said to Congress that he wants to see the numbers  stick to the NDA level, the National Defense Authorization Act that had it  at the six twenty-nine number plus 71 billion in overseas contingency  operations to bring it up to about 700 billion for the year.</p><p>So that is the number that the secretary had asked -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.</p><p>SHORT:  - for.</p><p>But I think that regarding the deficits, keep in mind that you'll see the  president put forward a budget that will cut spending when it comes forward  next week.</p><p>The challenge will be though, is just like last year, the president put  forward a budget that balanced in 10 years and yet Congress then summarily  dismissed it.</p><p>So, we do have serious concerns about the deficits and we do think that  Congress should do a stronger job of being responsible to taxpayers in- clearing those deficits.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick Marc, are we going to get some big infrastructure  announcement on Monday?</p><p>SHORT:  You're going to see the Infrastructure announcement rolled out and  we're expecting it on Monday.</p><p>The president spoke about it some, at the State of the Union and we do  expect that you'll see greater details of those plans coming forward on  Monday.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Marc, good to see you.</p><p>We covered -</p><p>SHORT:  Thanks for having -</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - a lot -</p><p>SHORT:  - me on.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  - of ground - Thank you so much.</p><p>Marc Short, from the White House.</p><p>Coming up, a Super Bowl title, not the only thing Rob Gronkowski was robbed  of, you'll hear the Patriots superstar's frantic 911 call after thieves  broke into his home and stole guns and safes.</p><p>Plus, Goldman Sachs eyeing Apple, the bank wants to cash in on some iPhone  customers.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get ready for another wild ride on Wall Street.</p><p>Take a look at how the Futures are trading right now.</p><p>Dow Futures are down just 45 points, again a major bounce back, lots of  volatility again yesterday but after the worst percentage loss on Monday,  since August of 2011, the Dow - there was trading in a twelve hundred-point  range yesterday, managed to close up 567 points.</p><p>Dow Futures were down 200 points at 6:00 a.m., now look at them?  </p><p>Holding steady!</p><p>And Goldman Sachs is looking to help people buy the next iPhone and other  Apple gadgets.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has more details on this, hey Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  New twist for Goldman Dagen, \"The Wall Street Journal\" is  reporting that Goldman Sachs is in talks with Apple to finance customers  purchases of Apple products like, yes, the one thousand dollars iPhone X.

It's Wednesday, February 7th, your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Wild swings on Wall Street 567 point gain yesterday but again the  range of swings up 1,200 points on Tuesday.  Investors in for a volatile  ride yesterday and maybe today.  Take a look at how futures are trading  right now.  We had a more than 200-point loss on the Dow futures starting  to show 6:00 a.m. now down just 70 points but again volatility is back  after people got used to very calm markets, Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ start  today up for the year not the same story for the transports and small caps.  </p><p>Meantime, the Atlanta Federal Reserve has lowered its first-quarter GDP  forecast from 5.4 percent we reported that last week now down to four  percent, still strong.  In Europe stocks are heading higher across the  board, the biggest winner there being the FTSE 100 in England up more than  one percent.  In Asia overnight stocks mostly lower, the Nikkei eking out a  small gain, the KOSPI in South Korea the worst performer falling more than  two percent.  Budget battles looming, lawmakers have until tomorrow night  to reach an agreement to keep the federal government running.  The house  already passing a stopgap spending bill and now the fight turns to the  Senate how the Senate will vote on that and immigration is still a top  issue there.  White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short  weighed in on that debate last hour. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARC SHORT, WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS:  We were expecting  Congress deliver on the promises we made on the campaign that we would  invest in border security.  And he's going to hold Congress' feet to fire  on that and if they're not going to deliver on that border security he's  saying he is okay taking that extra step.  But we are not expecting a  shutdown this week, we are expected a budget cut deal is to be in place and  we're expecting to be an evictee on the president's commitment to rebuild  our military. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The latest on that battle and the immigration straight fight  ahead.  Steve Wynn out, the details as the billionaire mogul stepped down  as CEO of his company following sexual misconduct allegations.  Sheryl  Sandberg calling for fairness when it comes to the Pence role.  The Vice  President won't eat alone with a woman other than his wife and he won't  attend events where alcohol is served without his wife either.  But Sheryl  Sandberg says women's careers are ultimately hurt by this.  And SpaceX  taking it to infinity and beyond!  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  3 2 1 -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The company launching their most powerful rocket since the  Apollo mission sending a test to roadster into orbit more on the giant leap  for the private space race ahead.  And here to break it all down Fox News  Correspondent Lea Gabrielle, Fox News Contributor 32 Advisory Founder and  CEO and Former Economic Advisory to President Obama Robert Wolf, And CFRA  Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell.  I was looking on Twitter, I think that  you were called tolerable this morning Mr. Wolff, how about that?</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, that's -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm just -- I -- I am not making it up. </p><p>WOLF:  You know, this has been a really fun morning so I'm expect -- you  know, I see all you guys getting tweets saying, oh my God, I love seeing  you on.  I am waiting for one of those for me. </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, sitting next to you I can  tell you they enjoyed to be with you.  It's more than tolerable to enjoy. </p><p>WOLF:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I think that the volatility that we saw in the market, the  massive sell-off on Monday, biggest point decline in the history of the Dow  but also the biggest percentage decline in since 2011.  It is important to  have somebody with experience who's here.  And that is no knock on your  age, I mean that -- I mean that from the bottom of my heart. </p><p>WOLF:  Thank you.  Well, I started really young on Wall Street 21, so when  I left at 50, you know, it was -- I felt like I had three great decades.  A  few things and -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you want to -- we'll save it because we're going to talk  about the markets.  And you just have to tell people, some of the guests  are coming up later this hour.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  That's a tease, that's quite a tease.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get your -- I want to get your thoughts because again  this is just -- </p><p>WOLF:  Great guess what I was a going to say. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, so I -- the last few days felt like things that Mr. Wolf  and I have experienced covering the markets being involved in the markets  for so many years.  Joining the conversation this morning Louisiana Senator  John Kennedy, Former Chief of Staff under President George W. Bush,  Business Roundtable, CEO and President Joshua Bolten and Host of Varney &amp;  Company, Stuart Varney.  You don't want to miss it.  So volatility has come  back.  This is our top story.  Wall Street bouncing back but again they  kind of wild swings that we have seen in the market where many people have  bet billions of dollars on stable markets the last year or two was a big  winning bet.  And some people made 800 percent betting against volatility  but it came back and you had a couple of these exchange-traded products  wiped out, they closed -- they closed for good on Tuesday.  Now to you,  what were you going to say? </p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I mean listen.  We have spoken a lot since you know the Lehman  crisis where I spent you know a few days at the Fed there.  This is not  that type of crisis, this is not where on a one-directional down trade  everyone should be nervous that type of way where there's contagion coming.   This is actually just the opposite, you have a balancing equation right now  between the bears and the bulls that we spoke about between a rising rate  environment that makes people nervous versus very good corporate earnings  and growth.  </p><p>And the question is who wins and we have not seen a rising rate environment  for decades and so, you know, when I started in the 80s we were 12 percent,  we have been one directional, you know, for three decades.  And so at the  end of the day, we will be in an environment where we are not sure who is  going to win, it feels to me that the short term -- short term because of  tax reform corporate profits in the global growth will outperform for the  equity market versus a rising rate environment.  That's how it feels but  there is going to be incredible volatility. </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  I agree with that and what I  will say going back to your initial point about this isn't Lehman Brothers  days.  We have credit availability actually spreads on the 10 and the two- year have improved over the last several trading days.  So that's a good  sign and the inversion of the yield curve is a huge implication for us  going into a recession. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And that's a huge sign.  Inversion is where shorter-term rates  are higher than the longer term rates and -- because people are betting  basically buying longer-term debt thinking that there is going to be some  sort of calamity in the economy. </p><p>BELL:  Exactly.  And it's a key indicator. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But so can -- better economy can rising wages still drive this  market higher in coming year, Lindsey?</p><p>BELL:  I think so but we saw in the last couple days this market is a very  skittish market, they're going to be watching inflation, they're going to  be watching the 10 year, they're going to be watching wage data and wage  data that we got on Friday was good 2.9 percent but I mean when we are in a  boom times that wage growth is more like 3-1/2, four percent. </p><p>WOLF:  The one thing that is really different versus you know other  volatile times is the -- what Lea was talking earlier about the whole idea  of algorithmic and programmatic trading where it's not based on experience,  it's just based on -- there is no human touch to it and so the pendulum  swings farther each way. </p><p>BELL:  I was thinking about that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But is this something -- but this is -- I want to get to Kevin  Corke but this is something that we have known about though.  I remember  the flash crash 2010, this is why this 15-minute halts on stocks were put  in place.  So this is nothing new, you had to expect it, it was like people  got conned into thinking that volatility would never come back that  everything goes up in one direction that I can bet on Bitcoin, I can bet,  you know, a stable stock market, I can bet on anything and everything and  nothing ever goes down.  I mean again --</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I know you were not going to like this but The President has  mentioned the great stock market at least 25 times just in the month of  January. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I -- listen, I -- </p><p>WOLF:  And I will just tell you if you're not -- I know but that it not a  gage for the economy that we actually usually look at -- we look at many  other gages and we should give him credit.  The economy is doing well, but  I think using the stock market as that key indicator is not the best way. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I said that from I think the day that he took office.   Even before -- no, I said you try to take credit for the record-breaking  run in the stock market on the way up and you are going to own it way down.   And I do think The President by talking about it so much even to the troops  during his Thanksgiving message that he puts all the people at the White  House in a position where now they have got to talk about it.  Whether it's  guest on this program whether it's Sarah Huckabee Sanders, whether it's the  treasury secretary, treasury secretary I understand he talks about the  stability of markets to make sure the markets are functioning properly that  is something the treasury secretary would talk about but in terms of --  now, they're trying to pivot back to just talking about the economy and it  is going to be hard.  Now I want to get to this budget issue because  lawmakers are scrambling to avoid a government shutdown set for tomorrow  night, tomorrow at midnight while President Trump trends to shut the  government down over his demands for border security.  Kevin Corke covering  the story from the White House and he has the very latest.  Hey, Kevin. </p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning to you,  Dagen.  Always nice to see you now the conventional wisdom in Washington is  typically speaking -- something will get done before Friday midnight but to  get to that C.R. that continuing resolution to give the government open and  funded, there are a lot of people who are concerned that they're probably  going to have to deal with most contentious issue and quite some time here  in Washington, you know, what I am talking about it's DACA, it's Dreamers  and most of all it is border security.  The President making it very plain  yesterday that look this is something that has got to be solved, he wants  it figured out now.  Now that is despite the threat of a democratic led  shutdown of the government. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I would love to see a  shutdown if we don't get this stuff taking care of.  So we have to strength  our borders not by a little bit but by a lot.  We are so far behind the  time and by the way, the world is laughing at us because they can't believe  these policies, they don't have it.  I could name 15 of them right now, no  other country in the world has what we have.  And we are going to get it  stopped and if we have to shut it down because the Democrats don't want  safety and unrelated but still related.  They don't want to take care of  our military then shut it down.  We will go with another shutdown.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE:  You understand what they are doing here right?  What he is  basically saying is you will be on the side of taking nonresidents, aliens,  people who are here illegally versus picking to be on the side of the  American people, that is the strategy here.  But I should also tell you  this, Dagen, over on Capitol Hill, all is not lost, so says Masters, Mitch  McConnell, and Schumer. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I'm optimistic that  very soon we'll be able to reach an agreement.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I have discussed some of  the outlines with my caucus that I think we are very happy with and  hopefully the Republicans are and then we can get something really good  done. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CORKE:  Now, let's be honest a lot of this is jesting for public  consumption but I don't think there's any of doubt.  We will see something  happen before Friday midnight, we'll be watching very carefully from our  perch.  And I promise that truck which is about to drive right by is far  enough away that I am safe, back to you. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what -- you know what I fear the most Kevin for you  leaf blowers.  They are -- they are the worst thing on the plant, scarier  than a chainsaw. </p><p>CORKE:  Yes.  True story. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I brought it and it was so loud and so annoying.  Kevin, great  to see.  Kevin Corke from The White House for us.  Real quick everybody on  this budget deal, here is what bothers me about the Republicans show me  some spending restraints because again this deal that the senators are  putting through $80 billion a year more in defense spending, nondefense  spending, increasing by $63 billion a year and then we're going to be  talking about infrastructure. </p><p>GABRIELLE:  And that is the problem it's because they can't get it passed  without getting some Democrat support and Democrats won't support it unless  they get some sort of a match to the increasing defense spending, right? </p><p>WOLF:  But a few things.  That is not uncommon, that you have discretionary  spending and nondiscretionary go up equally.  That's not -- number two.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is the problem -- it's not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- 20 trillion debt.</p><p>WOLF:  Number two, the Republicans have always been a pay go OK party.  Now  all of a sudden they are no longer fiscal, they find it --</p><p>GABRIELLE:  The military has been suffering since the budget control last  2011 the secret --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF:  I'm not talking about the military.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I'm not talking about the military, we're talking about  the nondiscretionary.</p><p>WOLF:  And as you know Claire McCaskill went on the floor and said let's  pass all the spending we need for the military true or not true. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is true.</p><p>WOLF:  Is she a Democrat? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes. </p><p>WOLF:  And it didn't get passed, so listen, we can talk partisan politics  all day, we are all supportive of the military our -- my only point is the  Republican party has always been fiscal hoax and all of a sudden we have a  trillion-dollar deficit from the tax reform. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and the Democrats said -- the Democrats have always wanted  to spend everybody else's money and not give it back to us and not give us  tax cuts.  And now all of a sudden they are worried about the sky falling  because of the budget deficit. </p><p>WOLF:  How about where we all agree -- how about where you all agree we  should not have a government shutdown, that does not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think everyone does agree that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I agree because the military doesn't get paid, that's what  shameful. </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think -- I think the only one who is not saying that right  now is President Trump and I think the reason he is saying what he is  saying is because he is appealing to his base.  And he's prone hyperbole.   Immigration. </p><p>WOLF:  Right.  But the -- but let's be clear, a government shutdown costs  over a billion dollars a day the last one, that's not a good thing for  anybody. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And doesn't make (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>WOLF:  And I'm not supportive of attaching DACA to a government shutdown  neither.  I think one is budgetary but we should -- we should --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want some spending restraints, Republicans spending  restraint.  Can we show it?  Can we see it?  More ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  Steve Wynn resigning as Chairman and CEO of Wynn  Resorts.  Cheryl Casone has more details.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Big news, Dagen.  Wynn has that Steve Wynn's  resignation, it's effective immediately.  This comes after sexual  misconduct allegations against the Las Vegas billionaire.  A number of  women have claimed that Wynn harassed or assaulted them, one case led to a  $7.5-million settlement.  Now, Wynn is still denying those allegations.   Shares of the company up nine percent in the premarket.  It was down  earlier.  Stock to watch today.</p><p>Well, a Facebook executive is taking issue with Mike Pence's rule about  being around women.  He has a personal rule that's common among a lot of  evangelicals.  Doesn't allow him to be alone with women.  He's also said in  the past, he won't attend an event with alcohol without his wife by his  side.  Well, Sheryl Sandberg thinks this rule hurts women's growth in the  workplace because missed opportunity to network with men.  A lot of times  they're superiors.  Sandberg, the CEO of Facebook and the co-founder of  Lennon says that if men followed the so-called Mike Pence Rule, it should  apply to everybody, not just women but the flood of #MeToo revolutions, a  recent survey showed half of male managers said their uncomfortable  participating in basic activities with women. </p><p>Well, President Trump like what he saw as a guest of honor at France's  Bastille Day parade last July, so much he wants a similar parade perhaps on  Pennsylvania Avenue to celebrate 4th of July.  Trump is asking the defense  department to throw a parade to show off American military power.  White  House officials and the Pentagon have confirmed that a military parade is - - well, they're talking about it.  Options are being put on table, they say  they're planning something.  Last time we had a full military parade in  D.C. was after the Gulf War back in '91.  It cost $12 million.  So you got  to throw out the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think a parade to celebrate our troops, to celebrate our  defense, to celebrate our country is wonderful but we as a country are so  above these parades you see from other countries where they need to put on  display their weapons and need to show over what they have and if this in  any way smells of that type of parade I think will be resented by our  troops because we are above that. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF:  There was a rule that President Trump may actually ride in one of  the tanks. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Did you just make that up? </p><p>WOLF:  I did. </p><p>BELL:  Oh my god.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That worked very well.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  You got me there.</p><p>WOLF:  I did.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No. That worked so well for Mike Dukakis, that basically ended  his presidential run but I want to point something out -- </p><p>WOLF:  Tuesday.  You got me there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  So -- but one thing, but if that happens that you say the  military wouldn't like it but it would like the Soviet Union or North  Korea, I mean, that is the appearance. </p><p>BELL:  It is unnecessary, it looks silly.  I think something to celebrate  our troops is one thing, to celebrate country is something but if we start  making this look like a big display like we see in North Korea, it's silly,  it's unnecessary and we as a country are above it. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wouldn't you rather have $20 million put towards new aircraft or  a new tank? </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that we should thank those who have served and do serve  who basically are protecting our freedom.  We say we're the land of the  free because we are the home of the brave.  We need to thank these  individuals every single day.  Thank you for your service. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Oh, thank you for saying that.  And let's thank them all of  those who serve and the families of those who serve by showing them off, by  not making them jump through you-know-what's to put on a parade.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And I have my R. Riveter bag right here.  This is made  by the spouses of people of men and women who are serving in -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>WOLF:  And I have to show my wounded warriors here because I'm a big  supporter and to give the 20 million to wounded warriors.  So we have tons  of different ways to give the money versus the parade.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  You can see parades around the world as you see are vessels and  around the world supporting our country.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  The trickle-down effect of President Trump's tax  plan, how cutting corporate taxes could help millions of American workers.   Plus, Houston we have liftoff, more incredible video from the SpaceX rocket  launch, straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Investing in America.  A new blog post titled, America's workers  are the real winners from corporate tax reform. Hits back against critics  who say that the new tax law only benefits corporations.  It reads in part,  companies will also use some of the gains from tax reform to return capital  to investors.  Money returned to shareholders of any kind re-circulates  throughout the economy with some helping finance new star-ups, some being  reinvested in growing sectors to the economy.  Some being safe to increase  future consumption.  Let's bring in the writer of this blog post, he  happens to be the former chief of staff under President Bush 43, Business  Roundtable president and CEO, Josh Bolton.  Josh, you preach into the choir  right here, I have been saying that, I understand the way the tax reform  works both for individuals and corporations.  Are we hearing enough of that  from members of the Republican Party?  And those very lawmakers really  pushing back on the rhetoric from the likes of Nancy Pelosi?</p><p>JOSH BOLTON, CEO, BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE:  Yes, I hope so.  First of all,  thanks for having me this morning to talk about this.  But I hope we are  hearing it from the members who supported this tax bill because they have a  lot to be proud of.  It's not just the dividends and share buybacks that  the tax reform may release, the much more important part is the benefits  that are going directly to workers right now as a result of the extra cash  that companies have.  And even more important than that is the investments  that those corporations that companies all over America are going to be  able to do right here in America as a result of the more competitive tax  code.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I just want to point out we're looking at the vast list of  companies that are returning some of the tax savings to their workers  whether it's in thousand dollar bonuses and we just found out Chipotle has  said it's going to reinvest more than one-third of its savings from the new  tax law in its employees.  Some of the new benefits workers will get  include one-time bonuses of up to $1000 to hourly and salaried workers  along with life insurance, short-term disability insurance for hourly  restaurant managers.  This is just to name a few.  But to look at thousand  dollars in this country and say that it's pathetic crumbs, Josh, I don't --  I don't -- I know that that does not resonate with the American people.   I've said this, are people really looking at their bigger paychecks  thinking, I really wish Nancy Pelosi had her hands on this money instead of  me. </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  I hope they are and comments like that I think just  reflected a fundamental misunderstanding of what tax reform was likely to  bring.  And the evidence is now overwhelming.  At the business roundtable  alone we represent 200 of America's biggest corporations.  We have members  of our organization alone have already announced over $700 million in  bonuses to their employees, lots of wage increases 401(k) enhancements.   Those are real substantial benefits for the workers of all those  corporations.  And that's just in the first six weeks after the enactment  of the tax reform.  I think there is a lot more to come in this economy.   Both in terms of short-term benefits that workers will realize more  importantly in the long-term competitiveness of American companies which is  where American workers need to work.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Josh, are you concerned though about the tax reform being part  of the reason that we were -- we're going to have higher inflation?  You  talk about wage growth.  But wage growth is part of the inflation equation,  you wind up with higher interest rates.  That is certainly last week was a  big concern for the stock market with that wage growth number we got from  the employment report.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes.  That could have been a part of what's roiled the markets a  bit in the -- in the last few days is an expectation now of some  inflationary pressure from wage increases.  But look, that's -- that wasn't  the purpose of tax reform and it's not -- it's not really going to be the  effect.  What everybody across all political persuasions has been looking  for is real wage increases for American workers.  Tax reform is going to  unleash a lot of that and overall that's a huge benefit to the American  economy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Josh, it was really good to see you.  Thank you for being here  as always.  </p><p>BOLTON:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Josh Bolton.  We will see you very soon.  As we go to break,  futures are trading like this right now, take a look.  Dow futures were  down more than 200 points when we started the show at 6:00 a.m. Eastern  down 87 points right now.  Wild swings on Wall Street, we will watch that  as the day moves on.  Plus, Tesla revving up to report fourth-quarter  earnings after the bell.  We break down the numbers ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  Welcome back,  everybody.  It's Wednesday, February 7th.  Your top stories at 8:32 a.m.  Eastern.  Another wild day on Wall Street, the Dow Jones swimming more than  1000 points, almost 1200 points in fact from loss to highs in yesterday's  session ending the day up 567 points, big bounce back from that kind of  epic loss on Monday.  The major market gages finishing yesterday in the  green and the Dow, S&amp;P, and NASDAQ are all back in positive territory for  the year.  Checking action this morning.  Futures are off a little bit, the  Dow futures are down 98 points, they were off more than 200 early in the  morning about 6:00 a.m. when we started this program, started MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  </p><p>But again, this is the issue, volatility is back, people have become very  complacent, they weren't used to wild swings.  The Dow had a move of one  percent or more to seven times last year.  Over in Europe, you have gains  across the board to speak of.  The biggest gainer there being the FTSE 100  in England up more than one percent.  in Asia, markets were mostly lower,  heavy selling to report on the KOSPI in South Korea down more than two  percent.</p><p>Plus, Steve Wynn resigning from his namesake company.  The casino mogul  leaving amid allegations of sexual misconduct.  Stuart Varney's take coming  up.  To the budget battle on Capitol Hill.  One Senator unveiling  legislation to cut back on government waste.  The details ahead.  Investors  eyeing earnings of course back to fundamentals, Tesla gearing up to report  after the closing bell, the numbers that you need to watch ahead.  And  going to a place where there are no roads. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There might not be roads there but that didn't stop Elon Musk  from sending a Tesla into space.  More on the Falcon Heavy launch later  this hour.  Futures under pressure but well off the lows of the morning.   We are -- what are the traders on Wall Street saying about this have crazy  ride that we've seen really in the last week.  Nicole Petallides on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  Nicole? </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Good morning, Dagen.  So, obviously we've  seen from choppy (INAUDIBLE) action, there's no doubt about that, even this  morning as you have been covering there throughout the morning, we've seen  it down as much as close to 300 -- and the futures now we're down about  100, so that's what the traders are talking about.  They're also talking  about the heavy volume that we saw yesterday.  So there has been a lot of  action and talking about the people who were trying to get in, there were  some outages for people from T.D. Ameritrade and Fidelity trying to get --  try to navigate this difficult market.  And whether or not the bottom is  in.  That's been a big topic of conversation.  Yesterday we had obviously  the second largest-point swing ever in history in the day before.  The  biggest ever.  So, the question is whether or not the bottom is in and  yesterday 75 percent they said is likely in.  Back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nicole, thank you so much for that.  Nicole Petallides in the  New York Stock Exchange.  Turning to the shutdown showdown.  A bipartisan  budget deal in the works.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and  Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying that they are very close to finalizing  a budget that would boost military and nondefense spending, reportedly a  total $143 billion.  The new PAC makes no mention of immigration likely  tabling that debate for now.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHUMER:  The Republican leader and I have been working together quite  productively.  Of course, there is still some outstanding issues to be  resolved.  But we are closer to an agreement than we have ever been.</p><p>MCCONNELL:  Once we have established that the government is going to be  open which needs to happen by February the 8th.  We'll then go forward with  an immigration debate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now is Louisiana Senator John Kennedy.  This plan  comes just as the House approved a stopgap spending bill to fund the  government through March 23rd.  What do you think of the proposal from the  leadership in the Senate? </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Well, I like the House deal, Dagen.  I  haven't seen the details of the leadership's proposal.  They say they are  close, I've been hearing that for four months.  I've got to see it to  believe it.  I think if they make a deal it will be two-year deal and  surprise-surprise they're going to increase spending.  I just got to see  how much and where they're going to spend the money.  And how much is going  to add to the he deficit and you can put me down as doubtful.  I'm not  saying I'm not going to vote for it, but every time there is a budget deal  it always includes bigger numbers not smaller numbers and while you and I  are talking today since we've been talking we've already borrowed a  million-dollars.  We've borrowed a million dollars a minute to operate the  Federal government.  $1.4 billion a day.  </p><p>BELL:  Senator, it's Lindsey Bell.  I absolutely can appreciate your  concern for the spending there and we need to cut back on some of these  costs but isn't a two-year deal better than another C.R. to just get --  take us out another six weeks, by the time we get to march, the fiscal year  only have six more months left. </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, the problem with the C.R. or continuing resolution, Dagen,  is that there is no certainty and it does hurt our military.  Because they  can't plan.  And I do support more spending for military.  Every Senator,  Republican and Democrat, has seen the classified information.  They can't  talk about it but they know we need more spending for the military.  I just  got to see how much of waste I've got to eat in order to help our military.   And I can't make that determination until I see the -- see the numbers.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Senator, this is Lea Gabrielle.  Nice to see you. </p><p>KENNEDY:  Nice to see you, Lea.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  It sounds like you're not very hot on what you expect to be  coming your but also acknowledge that a C.R. is a terrible solution for  what we have going on, so what are you proposing? </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, what I'm proposing is that we get serious about properly  funding our military and we get serious about living within our needs.   Nobody around here except some folks in the house and few Senators are  talking about how we can spend less.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  But how do you propose getting that done? </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, let me give you an example.  I'm introducing the bill with  Tom Carper, it's got a fancy title but I call it The Stop Paying Dead  People Act.  The federal government is paying I think between 10 and $20  billion dollars a year to dead people.  And they're cashing the checks.   Obviously, there is fraud.  I mean in some states dead people can vote but  cashing a check is a little bit too much.  </p><p>WOLF:  Senator --I</p><p>KENNEDY:  I'll give you an example over a three-year period, the auditors  found that the Federal government sent out $1 billion in foreign payments  to dead farmers.  There is another case over a five-year period, the  Federal government paid $600 million in Federal pension checks to dead  retirees.  And the checks are being cashed and you know what's being done  about it?  Nothing, zero, nada. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Senator, I'm going to let Robert Wolf ask you a question but  Robert, I think everybody is for getting rid of waste and fraud and paying  dead people but a few billion dollars a year is a drop in the doggone  bucket in terms of what we spend just on -- listen, the interest on our  national debt in a year or two is going to top what we spend on the  military, Robert.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  Senator Kennedy, I just want to shift quickly because it seems  like either be a continuing resolution or a two-year budget deal with  respect to the -- with respect to the Senate.  It seems like there's not  going to be a government shutdown.  So I want to therefore just segue to  DACA which market is a really big gate for these 800,000 immigrants waiting  to see really what happens to them and just to be clear, you know, I'm a  supporter to protect the DREAMers.  And so I'm curious, where you are going  to March 5th and how do you see the outcome for these individuals? </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, number one, there are a lot of meetings being held in  groups of Senators are talking.  But what counts is 60 votes.  There are  several plans on the table right now, every single one of them are held  together with spit.  The only way to find out where everybody stands is to  vote.  And what I expect Senator McConnell to do is put some sort of  instrument bill on (INAUDIBLE) and let us start debating it and amending  it.  I'm much less sanguine than so my colleagues that we'll be able to 60  votes to do something meaningful.  Our Democratic friends want amnesty and  frankly nothing else.  I want to solve the problem.  I want to be here  talking about another DACA immigrant amnesty issue five or 10 years from  now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Senator, that's one of the reasons that they're including  the people who never signed up for DACA, including the White House,  including that in that 1.8 million people who would be given a pass to  citizenship.  So, do you oppose any path to citizenship whatsoever?  You  can call it amnesty --</p><p>KENNEDY:  It just depends on the bill.  Look, here is the problem.  We've  got immigration laws about half of our public officials don't agree with  them so they don't enforce them.  I give you ask sanctuary cities are  exhibit number one.  What we need to do is agree on a set of laws and  enforce the damn things like every other country does.  Just doing amnesty  is not going to solve this problem.  We need to --</p><p>WOLF:  Just to shift.  So we know it's coming up on March 5th, so there's  not going to be a broad base immigration bill passed by March 5th, we know  this.  March 5th --</p><p>KENNEDY:  No.  We don't know that.  Excuse me.  But we don't know that.</p><p>WOLF:  OK.</p><p>KENNEDY:  We can start debating the immigration bill next week and come out  with a comprehensive bill.  We have 60 votes, now I'm not -- I don't think  we will but we could -- </p><p>WOLF:  So let's agree that the likelihood is unlikely.  So March 5th comes  and we have the situation with the DREAMers.  Where do you think it will --  what will happen on you March 5th?  What is your expectation? </p><p>KENNEDY:  Well, if we don't do anything by March 5th, it's up to the  president.  Because he controls the enforcement of deportation, he sets  deportation policy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Senator --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- the DACA recipients that is being held up in the courts.  So  there is this feeling in Washington that they can drag their feet and wait  on dealing with this because the court has said that the order to end DACA  that they're basically put a stop to it at least in -- for -- at least  temporarily.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  That's a very good point.  I can just tell you categorical,  unequivocally, I don't want there to be any doubt about where I stand.  I'm  not going to vote for amnesty unless I get a full bill that solves the  problem.  Now, you're going to ask me what that is, I've got my own ideas,  I'm not so arrogant that I think only my ideas will work but I'm not just  going to vote for amnesty and kick this problem down the road, I want to  solve it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you but everybody who you're in -- at the -- in the  Senate and House with, you're kicking that debt problem down the road and  it's going to blow up in everybody's face.  That's my predictions.  Senator  John Kennedy.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Amen, amen, sister, amen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Futures are off by 102 points, that's much better than the  picture was at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  But again, wild swings on Wall  Street yesterday.  Meantime, Steve Wynn resigning as chairman and CEO of  Wynn Resorts.  Joining me now to weigh in is the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Mr. Stuart Varney.  What say you, sir?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Well, I don't think there was much choice here.   I think Steve Wynn had to go.  Look, he's been accused to buy, literally,  dozens of women of sexual misconduct.  He didn't get his day in court but  that is not the point.  Had this gone forward with him as CEO, the Chinese  government may well have withdrawn the licenses which Steve Wynn has for  his casinos in Macau.  You withdraw those licenses in Macau and you have  just about destroyed Wynn Casino, the stock.  He still got 12 percent of  it, but if you can operate in Macau and he's got 70 percent of his revenue  come from Macau, you can't operate, period.  He have to go even though he  didn't get his day in court.  That's my reading of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But day in court, Stuart, though, means -- I mean, due process,  we all believe in that, right?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That it means it leaves the company opening an internal  investigation with outside counsel to look into this, but I think when it  comes to light that an individual -- and this is according to all reports  in the Wall Street Journal -- Steve Wynn set up an LLC to pay one accuser,  took steps to conceal $7-1/2 million settlement.  It's those settlements  that we all well know dupe people in, in terms of their employment.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, you got a good point, Dagen.  No question about it.  I'm just  a little uncomfortable with the current trend towards utter dismissal,  total disgrace, you lose everything but you never get to plead your case in  court.  Now, in this particular instance, I can understand why not?  But  you know, we've gone a long way with this.  I'm not -- I'm not criticizing  the women who've come forward.  I enthrall it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart, no, no, no --</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm saying we better settle down a little here because maybe, in  some cases, some injustice is being done.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not just men who are uncomfortable with some of this, it's  women like myself who is very uncomfortable with that story told about --  Aziz, I'm sorry, the comedian about this date that he had been on, and it  was a bad date, and he -- again, people's careers and lives are destroyed  in some instances by based on one headline.  Never read -- never reading  the allegations.  I just think that there is just -- there is definitely a  brewing discomfort among both men and women about how these allegations are  aired.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well said.  And there are no good answers here, period.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>VARNEY:  None.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  None.  But we do want women to be heard, too.</p><p>VARNEY:  We do, indeed.  Absolutely, we do.  Yes, of course.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart, you're the best.  Your show starts in exactly 10  minutes.  There you go, Monday through Fridays, Stuart is all over this  market.  It is going to be incredible coverage as it is every day, Stuart  Varney 9:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Coming up, SpaceX successfully launching the Falcon Heavy rocket, sending a  Tesla Roadster into outer space.  More video that's out of this world,  next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  To quote Robert Wolf, so cool.  3, 2, 1 liftoff.  SpaceX  successfully launching the Falcon Heavy Rocket yesterday, capable of  lifting up to 140,000 pounds, and now, holds the title of world's most  powerful rocket.  But how will Elon Musk auto company take off today?   Tesla set to report fourth-quarter results after the bell.  It's expected  to post a loss for $3.10 a share, revenue on revenue $3.28 billion.   Joining us now, ARK Invest Analyst, Tasha Keeney.  Tasha, what are  expectations for Tesla?</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, INVEST ANALYST, ARK:  So, I think most investors are worried  about the Model 3 production ramp cash burn.  But from our perspective, you  know, people are comparing Tesla to traditional auto companies.  It's an  autonomous car company.  And once that switch is flipped, and these cars  that are already on the road today become fully autonomous, they're going  to become revenue-generating assets.  So, from that perspective, we're  happy that Tesla is spending money to get this off the ground because we  think that opportunity is huge.  We think the global market for autonomous  driving, autonomous taxis could be around $10 trillion.</p><p>BELL:  But they do have competition in this space, Waymo, Lyft, a whole  slew of others.  How sure are you that they're going to get there first and  they're going to be the winners in this race?</p><p>KEENEY:  They do have competition but what Tesla has is scale.  So, every  car that's on the road today is basically like a mini R&amp;D center.  It's  gathering data that Tesla then uses to train its autonomous driving  algorithms.  And no other automaker has been able to do this, get cars on  the road with that capability.  So, this puts Tesla years ahead of others  and, you know, yesterday, we heard on G.M.'s earnings call that they have  about 100 test cars on the road.  I mean, Tesla has thousands of cars.   Think about that information and what it's capable of.</p><p>WOLF:  So, being an old-school Wall Street guy, at what point do you get  nervous about cash burn, and what -- this is much more like almost a  biotech company?</p><p>KEENEY:  Because it's being -- the cash burn has been getting worse each  quarter.  Yes, yes.  So, to give you an idea of roughly what we expect in  earnings from these vehicles, so right now, each car is generating about  $3,000 worth of earnings for Tesla.  We think once you turn that  autonomous, that could be a net present value about over $80,000 per  vehicle, and --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, we've -- go ahead, finish your --</p><p>KEENEY:  And, you know, so we're happy that they're spending money.  I  think we'd be happy if they raised another $20 billion to get this off the  ground.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, you get the Tesla in space but you also have the CEO Elon  Musk, the founder of the company who's busy with all these other pursuits  including SpaceX.  Concerned.</p><p>KEENEY:  That's a valid point.  You know, I think Elon Musk is a really  amazing person.  We saw in this rocket launch, he is capable of making the  impossible possible, and so, you know, while no one has achieved this feat  yet, I wouldn't put it past him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  Tasha, Tasha Keeney, thank you so much.</p><p>KEENEY:  Thanks for having me.  Final thoughts when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Final thoughts.  Lindsey?</p><p>BELL:  Get ready for this political uncertainty to drive that volatility.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Robert?</p><p>WOLF:  Congrats to the Eagles, great year for the Pats, and I've already  moved to the Celtics.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I would, too.  Lea?</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Ask for a military parade, that you can see our ships on  parade, our submarines on parade, our soldiers, our sailors, airmen, and  marines around the world.  From Stephen LeClair who's a former marine, he  says he wants to spend time with his family on July 4th, not in a parade.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I say to the Democrats, stop talking down the economy and  essentially rooting for a downfall for the markets, bad for them.  Stuart,  over to you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, I'll take it, Dagen.  Thank you very much, indeed.  It is not  over but is it calming down a bit?  OK.  I'm on dangerous ground.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

You don't have any time, girl, you're busy today. All right. Good morning, everybody, I am Lauren Simonetti in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Friday, December 28th, here are you top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wall Street is looking to extend gains to day number three, Futures this morning sharply higher, Dow gaining a hundred and twenty-three, half of one percent, similar percentage gains across the board, this after a roller coaster session for the markets yesterday. Get this, the Dow swung more than 850 points during the session, finishing higher more than one percent. The S&amp;P 500 picking up nearly one percent, the NASDAQ tacking on just over a third of one percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Council of Economic Advisers Chairman, Kevin Hassett, saying the President is happy with the economy going into the end of the year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS CHAIRMAN: I think the President thinks that the economy the -- is doing well, that the economic fundamentals are sound, and I think he's very pleased to see that the markets are moving back to sort of where they belong given the fundamentals.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Seeing follow-through in Europe, gains across the board, 1.8 percent to the upside for all three markets on your screen. Asian markets mostly higher as well. The Nikkei, the outlier here, it is down a third of one percent, and negative for the first time on a year in seven years.</p><p>Well, day number seven of the government shutdown in Washington and it does not look like it will end before the New Year. Meanwhile, a new poll shows more Americans blaming President Trump for the government shutdown. We're going to break it all down for you.</p><p>Then outside, there is some wicked weather, millions of Americans hit by blizzard conditions and we'll tell you where this storm is heading next. Plus, did you look outside? Blue skies at night in New York. We have the details on what exactly what happened and more of this pretty incredible yet beautiful video. Aliens? Maybe. All right. It's deadline day for Sears, the struggling retailer has until the end of today to find a bidder for its assets or it could disappear entirely.</p><p>All of that coming up with me and this morning, we also have FOX News Contributor and \"GREG GUTFELD SHOW\" Correspondent, and National Review Reporter, that is one big title, Kat Timpf, in white, Beyond Sport Global Ambassador and FOX News Contributor, John Layfield, and Former State Department Spokesperson and Co-host of \"BENSON &amp; HARF\" on FOX News Radio, Marie Harf. Happy Friday.</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Happy Friday.</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST: Happy Friday.</p><p>SIMONETTI: What a strange week.</p><p>HARF: Yes. I mean what a way to end the year. So many ups and downs and it just feels like the news hasn't stopped at all.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I know. Are we ending the year up or down, though? What do you guys think?</p><p>TIMPF: I have no -- both.</p><p>HARF: It's a roller coaster.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I think both -- I think is safe to say.</p><p>HARF: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I think everybody is going to need a glass of champagne on New Year's Eve, right? Or --</p><p>TIMPF: At least one.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Or just a shot of whiskey.</p><p>HARF: Just one.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Only (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>SIMONETTI: And just -- and then you just see that veteran then you can live to a hundred and twelve years old. That lives a hundred and twelve --</p><p>TIMPF: Exactly.</p><p>LAYFIELD: That's right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: - by smoking cigars and drinking whiskey. Anyway, all right. Also coming up this morning, Wells Fargo Investment Institute Senior Global Equity strategist, Scott Wren, Ohio Congressman, House Ways and Means Committee member and Iraq War Veteran, Brad Wenstrup, former CKE Restaurant CEO and Former Labor Secretary Nominee, Andy Puzder, and Texas Congressman, Medical Doctor, and member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Michael Burgess. You don't want to miss it, and we're -- we got a lot to discuss and we're going to start with our top story this hour, and that is the market.</p><p>Once again, front and center, but it's a good day today or at least it's shaping up to be after a wild day of trading on Wall Street. Yesterday, the Dow staging a late comeback, swinging more than 850 points from high to low, and that's been what we've seen the past six sessions. We've seen one percent plus moves in both directions for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, let's talk about it and bring in the founder, CEO, and Chief Investment Strategist at Mainstay Capital Management, David Kudla. David, good morning.</p><p>DAVID KUDLA, CEO, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Good morning, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: What do you make of the volatility?</p><p>KUDLA: Well, it has been quite extreme in the past week, in the past month, and really the past quarter. It is what we expect now going into 2019. We had it very nice in 2017, the first part of 2018, but we've seen extreme volatility pick up through all of this year and this is what we need to expect more of. And a lot of it is because there's this confusion or maybe a seeking of what is the economic outlook for next year.</p><p>We had as little as a month and a half ago people thinking that the -- we - - the Federal Reserve might hike four, five -- even five times next year. That went down to maybe a couple of times. Now the Fed Futures prediction of how much the Fed will raise next year is showing us that they wouldn't raise at all. But the Fed dot plot, their own forecast, shows two raises and those that think that we're headed for recession. So, we have this very divergent view about the economy --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLA: And that is causing a lot of volatilities as we move between those different views.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes. It's true. Wall Street thinks one thing, they are suspecting or predicting a sharp slowdown in the New Year. And Main Street might think the opposite. Kevin Hassett was on after the bell yesterday, and he said, you know, Wall Street does engage all the momentum that we're seeing. In the economy, small businesses are not part of Wall Street and they're doing great right now.</p><p>KUDLA: Yes. If you -- if we look at the consumer, which is two-thirds of our economy and just look at the holiday spending season, look at the fourth quarter, we look at November retail sales, October revised higher, the --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLA: -- holiday shopping season from November 1st through December 24th, best in six years.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>KUDLA: Amazon having record sales.</p><p>SIMONETTI: But consumer confidence was down two months in a row. Sorry to interrupt you, David, but we do have that number, that it fell two months in a row. What do you make of that?</p><p>KUDLA: Well, that's a lagging indicator and a lot of that is a result of what's happened in the stock market over the past quarter. And so we'll see some of those -- the soft data like that will soften as the wealth effect or lack thereof, kicks in of what the stock market's been doing. But, you know, we're looking at two to two and a half percent growth next year, not a recession.</p><p>Unemployment, it's still near a 49-year low, and, you know, we just don't think a recession is right around the corner, we think the economy is still doing quite well. I think the biggest thing for the stock market is where do corporate earnings really come in? We think that we can still get eight or nine percent earnings growth in the fourth quarter, but -- or in the -- throughout 2019, but there are those that think that earnings are going to fall off a cliff.</p><p>If that's the case, we have trouble. If earnings, you know, we can't match the record earnings that we had in 2018, but if we get decent earnings in 2019, just eight or nine percent, we don't even need multiple expansion, we can do OK. Stocks can do OK through 2019.</p><p>LAYFIELD: David, if you go from say 20 percent right now in corporate earnings to about eight or nine percent, I think the estimate right now, consensus is around seven percent, so eight or nine would be a little bit higher than that, that is not falling off a cliff, as you say, but that doesn't pretend itself to the volatility that we've seen. Is this volatility really on different views of the economy? And what's going to happen next year or is it about the things the market can't control like Brexit, like this trade warm and so many things that's going on with these capricious politicians we have around the globe?</p><p>KUDLA: Yes, it -- you know, when we look at -- when we look abroad, when we look at Europe, whether it's yellow vest in France, whether it's Brexit, the problems in England, whether it's Italy arguing with the E.U. about future, you know, Europe has a lot of problems and we're avoiding Europe. We have this year for the last three quarters and will be going into 2019 because of the problems there, we're staying with U.S. stocks, we're starting to look at emerging markets but, yes, that's --</p><p>You know, we do have a lot of anxiety indigestion for the markets that's coming from D.C.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLA: And recently, the China-U.S. trade issues are a concern because that's where government action does affect real economies, and affects the stock market, so how that all works itself out in the New Year will definitely matter.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>KUDLA: But, you know, it is -- we look -- as we look further into the year, you know, it'll be a function of how -- when do we get into the first quarter? What do those corporate earnings start to look like?</p><p>SIMONETTI: David, the Wall Street Journal is out with the story titled \"The Investment That Cost Apple $9 billion in 2018 and it references the effect, market prices have had on company's decisions to buy back their stocks, specifically Apple.</p><p>Buy backs have helped support the market. Do you think we're going to see companies then buying this dip?</p><p>KUDLA: We've seen a little bit of that, you know. The funny thing about stock buybacks by corporations is they tend to buy high and that's not because they don't know when to buy stocks, it's more a function of the reason or their -- or their ability to buy -- to initiate those buybacks, it's typically when the economy is doing well, when the company is doing well because they're buying that with a free cash flow so they tend to initiate more stock buybacks during good economic times when they high revenue, high profits, high free cash flow. So, they tend to be buying high, not buying low.</p><p>There have been some companies step in with stock prices lowered and initiate stock buyback programs here late in the year.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Uh-hmm.</p><p>KUDLA: But, you know, if we do see more of an economic slowdown next year, we could see that. This year with the Corporate Tax Reform and the strong economy, we had over one trillion, a new record, in stock buybacks in 2018.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Are you concerned at all about companies and the amount of cash that they're holding and also we saw the Steven Mnuchin, the now infamous call to the banks earlier this week, considered their about ability to lend, are you -- are you concerned about any of these things?</p><p>KUDLA: No, you know, a lot of us were left scratching our heads why that letter was sent out, why those calls were made to the bank. There wasn't a concern about liquidity. We think that was a reason for some of the market volatility on Monday, on Christmas Eve, because that probably wasn't needed and what we've seen though is maybe a sturdier hand now. I think the more amicable tone of President Trump towards Jay Powell at the Fed --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>KUDLA: -- comments that --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Well, do you think there's a face-to-face meeting between the President and Jay Powell? Because that's what's been reported as a possible. Would that help the market's sentiment right now?</p><p>KUDLA: I think it absolutely would. And they say it's going to happen, I hope it happens because, you know, the fact that they're just meeting face- to-face and talking will be better than comments over Twitter and however else because --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>KUDLA: -- it's not doing the markets any good.</p><p>SIMONETTI: So the theme of 2019 then is going to be talking, whether it's Trump and Powell, or Trump and President Xi of China, just talking will get these markets to go up, I suppose. David Kudla, thank you so much for joining us on this Friday.</p><p>KUDLA: Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right. Coming up, a wicked winter storm pushing its way to the east, how millions of Americans in the path will be affected this weekend and it's not aliens. The internet going crazy over these mysterious blue lights above New York City, we're going to tell you what caused the sky to light up. Is that blue or green? Blue green?</p><p>TIMPF: Blue.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Teal? Blue? OK.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Markets still up with about three hours before the opening bell, but we have half the gains that we saw earlier, Dow Futures higher by 66 points. They were up about a hundred and forty just moments ago. The byline right now on the Wall Street Journal, Blue Chips log a record rebound yesterday after the week's biggest point in gain the day before, so volatility is the name of the game. We'll see.</p><p>Speaking of extreme, it's outside, too. We're watching the weather for you this morning. The Midwest taking hit by heavy snow while the East Coast is gearing up for flash floods. FOX News Meteorologist, Adam Klotz, live in the weather center with the bad news. Good morning, Adam.</p><p>ADAM KLOTZ, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST: Hey there, good morning, Lauren. You know what, it's that same snow system that's bringing all the heavy rain now to portions of the east. The East Coast and South East (INAUDIBLE) already stretching all the way back actually to New Orleans up through Atlanta and then all its way up to New York in the next couple of hours. Now the backside of this system is still producing a little bit of snow, enough snow that we still have some blizzard watches warnings, winter advisory stretching across portions of the Upper Midwest, this is going to be kind of moving out of the area within the next couple of hours so really winding down.</p><p>The worst of the snow in this area has moved off and it becomes more of a rain event. This entire system is running into some very warm air. You'll see it here in our future radar and you can pay attention to the timestamp kind of back behind my head, but it runs up throughout the day here on Friday and early Saturday morning, rain eventually heavy at times stretching from D.C. up to New York, up to Boston, colder air on the backside of this, but you noticed it was all just that heavy rain. Wouldn't be a surprise if there was some flooding especially in the southeast with this.</p><p>We've already seen a couple of inches of rain in Atlanta here early this morning. But all this moisture is running into some very warm air. Again, cold on the backside so where it's snowing, temperatures are still back down into the 20's, you get far enough behind it, and you see some spots down into single digits, but currently on the East Coast, it is well above our seasonal averages, as you're looking at 56 degrees here in New York City, 70 degrees in Raleigh. This continues. It stays warm throughout the entire day here on Friday, warm into Saturday.</p><p>Now there is cold air behind the system, so once this moves off coast, it cools down a little bit for us on Friday -- or on Sunday, excuse me, but then we warm back up on Monday and Tuesday, which means by the time we get into the New Year or close to the New Year, New Year's Eve, 47 degrees is the high there for New Year's Eve. It -- actually, by the time the ball drops, it'll only be down close to 40 degrees.</p><p>So, Lauren, it is going to be a mild start to this New Year even though we're talking about a big snowstorm in the middle of the country.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And if you're in Times Square, that's a lot of people probably going to, you know, enjoy the nice weather.</p><p>KLOTZ: Yes. It was like --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Uh-hmm.</p><p>KLOTZ: -- negative four last year, so this is better.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Oh. That's right.</p><p>KLOTZ: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Adam, thank you.</p><p>KLOTZ: Uh-hmm.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Kat Timpf, you plan to spend New Year's right in Times Square, right?</p><p>TIMPF: Not this year, no.</p><p>SIMONETTI: What are you guys doing?</p><p>TIMPF: I did last year when it was below zero for FOX and I couldn't feel my feet. Richard Fowler had to kind of drag me back to the van because I couldn't walk. It was so cold.</p><p>SIMONETTI: It was crazy. Yes.</p><p>TIMPF: Yes, it was nuts. What about you? What are you doing for New Year's?</p><p>HARF: I'm going to Northern New Hampshire, so it's going to be very cold and I hope a lot of snow.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And you're headed south, sort of?</p><p>LAYFIELD: I'm headed south to see my dad today and then come back to D.C. for New Year's Eve.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I can't believe. This is, like, it. Monday is New Year's Eve.</p><p>HARF: I know. I can't.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Wow. It always happens so fast.</p><p>HARF: 2019 is here.</p><p>SIMONETTI: It's been a full year, a wild year, especially on Wall Street. Maria Bartiromo is going to wrap up the highs and the lows of the year in business for us in just a bit. Plus it is deadline day for Sears. The retailer is bankrupt, it needs to find a buyer for its assets by the end of the day today or face liquidation. They'll sell the --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Roller coaster year for business. Maria Bartiromo takes a look back at the highs and lows of 2018.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: The year in business will likely go down, remembered mostly of how it's ending, with head-spinning moves in the stock market and uncertainty gripping the globe. The stock market rocked with wild moves up and down, but sadly for investors, it's been more down than up.</p><p>In Europe, Brexit on the brink.</p><p>THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: I continue to believe that we can leave with a good deal and that is it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Paris in pieces. Citizens rioting over a new gas tax designed to curve carbon emissions, all this as America's economy is humming in ways not seen in years. The President's tax plan kicking in January 1st, helping to send second quarter GDP north of four percent, and the unemployment rate all the way down to 3.7 percent.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY: The fact that a business can write off 100 percent of an investment is an enormous incentive to get people to make capital investment and that capital investment creates more jobs.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Blue-collar workers having their best increase in many, many years. The American economy is crushing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the euphoria faded by midyear as the President's America First Policy meant renegotiating old trade deals. President Trump telling me in April that the United States will not back down until it has better terms with the rest of the world, notably China.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you going to back down on the tariffs against China?</p><p>TRUMP: No, no, no. No. China wants to make a deal and so do I, but it's got to be fair deal for this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The administration calling out China over I.P. theft, the forced transfer of technology, spying on Americans and lopsided protectionist tariffs. But while doing so, global growth worries persisted. President Trump also calling out his own Federal Reserve Chairman for raising interest rates.</p><p>TRUMP: I think the Fed is making a mistake. They're so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Higher rates and the China tensions roiling the equity markets by years end with a big hit in the fourth quarter. The business world also still roiled by the Me Too Movement, including media mogul Les Moonves of CBS, fired and deprived of a massive severance package after an investigation uncover years of alleged sexual harassment.</p><p>It was also a year of big challenges for big tech.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility. It was my mistake and I'm sorry.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal revealed that Cambridge Analytica took the personal data of millions of people's Facebook's profiles without their consent. And it was used for political purposes. Facebook stock taking a beating and others such as Google under the microscope for privacy issues, leading to call for tighter regulations.</p><p>2018 saw a big change for the internet, if you noticed, net neutrality was repealed by the Trump Administration. Despite promises of doom, the internet seems to work the same as before. But it is not the same as before for believers of Bitcoin. A year ago, the cryptocurrency riding high near $20,000, but by year-end crashing below 5,000. The year-end Midterm Election set the tone for the year ahead with new uncertainty with the Democrats in the majority in the House, creating new questions over what can get done legislatively.</p><p>TRUMP: I am proud to shut down the government for border security.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 2019 begins with a new Congress and a divided government. That traditionally has been good for business in the stock market. No wonder the list of IPOs ready to launch is growing. But the U.S. will need to ratify the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, as well as finish its work with China among other things.</p><p>And in this era of a nontraditional precedent where business and politics overlap, you can be sure that more surprises are in store for the New Year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: So bottom lining that, 2018 was the year of the big surprise in my opinion.</p><p>HARF: Absolutely.</p><p>TIMPF: Right.</p><p>HARF: And we're one year out basically from the tax cuts having taking effect. We're seeing the impact of that sort of a mixed bag as we look back on those tax cuts. Corporate profits are up, some workers got benefits, some plants have kept closing like in my home state of Ohio, Lordstown, Ohio.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Oh.</p><p>HARF: So that's a big one. That's going to be a big issue seeing how these tax cuts play out over the next few months. Also as Maria mentioned, trade and NAFTA, new Congress coming in, it is not a given that they will approve the new NAFTA. I think it's likely, but it's not a given and so that will be another political fight and, of course, China trade. This is the big ticket item the President has to get something done on. I think his supporters who are impacted, soybean farmers, steel producers, they've been willing to give him some leeway here sometime, but I don't think it's indefinite. So, as we look to 2019, that time may run out --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>HARF: -- at some point.</p><p>SIMONETTI: We do have hope there's going to be a January sit-down --</p><p>HARF: That's right.</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- between both sides, Washington and Beijing, to try to get something done --</p><p>LAYFIELD: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- as the 90-day trade truce that expires in March is -- that clock is ticking.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Yes. And you look at the take from Maria, you had a market that was doing pretty well the first six months, and all of a sudden this trade war kicks in.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And you have so much unpredictability and so much volatility, it started from that point. I think Brexit right here is underestimated. I think Brexit next year could fall completely apart.</p><p>SIMONETTI: David Kudla --</p><p>LAYFIELD: I think --</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- said he's not touching Europe.</p><p>LAYFIELD: I think the E.U. could fall apart. If Brexit is a hard Brexit, then E.U. -- then Italy will probably drop out of the E.U. as well and the E.U. dissolves. That is big deal going on in Europe and that is not priced in on the market yet.</p><p>SIMONETTI: That is very interesting call because we're fixated on the Federal Reserve and the status of Jay Powell, and what's going on with China as being our two biggest headwinds, but Brexit and --</p><p>LAYFIELD: It's all things you can't --</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- two countries perhaps going out of the E.U.</p><p>LAYFIELD: That's right. And the whole E.U could dissolve on that. If England -- if U.K. has to stay in, that will send a message to Italy, \"You got to get your debt under control,\" Italy will probably rein in its debt and stay in the E.U. If Brexit is a hard Brexit, which looks like it certainly could be --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- I think Italy drops out as well.</p><p>SIMONETTI: They never plan for the hard Brexit. That was the problem. Anything to add?</p><p>TIMPF: I just think it's been crazy to see everything that's happened with Facebook this year.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>TIMPF: I think they've had such a bad year, and now Google, too, with all the privacy stuff.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Are you still on Facebook?</p><p>TIMPF: I'm still on Facebook, yes, but I'm concerned about some of my private messages, the fact that people have read those, I mean you don't think about it -- you don't really think about it. You think of it as being, \"Oh, private message?\"</p><p>SIMONETTI: Nothing's private.</p><p>TIMPF: \"It's a private message,\" but nothing's private. There's no such thing.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right.</p><p>HARF: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Coming up, the shutdown showdown in Washington and right now no end in sight, we're going to take a look at what could happen when Democrats take control of the House next week and blue skies at night. What caused this stunning blue scene over New York City late last night? We missed it. We were sleeping.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Welcome back. I'm Lauren Simonetti, in for Maria Bartiromo, this morning. It is Friday, December 28th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Wall Street pulling away from premarket highs up actually, look at this, volatility reign supreme, we're up just 60, now, we're up about 200 points on the Dow. So it could be another good day, but of course, everything can change come 3:00 p.m., in that final hour.</p><p>A wild session for the major averages yesterday, the Dow swinging more than 850 points during the session, it did finish higher by more than one percent, the S&amp;P 500 picked up just about a percent, and the NASDAQ tacked on just over a third of one percent.</p><p>Take a look at European indices, this morning. Green across the board, London, Paris, and Frankfurt, all up 1.8 percent. Asian markets, mostly higher overnight, the Nikkei however, down a third of a percent.</p><p>The border battle heating up with the government shutdown, now, in day seven, and President Trump doubles down on his call for the border wall, after an alleged cop-killer in California was in the U.S., illegally, the fallout, ahead.</p><p>Then, blue skies over New York, but it was night time, we have the details on what exactly happened and more of this incredible video.</p><p>Plus, it's deadline day for Sears, the struggling iconic retailer has until the end of today, to find a bidder for its assets or it could disappear entirely.</p><p>And we're ringing in the New Year in style, we've got the top wine choices to help you celebrate 2019, all that coming up.</p><p>Our top story this half hour, is the shutdown showdown, the partial government shutdown most likely stretching into 2019 with no clear end in sight, even some of the President's closest allies are losing hope of a quick agreement to end the shutdown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC), CHAIR OF THE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS: Having discussions with the President prior to the Christmas break, he was fully engaged in making a number of different options available to Democrats, and yet, it's been met with really just resistance and no acceptance whatsoever.</p><p>As you know, they've now said that we're not going to have votes this week, here in the house, so any suggestion that this would end quickly, are quickly fading.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: This comes as a new Reuters poll shows the majority of Americans blame President Trump for the shutdown, while only 33 percent blamed the Democrats in Congress.</p><p>Joining me now is Daily Caller News Foundation Editor-in-Chief, Christopher Bedford, Chris, good morning.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION: Good morning.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Does it matter who we blame? It matters the solution here, right?</p><p>BEDFORD: Yes, it doesn't really matter that much who you blame, we're two years away from anybody voting, and despite everyone in Washington, always freaking out over poll this or poll that, when the government shuts down, it doesn't seem to have a huge electoral effect, with that -- except with the major -- possible exception of a Virginia election a few years ago, when Virginia was so heavily affected by the shutdown.</p><p>SIMONETTI: The President could have gotten some support for his border wall and the need to contain and stop illegal immigration, with the news coming out of Northern California, that an illegal immigrant killed a legal immigrant, that police officer originally from Fiji. Does that aid his push?</p><p>BEDFORD: It might aid a little bit, at least, in the hearts and minds of Americans. This is a classic story, a very tragic story of an immigrant from Fiji, who comes here and joins a law enforcement agency, he's serving and protecting and he's got a 5-month-old child and a wife, and he's shot by someone who's here, illegally, when he pulls him over for suspected drunk driving.</p><p>That's a really tragic story on Christmas week, and it's a kind of story that says it paints a difference between those who come here, legally, and try to help, and try to serve their community, and those who don't, and they live in the shadows and they break the law.</p><p>And while there are some people that aren't shooting police officers, obviously, it shows you the worries here, but the problem is, the Democrats have no incentive here to give the President a win on anything. They were sailing into this, thinking that the President was going to fold on his campaign promise for a border wall, about two weeks ago.</p><p>Now, it's looking like he's not going to. But Democrats, their voters will punish them and their members will punish them if they give the President a win on anything.</p><p>HARF: Chris, Marie Harf here, good morning.</p><p>BEDFORD: Good morning.</p><p>HARF: I want to ask you a question. Play this out a little bit. Nancy Pelosi takes over speaker, and just a few days, the House will pass likely a clean funding bill with no border wall funding wall in it, the Senate may pass something similar they did earlier, this month, by unanimous consent, if something like that were to pass out of Congress and go to President Trump's desk with no border wall funding in it, will he and should he veto it?</p><p>BEDFORD: I suspect that he would veto it because this is a -- this is a campaign promise of his. He'd look like, maybe if they had done these two weeks ago, he might have let something like that by, but the pressure has built, he's becoming -- he's come pretty stubborn on this matter.</p><p>And he's really seen a lot of his base start to let him know and tell him, hey, President, we voted for you, in order to get this border wall passed, you had two years to do it, nothing happened. Now, it's down to the last minute, and if you fold again to the Democrats, that's not going to empower them.</p><p>Of course, it's possible that he tries to attach it to an infrastructure bill, but again, I don't see any incentive for Nancy Pelosi House of Representatives to give him a win on anything like this.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Hey Chris, when you talk about the overall economic impact, I agree with you, history show that government shutdown doesn't have an overall economic impact long term because you get money later, it certainly does and do much (INAUDIBLE) 800,000 people who aren't getting checks at Christmas because of these childish politicians can't get along and worse in D.C.</p><p>I think it's embarrassing and disgusting on all of them, both parties. But, when you look at what's going on this past week, with this government shutdown, we're in a stalemate right here. Both sides think they have a winning hand.</p><p>Look at what happened with the first Secretary of Defense that resigned, and General Mattis, it seems to lend itself that this White House is either at worst in chaos or at best unpredictable. This is what you think is hurting the image of the White House as much, and also the markets?</p><p>BEDFORD: The good news for the government employees who were out of a paycheck, is if the government figures this out by January 10th, then they're never going to even miss a paycheck. They'll be OK because they don't have a scheduled pay period until January 11th. Although, there's a sense of uncertainty you don't want.</p><p>But this has been a really, really bad two weeks for the White House, I was with a number of Conservatives over Christmas and over the break, talking about this, and I had never heard some of these Trump supporters be so down on the President, whether it's over Secretary Mattis, which was a step too far for a lot of the people who support the President, or whether it's over this final, final battle after two years of Republican control for the wall.</p><p>But a number of Conservatives and people on the hard right told me, that they said that if the President had folded on this issue, then they would - - he would've lost their support entirely. So, I think the President has gotten that message.</p><p>But this is a function of some of the dysfunction in the White House, where the way President Trump has traditionally run his businesses, as but a very small, very lean team of people who are close to him, and that doesn't work as well with the sprawling federal government, you need to have as many people on there, as possible, working for you at the same time, and empty jobs are not getting filled.</p><p>TIMPF: Hi, it's Katherine, I just have a question, in terms of how this all ends, what do you think would be better, politically, for the President if he ends the shutdown or do you think Conservatives would see it as him folding, if he doesn't get border wall funding?</p><p>BEDFORD: I think Conservatives will see it as him folding, absolutely. The best possible outcome for the President would be some kind of compromise where Democrats say they'll give a little bit more for a wall, but maybe it wouldn't be a wall, maybe it'll be steel slots, or something. He'll claim a victory there, and then, he won't at least -- no one would go home empty handed.</p><p>However, if the Democrats also have a possibility to appear to be adults in the room, to give him some kind of compromise like that, and say look, we are the House of Representatives, opened up government, but I also think that right now, both sides don't have that much to lose.</p><p>They're two years out from an election, I know this is really cynical, but they don't have that much to lose because voters will forget about some of the squabbling and what they will remember, is if Democrats voted for the wall, or if Republicans did not vote for the wall.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes. And meanwhile, yesterday they gavelled in and gavelled out, as if this is no big deal, and they're all looking ahead to 2020, even though we're not even in 2019 yet, that's how politics work.</p><p>We have a poll from The Des Moines Register, as well as CNN, it was from earlier this month, and it shows that the top Democratic contenders for 2020, among Iowa voters, are Former Vice President Joe Biden, he's leading, followed by Senator Bernie Sanders and Congressman Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>Now, this is coming as new reports say Michael Bloomberg, Chris, could be willing to spend upwards of $100 million of his own money, in a campaign for the White House, do you think Bloomberg could get in here?</p><p>BEDFORD: I don't think this is the time for Bloomberg. I remember his ads he just ran a few weeks ago, where he was saying, I used to be Republican, and now, I'm a Democrat. That's not the kind of bipartisan, I'm willing to switch on principles, kind of thing, at the last minute.</p><p>Vote or movement that's getting voters going on right now, the voters are very much divided. Democrats are not interested in working with Republicans and vice versa, and no one's really looking for a moderate person. You see, for the John Kasichs, or the Michael Bloombergs, there's not a huge rising chorus to get those people to run nationally.</p><p>Mitt Romney, he has to go to be a senator for Utah, he's not -- this is not his time to run for President, same thing with someone like Paul Ryan. So, I think that Bloomberg stands less of a chance.</p><p>And some of the problems for Democrats right now, with their base having put so much emphasis on different identity politics, are those leaders. Those leading three are all white men, except for maybe, Beto, who's not white, I guess, when he runs against a Cuban, but they're generally white men, and that is not something the Democrats are looking for and that's going to come up a lot in their primaries.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Marie, what do you think the Democratic ticket in 2020 looks like then?</p><p>HARF: I think we have no idea. You know, that poll is basically a name recognition poll, at this point, and if you look at polls from the same time, in the 2016 cycle, in the 2008 cycle, where Hillary Clinton -- no, Barack Obama was in poll, and anywhere close to that, in 2006, right?</p><p>At this point, in the 2008 cycle, there's going to be 20, 25 people in primary, and I actually think it will -- the process will work out. People that can survive on the national stage will do better, and people who can't, won't.</p><p>SIMONETTI: But these big names --</p><p>HARF: We have no idea.</p><p>SIMONETTI: -- bring in the money.</p><p>HARF: They do.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I was like, how can Hillary Clinton run again? But, she can fundraise.</p><p>HARF: Yes, but she's not -- well, I hope she doesn't run again, I should say that. But you know, fundraising has also changed, we see Beto who raised so much from small dollar donors online. Fundraising is very different today than it was even 10 years ago, in terms of getting those big donors, grassroots donors matter now, a lot more.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Where does the Democratic Party go from here? You know, 2009, the Republican Party was in disarray, much like the Democratic Party is right now, the tea party rose. For a while, it influenced elections and it kind of --</p><p>HARF: Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Right now, the Socialist Party is rising for the same reasons because they are mad at the political leadership. Where does that go from here?</p><p>HARF: There's going to be fight in the Democratic Party in 2020, because there are some high-profile progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who did win, but the reason Democrats won the -- won the majority in the House, is because of moderates who won in the Midwest, in the plain states, in the south.</p><p>There's going to be a fight over who can win, and the most important thing will be, who can beat Donald Trump.</p><p>SIMONETTI: It's going to be a very interesting year.</p><p>HARF: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Christopher Bedford, thank you for joining us.</p><p>BEDFORD: Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And for all of that. You gave us a lot to talk about here onset.</p><p>All right, coming up, retail wreck, J.C. Penney shares falling below a buck, making it a penny stock, $0.97 for the first time, in its very long history. This, as Sears hits the deadline today, to find a buyer for its assets or disappear forever.</p><p>Plus, no New Year's Eve is complete without a glass of bubbly, we've got a look at some of the top wine picks to ring in 2019.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Mysterious blue light, filling the New York City's skyline last night. Kristina Partsinevelos, what was this light all about?</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Oh, that sky was sparking rapid speculation on social media, some suggested it could be a strange weather phenomenon, some even say the aliens -- yes, it's true, but turns out it was a blown transformer in Queens that shined brightly. The small explosion caused some scattered power outages in the city including at La Guardia International Airport; the outage there resulted in multiple flight delays. Thankfully, though, no one was hurt but we love the speculation online.</p><p>Last year's special election in Alabama reportedly drawing the attention of the state's Attorney General Steve Marshall telling Washington Post a disinformation campaign targeting GOP Senate Candidate Roy Moore may have violated state campaign laws and affected the outcome of the race. Moore was defeated by Democrat Doug Jones. Marshall says his office is collecting information about the Russian-styled disinformation campaign called \"Project Birmingham.\" Meanwhile, LinkedIn Founder, Reid Hoffman, is apologizing for giving money to the group allegedly behind the campaign. Hoffman says, he was unaware of its tactics.</p><p>And bids to acquire Sears are due and U.S. bankers see court today at 4:00 p.m. But Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert, the only buyer who has expressed interest in keeping Sears in business is reportedly struggling to come up with financing to make good on its $4.6 billion offer to buy the company.</p><p>And since we're speaking of struggling retailers, J.C. Penny just became a penny stock. Shares of the company fell as low as $0.32 before closing down 7.5 percent at $0.97. It's the first time they've ever closed before a dollar since J.C. Penny went public in late 1970s. Shares of the company down nearly 70 percent this year. I heard one of you whistle. Has anybody went to J.C. Penny just within the last year or so?</p><p>SIMONETTI: Well, that's the problem. I mean, retail is strong right now but not for everybody. I don't know. Anyone go to J.C. Penny in the last year?</p><p>TIMPF: No, most certainly not.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Anyone see the blue light last night?</p><p>TIMPF: I was asleep. I was asleep at 8:30.</p><p>SIMONETTI: If you saw it at home, tweet us. Apparently, had to be in Queens. Coming up, it's almost time to ring in 2019 and nothing says celebration like a bottle of bubbly. We've got wide array of wines you can toast to when the ball drops.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Perfect song. The countdown to 2019 is on. Nothing says a celebration like a glass of bubbly, but that's not the only drink you can choose to ring in the New Year with. Joining me now is Wheeling Forward Co-Founder and University Club Head, Sommelier Yannick Benjamin. Thanks for coming on.</p><p>YANNICK BENJAMIN, FOUNDER, WHEELING FORWARD: Well, thanks for having me.</p><p>SIMONETTI: You brought your goods.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: This is an alternative to champagne, a sparkling wine.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Right. So, this is from the (INAUDIBLE). It's from Maurice Bonime, and so it's an alternative to champagne, it's from -- this region is called the garden of France. So, a beautiful little place, it's Chenin blanc. You get it in retail store about $12.00, so significantly less than champagne. So, if you want to save some money and then invest in other wines, you can also do that too.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Two questions: do you get the same champagne hangover?</p><p>BENJAMIN: Little bit less because less chemicals or whatever. But, you know, it's a natural wine, wonderful, beautiful -- yes, you'll be fine. And the most important thing, it'll put big smile on the face.</p><p>SIMONETTI: And the second question was: do you actually speak French or have you just perfected --</p><p>BENJAMIN: My parents are French, actually.</p><p>SIMONETTI: OK. So -- all right, you do. And what is this over hear?</p><p>BENJAMIN: So, this one over here, this is fun. This is from the famous region of Bordeaux, which is commonly known for red wines, but they do so much more than that. They some really great sparkling wines out there, some dry whites, but this is a sweet wine. And we often think sweet wines with dessert, but you can actually do as an (INAUDIBLE), which cheeses just to start it off. My mom is from Bordeaux. So, commonly, we would have sweet wine to start off the meal or even to just celebrate, to just kind of do a little toast for the new year.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Right, and you brought two reds.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes, for sure. Yes, this is a dry red over hear. This is a (INAUDIBLE). 100 percent (INAUDIBLE). I like this; give it a nice little chill so people like red wines, just flavorful, beautiful red fruit aromas to it -- little cranberry notes to it. So, just a perfect little red wine for --</p><p>SIMONETTI: Delicious -- I'm a red wine kind of gal. And then, I'm very excited to talk to you about, about this one that I see is open.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes, I popped it open. So, I wanted you to -- I decanted it for you, I put it back in the bottle so you can taste later on. But this is my private label for my nonprofit called (INAUDIBLE) which is an homage to my parents, it's called the Dreamer. 100 percent of the proceeds goes to (INAUDIBLE), which is a nonprofit to help other people with physical disabilities -- we help them find housing, education, all that good stuff.</p><p>SIMONETTI: How much have you raised thus far?</p><p>BENJAMIN: I don't know the number of I how much money I raised, but I can tell you we have two wellness and physical fitness centers, so it's been very successful.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Well, help you raised money right now. How much is this bottle?</p><p>BENJAMIN: This one, you can find for $49.99. But again, a 100 --</p><p>SIMONETTI: He says, you're joking -- it's for a good cause.</p><p>BENJAMIN: It's for a good cause, but you can go on our Web site, (INAUDIBLE) and you can purchase it. Or there's a great wine store down in (INAUDIBLE) called (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>SIMONETTI: Well, you blended it yourself.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes, I did.</p><p>SIMONETTI: So, what goes into -- what are the trends in wine right now?</p><p>BENJAMIN: The trends in wines, yes, I think people want, you know, hands off, minimal, organic and honest wines. Wines that when you're tasting, it really -- you know, it takes you back to that place: beautiful aromas, beautiful taste and food friendly as well.</p><p>SIMONETTI: OK. Well, I'm going to smell it for the aroma. I love when you --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI: People who really know wine can pick -- I smell cinnamon bun in this one.</p><p>BENJAMIN: There's a little (INAUDIBLE) on it, so there's some vanilla notes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIMONETTI: OK, I'm might pick up vanilla now that you say it. Maybe I'll smell it more if I pick up the glass. Sorry.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SIMONETTI: It's very strong. This is robust red.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Yes, it's pinot noir but just, you know, silky, smooth and all that kind of stuff, yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI: All right, and how much the sales typically go up at the end of the year because people are celebrating the holidays.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Oh my gosh, it's crazy; there's no end to it. You know, but January, they stop. For sure.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes, everyone is too hangover and poor. And poor in January.</p><p>BENJAMIN: And poor, exactly.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Maybe, you should continue to buy wine and champagne to drink away your paycheck sorrows.</p><p>BENJAMIN: That's right. That's right. Wine is a commodity.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yannick Benjamin, thank you so much.</p><p>BENJAMIN: Thank you so much for having me.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Thank you for everything that you do. All right, still ahead, everybody, Instagram's mea cupla; the social media service apologizing for a new update that users including myself absolutely hated yesterday, did you see it? We're going to tell you next about that on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Good morning. I'm Lauren Simonetti, in for Maria Bartiromo today. It is Friday, December 28th. Here are your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The bulls came out for a run this morning. They're still running; it could change any second now, but Dow is up 121 points, S&amp;P up 13, NASDAQ tacking on 21 after a roller coaster day yesterday and quite frankly, for the fourth quarter. The Dow swinging more than 150 points during yesterday's session. It did finish higher by more than one percent.

Wall Street powered back today in a huge advance to end the first wild week of the year 2000 on a strong note.  The Nasdaq soared more than four percent and the Dow surged to a record.  The rebound is even more impressive considering that investors had reason to fear going into today's trading,</p><p>Rhonda Schaffler has more in today's \"Street Sweep.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At the opening bell on Wall Street, traders were braced for another wild ride. Technology investors hear the fallout of Lucent Technologies first ever profit warnings and a report showing job growth is even more vigorous than expected, raised expectations of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.  But investors showed no fear, buying blue chips with abandon and tech stock with zeal. The Dow moved through a start-stop session to claim a 269-point advance, up 2.4 percent to end with a new record, 11,522.  On the Nasdaq, the composite recovered from a week of abuse to reclaim more than 155 points, finishing at 3,882, a single session rise of 4.2 percent.  Many analysts had expected disappointment with Lucent's performance to drain more power from a frazzled tech sector.</p><p>CHARLES BETZ, CORNERSTONE CAPITAL MGT.: Lucent's announcement last night reflected, I think, something that is company specific and one or two quarter specific.  They claimed that the last half of their year will make up for the short fall in the first two quarters of their year.  So I don't think techs going to be -- show us too many surprises on the earnings front.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: Analysts credited so-called bargain hunters for some of the record run-up on the Nasdaq, buying into an index that was down nearly 10 percent on the week.  But investors on the big board simply shrugged off a remarkable unemployment report despite expectations of future inflation, extra interest rate hikes, or both.</p><p>ROBERT DOLL, MERRILL LYNCH: At some point, if the market fears too much strength in the economy, they'll say, you know what, the Fed is going to have to do it too many more times, and therefore we're not going to trade stocks up.  We need some signs that the economy is at least moderating as opposed to blistering growth that most are seeing.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: But some investors are already moving into the perceived safety of consumer and cyclical stocks, especially pharmaceuticals, including Dow components Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCHAFFLER: The newfound popularity of cyclical stocks will be tested next week when the Labor Department releases inflation figures for December -- Willow.</p><p>BAY: Rhonda, until then, catch your breath.  Rhonda Schaffler at the big board, thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: Well said.</p><p>The broader market may have shrugged off Lucent's profit warning, but Lucent investors did not.  The tech giant saw frenetic trading. In fact, it was the most active session ever for any big-board stock. Lucent is America's most widely held issue, and it finished the day at 53 3/16, that is down 15 3/16 from yesterday's 4:00 p.m. close.  But it is up just a little from its low point in after-hours trading yesterday.  Now get this, more than 136 million shares changed hands, a big board record, more than 15 times the average daily volume.</p><p>Now, let's take a closer look at how the rest of Wall Street closed out the week.  Advancing issues beat decliners by a near 3-to-2 margin.  There were 67 stocks that hit new highs; just 49 that hit new lows.  While the Dow is tonight at a record, it's only up fractionally on the week.  As for the Nasdaq, it's down more than 4.5 percent, on the week that is, despite today's scorching rally. BAY: Still, the end-of-the-week comeback for high-tech stocks was encouraging, especially with the Nasdaq flirting with a correction just yesterday.</p><p>Charles Molineaux is outside the Nasdaq's market site tower with more -- Charles.</p><p>CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is the new location for the Nasdaq market site here in Times Square.  Of course, we moved out of the old location on a positive note.  Stock strategists think that a sense seems to be developing that technology stocks have had their necessary correction after the big run-ups at the end of last year, and of course we had that not too scary employment report and then the bond markets benign response, which encouraged bargain hunting.</p><p>The Nasdaq actually started off waffling at the outset, then surged through the day, gained strength in the late day, closed up 155 points, its biggest one-day point gain ever.  But the close 3,882 is still down 186 points this week, its worst weekly-point loss. Biotechnology stocks led the way up with an 8 1/2 percent rally.  The industry's giant, Amgen, picked up 11 percent.</p><p>Computers were up by almost 4 1/2 percent even as Dell lost $1.81 on rumors, which it denies, that it's going to be reporting an earnings shortfall.  Apple gained $4.50.  And the roller-coaster ride continued for Qualcomm, as the telecoms were the strong sector on the Nasdaq as well, they picked up four percent.</p><p>In technical terms, the rally is a big relief for some market watchers who saw no end to the selling if the Nasdaq's declines didn't turn around soon.  Not that this volatility is necessarily behind us by any stretch of the imagination.  We are heading into earnings season.  We're going to be hearing from some big names next week, including the tech semiconductors, biotech, and two tech bellwethers whose fortunes can move the entire market, Intel and Yahoo! -- Stuart, Willow.</p><p>BAY: Charles, Monday the market site will be open?</p><p>MOLINEAUX: I beg your pardon?</p><p>BAY: On Monday will that market site be open?</p><p>MOLINEAUX: The market site will be open on Monday and we'll be broadcasting from there, yes.</p><p>BAY: They'll let you inside then, great.  Charles Molineaux, thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: As you might imagine, technology mutual funds posted sharp losses in the first week of 2000, down more than 9.7 percent, on average, that's according to Lipper.  Now, this after a stellar performance in '99.  The Invesco Technology Fund, for example, returned nearly 145 percent last year. And joining us now with a look at what lies ahead for the tech sector is Bill Keithler, he is the portfolio manager of the Invesco Technology Fund.  He joins us from the company's headquarters in Denver.</p><p>William, welcome to the program, good to have you with us.</p><p>WILLIAM KEITHLER, INVESCO TECHNOLOGY FUND: Thanks, Stuart. Thanks to be here.</p><p>VARNEY: Is that it, the tech sector correction is over after a couple of days?</p><p>KEITHLER: Well, I think what happened this week, my theory on it is we have this huge run-up following a very strong quarter.  But a huge run-up in the last few weeks of the quarter.  The stocks went up basically on nothing.  There was a big tech conference this week down in Arizona and about 1,500 tech investors were down there.</p><p>I think people were rotating out of technology this week, they wanted to show it in their portfolios at the end of last year, and then they rotated into something that had maybe a little more value, and there were no buyers around.  When we all came back from the conference, we saw these stock prices and they looked like pretty cheap stocks, so we all rushed in and bought them today.</p><p>VARNEY: Next week, we carry on from here on the upside for the tech sector, do we?</p><p>KEITHLER: Well, as you mentioned, we're going into the earnings reporting season, and that's usually a -- certainly last year it was a choppy period for tech stocks, but by and large we're not looking for too many negative surprises.  I think we've gotten that out of the way this week.  So I think the earnings reports are going to be good and I think the outlooks that the companies present in their conference calls are going to be fairly positive.  So we think post the earnings reporting season, technology stocks should do pretty well.</p><p>VARNEY: Now you cover -- you have a technology fund and that covers a very broad range of industries.</p><p>KEITHLER: Correct.</p><p>VARNEY: I mean, you cover Internet, telecom software, where exactly are you concentrating your buying within a specific area of technology?</p><p>KEITHLER: Well, we tend to focus on the market leaders within the various subsectors of technology.  But within the different sectors our largest sector waiting is in the software group.</p><p>VARNEY: Which companies in particular do you like?</p><p>KEITHLER: Well, we like Microsoft, we like Intuit.  We like BEA Systems, those are all some of our larger holdings within the software group. VARNEY: Last quick question, if I may, Bill, because we haven't got much time, but I do want to ask, would you buy Lucent at $52?</p><p>KEITHLER: Not for immediate near-term performance.  I think the company didn't do enough in lowering their hurtles for the second half.  I do believe it was a Lucent specific problem, but I think there are some other issues they didn't really discuss in the conference call that are going to take longer to work out and will present the company with ongoing challenges, so I wouldn't be in a hurry to step in here.</p><p>VARNEY: A future buyer of technology stocks, William Keithler joining us from Invesco Technology Fund in Denver.</p><p>Thanks for being with us, Bill.</p><p>KEITHLER: Thanks, Stuart.</p><p>BAY: It wasn't just U.S. stocks on a roller coaster this week. Markets across the globe witnessed their fair share of volatility. And despite a positive Friday session in European markets, including the biggest point gain ever in Frankfurt, for the week, London's FTSE, Frankfurt's Dax, and the Paris Cac 40 still ended in negative territory.  In Asia, a similar story -- up today, though Tokyo's Nikkei average shed nearly four percent on the week.  Hong Kong's battered Hang Seng index down more than nine percent.</p><p>VARNEY: It is now that time when we find out what some of MONEYLINE's other reporters are working on for tonight's program.</p><p>First up, Bruce Francis -- Bruce.</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Stuart, thank you.</p><p>One of the pillars of networking practically crumbled under selling pressure today.  So why didn't Lucent's fall bring down the whole house?  I'll have the story.</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Allan Dodds Frank.</p><p>The big five accounting firms face new scrutiny about conflicts of interest.  We'll tell you why.</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And I'm Peter Viles.</p><p>It's the one new technology in which Americans are not the global leaders, wireless phones.  Tonight, \"The Bottom Line\" on Nokia, the Finnish company that's leading the way.</p><p>BAY: Also coming up on MONEYLINE, the new job figures that smashed expectations, with unemployment at its lowest in decades.</p><p>VARNEY: We'll ask Jim Glassman of Chase Manhattan whether the numbers could sway the Fed.</p><p>That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Turning now to some of the day's top stories outside the world of business in our \"MONEYLINE Digest.\" We have some incoming pictures we'd like to show you.</p><p>Protests under way in Cuba, looks to be tens of thousands of people gathered there, protesting over the fate of Elian Gonzalez. And those were not the only protests.</p><p>Cuban exiles in Miami calling for new protests and a civil disobedience campaign over plans to return Elian Gonzalez to Cuba. Police warn they'll block a threatened attempt to jam car traffic Monday at Miami's airport.</p><p>Elian's great-uncle today filed in Miami for temporary custody of the 6-year-old boy, a first step toward an application for U.S. asylum for Elian.</p><p>President Clinton trying to jump start the troubled Mideast peace talks.  He's presented Israeli and Syrian negotiators with a paper summing up their common ground and their differences, hoping it will help the two sides focus on solutions.</p><p>There's growing enthusiasm for a White House run from New York tycoon Donald Trump.  He says there's a very good possibility he'll announce a $100 million campaign next month.  Trump appeared today with Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, who says he'd consider endorsing the developer for the Reform Party nomination.</p><p>And from short-order cook to multimillionaire, Johnnie Ely of the Bronx is the sole winner of New York's millennium millions lottery, with a $100 million jackpot.  Ely opted for a lump-sum pay-out of over $44 million.  He's expected to keep about $22 million after taxes.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, American workers hit the job jackpot last month and last year, in fact, according to the latest numbers from the government.  The economy created way more jobs than expected in December, with unemployment at 4.1 percent.  That's the lowest rate since January 1970.  December's performance capped a remarkable year for America's job-creation machine.</p><p>Kelli Arena reports from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This economy continues to surprise even the experts, creating more than 300,000 jobs last month, keeping the unemployment rate at a three-decade low. For all of 1999, the unemployment rate averaged 4.2 percent.</p><p>WILLIAM J. CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's the lowest annual minority unemployment rate for African-Americans and Hispanics ever recorded.  It is important to recognize the role technology has played. ARENA: Jobs were plentiful from construction sites to retail stores.  For the year, payrolls increased by 2.7 million.  As the labor market tightened, average hourly earnings rose, up six cents to $13.46.</p><p>But for the year, wages rose just 3.7 percent.  And that's actually the slowest pace in four years.  Productivity gains are credited with helping keep wage inflation under control.</p><p>ALEXIS HERMAN, LABOR SECRETARY: When you look at the real wage growth in this county, real wages are actually lagging behind productivity at about two percent.  So you still have an economy that's really very much in balance.</p><p>ARENA: But many economists are still convinced the Federal Reserve will move to raise interest rates to preempt an eventual pickup in inflation, even though it's not a problem right now.</p><p>JOHN RYDING, BEAR STEARNS: I don't think the Fed should be raising rates because there's an inflation problem.  I think the Fed's raising rates because of the strength of the economy.</p><p>ARENA: The Fed's next interest rate policy decision will come on February 2nd.</p><p>(on camera): The betting among economists is that the Central Bank will raise short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.</p><p>Kelli Arena, CNN financial news, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: Well, the bond market, judging by today's trading at least, seemed to hold its bets.  Very little change.  The 30-year Treasury edged up all of 1/32, with the yield holding at 6.54 percent.</p><p>BAY: Joining us now with more on today's jobs report and how it plays into the Fed's guessing game, Jim Glassman, senior U.S. economist with Chase Manhattan.</p><p>Jim, welcome.</p><p>JIM GLASSMAN, CHASE MANHATTAN: Thank you.</p><p>BAY: Strong labor report that 315,000 new jobs created.  I thought the markets would react a little more negatively.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, so did I.</p><p>Did you?  Were you surprised at the market's reaction?</p><p>GLASSMAN: No, really not, because the market has already been seeing a lot of news that tells us that the economy is roaring.  And they've already gotten used to the idea that the Fed probably will tighten in February and maybe March.  So this news really just confirmed that other news that we've been seeing.</p><p>BAY: Do you see anything inflationary in these numbers?</p><p>GLASSMAN: I don't.  That's really what's breathtaking about this news.  We get this phenomenal job growth, and yet wage inflation continues to be a steady.</p><p>BAY: So what is keeping wage inflation in check?  First of all, do we know?</p><p>GLASSMAN: I think -- I wish we did know.  This is a major mystery, and I think it's at the heart of what we call the new economy.  Because here you have unemployment at four percent.  Only two or three years ago, we all thought if unemployment fell below six percent you'd have an inflation problem.  And, frankly, here we are now, three years below five percent unemployment, and wages are well- behaved.  There's no problem here at all.  And I think it really comes down to -- there's lots of things going on in the economy.  The economy is much more dynamic.  The labor market's more dynamic. People have more options\u2026</p><p>BAY: What do you mean the labor market is more dynamic?</p><p>GLASSMAN: People have more options.  They can work part-time, they can work at home.  There are more options for retired folks. We're finding the people who are getting close to retirement are choosing to stay in the work force.  Money's not everything, and they find that they can do part-time work and do other things.  So the labor market is just offering people many more options than it did.</p><p>Also, frankly, we look different.  The labor force -- the work force looks a lot different.  There have been major demographic changes.  We're an older population.  We don't hop jobs as quickly. There's lots of things going on in the labor market.  At the same time, you put that together with what's going on in the business sector.  Companies are facing an onslaught of competition from the Internet, from foreign competition, and they have to keep an eye on their costs.</p><p>BAY: Do you agree with the consensus that we will get a rate hike in February?</p><p>GLASSMAN: Yes, probably so.</p><p>BAY: Yes, probably so.  How\u2026</p><p>GLASSMAN: I think that's right.  I think that\u2026</p><p>BAY: Probably how big a rate hike?</p><p>GLASSMAN: I think 25 basis points.  And I think that's key, because in the market, people have been worrying that the Fed might actually have to step -- push interest rates up about half a point in February.  I think that's not the Fed's style.  They have no reason. There's no inflation problem.  All they need to do is sort of catch up with where the market has gone.  Since Thanksgiving, interest rates have moved up about a half a point.  I think that's all we're going to see by late spring.</p><p>BAY: All right, we'll find out fairly soon.</p><p>Jim Glassman, thanks, as always, for joining us.</p><p>GLASSMAN: Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: I'm still shaking my head.</p><p>BAY: Still to come on MONEYLINE, the Securities and Exchange Commission takes a hard look at the world's biggest accounting firm and calls for change.</p><p>VARNEY: That story's next for you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Well, believe it or not, today there were more highs than lows.  And here's a partial list of those highs: Proctor &amp; Gamble, Forest Laboratories, the oil and gas company Kerr-McGee, Santa Fe International and Columbia HCA, new highs all.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is concerned that major accounting firms have been lax about conflict-of-interest rules.  This after a study looked into practices at the world's No. 1 firm, Pricewaterhousecoopers,</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank has the story for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK (voice-over): For Pricewaterhousecoopers, the independent examination of its employees' investment practices uncovered startlingly widespread violations of the firm's ethics policy.  The report, commissioned at the request of the SEC and undertaken by a New York law firm, found that nearly half of the accounting firm's 2,700 partners held investments in companies being audited by Pricewaterhousecoopers.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission rules are designed to protect the integrity of audits by prohibiting even the appearance of conflicts of interest.  Direct investments, no matter how small, in clients is not permitted.  Even an indirect financial interest, such as a credit card balance of more than $5,000 at a client bank, is not allowed.</p><p>PROF. STEPHEN GILLERS, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL: Pricewaterhousecoopers and other auditing firms that may have been lax in the past have to put into place a policing mechanism that is credible to regulators and the public, and not the one they had where the police were themselves violating the rules.</p><p>FRANK: In a letter to employees, pricewaterhousecoopers' top two executives said that while the report was embarrassing, \"At no time was the objectivity or integrity of any PWC audit compromised.\" Still, the findings at the world's biggest auditing firm are triggering an industry-wide examination of whether ethics policies are actually being followed.  The other big accounting firms, Arthur Andersen, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp; Young and KPMG will be checked, despite their assertions that their current policies are sufficient.</p><p>SUSAN COFFEY, AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CPAS: The impact on the profession is huge.  And the firms will have to change their systems of quality control as a result of this.  The firms have agreed to implement investment tracking systems.</p><p>FRANK (on camera): Many accountants view the current rules as confusing and out of date.  And in this era of global accounting firms with thousands of clients, it can be difficult for an accountant to identify all the potential conflicts.</p><p>Allan Dodds Frank, CNN financial news, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BAY: Coming up, Real Networks, rather busy today making a few deals.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, we're going to return to that new economy company for you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Checking some of the stocks that hit 52-week lows today, Gadzoox Networks, eToys, Charter Communications, Vista Bancorp and Peoples Bancorp.</p><p>In other corporate news, Real Networks wants to offer consumers greater access to digital music.

BAY: And the company that helps the world go mobil.  The cell phone king Nokia in \"The Bottom Line.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Staggering losses for one of Wall Street's most predictable and rewarding stocks, Lucent Technologies, in the busiest session ever for a single issue.</p><p>If the Fed needed another reason to hike interest rates, this could be it: the strongest job market since the Vietnam War.</p><p>And our special Friday feature, \"The Bottom Line.\" Tonight, Nokia, the wireless leader that emerged from that high-tech mecca Finland.</p><p>BAY: But first our top story: A breathtaking rally after a nail-biting start to 2000.  The Dow industrials ended this first week of trading the same way it ended 1999, at a record.</p><p>While the Nasdaq came back from the brink of a correction, the Dow climbed 269 points to close at 11,522, more than making up for this week's steep losses.  Volume on the Big Board: 1.2 billion shares.  Much more green than red on the Dow.  Twenty-five Dow stocks gained ground, five fell, and no stocks were unchanged.  The Nasdaq soared as well, up 155 points, it's biggest point gain ever, to close at 3882.  Volume a heavy 1.6 billion shares.</p><p>Today's rally all the more surprising given the disastrous day for Lucent.  The stock tumbled more than 15 3/4 from yesterday's 4:00 p.m. close, after warning that earnings would fall short of expectations.  But the stock did recover a bit from yesterday's after- hours trading.  Volume was the heaviest for any single stock in history, 136 million shares traded.</p><p>VARNEY: Here's how wild this week was: The Nasdaq had both its biggest point loss and its biggest point gain -- within a span of four days.  The Dow was just as volatile, though more resilient, as investors ploughed into the oldest of the blue chips.</p><p>Here's Susan Lisovicz, to wrap up the week for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After a year of unprecedented gains, Wall Street partied like it was, well, 1999.  But when the new century arrived, so did a huge hangover.  On the second trading day of 2000, the Dow industrials plunged 359 points.  The Nasdaq plummeted 229 points, its biggest one-day point loss ever.</p><p>The Street's best performer continued its nosedive over the next two sessions, flirting with the percentage loss of 10 percent, commonly defined as a correction, before bargain hunters came roaring back.</p><p>MICHAEL HOLLAND, CHAIRMAN, HOLLAND &amp; CO.: People have been grasping for straws for the last several days as to why the markets are going down now.  They have used interest rates as a reason, they have used Y2K post-relief selling as a reason, and even bonuses coming late as a reason.  Each of these three is almost laughable.</p><p>LISOVICZ: But investors weren't laughing.  They were busy getting out of high-priced tech issues, and into value stocks.</p><p>BARRY HYMAN, EHRENKRANTZ, KING, NUSSBAUM: Money did not leave the market.  Money went to other sectors of the market.  At this time of the year, there is the so-called \"January effect,\" where the beaten-down stocks and the beaten-down sectors of the previous year tend to do better.</p><p>LISOVICZ: That rotation was seen in drug stocks.  Merck shot up by more than 11 1/2 percent for the week.  American Home Products rocketed 14 percent.  Utility stocks also participated in the power play, Williams and Enron each advancing with double-digit percentage gains.  But by week's end, tech issues resumed their favored status.</p><p>ETHAN HARRIS, LEHMAN BROTHERS: The jitters that we've seen in the markets have had more to do with the speed and size of the rally than any fundamental view that the new economy, the technology economy, is not for real.  It is for real.</p><p>LISOVICZ: And investors rewarded the Nasdaq with a 155-point rally and the final session of the week, its biggest one-day point gain ever.</p><p>MICHAEL MOE, MERRILL LYNCH: What you're seeing is really a sequel of a movie that we have seen over the last three years, which is we had dramatic rises in the market, and we have seen equally dramatic corrections.</p><p>LISOVICZ (on camera): And there's every indication that there is more drama to come as we enter the treacherous period when companies issue earnings warnings, and as the calendar draws closer to the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting.</p><p>Susan Lisovicz, CNN financial news, New York.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: And here's more on today's market surge: On the Big Board, more than two stocks rose for every one that fell.  And here is a switch: 67 stocks hit new highs, just 49 new lows.  Not seen that for a long time.  Among the stocks that catapulted the Dow into record territory: Procter &amp; Gamble, Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson, General Electric, and Coke.</p><p>BAY: Another reason why today's big advance was surprising: More evidence that the economy is booming.  The December employment report pointed to the strongest job market in a generation.  The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 percent, and 315,000 people were added to the nation's work force, the biggest gain since July.  But bond prices barely budged.  The 30-year treasury up slightly, the yield at 6.54 percent. Ceci Rodgers has more on the curious reaction to yet another sign this economic expansion isn't over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CECI RODGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A schizophrenic day in the bond pits.  Prices plummeted at first, on signs of a too- hot market for jobs and wages.  But then they recovered, as hedge funds and other bargain hunters stepped in to buy.  A closer look at December's jobs report also helped calm nerves among inflation-wary traders.</p><p>ANDY WALLACE, R.J. O'BRIEN: If you look at it on a year-to-year basis, the average hourly earnings are still around the current trends, not showing any accelerating signs of inflation in wage growth.</p><p>RODGERS: Warmer-than-usual weather and Y2K-related hiring may have also boosted the numbers.  As a result, many believe the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point next month, and not the half a percentage point hike feared earlier in the week.</p><p>CHARLES LIEBERMAN, FIRST. INST. SECURITIES: The inflation news so far is still relatively benign.  It hasn't been that bad, so there is no sense of urgency that I think will arise from that.</p><p>RODGERS: Economists say the Fed isn't battling an inflation blaze, but a brushfire, and will probably continue to make small credit-tightening moves after February.  For one thing, the labor market remains tight.  The percentage of workers leaving jobs voluntarily rose again in December, while the pool of those available and willing to work fell.</p><p>DIANE SWONK, BANK ONE: Service-sector firms, like Starbucks, for instance, have already complained that their profits are much narrower than they thought they would be this year, a little slower than they thought they would be, because of rapidly rising labor costs.  And the bottom line for firms like Starbucks is that there's only so many ways you can innovate around making a cup of capuccino.</p><p>RODGERS (on camera): While bonds passed this latest test, next week brings fresh challenges, including the government's latest read on producer prices, consumer prices, and retail sales.</p><p>Ceci Rodgers, CNN financial news, Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: Much more to come on today's big loser, Lucent.  Telecom rivals scramble to make it very clear: Lucent's problems are its own.</p><p>BAY: And investors ask themselves: Buy, sell, or hold on the stock?</p><p>That's next on MONEYLINE. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: In Tonight's MONEYLINE \"Focus,\" perhaps the most challenging day in the history of Lucent technologies.  The stock reeled from an earnings warning, the company's first ever.  And it came as a shock to many investors, who have paid a high price for Lucent's consistent growth.  But if they were worried about a ripple effect across the telecom industry, it never materialized.</p><p>Bruce Francis joins us now with more on this, live -- Bruce.</p><p>FRANCIS: Stuart, thank you.</p><p>Lucent's big problem is that it has stumbled on the high end of optical networking, and some customers can't wait for Lucent to ship its new line, so they are bolting to competitors like Nortel.  Lucent also blames weak software sales, as customers now prefer to buy throughout the year, not just at the end.</p><p>Lucent closed yesterday at 69, traded as low as $50 in after hours trading, and ended today's record setting session at just over $53.  An active and agonizing session it was for millions of investors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS (voice-over): Lucent shares crumbled under unprecedented selling, more than 15 times its average volume, making it the most active stock in a single session on the NYSE.  Analysts downgraded Lucent, and watched a former favorite stock hunker down for what could be a long winter's nap.  Investors will want to see evidence that the product transition that is now hurting earnings is over before it's time to buy again.</p><p>STEVEN LEVY, LEHMAN BROTHERS: We don't think that the stock is going anywhere for the next six months.  We think it is going to hang out right around these levels.</p><p>FRANCIS: Fortunately for Lucent's rivals, the conclusion on Wall Street was quick and just about universal: That Lucent's problems were Lucent's alone.  Both Nortel and Cisco issued statements that affirm their earnings outlook.  That helped ignite a rally in networking stocks that was almost as dazzling as Lucent's fall, as many analysts said that Lucent's loss will be Nortel's gain, especially in the fast- growing area of optical networking, which uses pulses of light to transmit data.</p><p>MICHAEL CHING, MERRILL LYNCH: Nortel does have a leadership position, and with Lucent's recent problems it is probably expanding that leadership.</p><p>FRANCIS: Ciena and Nortel both gained more than 25 percent. Cisco, Tellabs, and Alcatel also surged.  Still, analysts caution that a rough quarter or two for Lucent doesn't mean that the networking giant has lost its advantages. CHING: They have a buying power and a scale that I don't think you want to underestimate, so I think longer-term Lucent will be an OK -- a fine investment.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANCIS: Traders who sold Lucent after hours yesterday got a jump on what turned out to be a brutal session.  But those who bailed out of networking stars like Nortel and Ciena missed out, Stuart and Willow, on a really stunning rally.  So watch that after-hours trading.</p><p>VARNEY: All right, Bruce, here's the key question, as far as I am concerned: How long before Lucent returns to the kind of earnings reports that we have been used to throughout its history?</p><p>FRANCIS: Company guidance here is about a quarter.  It could take longer, maybe even two.  Product transitions are very thorny ones, and let's see how this bleeds through to the bottom line.  Can Lucent execute?  That's a big question.</p><p>VARNEY: Have you ever seen before such a widely-held, big-name, highly-capitalized stock that loses so much ground in matter of hours? I can't remember this ever happening before.</p><p>FRANCIS: This is a big one, and what is so notable is that it didn't take down those other stocks.  Wall Street was rational in this otherwise, some say, irrational market.</p><p>VARNEY: Did they figure perhaps that the business would just go to those competitors, that that's what was happening, that it was -- Lucent was losing market share and business, and the others were benefiting?</p><p>FRANCIS: There's no question that there's lots of demand out there.  Wall Street likes to see that this wasn't a demand-driven problem.</p><p>BAY: Lucent have to fight to get that market share back?</p><p>FRANCIS: I think they will.  You know, if you lose a customer in this fast-growing way, that's letting the camel's nose inside someone else's tent.  This could be a problem.</p><p>VARNEY: Well said.</p><p>Bruce Francis, thank you.</p><p>BAY: Lucent's bad news was a huge blow to its biggest shareholders, which happen to be the biggest mutual funds in the country.  The Vanguard 500 index owns 25 million shares of Lucent, and Fidelity Magellan owns nearly 24 million shares.  So both funds lost, on paper, about $4 billion.</p><p>After losing so much money today, will investors stick with a stock that's surrounded by so much uncertainty?  Especially since Lucent has enjoyed the kind of run-up that takes years to happen, not just three.</p><p>AT&amp;T spun off Lucent in 1996.  Up until yesterday, the stock was trading at 10 times its IPO price.</p><p>But that kind of performance can also inspire fierce loyalty, as Greg Clarkin reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Richard Zito and Doug Flynn run a financial planning firm on New York's Long Island, and there is one stock everyone wanted to talk about today, Lucent.</p><p>RICHARD ZITO, FLYNN ZITO CAPITAL MNGMT.: It was unprecedented from the standpoint that in such a short period of time this morning we had so many calls.</p><p>CLARKIN: Lucent is the most widely-held stock in the country, more than three billion shares outstanding.  The telecommunications equipment maker said profits will not be what Wall Street expected. Its shares dived in after-hours trading, wiping out almost $51 billion, or about one-quarter of its market capital.</p><p>Bank of AmericaCapital Management lost about $250 million on its $1 billion investment in Lucent in after-hours trading, but it hung on to its shares, and even had a glimmer of good news as Lucent shares picked up $1 in New York trading.</p><p>JOHN ZIMMERMAN, BANC OF AMERICA CAPITAL MGMT.: It was a very large drop, and it's obviously an unpleasant experience as a shareholder, but our feeling is that Lucent remains well positioned, and we're very heartened to see the $1 or so increase in the share price over the course of business today.  It seems like a lot of people got to the point where they were comfortable with the valuation.</p><p>CLARKIN: And many smaller investors sensed an opportunity in the battered stock.</p><p>ZITO: I was very surprised to see that the calls were people were looking to buy as opposed to sell.  I think they feel -- like most clients, like most people -- that it is such a strong company that it's just a small bump in the road.</p><p>CLARKIN (on camera): And despite the fact that many analysts expect Lucent's problems to linger, many investors say they expect Lucent's shares to quietly creep back to pre-profit warning levels.</p><p>Greg Clarkin, CNN financial news, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: Coming up: Internet stocks propel the Nasdaq higher and snap a three-day losing streak.</p><p>BAY: But it's not all good news.  The details when MONEYLINE returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's \"MONEYLINE Movers,\" the German software maker SAP stormed up 13 5/8 after reporting that its fourth-quarter profits had nearly doubled.  That gain helped propel the German Dax to its biggest gain in a single session.</p><p>Tiffany was up nearly 5 1/2 after PaineWebber upgraded the stock to attractive.  The jewelry retailer sold off yesterday, despite reporting strong holiday sales.</p><p>BAY: In other corporate news, phone carrier McLeodUSA says it will buy Splitrock services, which runs a nationwide high-speed data network.  The price tag: close to $2 billion in stock.</p><p>Wal-Mart also wants to expand its presence in cyberspace.  The country's biggest retailer will form a separate company to enhance its walmart.com site.  Wal-Mart will team up with venture capital firm Accel partners, and said it plans to pursue a public offering in the future.  Shares of Wal-Mart up more than 4 3/4.</p><p>And Instinet, the electronic trading system owned by Reuters, says it will open its doors to retail investors at the start of the second quarter.  Analysts say Instinet, the leading after-hours system, could pose a serious threat to sites like E*Trade and Ameritrade.</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's sector focus, a stellar day for Internet stocks as investors drove that recently-depressed sector sharply higher, the Goldman Sachs Internet index up nearly 7 percent. However, for some investors that may be little comfort.  The index is still down more than 11 percent in just the past four trading sessions.</p><p>Checking some of today's big winners, we call this volatility. Yahoo! up more than 39 1/4, though it is still off 6 percent on the week.  DoubleClick up nearly 37 1/2.  CMGI jumped 24 3/4.</p><p>B-to-B Internet companies also strong.  Ariba, for example, up nearly 19 1/2.  Broadvision up more than 19 -- and change, I should say -- though still off 13 percent on the week.  Beat that.</p><p>BAY: Make all of that volatility, nicely said.</p><p>Coming up next: Inside the world's wireless wonder.</p><p>VARNEY: Nokia, the cell-phone king, sprung out of Helsinki, not Tokyo.</p><p>\"The Bottom Line\" is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BAY: Now, \"The Bottom Line,\" our regular Friday feature inside one company on the move.  Tonight, Nokia, the Finnish company that seemed to emerge from obscurity.  It's out to create a world without wires.</p><p>Peter Viles reports.</p><p>VILES (voice-over): American companies may dominate the wired world, but in wireless technology, America is a latecomer, and the world leader is Finland.  What Wall Street is to money, what is Hollywood to movies, Finland is to the cellular phone.  Six out of 10 Fins carry one, a penetration rate double that of the United States. When stock analysts want to see the future of wireless applications, they go to Helsinki, because the world's leading wireless phone maker is Finland's Nokia, a slimmed-down conglomerate that has outmaneuvered, outhustled and outinnovated competitors Motorola and Ericsson.</p><p>ROB GENSLER, T. ROWE PRICE: If you really want to get to the core of Nokia and what makes them great is the pace of innovation. And as long as they keep the pace of innovation up, they will have very great growth and phenomenal margins.</p><p>VILES: That innovation included the realization that many customers want a phone that's also the fashion statement, fun, stylish and easy to use.</p><p>GENSLER: They have a keen eye for design.  They understood far before anybody else that what made handsets powerful was the fact that people were using them and enjoyed using them and design mattered.</p><p>VILES: Nokia's growth has been stunning.  In 1997, it sold 21 million phones, 20 percent of the global market, 41 million the next year and 72 million last year, good for 30 percent of the wireless market, which is why Nokia's stock has also exploded, up 877 percent over the last two years -- impressive for a company that some consumers still assume is just another Japanese electronics brand.</p><p>WILSKA: Because the name looks like Japanese name, even though I don't look too much Japanese.</p><p>VILES: Wall Street sees the company's Finnish base as an advantage.  It gives Nokia daily access to a test market of five million, a market where Nokia phones are capable of transmitting short text messages, downloading weather reports from the Internet, even talking to other machines and paying for Cokes.</p><p>WILSKA: We can foresee that three years, five years from now, people are paying their bills by using their phones.  They can go to grocery store and instead of swiping their debit or credit card, they can point their phone at the cash register and pay their bill by using their phone.</p><p>VILES: The great opportunity for Nokia is also the great threat. What happens as more and more Internet access is wireless?  If everyone from Microsoft to Panasonic wants to build a new pocket computer, will Nokia's advantage last?</p><p>MARK MCKECHNIE, BANK OF AMERICA SECURITIES: I think it's going to be interesting to watch the new entrants into this base, such as the Palm, such as HandSpring, who's got the visor product.  And so Nokia will have to maintain their leadership, will have to innovate quicker than they to stay ahead of it.  But net net, we think they've got the management strength, the history, and the relationship with carriers and the brand name to maintain that leadership.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VILES: Now with or without all those Internet applications, the market for wireless phone service voice service is exploding.  It grew 50 percent last year.  Four hundred fifty million people globally now have wireless phones, and Nokia predicts it will grow to a billion users, a billion cell phones by the year 2002 -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: I've got to ask, though.  How do they stay on top over a very long period of time in a very fast-moving industry?</p><p>VILES: One of the keys in this business is coming out with a new product even if it might hurt the existing product you have on the market.  Intel is also known for this.  Analysts refer to this as eating your own young.  It's coming to market with a product, even if it hurts what you've got out there.</p><p>VARNEY: Get it on the market, get it out there fast.</p><p>VILES: Because the consumers are looking for it.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BAY: That billion users, where are the users likely to come from?</p><p>VILES: All over the world.  And the United States is lagging in some areas.  Asia and Europe have been the strongest areas where the penetration is the greatest.</p><p>Peter Viles, thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>Up next, \"Ahead of the Curve,\" some of what you need to know tonight before those markets open again next week.</p><p>BAY: You are watching MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Let's check for you what investors will keep an eye on for next week.</p><p>On the economic front, we have two important inflation figures coming out, the producer price index and the consumer price index, both for December.</p><p>Also due out, figures on retail sales, wholesale trade and the latest numbers on the nation's manufacturing sector, too. In terms of earnings, a few Dow components are expected to report.  They include Alcoa, International Paper and Intel -- remember, Intel is now a Dow stock.</p><p>Also due out, fourth-quarter results from Yahoo!</p><p>BAY: And after quite a week on Wall Street, that's MONEYLINE for this Friday.</p><p>I'm Willow Bay.</p><p>VARNEY: And I'm Stuart Varney.</p><p>Thanks for joining us.

Poll after poll in the past few years has found that people are worried about online privacy and do not trust big tech firms with their data. But they carry on clicking and sharing and posting, preferring speed and convenience above all else. Last year was Silicon Valley's annus horribilis: a year of bots, Russian meddling, sexism, monopolistic practice and tax-minimising. But I think 2018 might be worse still: the year of the neo-luddite, when anti-tech words turn into deeds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The caricature of machine-wrecking mobs doesn't capture our new approach to tech. A\u00a0better phrase is what the writer Blake Snow has called \"reformed luddism\" : a society that views tech with a sceptical eye, noting the benefits while recognising that it causes problems, too. And more importantly, thinks that something can be done about it.</p><p>One expression of reformed luddism is already causing a\u00a0headache for the tech titans. Facebook and Google are essentially huge advertising firms. Ad-blocking software is their kryptonite. Yet millions of people downloaded these plug-ins to stop ads chasing them across the web last year, and their use has been growing (on desktops at least) close to 20% each year, indiscriminately hitting smaller publishers, too.</p><p>More significantly, the whole of society seems to have woken up to the fact there is a psychological cost to constant checking, swiping and staring. A\u00a0growing number of my friends now have \"no phone\" times, don't instantly sign into the cafe wifi, or have weekends away without their computers. This behaviour is no longer confined to intellectuals and academics, part of some clever critique of modernity. Every single parent I know frets about \"screen time\", and most are engaged in a struggle with a toddler over how much iPad is allowed. The alternative is \"slow living\" or \"slow tech\". \"Want to become a slow-tech family?\" writes Janell Burley Hoffmann, one of its proponents. \"Wait! Just wait - in line, at the doctor's, for the bus, at the school pickup - just sit and wait.\" Turning what used to be ordinary behaviour into a \"movement\" is a very modern way to go about it. But it's probably necessary.</p><p>I would add to this the ever-growing craze for yoga, meditation, reiki and all those other things that promise inner peace and meaning - except for the fact all the techies do it, too. Maybe that's why they do it. Either way, there is a palpable demand for anything that involves less tech, a\u00a0fetish for back-to-basics. Innocent Drinks have held two \"Unplugged Festivals\", offering the chance of \"switching off for the weekend... No wifi, no 3G, no traditional electricity\". Others take off-grid living much further. There has been an uptick in \"back to the land\" movements: communes and self-sustaining communities that prefer the low-tech life. According to the Intentional Community Directory, which measures the spread of alternative lifestyles, 300 eco-villages were founded in the first 10 months of 2016, the most since the 1970s. I spent some time in 2016 living in an off-grid community where no one seemed to suffer mobile phone separation anxiety. No one was frantically checking if their last tweet went viral and we all felt better for it.</p><p>Even insiders are starting to wonder what monsters they've unleashed. Former Google \"design ethicist\" Tristan Harris recently founded the nonprofit organisation Time Well Spent in order to push back against what he calls a \"digital attention crisis\" of our hijacked minds. Most of the tech conferences I'm invited to these days include this sort of introspection: is it all going too far? Are we really the good guys?</p><p>That tech firms are responding is proof they see this is a serious threat: many more are building in extra parental controls, and Facebook admitted last year that too much time on their site was bad for your health, and promised to do something. Apple investors recently wrote to the company, suggesting the company do more to \"ensure that young consumers are using your products in an optimal manner\" - a\u00a0bleak word combination to describe phone-addled children, but still.</p><p>It's worth reflecting what a radical change all this is. That economic growth isn't everything, that tech means harm as well as good - this is not the escape velocity, you-can't-stop-progress thinking that has colonised our minds in the past decade. Serious writers now say things that would have been unthinkable until last year: even the FT calls for more regulation and the Economist asks if social media is bad for democracy.</p><p>This reformed luddism does not however mean the end of good, old-fashioned machine-smashing. The original luddites did not dislike machines per se, rather what they were doing to their livelihoods and way of life. It's hard not to see the anti-Uber protests in a similar light. Over the past couple of years, there have been something approaching anti-Uber riots in Paris ; in Hyderabad, India, drivers took to the streets to vent their rage against unmet promises of lucrative salaries; angry taxi drivers blocked roads last year across Croatia, Hungary and Poland. In Colombia, there were clashes with police, while two Uber vehicles were torched in Johannesburg and 30 metered taxi drivers arrested.</p><p>Imagine what might happen when driverless cars turn up. The chancellor has recently bet on them, promising investment and encouraging real road testing; he wants autonomous vehicles on our streets by 2021. The industry will create lots of new and very well-paid jobs, especially in robotics, machine learning and engineering. For people with the right qualifications, that's great. And for the existing lorry and taxi drivers? There will still be some jobs, since even Google tech won't be able to handle Swindon's magic roundabout for a while. But we will need far fewer of them. A\u00a0handful might retrain, and claw their way up to the winner's table. I am told repeatedly in the tech startup bubble that unemployed truckers in their 50s should retrain as web developers and machine-learning specialists, which is a convenient self-delusion. Far more likely is that, as the tech-savvy do better than ever, many truckers or taxi drivers without the necessary skills will drift off to more precarious, piecemeal, low-paid work.</p><p>Does anyone seriously think that drivers will passively let this happen, consoled that their great-grandchildren may be richer and less likely to die in a car crash? And what about when Donald Trump's promised jobs don't rematerialise, because of automation rather than offshoring and immigration? Given the endless articles outlining how \"robots are coming for your jobs\", it would be extremely odd if people didn't blame the robots, and take it out on them, too.</p><p>Once people start believing that machines are a force of oppression rather than liberation, there will be no stopping it. Between 1978 and 1995, the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, sent 16 bombs to targets including universities and airlines, killing three people and injuring 23. Kaczynski, a Harvard maths prodigy who began to live off-grid in his 20s, was motivated by a belief that technological change was destroying human civilisation, ushering in a period of dehumanised tyranny and control. Once you get past Kaczynski's casual racism and calls for violent revolution, his writings on digital technology now seem uncomfortably prescient. He predicted super-intelligent machines dictating society, the psychological ill-effects of tech-reliance and the prospect of obscene inequality as an elite of techno-savvies run the world.</p><p>The American philosopher John Zerzan is considered the intellectual heavyweight for the anarcho-primitivist movement, whose adherents believe that technology enslaves us. They aren't violent, but boy do they do hate tech. During the Unabomber's trial, Zerzan became a confidant to Kaczynski, offering support for his ideas while condemning his actions. Zerzan is finding himself invited to speak at many more events, and the magazine he edits has seen a boost in sales. \"Something's going on,\" he tells me - by phone, ironically. \"The negative of technology is now taken as a given.\" I ask if he could forsee the emergence of another Unabomber. \"I think it's inevitable,\"\u00a0he says. \"As things get worse, you're not going to stop it any other way,\" although he adds that he hopes it doesn't involve violence against people.</p><p>There are signs that full-blown neo-luddism is already here. In November last year, La Casemate, a tech \"fab lab\" based in Grenoble, France, was vandalised and burned. The attackers called it \"a notoriously harmful institution by its diffusion of digital culture\". The previous year, a similar place in Nantes was targeted. Aside from an isolated incident in Mexico in 2011, this is, as far as I can tell, the first case since the Unabomber of an act of violence targeting technology explicitly as technology, rather than just a proxy for some other problem. The French attackers' communique was published by the environmentalist/anarchist journal Earth First! and explained how the internet's promise of liberation for anticapitalists has evaporated amid more surveillance, more control, more capitalism. \"Tonight, we burned the Casemate,\" it concludes. \"Tomorrow, it will be something else, and our lives will be too short, in prison or in free air, because everything we hate can burn.\"</p><p>If the recent speculation about jobs and AI is even close to being correct, then fairly soon \"luddite\" will join far-right and Islamist on the list of government-defined extremisms. Perhaps anti-tech movements will even qualify for the anti-radicalisation Prevent programme.</p><p>No one wants machines smashed or letter bombs. The wreckers failed 200 years ago and will fail again now. But a little luddism in our lives won't hurt. The realisation that technological change isn't always beneficial nor inevitable is long overdue, and that doesn't mean jettisoning all the joys associated with modern technology. You're not a fogey for thinking there are times where being disconnected is good for you. You're just not a machine.</p><p>                                            Radicals: Outsiders Changing the World                                          by Jamie Bartlett is published by William Heinemann.

Medical practices have reached a tipping point as the industry accelerates its shift to value-based care and adapts to patient demands for a better consumer experience at the doctor's office. CareCloud researchers tracking the intersection of technology with patient expectations believe that a rising tide of patient consumerism, combined with regulatory and financial trends, will make 2018 the year medical practices invest in modern mobile technology and hardware that strengthen practice-patient interactions.\u00a0 'With patient out-of-pocket costs now accounting for 20-30 percent of a practice's revenue, a better patient experience is good medicine for the bottom line,' said Ken Com\u00e9e, CEO of CareCloud in a statement. </p><p>'Consumers are bringing their expectations for personalized on-demand service \u2014 and convenience in how they pay for and interact with that service \u2014 into the doctor's office. From wait-times to overdue bills, consumers want to know exactly where they stand with their medical providers, in real-time, via their mobile devices. We expect 2018 will be a watershed year for mobile technology that extends and improves the practice-patient experience outside the office walls.' Here are CareCloud's top five predictions for the upcoming 'Year of the Patient': 1. PXM as a New Category: A new segment in health technology is emerging: patient experience management[3] (PXM) is poised to join electronic health records (EHR), revenue cycle management (RCM) and practice management (PM) as a peer category and a must-have for any medical group in 2018. PXM systems cover a wide range of patient interactions with their health, including digital check-in, reminders, and personalized education \u2014 in the practice, at home or on the go. With patient-friendly mobile interfaces, PXM uses data from the practice's back-end technology suite in real-time to serve an exceptional patient workflow. All of which are key requirements given the growing importance of the patient payment process and rising patient expectations. 2. Paying Attention to Attention: A 2017 study[4] of over 1,100 patients by CareCloud showed that patients value personal attention from their physician, even more than their actual medical outcomes. A full seven out ten patients say that personal attention matters highly, jumping to 83 percent for patients over 60 years old. Compare that to 58 percent of patients saying health outcomes are key to their overall satisfaction. Medical practices will be expanding their focus on the patient experience in 2018, using techniques from the likes of Disney and Ritz-Carlton to train staff and create cultures of incredible service. Technology that reduces physician burnout and helps expand attention to patients will also be hot in the year ahead. Look for EHRs[5] focused on fewer clicks to give clinicians more time for patient care. 3. Perfecting the Payment Process: U.S. patients are already paying for 25 percent of their medical costs out-of-pocket. Experts predict premiums will increase[6] by 40 percent in 2018. At the same time, a recent CareCloud study shows one in three patients has never been asked to pay their medical bills during a visit. In the year ahead, medical practices will integrate better payment options and more price transparency into their patient experience \u2014 streamlining the process for practices while meeting the evolving needs of their patient populations. Look for mainstream financial giants such as First Data[7] acting on new opportunities for fintech growth in the medical sector. 4. The Millennial Movement: Millennials are now the largest generational cohort in the U.S., outpacing[8] Baby Boomers by half a million people. Their expectations and decisions are shaping the future of medicine. Early indications show they're more discerning 'buyers.' In fact, a recent CareCloud survey found that more than half of millennials would switch doctors if that led to reduced wait times. Millennials are also twice as likely as other age groups to switch doctors in order to use a computer/tablet to check in. For these reasons, medical groups will start transforming their practice to attract and retain this younger cohort of patients. Startups such as Forward are aiming at the millennial healthcare market and big tech players such as Amazon and Apple are expanding their interest \u2014 seeing potential in this large and growing segment of patients.  5. Analyze This: Despite an uncertain healthcare climate in 2017, government regulations continued to evolve in support of value-based reimbursement models. The Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and incentive payments for Alternative Payment Models (APMs) both advanced the focus on patient engagement, care coordination, and more collaborative care. Now that systems have been made electronic through the shift from paper to EHR, practices will lean more on their digitized records next year to run population health analytics like those from Lightbeam[9] in an effort to provide a more patient-centric approach to care. Practices that integrate analytics into their workflows will find data to be a distinct strategic asset in highly competitive markets.

And will different views towards Big Tech in the US, Europe and China lead to a \u201csplinternet\u201d?</p><p>The answer to the first question depends on whether politicians can develop a coherent world view about the surveillance capitalism practised by these digital giants, and agree on its most pressing implications.</p><p>In the US, for example, Democrats and Republicans are at odds about what really bothers them about Big Tech. Liberals are most concerned about the possibility of rightwing manipulation of elections. Meanwhile, conservatives say the tech platforms, whose employees tend to be progressive, have algorithms that discriminate against them. But there are no clear proposals on how to create more algorithmic transparency, and efforts around more online political advert regulation have stalled.</p><p>The two areas that are riper for change are privacy and antitrust. In both the US and Europe, there is widespread agreement that Big Tech rides roughshod over user privacy, as evidenced by almost weekly data breaches and allegations of misuse. There is tremendous opacity in how the largest platform-technology companies define and collect data, and sell it to third parties. Provisions for what happens to users whose data are compromised, meanwhile, are not strict enough.</p><p>At the moment, the burden of proof is on users themselves. Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation went some way towards addressing that issue, but California\u2019s tough new privacy laws, which are set to come into effect in 2020 and could become a national model, may go even further. It is a measure of the potential efficacy of the legislation, which would force platform-technology companies to disclose clearly just how they use consumer data, that Big Tech has launched a massive campaign to try and water it down.</p><p>The industry will also try hard to hold on to the Section 230 loophole in the US Communications Decency Act, as well as similar laws in Europe, through which they retain immunity from most problems arising from user-generated content on their websites.</p><p>The area that may see most action is antitrust. In the US, both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice have indicated the monopoly power of Big Tech is an area of major concern. In Europe, Google may once again face fines or penalties if it is found not to have complied properly with rulings about anti-competitive behaviour in the search and mobile handset markets. But in order to really shift the business model of the internet giants, regulators will have to find a way to show that consumer harm \u2014 currently the measure of monopoly power in the US \u2014 is based on more than just consumer prices, since Big Tech\u2019s opaque transactions are typically done in data rather than dollars.</p><p>One way to do that would be to shift to an earlier interpretation of antitrust regulations that focused not just on consumers but rather on proving that the larger economic ecosystem is being harmed (competitors cannot flourish, choice is reduced, the political economy is being manipulated, and so on). That is something the \u201c New Brandeis\u201d school of regulators, now ascendant in places like the FTC, is pushing for.</p><p>But a quicker, potentially less politicised way to curb monopoly power through an antitrust suit would be to put a price on data itself, enabling regulators to use the existing \u201cChicago School\u201d philosophy of consumer harm to break up the Big Tech companies.</p><p>There are some academics and critics who believe the disproportionate profit share taken by these companies over the past two decades relative to the benefits received by consumers can be quantified. After all, carbon credits represent a discreet form of value; why not data?</p><p>Economists are busy crunching numbers on that \u2014 and if a price can be put on data, all bets are off for Big Tech\u2019s current business model.</p><p>That would only be the case, of course, in the US and Europe. China has made it quite clear that it plans to take its own direction on the internet. More people in China access the internet than anywhere else in the world and President Xi Jinping has outlined plans to turn the country into a \u201ccyber-superpower\u201d by moving ahead in data-driven artificial intelligence, cyber security, and 5G networks.</p><p>Over the past two years, however, the Chinese government has shut down websites, censored more content and instituted stricter controls on how both local and foreign companies operate.</p><p>In the Middle Kingdom, there is no debate over privacy, liability or antitrust, nor will there be. In this sense, the net has already been splintered \u2014 the only question is how much further the trend will go.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-d72fb54cffc111e8b03fbc62050f3c4e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1T-GH61-JB77-K444-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><timeReceived>11:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 21, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009FYS</classCode><className>BAIDU INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Not only by your friends, your colleagues or your expartners. You are also being watched by artificial intelligence which continuously scans your activity for any hint of abuse, support for terrorism or - depending on where you live - suicidal intent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, Instagram announced it would be cracking down on images of self-harm after the father of 14-yearold Molly Russell blamed it for her suicide. Part of that crackdown will involve improving Instagram's AI tools for detecting such images in the first place. It is not alone: under escalating pressure to police the billions of messages they handle each day, US tech giants are increasingly relying on automated content moderation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When asked what they are doing to protect their users, they often point to these tools. In doing so, however, they raise uncomfortable questions. Social networks' use of AI moderation is quite varied. They hunt down automated and fake accounts, watching how many interactions you undertake per minute and recording how your mouse cursor moves across your screen (bots move in more angular patterns than humans).</p><p>\"AI plays a central role in content moderation simply because the job is too large for humans to handle,\" says Mason Marks, a fellow at Yale Law School who studies Facebook's mental health efforts. \"Pretty much everything that is posted on Facebook and Instagram is scanned by AI, not only for self-harm and signs of suicidal thoughts but also signs of human trafficking and child abuse.\"</p><p>Sometimes, these systems operate autonomously. Over a six-month period in 2018, Facebook blocked or removed almost 1.3bn fake accounts, most of them at the moment they were created. Twitter monitors what kind of accounts its users block, automatically filtering out similar content so that they never even see it. But very often AI is used to \"flag\" content for human moderators who take the final decision. That is the case for Facebook's extensive suicide prevention programme, which has referred 3,500 people to the emergency services since it began (but which does not operate in the EU due to its strict privacy laws).</p><p>Such systems will play a role in Instagram's new campaign against self-harm and suicide content. A spokesman explained that for around a year now, Instagram has used a mixture of reports from users and automated technology to flag self-harm content for human moderators, and that it never removes such content without human intervention.</p><p>The first problem, widely acknowledged by tech firms, is that AI's talents remain somewhat narrow. In Facebook's most recent set of moderation statistics, 96pc of the content it removed due to adult nudity and 99pc of the content it removed for child nudity was found and squashed using AI before anyone could even report it. The equivalent figure for hate speech, which is much harder to adjudicate, was 52pc, and for bullying and harassment it was only 15pc. That is probably for the best, because the latter behaviours require a much more nuanced approach; sometimes not even humans agree on the correct response. Still, it shows how limited AI moderation still is. \"You can't replace humans yet,\" says Jennifer Grygiel, a professor of communications at Syracuse University in the US. \"Even in the best case scenario, these situations of self-harm are of such importance that we need a human connection.\" Prof Grygiel questions whether such AI systems are working well enough, saying they have found and reported numerous self-harm accounts on Instagram over the last month. In one case, Instagram instructed Prof Grygiel to call the New York Police department about a suicidal teenager in the UK; a flummoxed officer suggested that they call Interpol. To prevent such situations, Prof Grygiel wants Facebook, which owns Instagram, to set up a central emergency hotline to manage users' reports across national borders, and to not rely on AI over properly trained humans.</p><p>When companies lean too heavily on AI, the results can be chaotic. Last December, the new owners of Tumblr, a blogging site popular with teenagers and young people, famous for its risqu\u00e9 content, tried to ban pornography. The new algorithms flagged anatomical drawings for artists' reference, pictures of the crevasses between sofa cushions, and curvaceous vases.</p><p>Some speculated that Tumblr was also using guilt by association, manually identifying known porn blogs and then flagging the users whom they interacted with or whose posts they shared. That may be why, at one point, Tumblr's own post announcing the new policy, which was shared by many porn blogs, was itself flagged as potential porn.</p><p>That illustrates a second problem: humans are cunning. The scary truth about self-harm content on Instagram, or any other social network, is that some of it comes from very committed and secretive communities. Even in 2016, Instagram forbade \"glorifying self-injury\", and made hashtags such as \"#selfharm\" unsearchable. But the dedicated pro-cutting community added another \"m\" to make \"#selfharmm\", and kept adding extra \"m\"s as each new version was banned. For that reason, tech firms are often reluctant to explain how their AI systems work in detail. Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety, has said that such openness would allow people to \"play games with the system\".</p><p>And this, according to Marks, may be the biggest problem with AI moderation. \"We don't really have any way to evaluate what Facebook is actually measuring, and we don't know anything about the outcome,\" he says. American hospitals working on suicide prediction are doing so with real medical records, publishing their information in peer reviewed journals. Facebook is not.</p><p>This is dangerous, he argues, because the level of surveillance Facebook exercises over mentally ill users and its willingness to contact the authorities on their behalf could actually be causing harm. \"I have serious concern that sending police to people might escalate the problem, and lead to people being put in hospital or medicated against their will,\" he says, citing research that shows hospitalisation sometimes increases the risk of suicide and laws in some countries which make attempted suicide a crime. Have any of Facebook's 3,500 \"wellness checks\" resulted in a shooting? We don't know, says Marks, but \"it may already have happened\".</p><p>What role social networks should even play here is a philosophical question society has not settled. Ministers vowed this week to regulate those which fail to protect children, and there is constant pressure on them to police their users. Yet Marks believes they should intervene in mental health only very rarely, in part because censoring self-harm could \"send the message that this is something we don't talk about, that this is shameful\". Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, echoed that point when he wrote in The Daily Telegraph last week that he does not want to just remove all self-harm content because it would deny vulnerable young people a \"safe space\" to talk about their illness. Part of the answer, says Marks, has to be more transparency about how AI moderation is used. People don't react well when they are judged by laws that they don't understand. Twitter got into trouble for allegedly \"shadow banning\" conservative users when its automated systems, designed to guide users away from fake news, caused prominent American politicians to disappear from search results. Facebook, after leaks of its secret moderation guidelines, is becoming much more open about its policies. Ultimately, as long as tech giants are under pressure to monitor their users, AI moderation will continue. If they deploy it responsibly, under the supervision of well-trained humans and with serious consultation, it could mitigate so many of the terrors that the internet has unleashed. But if they try to use it merely as a PR exercise, or as an excuse to keep their human overheads low, it could exacerbate those harms - and create new ones.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-146379815</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VDF-3081-DYTY-C09W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1339\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Airbnb is hoping the ruling against the New York City Council law will spell trouble for a similar proposal in the Assembly, giving the company an opening to advance more favorable regulations in the state Legislature.</p><p> Last session, two Assembly members faced off with competing bills to regulate companies like Airbnb and HomeAway. The first, sponsored by Assemblyman Joseph Lentol, was backed by Airbnb and would introduce regulations while also allowing hosts to rent out their homes for short periods of time, which is currently prohibited by state law. The second bill, introduced by Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, had the support of the hotel lobby and is very similar to the New York City Council law that was recently blocked. Like the City Council law, Rosenthal's bill would require Airbnb operators to disclose to city enforcement agencies their exact addresses in an effort to crack down on illegal operators and free up New York's scarce affordable housing. Neither Rosenthal's nor Lentol's bill passed in the Assembly last session.</p><p> Lentol has been working with Airbnb since 2017 to implement regulations that do not demand the kind of detailed personal information from hosts that the City Council law \u2013 or Rosenthal's bill \u2013 does. \"Airbnb is something that we need, it's something that thrives underground, and why shouldn't the state be getting revenue from it, and why can't we do it the right way?\" Lentol asked. \"The City Council bill appeared to be a bill looking to go for the jugular, and as a result of course (the judge) must have seen through that and declared it unconstitutional.\"</p><p> Lentol's bill would, among other things, limit hosts in New York to listing one unit on the site, collect the same taxes that hotels typically do, require hosts to register with the state Division of Homes and Community Renewal and bar hosts with repeated city or state law violations. \"It is the way of the future, and I'm looking to do it because I think it's workable. It works in other cities, San Francisco and around the world, London, Paris, and other cities in the United States of America,\" Lentol said. \"And here we are in New York City and we don't have it.\"</p><p> The assemblyman, who says Airbnb asked him to sponsor the bill, was also looking for a solution to a problem his constituents in Brooklyn neighborhoods like Greenpoint, Williamsburg and Fort Greene faced \u2013 wanting to rent out their homes but being restricted by the amount of time for which they were able to do so. Under New York state's multiple dwelling law, it is illegal to rent out a home for fewer than 30 days. For a family looking to make some extra income by renting out their home while they're out of town for two weeks, the current law presents a problem, and in authorizing short term rentals, Lentol's bill would fix that, Airbnb says.</p><p> So far, however, Rosenthal has been more successful in building momentum behind her bill. Last session, Lentol's bill accumulated 18 co-sponsors in the Assembly, while Rosenthal racked up nearly 40. And while the Lentol bill had Republican state Sen. John Bonacic as its sponsor in the state Senate last session, Bonacic has since retired and Lentol said he does not yet know whether another senator will pick it up. Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office has not come down in favor of either bill. \"We will review the legislation,\" Cuomo spokesman Tyrone Stevens wrote over email. The office of Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p> The fact that the City Council law was recently blocked suggests that Rosenthal's bill would have a harder time passing now, but Rosenthal shows no signs of slowing down. A spokesperson told City &amp; State that Rosenthal plans to introduce the bill again this session, though she is still considering whether any changes should be made.</p><p> \"Without address disclosure, New York stands to lose nearly 11,000 housing units and renters will pay more than $60 million in Airbnb-induced rent increases,\" Rosenthal said in an emailed statement. \"All the while, Airbnb will continue to make record profits on the backs of hardworking renters and our affordable housing, while hiding its illegal methods from the light of day. I have zero intention of standing idly by and allowing Airbnb to do that, which is why I will be working with my colleagues on legislation that will require of Airbnb the transparency it refuses to provide. One company will not hold a city and its affordable housing hostage.\"</p><p> Rosenthal has already had a win against the home-sharing industry, writing the 2016 state law that imposed high fines for illegally listing a unit on platforms like Airbnb. And though Airbnb did score a preliminary injunction to the City Council law, supporters of the Council law \u2013 including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson \u2013 predicted that the fight would continue and the law would ultimately prevail.</p><p> The federal judge who granted the injunction on the City Council law did so on the grounds that requiring home sharing services to disclose the addresses of their listings and the identities of hosts to the city violated the Fourth Amendment guarantee against illegal search and seizures.</p><p> Some, however, argue that if hosts are using their homes for commercial purposes, that kind of information should not be off limits. \"If you're treating a home as a business and essentially as a transient stay hotel room, there's no reason why that address should not be reported,\" said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. \"We know the location of all the hotel rooms in the city. So if you want your privacy, have your privacy, but then don't treat your house as a hotel room.\"</p><p> The preliminary injunction blocking the City Council law does buy time for the Lentol bill, even if it's the starting place for a compromise. \"The Lentol bill does represent the compromise,\" said Julie Samuels, executive director of Tech:NYC, a nonprofit tech industry group. \"It actually would regulate home sharing. And in many ways, it's the start of a conversation. It's not the end of a conversation. As that bill makes its way through the legislative process, I am cautiously optimistic that all the relevant stakeholders will come to the table and hammer out a version of legal and regulated home sharing that makes sense for New York and New Yorkers.\"</p><p> Lentol expects to reintroduce his bill in the Assembly by the end of February, according to both Meltzer and Lentol himself. Lentol is still consulting with his staff and others about the possibility of making minor changes to the bill, but he intends to keep its major provisions, including the one host, one home measure, and the registration system. Any changes to the bill at this point would likely involve strengthening tenant protections. \"I just want to make sure that there are airtight protections for tenants,\" Lentol said, \"so that they're not upset over the fact that there are going to be unscrupulous landlords who are going to use their apartments for hotels and keep needed, affordable housing off the market.\"</p><p> With the availability of affordable housing at crisis-level lows, one of the major complaints about Airbnb is that it takes housing \u2013 affordable or not \u2013 off the market. In January, New York City filed a $21 million lawsuit against a group of real estate brokers for allegedly using Airbnb to illegally rent out apartments, effectively turning residential buildings into hotels \u2013 one of the largest efforts at weeding out those who use the home-sharing service as a kind of commercial enterprise.</p><p> \"If Airbnb is serious about working with New York City they must drop the legislation they are advocating in Albany and quit turning a blind eye to the army of wealthy commercial operators using their website to gut our affordable housing,\" said Mike McKee, treasurer of Tenants PAC, which is a member of the Share Better Coalition, an organization backing the Rosenthal bill.</p><p> Behind both of these bills are powerful lobbying groups \u2013 the Hotel Association of New York City and the Hotel and Motel Trades Council on one side, and Airbnb on the other \u2013 all of which have deep pockets to turn out in Albany. With the hotel industry fiercely supporting Rosenthal's bill in the past, Lentol's bill will face tough opposition when both are reintroduced this session, even with the ruling against the City Council law.</p><p> In introducing regulatory legislation that would theoretically limit its own freedom to operate, Airbnb joins a handful of other tech giants trying to preempt restrictive legislation aimed at cracking down on tech by advancing legislation of their own. After a string of high-profile hacks, privacy breaches and covert data collection scandals, there's a growing appetite for regulation of Big Tech both in Washington and here in New York. A representative of Airbnb said the company understood concerns about bad actors using the platform to take housing off the market, and accordingly presented a fair compromise.</p><p> \"It never really makes sense to negotiate against yourself, but that's sort of what we had to do in this case, because there was nobody sitting at the other side of the table,\" said Josh Meltzer, Airbnb's head of public policy for the Northeast region.</p><p> While Lentol is proud of not caving to hotel interests, he also says that he's not completely beholden to Airbnb's interests either. \"I refuse to be unnecessarily lobbied by Airbnb to do exactly what they want because I want a bill that I want,\" he said. \"And I want to help Airbnb, but not necessarily just them. I want to help all of those kinds of platforms thrive in the communities.\"</p><p> Despite the challenges, Lentol says he is looking for feedback on the next version of the bill he introduces and is open to working with other lawmakers, tenants groups, the public and the hotel and trades unions to get a bill that works to protect everybody. Still, Lentol seems to recognize the considerable barriers to his bill passing \u2013 not the least of which is the hotel lobby. \"I know there are strong interests out there that are looking to prevent that from happening, but I'm a big boy now,\" he said. \"I've been in the Legislature a long time, I understand. I may not be able to get it done because of those powerful interests, but I'm still going to try to do the right thing.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Assemblyman Joseph Lentol in the Assembly Chamber at the Capitol.

Dubbed the \"Christchurch Call,\" it's a pledge to keep online platforms free of hateful content and terrorist outreach. Widely endorsed by other countries, including the EU, Canada, Indonesia and Britain, the pact's also been embraced by a large number of high tech providers, ranging from Amazon to Microsoft, YouTube to Google. Considering how tech companies, like notorious polluters, plead with regulatory agencies to self-police, but never do, consider their inducements. Demands for breaking up the big tech giants have become prevalent among critics. Accused of being too powerful to regulate, even Facebook and Twitter are answering the Call.</p><p> With such an overarching need and consensus for the pledge you'd hope to find America on-board. Most of our mass shootings are by white supremacists, many of whom, like the Christchurch madman, put diatribes online. Yet, despite the Call's mission to preserve \"principles of a free, open and secure internet, without compromising human rights and fundamental freedoms,\" the U.S. has chosen to abstain. Coming on the heels of recent withdrawals from nuclear arms treaties with Russia and Iran, this latest U.S. disconnect is yet another indicator of our floundering democracy. Attitudes around the globe towards U.S. policies at odds with planetary welfare have been souring for years, certainly since our failure to sign the Kyoto Protocol, the invasion of Iraq and, more recently, reneging on the Paris Climate Accord. We've ceased to be that shining symbol of democracy we propagandize.</p><p> Findings from a study by the Eurasia Group Foundation were recently summarized in a Time magazine article by Ian Bremmer. Among eight countries surveyed, attitudes about the U.S. and its brand of democracy were interesting and mixed. Brazilians and Chinese had favorable views, as did citizens in India, the world's largest democracy. Japan and Germany by contrast, despite longtime alliances with the States, had negative views, Germany especially. One of the survey's conclusions was that wealthier nations, Germany and Japan for example, tended to look unfavorably at the Trump administration and income inequalities in America. As a result, their countries were perceived as much better democracies. Citizens in authoritarian or emerging-market societies, however, while uniformly resenting our involvement in other countries' affairs and U.S. foreign policies in general, still coveted our freedoms.</p><p> The use of armed interventions to promote democracy, without knowing unintended, long-term consequences of such actions, forces people to forgo personal securities for the right to vote. Shouldn't we allow nations to chart their own egalitarian courses while Americans acknowledge and correct our flaws in democratic processes at home? In other words, shouldn't we advance democracy abroad by setting good examples here? As Emma Goldman suggested, before making the world safe for democracy, we should first make democracy safe in America. Democracy should be more than facades to cover corrupt, leaderless politics and half-witted decision-making focused on future elections instead of future generations. Transparency has always been its hallmark. As long as congress and the White House value ideology over reason, avoid accountability, and hide their mediocrity and self-interests beneath the flag, America's image will continue to slip.</p><p> Scott Deshefy is two-time Green Party congressional candidate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-b1a4c5717d44a7f677fe846a4a03e27b3e2f714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28DA6762E4A6C6 NWBKCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6D-S161-DXVP-V1PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"616\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 GateHouse Media LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

A view of a US automotive and energy company Tesla showroom and service center in Amsterdam on October 14, 2018. Photo: EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images Jones added that big tech firms will not go the whole hog by exposing too high into the auto sector. They know autonomous vehicles are a marathon race and take 10 or 20-years to collect real-world miles. For staying out there, many ways exist and it need not be like 'owning a full-stack, awesome, great auto company.'Tesla may miss delivery guidance in Q2 Jonas said Wall Street is expecting Tesla will miss delivery target for Q2. Analysts are expecting only 70,000 vehicles in the second quarter of 2019. Even at an over-optimistic estimate of 82,000 vehicles,Tesla will still miss own guidance to deliver 90,000 cars in Q2 per the letter Musk wrote to shareholders.Tesla's shares were downsince May 16 by an average of 15 percent. The slide came after reports said CEO Elon Musk asked employees to prune spending and he is personally monitoring expenses. Adding to investor apathy was not so exciting consumer reports review of Tesla's new Autopilot Navigate feature in the Model 3 electric sedans.

Foxconn is also making iPhones in India and Pegatron is looking to place factories there. Smaller Apple partners such as Salcomp are also investing in production facilities\u00a0in the country.</p><p>Given current trade tensions between the Trump administration and China, it makes sense for Apple to diversify its supply chain in order to protect shoppers against unexpected price hikes.\u00a0The company has been applying a great deal of energy in India for some time, both because it wants to generate new business in India's rapidly expanding economy and because it really, really wants to diversify its supply chain.</p><p>Apple has also been ever so keen to stress that it's looking to make a long-term commitment to the country.\u00a0\"We're not here for a quarter, or two quarters, or the next year, or the next year,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a 2016 visit. \"We're here for a thousand years.\"</p><p>Jaw-jaw beats war-war</p><p>It's fair to say Apple hit some hurdles. Not only were its products quite expensive in terms of the local economy, but India enforced a number of regulations that made expanding business there difficult. To mitigate these challenges, it appears Apple has engaged with local governments to find a mutually useful compromise.</p><p>That's why news that India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is exploring a range of initiatives it hopes will encourage big tech firms to set up shop seems so well timed - tax breaks, loan subsidies, infrastructure investment and the creation of special tech industry zones are all being discussed.</p><p>In other words, the timing seems pretty good for at least some expansion of Apple's manufacturing presence in India, even as its iPhone 11 series devices have re-ignited local interest in the company's products. The iPhone 11 is selling strongly in India with queues of people ready to shop when the device launched.</p><p>Apple's move to improve its current low-end offering (the iPhone 8 is currently the entry-level model) with an iPhone 9 will broaden what it has available. The company already makes the iPhone XR there, reports have claimed, and these devices are apparently exported elsewhere.</p><p>Made in India?</p><p>With a new model set to go into production in February, news that Apple has asked TSMC to increase production of Apple's A-series processors is likely not just spurred by strong sales, but also to address what's coming in FY20 Q3, which is: Even stronger sales as a lower cost model hits the shelves.</p><p>If successful (and there's little reason amore-affordable, A13-powered device shouldn't be) the new model is going to require the company to ramp up its manufacturing capacity. And with so many partners investing deeply in manufacturing centers there, it seems possible we'll see at least some of these new iPhone models designed in California, but Made in India.</p><p>Please follow me on\u00a0Twitter, or join me in the\u00a0AppleHolic's bar &amp; grill\u00a0and\u00a0Apple Discussions\u00a0groups on MeWe.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CMPWLD-3516069</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CMPWLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1X-K1H1-JBP6-P3T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6943</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><timeReceived>07:59 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 IDG Communications, Inc.

By early last year Aurora had lined up multiple partners, raised an impressive war chest and burnished a reputation for having some of the top engineering talent.</p><p>But after a wave of consolidation that has seen carmakers opt to build their autonomous technology in-house, Aurora is suddenly the west\u2019s last independent self-driving unicorn standing.</p><p>With deals struck in recent years between Volkswagen and Argo, Hyundai and Aptiv, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/228e2aee-6182-4d6b-8a69-e31cc19e4c9d\">FiatChrysler and Google\u2019s self-driving unit Waymo</url>, the company is faced with the prospect of developing a hugely expensive technology with no one to sell it to.</p><p>But Chris Urmson, Aurora\u2019s chief executive and the former lead of Google\u2019s self-driving project, is betting that carmakers will yet be forced to concede defeat and switch to Aurora\u2019s technology. \u201cAt some point our technology will work, and theirs won\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Going it alone</emphasis></p><p>It\u2019s a risky bet. Karl Iagnemma, chief executive of Motional, the driverless joint-venture from Hyundai and Aptiv, said: \u201cI have a lot of respect for Aurora, but I do believe that it'll be a challenge for any start-up to compete in this space given the partnerships that are being formed and the massive influx of capital that we're seeing flow to the major players.\u201d</p><p>Today\u2019s car industry faces escalating challenges, from falling sales to regulatory requirements demanding greener vehicles. Aurora\u2019s hope is that its narrow focus on \u201cthe Driver\u201d \u2014 the hardware and software system for controlling the car \u2014 rather than building the vehicle itself or maintaining a ride-sharing service, will pay dividends.</p><p>Mr Urmson isn\u2019t rooting for others to fail, necessarily. But the otherwise jovial Canadian thinks the moonshot of building driverless technology will leave a vast graveyard in its wake.</p><p>His preferred analogy stems from aviation, where Boeing and Airbus have a combined 91 per cent market share, as two of the only companies capable of building aeroplanes. \u201cWe expect this technology to have the same kind of barrier,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is going to be really hard and so we're setting ourselves up for that long commitment to deliver that.\u201d</p><p>Aurora has now raised $700m from investors including Sequoia, T Rowe Price and Amazon, at a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8bb58aa-2a6c-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7\"> valuation of $2.5bn</url>, and amassed a team of more than 500 employees in four states \u2014 California, Pennsylvania, Montana and Texas. But it tends to operate in secrecy, with the bulk of its work taking place virtually in simulated worlds where it can encounter far more variety than even the busiest cities.</p><p>By contrast, it is common to see self-driving vehicles from Waymo, Cruise and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37ae69d9-f160-48c3-b3c5-736730c110ce\">Amazon-owned Zoox</url> roaming the Bay Area. In China, groups such as AutoX and Didi operate pilot self-driving rideshare services. But there\u2019s almost always a back-up driver involved and often an engineer riding shotgun. Mr Urmson sees these efforts as emblematic of the wrong approach.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a more expensive, crappier taxi,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect that very few companies will actually cross that chasm of being able to pull the driver out of the vehicle.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u2018The provider for everyone\u2019</emphasis></p><p>Mr Urmson has palpable confidence in his vision, but also a record to back it up. Since his Carnegie Mellon team won the DARPA Urban Challenge in 2007 \u2014 the race that spawned today\u2019s self-driving movement \u2014 he has been one of the industry\u2019s central players, first co-founding Google\u2019s self-driving unit and later leading it. </p><p>Yet as the broader industry shifts towards more niche use cases for autonomous technology, some industry executives are left wondering about the divide between Aurora\u2019s big ambitions and the current state of its product.</p><p>\u201cI see a lot of companies that haven\u2019t made this work on a small scale, yet they are trying to make it work everywhere,\u201d said Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, chief executive of automated truck group Starsky Robotics, which collapsed earlier this year when it was unable to raise more funds.</p><p>\u201cUnless you can make this work quickly, being the tech provider to every [vehicle maker] is farcical,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not feasible to be the provider for everyone.\u201d</p><p>Last month, when Aurora announced that its \u201cfirst commercial product will be in trucking,\u201d rather than in passenger cars, some questioned whether the apparent expansion was actually a desperate shift in business model.\u00a0</p><p>One person, who called Aurora \u201can extremely high-quality company\u201d, nevertheless said the unveil looked rushed and pointed out that the video announcing the pivot showcased a Peterbilt truck embossed with a glossy Aurora logo \u2014 but lacking in any self-driving hardware.</p><p>Rumours even circulated in the days after that Aurora might even put itself up for sale or raise funds.

Long lauded for powering the economy, driving down prices, and pushing innovation forward with new devices and services, Big Tech this year finds itself wearing a black hat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consumers and politicians alike now criticize technology giants for slanting the news, invading privacy, and carelessly leaving back doors open for cybercriminals to steal data and foreign countries to influence elections. Federal and state authorities are investigating Amazon, Google, and others as possible monopolists over retail sales and ad revenues. The backlash against Silicon Valley has even spawned its own term: \"techlash.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But some tech experts are sounding a cautionary note. While data abuse and antitrust business practices need to be investigated, they say, overzealous prosecution and lawmaking could compromise America's competitiveness vis-a-vis other nations.</p><p>\"I worry that the techlash is going to have detrimental effects,\" says Robert Atkinson, founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a Washington, D.C., think tank. \"Ultimately, that's playing into the hands of China.\"</p><p>In the past week, the pressure on Big Tech has intensified. Attorneys general in 48 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have announced antitrust investigations of Google, with at least eight of them also examining Facebook. This comes as the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up its investigation of business practices of Amazon, Apple, and others.</p><p>\"It's not surprising that people are very concerned about privacy rights and security of your personal data and also the social effect of the new media platforms,\" says Thomas Hazlett, a professor at Clemson University in South Carolina and former chief economist of the Federal Communications Commission. \"The question is: How do you best handle that with some kind of regulatory solution ... that's actually going to help?\"</p><p>The strides China has made in next-generation technologies, such as 5G cellphones, gene editing, biometrics, and other areas, are creating pressures for the U.S. to refocus on competitiveness the way it did with the Soviet Union in the 1950s and '60s, and with Japan in the 1980s and '90s. If anything, the threat posed by China could be greater, since it combines the military rivalry of the Soviets with the economic rivalry of the Japanese.</p><p>According to one survey of academic research, China has already surpassed the U.S. in the number of published papers in artificial intelligence and is poised to move ahead in the number of papers on that subject most cited by other researchers (a measure of their importance).\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"We do need some serious updating and reexamination of our policies and our public-private partnerships because the challenges are very different than they were when the U.S. council was created in 1986,\" says Deborah Wince-Smith, president and CEO of the Council on Competitiveness in Washington.</p><p>The current focus on Big Tech's misdeeds is delaying this needed debate, says Mr. Atkinson of the ITIF. \"That conversation is treading water right now.\"</p><p>Americans have made adjustments before when confronted with new technologies that have given companies powerful sway in the market, says Professor Hazlett, who assigns his students an 1890 article called \"The Right to Privacy\" - a reaction to the news and gossip from the new mass-market newspapers of the era.</p><p>But problems have arisen when regulators and policymakers have gotten too aggressive in countering technology. Mr. Atkinson points to San Francisco's recent ban on facial recognition by police and city government, despite the positive uses the technology has. On Thursday, California's legislature passed a much less draconian three-year ban on facial recognition technology for police body cameras.</p><p>More pernicious, in his view, were antitrust regulators in the 1950s and '60s, who forced leading technology giants of that time to license their patented technology. That's how Sony got its hands on AT&amp;T transistor technology and how Japanese copier firms acquired Xerox know-how, allowing the laggards to rapidly catch up to and surpass the U.S. firms. The major reason Japan came to dominate color TVs was because RCA had to license its technology, he says.</p><p>That Japanese dominance, in turn, pushed the U.S. to create a national competitiveness council and strategy in the 1980s, which included the funding of research and encouraging tech transfer from national labs and leading universities to U.S. companies. Encouraged by both Republican and Democratic administrations, the competitiveness push lost its focus after the fall of the Soviet Union and Japan's economic and policy stumbles.</p><p>Not everyone is convinced that a new competitiveness policy will help the U.S. compete against China.</p><p>\"I think it's very important that the real issues, particularly intellectual property theft and security issues, be litigated,\" says Dr. Hazlett, the Clemson professor. But \"I don't trust the government to pick the right winners nor to have the right policy that's going to support the markets and not hurt consumers. ... That's just not a task that's worked well.\"</p><p>To its advocates, competitiveness policy is a bipartisan issue that could gain strong support once the public's concerns about Big Tech are dealt with.</p><p>\"I'm optimistic,\" says Ms. Wince-Smith of the Council on Competitiveness. \"Both in the Obama administration, I'm very pleased to say, and in the Trump administration there is a dual support and understanding of the importance of investing in the research and development and the manufacturing capability for next-generation microelectronics.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CSM-495305c7ad75ddaeb9fa88ca2893f77e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CSM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X20-8081-JC8H-M360-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7945</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"944\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Christian Science Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 13, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Atul Gawande is in a deal with Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, and Berkshire Hathaway, and it looks like we might be seeing our EOBs being sent to us from Google fairly soon. Amazon's hired 20,000 doctors[3]. Ok, that was an Onion article, but illustrates the point. And now comes big media into our little world. And in an industry that still resists change, healthcare technology is still small. But what would make media companies want to dabble in the healthcare IT space. Well, to understand the why, you must first understand the who.; The 'who' is Comcast Corporation. Comcast, the big media company, best known for broadband solutions, is now making a play for healthcare technology. Comcast recently entered a joint venture with the Independence Healthcare Group, in which the two will build patient-centered digital platforms for Comcast's 60 million plus customers. The collaboration looks to make the patient-provider communications seamless by allowing patients to view needed information and to-do lists prior to operations and other engagements. Time will tell if this is finally the project for Comcast, as their prior attempts to break into the market, initially partnering with Kaiser Permanente on a now defunct pregnancy app and later with a UC Davis partnership on health and nutrition videos, were both colossal failures. The 'who is also Cox Communications. Cox tried to make a statement in the healthcare IT space by partnering with Cleveland Clinic to develop Vivre Health, a home health product and service delivered by broadband. The venture failed and Cox eventually pulled out. But like Comcast, Cox believes they have now found their footing. They are banking on the value of remote patient monitoring and in 2015 they purchased Trapolla. The product is now in development. Now that we know the who, let's concentrate on the why. The easy answer is market share. The healthcare market is worth more than 3 trillion dollars, according to CMS estimates. It's only intuitive that other industries would come calling. Media companies may see healthcare IT as an opportunity to capitalize on a growing industry while their own industry may be cooling off. Companies have to leverage their current capabilities to drive growth in others sectors. Media companies are in a unique position to do just this.  The interest in healthcare tech by big media may have a negative impact on smaller or independent brands. Based on broadband alone, smaller companies can't compete on the scale of companies like Comcast and Cox Communications. Could the current interest in the market, which is growing, mark the end for smaller companies? Time will tell but what is certain is that nothing in healthcare comes quickly. Big media may find it hard disrupting in healthcare where the small guy may already have the lay of the land. And small or not, already vested players won't sit idly by while big media giants come it and try to dim their flame. Join us for this week's #HITsm chat to discuss big media in healthcare. What will be the impact for good and/or bad? How will they fair? Is this a good choice for them?

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who spoke at Trump's social media summit last week, wants to roll back key parts of Section 230 if tech companies don't enforce their moderation policies in a \"politically neutral\" way. (Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act grants legal immunity to tech companies from what their users post, within certain parameters. So, tech companies are not liable for what their users do on their platforms.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservatives and liberals decried Hawley's plan because it essentially gives the government control of online speech, which does not align with historically conservative, democratic or limited government principles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, some Republicans worry the Big Tech censorship issue could split the party going into 2020, damaging their electoral prospects.</p><p>Trump's \"Social Media Summit,\" hosted at the White House on July 11, featured some 200 conservative content providers. Trump did not invite Facebook, Google or Twitter to the event, instead accusing them of suppressing conservative voices -- including his own.</p><p>\"The establishment and fake media says there's no censorship on social media, it's all made up. We know that's not true. We know they want to shut us down, and we can't let them,\" Hawley said at the summit. \"Here's the deal, Facebook and Google have gotten this special deal from government. If they get to keep their special deal, they need to stop discriminating against conservatives. They ought to abide by the same principles of free speech and First Amendment that our country embraces. I don't think it's too much to ask. These tech companies have gotten rich off our information. ...They shouldn't discriminate, they shouldn't censor, they shouldn't shut us down.\"</p><p>Trump complained about how his Twitter audience isn't growing as fast as it used to, and how he isn't getting as much engagement.</p><p>\"Does anyone know what I'm talking about?\" he asked the crowd of conservative commentators, who responded in a chorus of enthusiastic yeses. \"I used to get great press, I haven't had a good story in two years,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have banned or censored many right-leaning individuals or groups for violating their user policies or terms of service over the last year, and many conservatives interpret this as bias toward conservatives.</p><p>Most recently, Pinterest banned the pro-life group Live Action for violating its user policy (Live Action often shares graphic photos and videos of abortions), and Facebook and Instagram banned what they called \"dangerous individuals,\" like the right-wing website InfoWars and its founder Alex Jones (who promoted the conspiracy theories that the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and 9/11 were inside jobs and the Sandy Hook Massacre never happened), as well as conservative commentator and conspiracy theorist Paul Joseph Watson, who many conservatives don't consider extremist.</p><p>Many free speech advocates -- including conservatives -- believe there is little evidence that Big Tech targets conservatives specifically. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) collects data on censorship across the internet, and found that social media companies tend to unevenly enforce their policies across the political spectrum (i.e., liberals, especially LGBT people, are also censored or banned).</p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) noted in a February hearing that there is only \"anecdotal evidence\" of potential censorship and no empirical evidence that Big Tech targets conservatives.</p><p>According to James Pethokoukis, a writer for the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute (AEI), \"Right-wing media is doing fine on social media. For instance: They dominate the most popular stories on Facebook, even when those stories are about Democrats like the 2020 presidential candidates. If there is a bias, it's in favor of viral articles from high-traffic websites.\"</p><p>In June, YouTube faced a massive backlash from free speech advocates for banning conservative commentator Steven Crowder and for how it handles LGBT and anti-LGBT content on its platform. (According to the LGBT community, YouTube frequently demonetizes them as well as anti-LGBT creators.)</p><p>David French, a conservative commentator for National Review, used the incident to warn conservatives against using the government to force social media companies to moderate their platforms in a certain way.</p><p>\"What conservatives cannot and should not do is use the government to erode freedom for the alleged purpose of saving freedom,\" he wrote. \"The alleged 'easy' solution -- the fast fix of federal legislation -- is likely blocked by the First Amendment. Moreover, there's something fundamentally entitled and not-conservative about claiming that you should have government-mandated access on terms you prefer to a platform you didn't create, that's maintained by people you oppose, and that you should have that access for free.\"</p><p>At the same time, French thinks it is troubling that social media companies appear to ban more conservatives than liberals.</p><p>\"A right-wing speaker says something outrageous and faces consequences, while multiple left-wing speakers seem to spew venom with impunity, including at people who are also ostensibly protected by various social-media anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies,\" he wrote.</p><p>Carl Szabo, policy counsel for the Big Tech lobbying firm NetChoice, told InsideSources that even though the conservative education organization PragerU complains about being censored for its conservative ideas, YouTube has restricted only 12 percent of PragerU's videos, while restricting a whopping 71 percent of progressive, socialist-leaning group, the Young Turks. Szabo also said PragerU's subscriber base continues to grow at an \"exponential rate.\"</p><p>\"This is a defining time for conservatives in determining where they truly stand on limited government and free markets,\" he said. \"Conservatives should stop complaining about victimhood and just start focusing on 2020.\"</p><p>Aram Sinnreich, chair of communication studies at American University, told InsideSources that the summit speaks to a deeper ideological divide in America.</p><p>\"What does it even mean to be a conservative in the current political moment? These people believed in separation of powers until they didn't and state rights until they didn't,\" he said. \"Traditionally conservative versus liberal was about [the best way to deliver] on the promise of the Constitution and our shared national interest and a functional democratic state, thriving markets and improved quality of life for everyone in America. Reagan and Carter agreed that was the case and Eisenhower and Kennedy agreed that was the case and Bush and Gore. I think we've reached the point where there isn't any consensus about what the function of government should be in the American context. And that's where it ceases to be about left and right and it's about authoritarian populism versus some kind of anti-fascist resistance, which is a totally different vector.\"</p><p>Trump already suggested he might use the Department of Justice (DOJ) to go after Big Tech for antitrust violations, but just the threat of regulation might be enough to \"keep them in line.\"</p><p>\"He's signaling to the social media world that if they don't turn a blind eye to the monkey business of 2016 (and promote his interests), then he's going to punish them economically,\" Sinnreich said. \"And because they're public companies, that means they have a fiduciary duty to act in Trump's interest.\"</p><p>As conservatives draw battle lines over free speech and what it means to be conservative -- and whether that means supporting Trump -- Szabo said they're running out of time if they want another four years in the White House.</p><p>\"Going into the 2020 election, we should not be seeking out issues that divide our party,\" Szabo said. \"Amending Section 230 will just create division that we just don't need.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

But ...</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic has been a huge boost for tech companies, as more and more consumers use digital platforms, subscribe to more services and use online payment services. And many of these services are based on just a small handful of providers.  But the more people start to rely on these platforms, the more powerful they become to the extent that they can set the terms and conditions including the price and commission they charge.  In other words, it looks like big tech companies are building up monopolies and there's concern that regulators are struggling to keep up with them and consumers are losing their voice.  To discuss this more in detail, we connect with Dr. Yang Jun-sok, Professor of Economics at the Catholic University of Korea.  Of course, the nature of business is to maximize profits but are big tech firms abusing their power?   Here in South Korea, we\u2019ve seen the use of platform businesses spike during the COVID-19 pandemic. There\u2019s been a lot of talk surrounding  , the country\u2019s biggest food delivery platform, merging with another widely used food delivery service. What are the main concerns here?   Monopolies have the power to set the market price. The biggest regulatory complaint against IT giants like Apple is how it runs its app store. Apple\u2019s 30 percent commission on App Store purchases has been deemed abusive by services like Spotify.  Is there a right amount they should charge?   Apple pushed back on the investigations in the European Union, saying its products promote competition. Do you agree? What limits do current competition laws have when it comes to reigning in the internet giants, and what makes it difficult for regulators to do so?   We also see huge tech firms which arguably have monopolistic power enter other areas of business, for instance, Google make smartphones and is delving into self-driving car technology, while Amazon enters the health care market. Should this be allowed, and how can we make sure they are playing fair?   Here in Korea, there have concerns about firms monopolizing online payments. The country\u2019s biggest online portal Naver has been seeking to expand Naver Pay, and they already have a huge advantage due to the sheer number of users and personal information they have. What are your thoughts on this? What are the dangers do consumers face in big tech monopolizing financial transactions?   Should big tech companies be broken up? How should they be regulated?   What's the danger of allowing companies to continue as they do throughout this pandemic?   This is where we'll have to wrap up the show but thank you for joining us today.

But to the tech giants, the idea could unload some of their burdens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAN FRANCISCO -- Not so long ago, the technology behind Bitcoin was seen in Silicon Valley as the best hope for challenging the enormous, centralized power of companies like Twitter and Facebook.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Now, in an unexpected twist, the internet giants think that technology could help them solve their many problems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The chief executive of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, said last week that he hoped to fund the creation of software for social media that, inspired by the design of Bitcoin, would give Twitter less control over how people use the service and shift power toward users and outside programmers.</p><p>  Likewise, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has said he hopes the same concepts from Bitcoin could ''take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands.''</p><p>  This push toward decentralization -- the buzzword people in tech are using to describe these projects -- has already gained enough currency and has sounded outlandish enough that it was one of the central themes of the satirical HBO show ''Silicon Valley.'' </p><p>  Though Bitcoin's digital tokens are widely used among the tech set, its underlying concept -- a network of computers managing the currency without anyone in charge -- is what's most interesting to many people working on decentralization.</p><p>  Countless entrepreneurs are working on decentralization projects, including the creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee. He founded Solid, which seeks to fix the problems of the centralized internet by shifting the ownership of personal data away from big companies and back toward users.</p><p>  But the other efforts have largely been aimed at taking down Twitter and Facebook rather than helping them solve their problems. And the two behemoths have plenty of problems, from policing their sites for toxic content to dealing with pressure from regulators who think tech companies have grown too powerful. </p><p>  Not surprisingly, the efforts at Twitter and Facebook have faced skepticism and questions about whether they are just trying to land some positive press while dodging responsibility -- and regulations. </p><p>  ''When a company does something like this when it is under pressure, it becomes a way to distract attention by appearing to do something,'' said Mitra Ardron, the head of the decentralized web project at the Internet Archive, which has hosted the Decentralized Web Summit the last four years. </p><p>  Many people working on decentralization projects are concerned that Twitter and Facebook are trying to align themselves with the work's countercultural spirit without giving up their enormous power.</p><p>  ''The monoliths see it as a threat to their model, so they try to weave in the concepts into their own products to maintain control,'' said Eugen Rochko, the founder of Mastodon, a competitor to Twitter. With around two million users, Mastodon has been one of the most successful alternative projects. </p><p>  Mr. Dorsey said Twitter was just starting to look at the idea and had committed only five people to it. Facebook has moved ahead with its Bitcoin-inspired cryptocurrency and has beefed up encryption, but the company has otherwise taken few steps to decentralize its services. Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Zuckerberg, though, have frequently discussed decentralization, suggesting they have a personal fascination that goes beyond business interests. </p><p>  Mr. Dorsey also hired a small team at his second company, Square, to work full time on Bitcoin, without any commercial responsibilities. And he recently announced that he was hoping to take an extended sojourn in Africa to understand how Bitcoin was working there.</p><p>  ''It's clearly catching on in part because people believe in it,'' said Neha Narula, the director of the Digital Currency Initiative at the M.I.T. Media Lab. ''It's not necessarily that it is cheaper or more efficient or faster or easier. In fact, it is much harder. But it's clear that this idea speaks to people.''</p><p>  Mr. Dorsey's tweets last week suggest that he wants the new team, Blue Sky, to build essentially a basic version of Twitter that would be available for anyone to copy. This would make it easier for outside developers to build on top of Twitter and to compete with it. A competitor might be able to offer a version without ads, or one that recommends tweets to readers based on different standards.</p><p>  While that would most likely pose a commercial threat to Twitter, Mr. Dorsey said it would also force the service to be ''far more innovative than in the past'' and could draw more overall users to it. </p><p>  The idea of decentralization harks back to the basic design and ideals of the internet, which was supposed to be a global gathering place where everyone was welcome and no one was in charge.</p><p>  Mr. Dorsey said the invention of Bitcoin had made it possible to revive those early ideals. The key to Bitcoin is its blockchain database, which provides a way for a network of disconnected computers to agree on a single set of records for every Bitcoin in existence.</p><p>  Mr. Dorsey is following in the steps of the many cryptocurrency advocates who have argued that the underlying technology could be used to record all the users and activity on a social network, and to agree on a single set of rules for the network, without having any single company in charge. He said, though, that it would most likely take ''many years.'' </p><p>Facebook has pursued several projects over the past year that would shift control to its users. </p><p>  The company's most notable effort with blockchains is the Libra cryptocurrency, which aims to create money outside the control of any one company. The Libra effort has faced crippling opposition from politicians, regulators and even some of the project's original partners. But it appears to have inspired central banks in China and Europe, which are also considering ways to duplicate Bitcoin's underlying technology.</p><p>  Already, many start-ups have tried to use blockchains to create social networks to compete with Twitter and Facebook. But these networks, with names like Minds and Steemit, have faced many of the same problems that Bitcoin has, struggling to attract mainstream attention and leaving users to fend off hackers themselves. Many investors have largely given up on blockchain investments.</p><p>  Several up-and-coming projects focused on decentralization, including Mr. Berners-Lee's Solid, have steered clear of the blockchain entirely because they don't believe it is useful for anything other than financial transactions. </p><p>  Mr. Dorsey said one of the great appeals of a decentralized future was that Twitter would no longer be the only one in charge of deciding what is and isn't allowed on the network. </p><p>  To many people, that sounded like an effort by Mr. Dorsey to wash his hands of the hardest but arguably most important responsibility of social networks today: identifying and filtering bad actors and disinformation.</p><p>  ''I'm concerned that Twitter may try to foist the responsibility for dealing with these problems onto the decentralization community,'' said Ross Schulman, the senior policy technologist at New America's Open Technology Institute.</p><p>  A spokeswoman for Facebook had no comment on the company's efforts.</p><p>  Mastodon, the Twitter competitor, allows anyone to tweak the software in order to create his or her own version of Mastodon. If people don't like the rules set up in one version, they can move to another.</p><p>  But Mastodon has provided a window into just how difficult these problems are to deal with, even with decentralization. </p><p>  The Mastodon software was created to form a refuge from anger and hate speech on Twitter. But recently, a social network with close ties to hate crimes and the far right, Gab, used Mastodon's software to create a new home after it was pushed off the mainstream internet. Mastodon's leaders were opposed to it but could do little to stop it. </p><p>  ''Building these types of decentralized social networks comes with a slew of challenges that we haven't figured out how to solve yet,'' said Ms. Narula, who was a co-author of an article titled ''Decentralized Social Networks Sound Great. Too Bad They'll Never Work.'' </p><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, left, and Jack Dorsey of Twitter are exploring the Bitcoin model as a way to empower users.

The series of hearings have been called, \u2018Online Platforms and Market Power\u2019, that have largely focused on \u2018Big Tech\u2019 corporations and their powerful position over the Internet and social media. The hearing will specifically be held in the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law.        With a hearing that has two of the top five richest billionaires in the world testifying, including Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon at #1 and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook at #4, the testimony with respect to antitrust matters will likely have a high level of public interest tomorrow. As these firms have fallen under the microscope for everything from allowing interference in our electoral process to profiting off of our personal data, these questions the U.S. Government has are also some of the problems that blockchain technology seeks to solve with a decentralized approach to rebuilding the World Wide Web in what is commonly known as Web 3.0.     Many blockchain companies describe the approach in building distributed systems as a new chance at the Internet as it was originally imagined and specifically target these \u2018Big Tech\u2019 firms as a problem which decentralized systems can fix.    \u201cThere are a lot of challenges with centralized parties that can be improved by distributed ledger technology. Part of the promise of the web was to level the playing field and democratize information. Technologies like smart contracts, digital securities and Bitcoin can change the way people interact and reduce the need for powerful central parties,\u201d says bitcoin advocate and economic strategist Bruce Fenton, Founder and CEO, Chainstone Labs and Founder/ President of Atlantic Financial / Atlantic Financial Blockchain Labs.    Facebook seemed to acknowledge the threat of Bitcoin and capitalize on stablecoins, or a less volatile cryptocurrency that could be used in payments, by introducing Libra last year. Introducing a new cryptocurrency and blockchain platform won the quick attention of regulators, who became concerned about the idea of a threat to the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency, not to mention general reservations about Facebook\u2019s past behaviors with personal data. The social media giant is not alone, as Google has had its own war against crypto when it knocked off YouTube videos that had cryptocurrency content; however, the company soon responded by saying this was an error.         The Forbes Blockchain 50 , a list of enterprises embracing the technology underlying cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and using it to speed up business processes, increase transparency and potentially save billions of dollars, includes all but Apple. While Facebook\u2019s Libra project earned it a place on the list, Amazon Web Services has been offering blockchain when companies do not want to build their own as an extension of the AWS platform. Google has integrated a data analytics platform with the blockchain called \u2018Chainlink\u2019, that would allow data from outside sources to be used in applications built directly on the blockchain.    Speculating on the possible outcomes for Big Tech, Congress may consider the idea of how decentralization - what many in the blockchain world are developing and working on day in and day out - might actually play a role in public policy toward the Internet. As companies such as \u2018Ma Bell\u2019, or AT&amp;T  T  have had to be broken up by the government before, perhaps a more decentralized tech infrastructure can be the new foundation for the Internet, built in a way to avoid the oversized corporation from feeling like our lives are being taken over.    Despite calls by the Republicans, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter - and recently a Bitcoin advocate in his own right - will not be testifying as the company is much smaller than the other four and an antitrust case is less likely. However, Twitter has had a great amount of influence in discussions on social media, which raises the question of whether our Antitrust laws are sufficient enough to handle the modern dilemma of our Internet, as we know it. Details and a livestream of the hearing can be found here</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Volatility became a watchword as US monetary conditions tightened, the Trump-induced trade war erupted, and Big Tech came under the regulatory spotlight. Indeed, across traditional and crypto assets, markets haven't seen this level of sustained volatility since the financial crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many investors are now asking: What does the new year have in store for them? How will the Year of the Pig affect their performance and fortunes? The early days of trading in 2019 have suggested some of last year's volatility could continue, yet other early signs are pointing to upward swings in markets like crypto.</p><p>Yes, things have been volatile, but volatility can also bring opportunity, especially at the levels we're seeing now.</p><p>With the exception of a few months in the middle of the year, 2018 has been incredibly volatile and 2019 has started out with a bang. The slowdown we are seeing in China's economy coupled with increased uncertainty around Brexit will only continue to drive this trend.</p><p>Stock markets: short-term volatility or long-term stability?</p><p>The FTSE 100 tumbled 12.5 percent in 2018 - its biggest fall in a decade. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 experienced their worst December performance since 1931. The conclusion many economists are coming to has been to call the end of one of the longest market bull runs we've seen in decades.</p><p>This has caused investors, including those in Asia who have become accustomed to steady gains, to rethink their strategy.</p><p>Volatility will likely remain a strong theme in 2019 - at least in the first half of the year. Many assets were overpriced previously, and a market correction, once complete, should enable investors to enter the market at a more reasonable price.</p><p>Factors with the strongest potential to move stocks in 2019 - and that should be watched - will include the threat of an international trade war, an economic slowdown in China, tightening monetary policy from the world's central banks, and the inevitable fallout from Brexit.\u00a0</p><p>If these issues are resolved within the next few months, volatility may well recede, creating a clearer run for markets in the second half.</p><p>Tech stocks: further to fall or realignment complete?</p><p>Tech stocks,\u00a0in particular, were hit hard in 2018. As Wall Street turned against the previously mighty FAANGs (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google/Alphabet), roughly US$1 trillion was wiped off their combined market cap. BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent) shares also plummeted last year amid the US-China trade tensions. It's fair to say some investors were caught off guard.</p><p>The valuation of tech stocks in particular had become overly based on momentum in recent years.</p><p>A market correction shows investors are reconsidering the fundamentals that underlie tech stocks, and such correction presents an opportunity for savvy investors in 2019 and beyond.</p><p>This year is likely to see this price realignment completed, likely offering potential opportunities and more price stability before too long.</p><p>Crypto assets: end of the bear market or continued slide?</p><p>Crypto assets began last year chasing the highs of 2017. Yet a bear market quickly took hold, with many cryptos falling around 80 percent in value across the year. As with tech stocks,\u00a0however, the bull run of 2017 was based on momentum, not value.</p><p>Going into 2019, crypto assets are still trying to find a bottom. However, it is important to look beyond price alone in this nascent market. </p><p>The fundamentals and development of the underlying technology will remain\u00a0strong. As a result, investors who best understand the technology that underpins assets like bitcoin and XRP have remained in the market.</p><p>- Contact us at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:english@hkej.com\">english@hkej.com</email></p><p>RT/CG</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HKEJIT-2054670</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HKEJIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VCK-6PG1-DXM8-X0KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 EJ Insight of Hong Kong Economic Journal Co., Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>EJ Insight</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5530\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The CMA's aggressive move, analysts say, represents Britain's regulator getting tough on big tech deals.</p><p>\"This is a remarkable decision,\" says Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital. \"It is hugely significant if it's setting a precedent.\"</p><p>The key concerns of the CMA are focused on whether the deal could damage competition in the restaurant food and grocery delivery markets.</p><p>Andrea Gomes da Silva, executive director of the CMA, said: \"If the deal were to proceed in its current form, there's a real risk that it could leave customers, restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower-quality services as these markets develop.\"</p><p>The move by the CMA to push Amazon comes as it makes moves under Lord Tyrie, a former Conservative MP and chairman of the Treasury select committee, to bear down on US technology giants.</p><p>\"The bottom line is acquisitions made by big tech players are highly likely to get looked at in detail because of the nature of the acquirer,\" says Simon Pritchard, a competition lawyer at the firm Linklaters.</p><p>The UK's restaurant food delivery sector represents is worth \u00a38.1bn and is set to grow to \u00a310bn by 2020.</p><p>Deliveroo, which had nearly \u00a3500m in sales in 2018, is a key player, competing with US giant Uber Eats and London-listed Just Eat.</p><p>Founded in 2013 by former banker Will Shu, Deliveroo has emerged as one of the UK's brightest technology start-ups. It has raised $1.5bn in investment and is valued at around $3.8bn.</p><p>But its future, at least in part, rests on a major investment from the Seattle-based retail behemoth founded by Jeff Bezos - an investment that could be scuppered by the CMA.</p><p>Amazon has long had designs on entering expanding into food delivery.</p><p>It runs Amazon Fresh, its grocery delivery arm and until November 2018 had its own restaurant delivery brand in the UK: Amazon Restaurants. But it pulled its restaurants business out of the market, and in May this year invested in Deliveroo, taking a minority stake as part of a $575m deal, having explored a full acquisition.</p><p>But in June, the CMA said it was looking into the deal - issuing an initial enforcement order.</p><p>After six months, the CMA announced its Phase 1 decision. Amazon's investment in Deliveroo, the CMA said, gave it material influence over the UK company, meaning they could \"cease to be distinct\" and effectively merge.</p><p>Its announcement even described the investment as the \"acquisition by Amazon of Deliveroo\". It did not matter that it was a minority stake. Amazon had significant expertise in logistics and influence thanks to its board member, Amazon UK head Doug Gurr.</p><p>The Phase 1 finding claims Amazon was already looking to return to food delivery in the UK, either through an investment or acquisition of another company. Such a move could have boosted competition, but instead it chose to invest in Deliveroo to strengthen its hand. It said the deal created \"serious concerns\" over competition.</p><p>The finding has baffled some analysts. \"The CMA believes, quite remarkably, that despite the fact that Amazon had exited the market in Nov 2018, ex-the investment in Deliveroo, it could well have re-entered the UK market,\" wrote Jefferies analyst Giles Thorne.</p><p>The CMA has taken a stern view of mergers in the food space before - taking a planned merger between Just Eat and rival Hungry House to a Phase 2 investigation in 2017. But it ultimately waved that deal through.</p><p>But it is not just restaurant delivery.</p><p>The CMA has also demanded remedies in grocery delivery, a sector it believes will be negatively impacted by the deal.</p><p>Online grocery orders in the UK were worth around \u00a312bn last year, according to data from Mintel. But the fast-delivery, small-basket segment is growing as consumers look for greater convenience with groceries delivered within the hour.</p><p>Both Amazon and Deliveroo have made moves into the grocery delivery sector, but both are at an early stage in Britain. Amazon offers its Amazon Pantry service, for cupboard goods such as snacks and drinks, and fresh produce service Amazon Fresh in some cities. It also offers grocery shopping with supermarket chain Morrisons for same-day delivery.</p><p>Deliveroo, meanwhile, has dipped its toe into groceries through a pilot scheme with the Co-op.</p><p>The CMA claims the combination sets the pair up as the dominant force in grocery delivery.</p><p>\"Supermarkets do not have the necessary logistical capabilities,\" its decision read. \"The merger would result in the combination of two of the largest and best-established suppliers of online convenience groceries.\"</p><p>But its decision is likely to face kickback. \"It seems ridiculous given the size of Ocado and Tesco in grocery delivery,\" says one market source.</p><p>The move is also potentially damaging for Deliveroo's ambitious growth plans. The CMA's intervention over the summer forced it to put a halt on a large portion of its planned $575m investment, which had been led by Amazon.</p><p>The parties have five days to offer remedies to the CMA, or the investigation will drag on with a Phase 2 inquiry.</p><p>This, according to Jefferies, would add \"another six months of uncertainty\". The analysts pointed to the fact that Deliveroo had \u00a3185m in cash at the close of 2018 - and a cash burn of \u00a3211m. Deliveroo is understood to have a plan in place regardless of the decision on Amazon's investment.</p><p>A Deliveroo spokesman said it had been working with the CMA and that Amazon's investment would \"add to competition\".</p><p>The implications of the intervention, analysts say, go beyond this deal. \"Is the British authority basically saying to US tech groups: 'We are concerned with how you disrupt markets and we are on your case'?\" asks Shore Captial's Black.</p><p>And, he adds, is it planning to look at not just major takeovers but \"investments in small companies in small markets\" leading to \"six-month inquiries and millions in legal fees\". Such aggression from the regulator, he says, could prove \"tectonic\".</p><p>In the short term, Amazon and Deliveroo have five days to make concessions, or lawyer up to take the fight to the CMA.</p><p>Technology Intelligence Don't miss our brilliant Technology Intelligence newsletter with Robin Pagnamenta and James Titcomb technewsletter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Amazon's investment in the British-headquartered start-up Deliveroo is being investigated by the Competition and Markets AthorityMIKAEL BUCK / DELIVEROO</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-155596269</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR0-N501-JCBW-N0W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1156\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0008DC5</classCode><className>LINKLATERS LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS541110 OFFICES OF LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC8111 LEGAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

In the UK, the Tory government -- not entirely distracted by Brexit -- is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/13/philip-hammond-to-make-fresh-attempt-to-curb-power-of-tech-giants\">moving to significantly toughen up</url> competition laws for tech companies. Meanwhile in the US, both       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.insidesources.com/democrats-republicans-eager-to-use-antitrust-law-against-big-tech/\">sides of politics</url> are talking about using competition laws against them. Here, the ACCC is finalising its digital platforms inquiry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[related-story id=\"658265\"]</p><p>This is creating some interesting bedfellows -- none more so than News Corp and progressive Democrat Elizabeth Warren. Warren last week put forward a <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">structural separation policy</url> to break up Google, Facebook and Amazon by designating them \"platform utilities\"\u00a0and banning them from both operating, and participating in, those platforms. \"Platform utilities would be required to meet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing [FRAND] with users. Platform utilities would not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties.\"</p><p>That's similar to what News Corp<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/News%20Corp%20Australia%20%28March%202019%29.pdf\">wants the ACCC to do</url> to Google here. News Corp wants \"functional separation\" of Google's ad tech \"and a requirement to grant access to their data on FRAND terms\", allowing greater competition in ad tech services for buyers and sellers. And it wants forced divestment of Google's search function.</p><p>The biggest difference is that Warren's aim is to benefit consumers and protect privacy -- in part by curbing the capacity of large companies to monetise personal data by on-selling it. News Corp -- despite its pretence that consumers would be the big beneficiaries of its proposed changes -- is interested in diverting the flow of ad revenue to Google back to itself and creating a level playing field in the exploitation of consumer data. Instead of Google knowing everything about you, News Corp wants any company to be able to compete to exploit your privacy effectively -- including itself.</p><p>The irony is, for decades, Rupert Murdoch has been the 800lb gorilla of media, devouring competitors and market share and cajoling or intimidating governments and competition regulators into not intervening. Now he has met an 80,000lb gorilla and is begging for intervention. According to the Murdoch of a previous era, you don't need to worry about monopolies: in 1994, he told the Centre for Independent Studies \"because capitalists are always trying to stab each other in the back, free markets do not lead to monopolies. Monopolies can only exist when governments protect them.\"\u00a0A quarter century later, News Corp wants government protection from a monopoly.</p><p>The '90s-era Murdoch was expressing the neoliberal wisdom of back then: a key part of the neoliberal project was the shift from the intensely pro-competition views of early neoliberals to the pro-monopoly views of the Chicago School, developed to justify the rise of powerful US corporations and the non-intervention of regulators in mergers and acquisitions. Like much neoliberal dogma, that has now been left behind as both the Left and the Right move to more economic interventionism. The result is very ideologically different people saying quite similar things.\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The American Conservative</emphasis> has been pushing for a new era of trustbusting for a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/why-the-regulators-went-soft-on-monopolies/\">couple</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-conservative-case-for-antitrust-jonathan-tepper/\">of</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/amazon-facebook-google-conservative-anti-monopoly-movement/\">years</url>.

Competition law is about improving consumer welfare by enabling greater competition between firms; using it to address other problems risks sub-optimal outcomes. Even Trump's Attorney-General <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.realclearpolicy.com/articles/2019/02/19/dont_hit_tech_firms_with_antitrust_cases_to_protect_conservatives_from_bias.html\">cavilled</url> at regarding bias as an anti-trust issue.

We get those services for free, and pay only indirectly through the abuse of our privacy by those firms and the firms they hand out information to. News Corp wants Google Search to be broken away from the rest of Google's products. But no one forces consumers to use Google Search; there are an array of other search engines, often better ones that don't abuse your privacy, like Duck Duck Go. True, price isn't necessarily the only signal to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.insidesources.com/democrats-republicans-eager-to-use-antitrust-law-against-big-tech/\">considered in competition law</url>, but it does lead to regulation based, effectively, on concluding that a company should be broken up simply because it's too popular with consumers.</p><p>Like corporations, Australian politicians have little or no interest in protecting privacy -- in fact political parties are some of the worst privacy abusers in the country. And as with media law in Australia, in the regulation of Big Tech, ultimately the interests of consumers may come a distant second to the demands of big media players like News Corp who are interested in themselves and no one else.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMY-N1V1-JD6R-T255-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"975\"/><timeReceived>10:31:14 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 15, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

There is no detail at all about the reach of the ads, or the way in which they were targeted. </p><p>Facebook at least reveals the demographic breakdown of how political ads were targeted, but its claim that all disclaimers must include \"information on the entity that paid for the ad\" is laughable. </p><p>Only last week, Nathaniel Gleicher, the company's head of cybersecurity policy, had the gall to warn that foreign agents were trying to recruit users in other nations in order to purchase political adverts on the platform on their behalf.</p><p>In pursuing such a circuitous route, Facebook's strict new rules - which include providing proof of a postal address in the country where the ad is places - would be satisfied. \"No security protocol is foolproof,\" cautioned Mr Gleicher.</p><p>That is especially true when the protocols put in place are about as robust as a water biscuit. The information Facebook requires - and subsequently publishes - is so vague and unhelpful, it might as well reprint the horoscope entries from a back issue of Take a Break.</p><p>Take just one of adverts it has permitted in the past week by way of example. The ad, promoting a page called Brexit Votes Matter, called on people to \"stop the eco loonies\" and bemoaned the \"endless lies and lunacy from the doom and gloom brigade\".</p><p>READ MORE: Facebook to verify political adverts in UK crackdown on dark ads'</p><p>The disclaimer, however, includes no individuals, let alone addresses, telephone numbers, or websites. Instead, it states the ad was placed by a group known as Brexit Defence Force.</p><p>You can say what you like about Facebook's lax privacy policies, but when it comes to organisations with quasi-paramilitary undertones, their secrets are well and truly safe.</p><p>When you consider that other Big Tech players such as Google, the owners of YouTube, and Snapchat do not have any kind of transparency underpinning political advertising on their platforms, the idea that the industry has the willingness and ability to regulate itself is laughable.</p><p>The question is, then, whether the UK Government has the backbone to enact meaningful change. Even if the need for transparency is enshrined in statute, it means little if a campaign group can simply submit a name without providing any details about its funding or donors, as per the Facebook model.</p><p>A sound starting point would be the introduction of a centralised searchable repository of ads across all social media platforms which explicitly spells out the identity of a group's executives and directors, as well as its donors. Anything short of that would do little to address the integrity crisis at the heart of British political life. </p><p>There is, however, a glimmer of hope, as discontent with the existing system grows and the calls for change intensify. At a time when the European election campaign is in full swing, it is telling to see who has been the biggest spender on Facebook advertising in the UK in the past week, forking out a hefty \u00a328,000.</p><p>The answer, laden in irony, is the Electoral Commission. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCTMAN-BEB627845CD7466999CB6A2A46423F19ELM76016176SWTS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCTMAN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2J-0YV1-JDPH-B2MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">377101</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Johnston Press Plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Scotsman</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13512\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 8, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There is no detail at all about the reach of the ads, or the way in which they were targeted. </p><p>Facebook at least reveals the demographic breakdown of how political ads were targeted, but its claim that all disclaimers must include \"information on the entity that paid for the ad\" is laughable. </p><p>Only last week, Nathaniel Gleicher, the company's head of cybersecurity policy, had the gall to warn that foreign agents were trying to recruit users in other nations in order to purchase political adverts on the platform on their behalf.</p><p>In pursuing such a circuitous route, Facebook's strict new rules - which include providing proof of a postal address in the country where the ad is places - would be satisfied. \"No security protocol is foolproof,\" cautioned Mr Gleicher.</p><p>That is especially true when the protocols put in place are about as robust as a water biscuit. The information Facebook requires - and subsequently publishes - is so vague and unhelpful, it might as well reprint the horoscope entries from a back issue of Take a Break.</p><p>Take just one of adverts it has permitted in the past week by way of example. The ad, promoting a page called Brexit Votes Matter, called on people to \"stop the eco loonies\" and bemoaned the \"endless lies and lunacy from the doom and gloom brigade\".</p><p>READ MORE: Facebook to verify political adverts in UK crackdown on dark ads'</p><p>The disclaimer, however, includes no individuals, let alone addresses, telephone numbers, or websites. Instead, it states the ad was placed by a group known as Brexit Defence Force.</p><p>You can say what you like about Facebook's lax privacy policies, but when it comes to organisations with quasi-paramilitary undertones, their secrets are well and truly safe.</p><p>When you consider that other Big Tech players such as Google, the owners of YouTube, and Snapchat do not have any kind of transparency underpinning political advertising on their platforms, the idea that the industry has the willingness and ability to regulate itself is laughable.</p><p>The question is, then, whether the UK Government has the backbone to enact meaningful change. Even if the need for transparency is enshrined in statute, it means little if a campaign group can simply submit a name without providing any details about its funding or donors, as per the Facebook model.</p><p>A sound starting point would be the introduction of a centralised searchable repository of ads across all social media platforms which explicitly spells out the identity of a group's executives and directors, as well as its donors. Anything short of that would do little to address the integrity crisis at the heart of British political life. </p><p>There is, however, a glimmer of hope, as discontent with the existing system grows and the calls for change intensify. At a time when the European election campaign is in full swing, it is telling to see who has been the biggest spender on Facebook advertising in the UK in the past week, forking out a hefty \u00a328,000.</p><p>The answer, laden in irony, is the Electoral Commission. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCTMAN-BEB627845CD7466999CB6A2A46423F19ELM76016176STTS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCTMAN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2J-0YV1-JDPH-B2KC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">377101</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Johnston Press Plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Scotsman</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13512\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 8, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And just this weekend, the UK's health minister Jeremy Hunt said social media firms should face tougher laws unless they do more to protect young people who use their sites.</p><p>But with this mountain of criticism directed at Facebook, what does it mean for the company as an investment opportunity? \"The Facebook affair has knocked confidence in the stock, and tech more generally,\" says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. While that doesn't necessarily mark the end of the company's outperformance, Mould says this shows the dangers of holding highly valued stocks. \"Lofty price tags leave little downside protection if something goes wrong.\" Stricter controls about what information third parties can access could also hit Facebook's advertising revenue. But Fiona Cincotta, financial market analyst at City Index, points out that Facebook still retains some of its value by owning huge brands like Whatsapp and Instagram - names which provide extra revenue streams to cushion the group against any falls.</p><p>\"As a group, Facebook is actually much stronger in the face of this scandal than it appears on face value,\" Cincotta adds.</p><p>But with the recent drama sparking questions about toughening up regulation, we should question whether we could see a shake-up of the landscape for other tech beasts.</p><p>Having been left to roam free, the kings of the stock market jungle could soon find themselves caged - and weaker as a result.</p><p>Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google - collectively known as the Faangs - have dominated the markets for years. So does Facebook's stutter signal the beginning of the end for this cohort? \"Faangs could do no wrong in 2017, but that has started to unwind rapidly this year,\" says Cincotta. \"It's probably safe to say that we won't see a repeat of the previous year's gains for Faang stocks.\"</p><p>Regulation is expected to be the glaring issue for the big tech names going forward, yet Hargreaves Lansdown's Laith Khalaf points out that these companies have the financial resources to accommodate some additional red tape. In fact, Khalaf points out that Facebook has a \"sizeable war chest\" of around $40bn in net cash, as well as free cash flow of $17bn in last year alone.</p><p>But it's not just increased regulation these companies have to worry about. \"Given their size and market caps, it is becoming increasingly obvious that these companies are not pulling their weight in terms of contribution to taxation,\" says Fidelity's Amit Lodha, warning that investors should be wary about the impact of higher tax on the revenue trajectory of these businesses, particularly as they grow bigger and more influential. Clamping down on the tax treatment of these companies could serve as a blow for shareholders.</p><p>Last month was a tricky time for all the Faang stocks in terms of market performance, and Lodha reckons that the next 12 months will continue to be choppy. But he also points out that this could present a good buying opportunity for investors - with Facebook's valuation now starting to look attractive. The recent saga could even spur big tech to address some of the social responsibility issues, such as privacy and competition, says Price. Improving corporate governance could benefit these companies from an investment point of view. As Price points out: \"these companies will need to be more responsible to attract shareholders\".</p><p>The Faangs are expected to become a bigger part of our lives, and so it's difficult to imagine the end of their reign. But they are no longer the safe bet they once were, and investors might like to err on the side of caution. Indeed, Cincotta warns that any sudden regulatory announcements could see these stocks drop sharply.</p><p>If you're invested in these tech stocks, don't expect the free lunch you've had over recent years - and don't bite off more than you can chew.</p><p>The kings of the stock market jungle could soon be caged</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-136878561</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5N-X5X1-JBVM-Y3DD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"794\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 City A.M.

The social media giant is also looking for venture capital firms to invest up to $1 billion in its blockchain project, according to a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://fortune.com/2019/04/09/term-sheet-tuesday-april-9/\">report</url> by Fortune.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Payments giant PayPal has also begun investing in blockchain technology.

This is open innovation, which means every incremental step has a large multiplier effect.\"</p><p>Weinberg also said that when big organizations like Facebook begin moving forward, it will encourage other companies to do the same.</p><p>\"The horse has left the stable and the speed that this space will move now that the giants are pushing will be greater than anything we've seen before,\" Weinberg said. \"In my opinion blockchain has reached its adoption phase.\"</p><h>A possible danger</h><p>There is a potential dark side to Facebook and PayPal becoming major players in the market:\u00a0While they will likely spark more innovation in the field and demonstrate that blockchain is a \"safe space,\" they also might use blockchain technology unethically, said \u00a0Cahill Puil, CEO and founder of Byte Media Group, a marketing company for blockchain and tech groups.</p><p>\"We've got to remember that it's Facebook \u2014 they're the wolf in sheep's clothing,\" Cahill said. \"This is the same company who's\u00a0historically known to abuse power and not give a crap about customers.

Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon each have money transmitter licenses in more than 40 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet it's not clear the states have the resources to oversee those firms, which represent a tiny fraction of the total companies the states are expected to supervise and examine. At the moment, states also don't seem to have an easy way to share information with each other about what they do find. Though state examiners currently conduct from 20,000 to 30,000 examinations of nonbanks every year, there is no nationwide system to share examination findings of nonbanks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even scheduling state exams has become a Herculean task. Every quarter, members of a task force of 10 state banking regulators spend several hours on a conference call looking at spreadsheets and coordinating their schedules.</p><p>\"With so many companies under supervision and so many exams to take place, we literally fall over each other,\" said Chuck Cross, senior vice president of consumer protection and nondepository supervision at the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. \"There has been no technology to allow us to have an understanding of where other examiners are at any moment in time.\"</p><p>State regulators are in the process of trying to change that.</p><p>After the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency first proposed in 2017 to create a charter for fintechs - one that could potentially be used by large tech firms - the states responded by filing a lawsuit (which is still pending) and attempting to resolve the hassles of being overseen by multiple states. They developed a 50-state examination system to simplify supervision and examine nonbanks like Facebook, PayPal and Venmo.</p><p>This fall, up to a dozen states will take part in a pilot project modeled on the CSBS' Nationwide Multistate Licensing System, which was created in 2008 for mortgage oversight after the financial crisis. A nationwide release of the state examination system is expected in early 2020.</p><p>The system is part of a larger effort to upgrade technology and create data analytics tools that states can use to flag high-risk products and companies.</p><p>\"It will facilitate an exchange of information and data between the states to make it easier for the states to share examination data, which is good for industry participants too,\" said Mark Quandahl, director of the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance, who chaired the CSBS' payments and innovation task force.</p><p>When it comes to overseeing Facebook, however, states like Nebraska have their work cut out for them. Nebraska has 34 examiners responsible for the oversight of 156 state-chartered banks, 3,900 mortgage loan originators and 139 sales finance companies, plus credit unions, trust companies, delayed deposit services and small loan companies. The state hired its first examiner of money transmitters last year, Quandahl said.</p><p>Facebook is licensed as a money transmitter in 42 states and the District of Columbia, but the depth of exams and supervision on the state level varies significantly.</p><p>\"What is hamstringing the states' efforts is not only are the states trying to track fast-moving innovation and keep up, it is complicated by different state laws, and banking agencies that are less than fully staffed and are trying to keep their heads above water,\" said Clifford Stanford, a partner in Atlanta at Alston &amp; Bird. \"The tension between Silicon Valley time and regulators' time -that's a real issue and a frustrating one.\"</p><p>Thomas Curry, the former comptroller of the currency who is a partner at Nutter McClennen &amp; Fish, agreed. He launched the OCC's fintech charter in an effort to give fintechs one set of rules. But that effort is stillbeing challengedin the courts.</p><p>\"What's really out there is a patchwork of rules and different types of licenses,\" Curry said. \"It is crying out for standardization and the choice is do you do it through a re-engineered state system or do you do it through the national bank system?\"</p><p>States argue that the OCC is overstepping is legal authority, and many bankers fear a large technology firm like Facebook could use the OCC's charter to become another megabank. They say that with the improvements state regulators are making to their processes, fintechs and others don't need a national charter.</p><p>\"There is a lot of oversight going on,\" said David Cotney, a former Massachusetts banking commissioner and senior adviser at FS Vector, a fintech consulting firm in Washington. \"Each state has been doing a good job at protecting consumers. What you'll see is a much more coordinated approach to supervision and the states will be able to raise the bar in terms of ensuring from a safety and soundness perspective that\" the nonbanks \"are well regulated.\"</p><p>No fintech license</p><p>Nonbanks operate under a number of different licenses that may not exactly reflect their business. For example, payment processors typically operate under money transmitter licenses, though their business is really about alternative payment systems.</p><p>But Facebook's Libra currency creates its own issues for states. Most states do not even have specific laws regarding cryptocurrencies.</p><p>\"States have a very challenging and difficult time to put their arms around a dynamic, fast-moving, fast-changing industry,\" said Tony Alexis, head of Goodwin Procter's consumer financial services enforcement practice and a former assistant director and head of enforcement at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"When you look at something as simple as money transmitters, it varies so much from state to state that it can be an incredible point of confusion and worry for a company as they launch their fintech products.\"</p><p>States have varied capital and bonding requirements in addition to so-called permissible investment requirements, which determine whether a payment processor like Facebook can hold capital in U.S. dollars or in cryptocurrency. Some state laws governing money transmitter licenses, meanwhile, have not been updated in a century.</p><p>At the same time, states also have seen a near-doubling in the volume of nonbank licensing applications, many of them from nonbank mortgage lenders. The proliferation of nonbank fintech firms has put more stress on the multistate system, Cross said.</p><p>The question is whether the efforts underway to standardize oversight will be enough to alter that. So far, nearly half of all state regulators have agreed to uniform standards forprocessing licensesfor money transmitters and money-services businesses. Another CSBS initiative still in development is a model money-services-business law that would smooth out the differences in state-by-state laws.</p><p>\"The risk is that someone walks in with cash or some other means of paying and the money does not arrive at its destination,\" Cotney said. \"There are far more consumer protections for lending, including usury limits, than for payments.\"</p><p>It's also a question of whether state regulators are willing to use the powers they have - and how others will be able to judge what they've done. States often resolve violations nonpublicly, which typically results in restitution for affected consumers, but no penalties.</p><p>Because supervisory and exam information is confidential, there is a dearth of publicly available performance data on the frequency of exams and how many enforcement actions of big tech companies are being done at the state level. It is a felony for a state regulator to divulge information about a state exam.

(And GM also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/11/gm-buying-self-driving-tech-startup-for-more-than-1-billion/\">bought</url> the self-driving-tech startup Cruise outright in the spring of 2016.) This new partnership may represent the first of the contours of the automotive marketplace of the future come into view. \"It looks like a joint front against Uber. I don't know if that's truly their motivation, but it certainly wouldn't surprise me,\" says Wallace.<br/>In talking through the Waymo-Lyft partnership, Wallace used an analogy to air travel to sketch out what the automotive industry of tomorrow may be like. \"At the end of the day, you may have three or four, possibly even five very strong 'alliances,' let's call them, for lack of a better word,\" he says. \"It would almost be like airlines. Take Delta, KLM, Air France and their other partners. [As a consumer] it almost doesn't matter which airline you end up on if it's one of them. They're all operated under the same agreement, and they're focused on fighting against the United alliance and against the American alliance and against the Southwest alliance, if you will.\"<br/>For the time being, the most immediate hurdles between the human-driving present and the autonomous future are still technological. Nobody has perfected programming a car to use an array of sensors to drive safely in all conditions, for example handling blizzards and other rough weather, reacting to the unpredictable human drivers sharing the streets, or knowing how to proceed when police are directing traffic with hand gestures that are intuitive to humans but meaningless to a computer looking out at the world through a LIDAR array. But as machines learn and software engineers program solutions, the important question isn't just about the development of the technology; it's over how it will be deployed, and by whom. \"The more interesting question than who's ahead right now might be who has the best business model to field it,\" Wallace says.<br/>Companies are having just this argument now, and it's a blood sport. First, there are the tech firms, which say they'll win because they're closer to solving those persistent technical problems. Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University and the author of The Sharing Economy, notes that these companies might have an edge over automakers when it comes to winning over consumers' trust. \"Wouldn't you be more inclined to rely on the software and cybersecurity ingenuity of Google, Uber, Didi, Lyft, Amazon, Apple or Tesla (the exception), rather than trusting the digital capabilities of Ford, Toyota, Daimler or BMW?\" he asked rhetorically in a comment shared with reporters.<br/>Detroit automakers, meanwhile, are arguing that it'll be the people who actually know how to build and deliver a vehicle who will capture the market, and no amount of AI wizardry can change that. Sundararajan sees a weakness in this reasoning, though. \"Automakers have invested heavily into making themselves sellers of lifestyle products rather than machines,\" he says, noting the trend away from marketing cars with signature flourishes and strong brand identities.<br/>And lastly, companies like Uber insist that, particularly when cars can drive themselves, the ownership model of car use will go defunct, and ride-hailing companies' existing consumer-facing model will be able to simply swap out cars driven by humans to cars that drive themselves-in other words, that the people selling transport as a service, rather than software or hardware as products, will be the winners. And, Sundararajan points out, these are the companies with the most experience navigating (or sometimes       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html\">subverting</url>) any regulatory hurdles that stand in their way.<br/>There are certainly merits to each view-that selling self-driving tech itself, or selling cars, or selling transportation is the way to come out on top. It's not clear yet which business model (or combination of business models) will win out, but that's what makes the Lyft-Waymo (and effectively GM) partnership so interesting, and inauspicious for rival firms from Tesla to Uber to the established major automakers       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5kIrW1_LTAhWlDMAKHWyDBnoQFggzMAI&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2017%2F02%2F18%2Fford-invests-in-pittsburgh-based-argo-ai-to-build-self-driving-cars-by-2021%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNHt3cxlOiaY0-rM_zJ6Ea7OpiDr8w&amp;sig2=tCk1SqrklGzPJRTS_2sYxQ\">investing</url> in self-driving tech of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-daimler-bosch-selfdriving-idUSKBN1760SJ\">their own</url>: These three are effectively taking all sides of the argument, hedging their bets by forming a team with a member from each camp.<br/>Read       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/05/lyft-waymo/526782/\">Will Game of Thrones-Like Alliances Shape the Future of Driverless Cars?</url> on theatlantic.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-willemgameofthronesemlikealliancesshapethefutureofdriverlesscars526782</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NJK-13P1-JCG7-V4BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"974\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

dominant position of its Android operating system in the mobile phone market was a very significant sum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google may be a massive cash cow in the global tech world, with revenues last year of \u20ac110bn and profits from that of \u20ac12.6bn, but make no mistake, for any company to have to hand over a third of its annual profit to a regulator for breaching competition rules will not sit well with its management, board, the market or with shareholders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although a record, the Google fine is of course not the first of its kind from the European Commission for alleged anti-competitive practices or illegal state aid.</p><p>Last year, the search giant was hit with a \u20ac2.4bn bill for using its search engine to steer internet users towards its own shopping platform. </p><p>Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, LG and Philips have also been at the receiving end of a severe financial telling off from the Commission over the last six years.</p><p>It all speaks to an increasing assertiveness among regulators in Europe about the growing dominance of big-tech.</p><p>And the push back is not just confined to the area of competition, nor is it only coming from regulators. </p><p>It is also growing among the populous too, with ordinary users starting to question how they use technology and how that technology uses them.</p><p>Take, for example, the renewed focus on Facebook this week following Tuesday night\u2019s Dispatches programme on Channel 4.</p><p>The undercover investigation revealed how moderators working in the company\u2019s offices in Dublin were instructed not to remove extreme, abusive or graphic content from the platform even when it violated the company's guidelines.</p><p>At face value, the programme seemed to be a shocking eye-opener about the role played by content moderation, the woeful inadequacies of aspects of the system and an alleged willingness to compromise standards of taste and decency in the pursuit of profit.</p><p>Facebook admitted mistakes had been made but also vehemently rejected some of the claims leveled by the programme.</p><p>In particular the company took issue with comments by a moderator who was secretly filmed saying Facebook wanted some extreme material on the platform in order to attract users.</p><p>The company said the reality was the complete opposite, because users want a good experience on the platform and advertisers don\u2019t want to be associated with dodgy content.</p><p>The programme also alleged a horrific video depicting the beating of a child by an adult was let stay on the platform by moderators because it did not breach its standards.</p><p>In its response, the social network claimed the only circumstances under which it allows videos of child abuse to remain online is if doing so might help bring the child to safety.</p><p>Nonetheless, the programme rightly led to a chorus of disapproval from online safety experts, politicians, businesses and ordinary users. </p><p>The Taoiseach said it was shocking and unacceptable, particularly as Facebook appeared to have not lived up to its own community standards, and stated the Government was examining legislative mechanisms to ensure such companies uphold basic standards of decency.</p><p>Communications Minister Denis Naughten told Facebook executives at a hastily arranged meeting that he was appalled and disgusted by the programme\u2019s contents and that a serious step change is needed.</p><p>Whether that step change will come about from Facebook reforming within, or from external action forced on it by Government is unclear.</p><p>Certainly the recently launched Government Action Plan for Online Safety has been dismissed by experts as being light on detail or concrete measures that would make a meaningful difference.</p><p>The doubt cast by the Government over the appointment of a Digital Safety Commissioner, has also disappointed many NGOs that have campaigned for one.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is all a sign that the tide of big-tech dominance which has been flowing in for years is clearly starting to ebb.</p><p>Undoubtedly in many cases it is not before time and with good grounds and justification.</p><p>A level of caution should be exercised though in deciding how fast and far we would like the tide to go out.</p><p>We must not forget that the internet and therefore by extension the commerce on it is still very young.</p><p>Clearly, despite their claims not all tech firms have pure squeaky clean motives of social good and bringing people together.</p><p>Indeed why would they? After all, most exist to make a profit.</p><p>But we should remember that many big tech companies are themselves still finding their way in this new internet enabled society.</p><p>And so in the same way that they haven\u2019t always foreseen the full consequences of what they have designed and built, neither can regulators always completely foresee the consequences of regulating and reigning them in.</p><p>For example discussion about hate crimes, violence in war zones or the exploitation of children may not be what most users go on to Facebook to partake in.</p><p>But we must ask ourselves, as ugly as it might often be, were moderate discussion about such topics not taking place on that and other internet platforms at all, would that be a positive or a negative outcome for society?</p><p>Sure, there must be boundaries as there are in the print and broadcast media, and clearly his ill-judged comments about Holocaust deniers show that even Mark Zuckerberg finds it difficult to get the balance right.</p><p>But over regulating is not necessarily the answer either. </p><p>Determining what is appropriate and inappropriate content for the internet and social media is entirely subjective and is dependent on a myriad of factors including context, motives, social and cultural norms, etc.</p><p>There is undoubtedly a place for legislative based guidance and supervision, but prescriptive tough regulation about internet content would be unworkable and potentially damaging to all that\u2019s good about the web.</p><p>Similarly, there is no doubt that market competition is good as it reduces prices and encourages innovation.</p><p>There\u2019s also no argument about the fact that Google has a dominant position in many markets it operates in, including mobile phone operating systems where its software is installed on 86% of mobile devices globally.</p><p>But as the Ibec affiliated Technology Ireland organisation argued, the Android competition case outcome could have unintended consequences, including perversely less innovation, less competition and higher prices.</p><p>That\u2019s because it could conceivably lead to increased fragmentation in the market, greater barriers to entry, lost scale and increased costs, all with knock-on effects for consumers.</p><p>So as we stand in the water and watch the tide of tech giant influence start to recede very slowly, we should be hoping the level doesn\u2019t drop too low.</p><p>Because while it can be a destructive force, the ebb and flow of technology\u2019s power is as much an opportunity as it is a threat to our everyday lives.</p><p>Comments welcome via Twitter to @willgoodbody</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

The tedious ritual of signing forms authorizing new providers to access our medical history is the result of a rarity for Americans: thanks to the first amendment, we have few rights and little expectation of privacy, except when it comes to our medical records. Even doctors who have our best interests at heart must get permission to access our data under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (Hipaa).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So it was truly shocking to learn this week that a business partnership between Google and Ascension, a major hospital chain and health insurer, has resulted in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790\">transfer of 50 million Americans' most intimate medical records</url> to the Silicon Valley company, without the knowledge or consent of those 50 million patients. Even more alarming, the records are not de-identified, and a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790\">whistleblower disclosed to the Guardian</url> serious concerns about the program, including that individual staffers have downloaded patient records.</p><p>It took less than 48 hours for federal regulators to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790\">announce an investigation</url> into the partnership. Google and Ascension both claim that they are fully compliant with Hipaa, but there are few reasons for the public to trust them. The combination of a data-hungry advertiser and a cost-cut-seeking health insurer is truly dystopian. The fact that a whistleblower was disturbed enough to risk their job is alarming.</p><p>One of the peculiarities of the backlash to big tech over the past few years has been the degree to which Google has remained unscathed despite engaging in behaviors similar to those that have left Facebook's reputation in tatters. I tend to believe that this is because Google's products are genuinely useful, making its surveillance of our online activities seem like a better bargain than Facebook's monopoly on our personal relationships, which often feels more like a hostage situation than an equal trade-off.</p><p>But getting in bed with an industry that profits by denying healthcare - and doing so in a way that at the very least appears underhanded - could be a step too far for some customers.  </p><p>                   Feature? Or bug?                   </p><p>A friend of mine recently sent me what she thought was a hot news tip. She'd been scrolling through Facebook on her phone when she was served an advertisement for \"anti-pigmentation sunglasses\" - big black shades that look like a hipper version of the throwaway glasses they give out at the eye doctor. The ad claimed that these sunglasses could reverse melasma, a type of facial hyper-pigmentation that frequently occurs during pregnancy.</p><p>My friend, a mother of three, does have melasma below her eyes, she told me, but no one knows because she covers it with foundation and has never posted a makeup-free photo on social media. \"This might mean that Facebook is spying through the camera even when you're just looking at it,\" she said. \"I know this sounds crazy, but they do a lot of crazy stuff.\"</p><p>I rolled my eyes. The conspiracy theory that Facebook is listening to people's conversations through their smartphones has been around for ages, providing tech reporters like myself ample opportunity to feel superior as we explain to friends and family that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790\">Facebook's vast data collection makes such individualized eavesdropping</url> wholly unnecessary. It's much more likely that Facebook just knows that you're a woman with kids, I texted, smugly.</p><p>Imagine my chagrin when, just 24 hours later, Facebook<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790\">confirmed that a bug was activating iPhone cameras</url> as users scrolled their feeds. The company says that the camera was only ever in \"preview mode\" and that it has seen no evidence of photos or videos being uploaded due to the bug.</p><p>But it's too late for my friend. She's more convinced than ever that Facebook is looking at her through her phone - and Facebook's PR response isn't exactly helping. I emailed the company asking for a definitive statement that Facebook does not use smartphone cameras or image analysis to derive ad targeting categories. Here is the response: \"Facebook does not use your phone's camera to inform ads or what you see in News Feed.\"</p><p>                     What I'm reading...                   </p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>An investigation into working conditions at Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory, by USA Today's Anjeanette Damon.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>An actually uplifting tech story about Personals, a queer dating space on Instagram that is launching its own app, by my colleague Sam Levin.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Five GitHub employees have resigned over the company's contract with US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice), according to a new report by Vice.</p></bodyText></listItem></list>                   Valley of the LOLs                   </p><p>In case it's not obvious from the title, Valley of the LOLs is a semi-regular section of this column where I hope to feature things on the internet that are - against all odds - good, or if not good, at least funny.</p><p>This week, I want to say thanks for this <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790\">website</url>, which features a rotating assortment of Sephora product reviews that mention crying.

And some well-positioned industry observers are forecasting seismic changes in how the tech giant\u2019s interwoven ad stack\u2014Google controls access to the ad inventory and owns the ad exchange, and its algorithm helps decide which ad impressions to buy (on Google\u2019s ad exchange or those of third parties)\u2014is used to direct the flow of ad dollars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regulators all over the world are more intensely scrutinizing Google\u2019s sprawling empire and questioning whether its dominance in ad tech, search and mobile operating systems is inhibiting innovation in the wider market. Some now believe Google may voluntarily divest itself of its less lucrative assets like its ad stack in an attempt to convince governments it\u2019s not a monopoly guilty of stifling innovation in online ad targeting and delivery. Alternatively, the U.S. government could force Google\u2019s hand.</p><p>Either outcome would result an ad-tech market that looks significantly different than the one we have today.</p><p>This is not the first time Big Tech has faced regulatory scrutiny, but industry sources believe\u00a0a major change to how third parties can access Google\u2019s ad-tech stack is on the horizon. As Attorney General William Barr intensifies his focus on Big Tech\u2019s dominance of certain sectors (and in online media, that means Google), some insiders believe it\u2019s just a case of whether Google will make such changes of its own volition or the government will force it to.</p><p>This week, on the same day the Senate Judiciary Committee explored \u201cself-preferencing by digital platforms\u201d in a hearing on Capitol Hill, Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., jointly penned a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice calling out Google\u2019s dominance of the search market.</p><p>This came soon after the DOJ hosted a conference in the wake of the IAB\u2019s annual leadership meeting at which industry experts and investors were invited to share opinions on Google\u2019s dominance of the sector. In particular, investigators were interested in whether or not the dominance of Big Tech is stifling investors\u2019 willingness to fund startup alternatives in the sector.</p><p>Sources told Adweek that DOJ investigators are particularly interested in how Google\u2019s complex ad stack, historically known as DoubleClick, is intertwined and whether the algorithms underpinning it contain inherent bias.</p><p>For instance, questions persist over whether Google\u2019s ad server, commonly known as DFP, favors its ad exchange, AdX, as an inventory supply source for publishers at the expense of third-party supply-side players. Additionally, Google\u2019s 2015 third-party ad serving changes on YouTube, such as restricting access to third-party demand-side platforms, have been the subject of much controversy in recent years.</p><p>In her testimony at this week\u2019s Senate hearing, Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, said that by purchasing \u201cevery spoke of the ecosystem,\u201d Google has affected competition in the market.</p><p>\u201cIf Google had not bought DoubleClick and then Admob, the leading mobile advertising company, plus a slew of other ad-tech companies, things could have been different,\u201d Hubbard testified, adding that Google\u2019s acquisition of multiple ad-tech tools significantly hindered market competition.</p><p>At the same hearing, Gene Kimmelman, senior advisor for Public Knowledge, told senators, \u201cThis type of behavior would allow Google to charge higher prices for advertisers than they might in a more competitive market and allow Google to pay less out to publishers for the right to advertise on their content.\u201d</p><p>Such pressure has many experts believing Google may sacrifice some of its ad-tech assets, such as its ad exchange or DSP, in an attempt to placate regulators probing how the company manages to lay claim to more than one in three ad dollars spent in the U.S.</p><p>Ciar\u00e1n O\u2019Kane, CEO of WireCorp, said the imminent demise of the third-party cookie means Google\u2019s ad-tech business \u201creally doesn\u2019t matter to them anymore,\u201d as the demise of such infrastructure could upend its value proposition.</p><p>O\u2019Kane also told Adweek that Google parent Alphabet breaking out its YouTube revenue for the first time during its most recent quarterly earnings filing was a significant move that may be an indicator of its future plans.</p><p>\u201cI think Google may be getting out of ad tech altogether, but if you really wanted to [break up Google] properly, you\u2019d have YouTube as a stand-alone business,\u201d O\u2019Kane said, adding that Google\u2019s dominance of the search market and YouTube is where its fortune lies.</p><p>\u201cI think that its recent YouTube numbers were a case of them telegraphing to the market that they\u2019re going to make a sacrifice to the DOJ just to get them off their backs \u2026 and I think that\u2019d be their ad-tech stack,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ari Paparo, CEO of DSP Beeswax, said government authorities could force Google to stop sharing data among the various components of its ad stack should it want to stoke competition in the space. \u201cThey could also force Google to be interoperable with other people, such as allowing DSPs to buy YouTube inventory,\u201d Paparo said. \u201cIn very broad swaths, that\u2019s what could happen.\u201d</p><p>In spite of indications of an imminent breakup of the Google empire, other analysts point to the privacy zeitgeist and how it\u2019s playing into the hands of Big Tech. Some maintain that walled gardens are simply better for user privacy because the fewer players there are in the market, the less opportunity there is for data leakage.</p><p>In the aftermath of his testimony before a Congressional committee investigating digital marketing, privacy and competition last year, influential ad-tech figure Brian O\u2019Kelley, the co-founder and former CEO of AppNexus, advocated a self-regulating body similar to FINRA, which has oversight of participants in the financial services market under the direct supervision of the SEC.</p><p>\u201cThese are really complicated issues that are not just hard to explain; they\u2019re hard to break into their component parts,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cHow do you address privacy without thinking about whether you\u2019re increasing Google\u2019s power over the advertising ecosystem?\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1131634</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDT-11V1-DYRK-H18C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1040\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 13, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

And all for a trifling $2.1bn (\u00a31.6bn).The upshot is yet another step forward in Google's quest to break into big tech's next frontier: healthcare.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">Financial Times feature</url> about all this, came a remarkable quote from a partner at Health Advances, a Massachusetts-based tech consulting company. Wearables, he reckoned, would be only one small part of the ensuing story: just as important were - and no guffawing at the back, please - \"bedside devices, under-mattress sensors, [and] sensors integrated into toilet seats\". Such inventions, it was explained, can \"get even closer to you than your smartphone, and detect conditions such as depression or heart-rate variability\".</p><p>Advanced societies are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">ageing at speed</url>, and the pressures this will exact on already stretched public services are obvious. Tech offers some of the answers: huge troves of medical data can power the kind of artificial intelligence whose capabilities, particularly for early diagnosis, far outstrip those of human beings. This could lead in turn to huge computing power monitoring people's every heartbeat and sneeze. Tech also opens up new revenue possibilities for the providers of care. Trade huge sets of patient data for either services or cash, and the returns could be enormous: some estimates suggest that the NHS might make       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">almost \u00a310bn a year</url>.</p><p>In the US, there are already examples of the inevitable <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">linking of tracking to health insurance</url>, whereby premiums are discounted in return for access to personal data gathered by wearables (which companies also use for in-house \"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">corporate wellness programmes</url> \"). Here, politicians now enthuse about the application of AI to medicine, and there are regular stories about the blurring of the boundaries between       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">big tech and the NHS</url>. </p><p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is very pleased about a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">deal with Amazon</url> that allows the company access to the NHS's information about \"symptoms, causes and definitions of conditions\" (not to mention \"all related copyrightable content and data and other materials\"). It stops short of the use of patient records, but the fact that NHS know-how will be accessible via Echo home assistants underlines where things may be heading: people will get in the habit of sharing health information, while Amazon gathers even more data about them.</p><p>Most British politicians seem barely aware of this new set of issues, which demand new rules and laws</p><p>In 2017, a partnership between London's Royal Free NHS Trust and Google's DeepMind division was found to have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">breached UK data protection law</url> when 1.6 million people's medical data was used to develop a system focused on acute kidney injury. Last week, news broke about the Spanish tech and telecoms giant Telefonica - which trades in the UK as O2 - being given access to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">thousands of people's medical records</url> by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust. The information was anonymous, but Telefonica wants to develop an algorithm that will flag up supposed signs of possible mental illness by closely monitoring people's everyday behaviour via their phones.</p><p>Last week I spoke to a Cambridge-based data specialist, Sam Smith, one of the prime movers in self-styled \"privacy NGO\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">Med Confidential</url>. In the UK, it points out, companies \"get to use patient data if they are working with the NHS to provide care, or do research, or anything that is 'for the purposes of the promotion of health'\". Yes, the NHS has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">an opt-out policy</url> on such uses of medical records but, as Smith told me, it has barely been publicised, and in any case, it only offers a blanket \"yes\" or \"no\", with no chance to select who or what has access.</p><p>Most people will do what human beings usually do: either not hear about the possibility of opting out, or not care - either of which means the blithe surrendering of personal information to endless companies and organisations. Insistences that it is always anonymised (or \"de-identified\") do not close down anxieties about data breaches or the fact that AI can trace even supposedly anonymous data back to individuals. And questions remain about the deeply invasive innovations that some companies will use the data to develop. If you want one vision of the future, think about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">the deal Google has struck</url> with the US provider Ascension, and the fact that it now has access to the medical records of up to 50 million Americans, complete with names and dates of birth. Google insists it will enforce a strict separation between this information and its activities in advertising and consumerism, but that does not allay some people's deep unease.</p><p>Besides, some of the most intimate personal information now goes way beyond the organisations who treat us when we are ill. There are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">well over 300,000 health apps</url> available worldwide. For millions of us, the future may well feature an alarmingly regular experience: reaching for our phones and finding that an algorithm beyond our understanding suddenly deems us at risk of any number of illnesses, ailments and conditions, and is not just marketing us drugs, food and lifestyle choices, but telling our doctors and employers. One of the central questions of the near future is already obvious: will the price of longer and healthier lives be losing the most basic kinds of privacy?</p><p>Fitbits and toilet sensors represent one aspect of the so-called Internet of Things. Aided by 5G technology, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">tens of billions</url> of devices - cars, cookers, heating systems - will soon be connected. In theory, it will not be very hard to cross-reference, say, people's alcohol consumption, exercise rates and friendship patterns - not to mention their medical records - and then either nudge or strongly push their lives in supposedly beneficial directions.</p><p>The utilitarian arguments for doing so, bound up with managing health spending, advancing medical knowledge and maximising life expectancy, are obvious. But the ethical case against much of this seems equally clear. The only thing that can balance these two sets of imperatives is the state, and so far, most British politicians seem barely aware of this new set of issues, which demand new rules and laws.</p><p>Elsewhere, things are a little more advanced. In the US, a handful of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">activists in Congress</url> are now regularly proposing legislation on data, privacy and consent. Last year, along with a Republican colleague, the Democratic senator and presidential hopeful Amy Klobuchar co-authored a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/01/google-snaps-up-fitbit-for-21bn\">Protecting Personal Health Data Act</url>. In Europe, the essential logic of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the so-called \"right to be forgotten\" points in a similar direction. The European angle, of course, only highlights yet another way that Brexit and the government's belief in regulatory \"divergence\" may well have consequences that have so far barely registered.</p><p>The biggest problem, perhaps, is that even the most trailblazing steps towards regulating the relationship between tech and health are just a start, and that governments and legislators will only firmly grasp the problem once the public pushes them. Therein lies one of the central tensions of our time: that more and more innovations are quietly revolutionising the most sensitive aspects of how we live, while most of us look the other way.</p><p> John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-59972986</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y49-7WY1-F021-611J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1259\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Arturo Herrera's priorities are clear. That is why the question is: what importance will it attach to other, non-urgent, but strategic issues?</p><p><br/>One of them has to do with taxes on digital services and products. At the G20 meeting in Osaka, this was one of the most important issues discussed by finance ministers and their teams. There were Carlos Urz\u00faa and Arturo Herrera, representing Mexico. The starting point for governments is that big tech companies are exploiting a gap in global tax legislation to pay less tax than they should, in the countries in which they operate. One resource they use is to have head office in low-tax countries, such as Ireland or Luxembourg.<br/>Many countries want to have that digital tax, but in the OECD and the G20 there is clarity that a comprehensive coordination agreement is needed to better solve the problem. In Osaka, ministers pledged to have a report with a proposal by the end of 2020. In the meantime, each country will be free to take such action as it deems appropriate.<br/>In that context, we must understand France's decision. It became the first country to create a targeted tax against the big tech. It's a 3% rate that will apply to companies that sell digital advertising or do e-commerce. Only companies that bill more than $845 million globally or 25 million euros in France will pay.<br/>The French government estimates that only 30 companies will pay this tax, including the big ones in the United States: Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. There are also Chinese, German, Spanish and, significantly, a single French company, Criteo. The expected revenue is 400 million euros in the first year and 650 million in 2020.<br/>France went for the free, after an attempt to create a pan-European digital tax failed in 2018. In the coming weeks, other Europeans could pass similar taxes: Spain and Britain are almost ready. The United States threatens retaliation because it asserts that it is a discriminatory measure against its companies. For now, he has launched an investigation that could bring sanctions to French products.<br/>What will happen in Mexico? The PRD presented an initiative to create a digital tax in 2018 that was unresonated. It would not be difficult for the matter to return, considering that digital services are growing at double-digit rates and the government will need higher tax revenues. An additional factor to consider is pressure from groups affected by technology disruptors. A hotel establishment pays more tax and has more regulation than Airbnb. \"Traditional\" traders want even soil against Amazon and the media resents the impact of Google and Facebook on the advertising market.<br/>The Treasury evaluates the issue and will have to make a decision on the digital tax. Maybe I'll do it for the 2020 budget. Mexico could raise more than 5 billion pesos a year for this tax. It's a good amount that could serve to drive tech entrepreneurs or to bolster cybersecurity. It all sounds logical, but what if Trump gets mad?<br/>[email protected]<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-7622099</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WJF-H3X1-DY1R-B28T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0009SDK</classCode><className>PETROLEOS MEXICANOS (PEMEX)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION &amp;

It shields online platforms from liability for the content posted by its users. In doing so, it allows platforms to alter or remove content without being categorized as a publisher and, therefore, liable for content the way traditional publishers are. The law was written to empower and encourage online hosts to create and enforce standards and rules for their platforms.</p><p>But today, misguided criticisms of Section 230 come from both sides of the aisle.</p><p>Critics on the Left feel that online platforms aren\u2019t doing enough moderation of content. This week, Democratic Rep. David Cicilline announced plans to introduce a bill that would remove Section 230 protections from platforms that refuse to police political speech. Last spring, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi told reporters that Section 230 \u201cis a gift to (tech companies) and I don\u2019t think that they are treating it with the respect that they should, and so I think that that could be a question mark and in jeopardy \u2026 I do think that for the privilege of 230, there has to be a bigger sense of responsibility on it. And it is not out of the question that that could be removed.\u201d</p><p>From the Right, the criticism is the opposite. Conservative tech skeptics insist that the same online platforms are doing too much moderation, and are disproportionately silencing conservative voices in the process. </p><p>In response to this allegation, Sen. Josh Hawley introduced legislation to amend Section 230. The Missouri Republican\u2019s bill would strip large internet platforms of Section 230 protection until they earned certification from the Federal Trade Commission that their content moderation practices were \u201cpolitically neutral,\u201d whatever that means. Hawley\u2019s Ending Support for Internet Censorship Act is matched in its heavy-handed name only by its very likely unconstitutional content. </p><p>Barr seems to agree with both criticisms. </p><p>The attorney general apparently thinks social media platforms aren\u2019t doing enough content patrolling. He said, \u201ccriminals and bad actors now use technology to facilitate and expand the scope of their wrongdoing and the victimization of our fellow citizens.\u201d </p><p>Barr is being somewhat misleading by not acknowledging that Section 230 does not provide immunity from any federal criminal statute, although the law does immunize platforms from state laws and states often take the lead on pursuing crimes. And it is true that the courts have embraced a very broad interpretation of Section 230\u2019s protections.</p><p>Barr also agreed that conservative voices have been over-patrolled when he expressed concern for \u201cthose whose speech has been banned or restricted by these platforms.\u201d He wisely stopped short of labeling such actions a violation of the First Amendment, because that standard only correctly applies to government restrictions of citizen\u2019s speech. It\u2019s also worth noting that while there is a lot of anecdotal evidence of platform bias against conservatives, there\u2019s not much hard evidence that proves the existence of any broader trend.</p><p>Critics concerned about unwanted content online should not seek to weaken the cover Section 230 gives platforms to remove or edit content without fear of legal retribution. Repeal or weaken those protections and watch online hosts take a hands-off approach to patrolling their platforms, leaving more, not less, undesirable content posted online.</p><p>Even if the biggest online platforms could afford to jump through the regulatory hoops and constantly patrol content in anticipation of possible all violations, smaller firms would not be able to, further enshrining industry incumbents and stifling competition. Weakening Section 230 would mean bolstering Google, Facebook, and Twitter\u2019s leading market positions. That\u2019s a curious position for Barr to support, seeing as the Department of Justice is conducting antitrust investigations into several Big Tech companies.</p><p>Critics of Section 230 should proceed with caution before destroying the \u201ctwenty-six words that created the Internet.\u201d If not, we'll all live to regret it. </p><p>Jessica Melugin is associate director of the Center for Technology and Innovation at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free market think tank.</p><p>Photo Caption:William Barr, U.S. attorney general, listens during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, May 1, 2019.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2374063120</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCV-65G1-DY0W-443S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

They do another take.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You would be hard pressed in the annals of television to find two more recognizable Canadian actors, whose careers were defined a generation apart: Shatner for his 1960s Captain Kirk role in Star Trek and Priestley as Brandon Walsh in the 1990s teen drama Beverly Hills, 90210.</p><p>Producers are hoping that the two will go together like chocolate and peanut butter when they play sparring detectives in Global's Private Eyes, with Shatner reprising his previous guest-starring role and appearing in the third-season finale on Aug. 7 (Global at 8 p.m.).</p><p>\"I guess you could say he's a character that's kind of blundering his way around,\" says Shatner in an interview in between takes. \"It's great that you can have so much fun with this character, to explore what this guy does and why he does it.\"</p><p>Shatner plays rival private eye Norm Glinski, with his signature bombast that is completely parody-proof - nobody does over-the-top better.</p><p>Thought to be dead after a suicide, Norm returns after faking his death, asking Angie and Shade to figure out who wants to kill him.</p><p>Priestley plays detective Matt Shade, a retired NHL player who learned the private-sleuthing ropes from Angie Everett (Cindy Sampson), who inherited the firm from her father.</p><p>Cobbled together from familiar tropes, the series is anchored in the considerable chemistry of Priestley and Sampson - resulting in the feel of a modern-day take on shows like Moonlighting, which managed to be thrilling, a little romantic and downright campy at the same time. In Canada, Private Eyes has been a hit for Global, in the top 10 most watched programs over the last few weeks.</p><p>It's no surprise that Global will use the season finale as a lead-in to the premiere of the all-new BH90210, the meta-sequel to Beverly Hills, 90210 that will also star Priestley.</p><p>While his co-star is already on a reboot of his franchise, Shatner has ruled out starring in a new Star Trek series, even as his friend and peer Patrick Stewart has returned to Starfleet with Picard.</p><p>\"I've been offered many series over the years. But I haven't done them because of the commitment of time. And at this stage of my life that's more valuable than anything else,\" he said.</p><p>Yet at the age of 88, Shatner remains one of the hardest working men in show business. He recently released a country album of songs with Alabama's Jeff Cook (Why Not Me) and appeared on the final season of TV's biggest show, The Big Bang Theory, as himself. In between, he's been busy writing his memoirs (there have already been 10) and guest-starring in multiple series.</p><p>\"What else would I be doing? You've got to make hay when the sun shines,\" says Shatner. \"But seriously, commuting to Toronto from Los Angeles is arduous. There are hotels and bad food and bad mattresses, and you're away from family. But this was something I really wanted to do.\"</p><p>A large part of the reason for Shatner's Toronto appearance is showrunner Shawn Piller, whose father Michael co-created the Star Trek spinoff Deep Space Nine. The younger Piller has been a lifelong fan of the actor.</p><p>\"I would work with Shatner any day of the week,\" says Piller. \"We needed this rogue, troublemaking private investigator and he fit the bill. When he started he kept throwing out random quotes in his lines that seemed odd, but kind of wise, and we kept it in. He's just this naturally brilliant, funny actor and an international icon at the same time.\"</p><p>In other words, Shatner essentially \"Shatnerized\" the Norm Glinski character.</p><p>Thanks to Piller, then, there's still a Trek connection to this Toronto job for this actor who made his first TV appearances in the early 1950s, here in Canada (on long-forgotten shows like Space Command and The Canadian Howdy Doody Show). At this stage in his career though, with his old friend Leonard Nimoy (Spock) and Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, both gone, Shatner is the most visible connection left to the groundbreaking series.</p><p>The legacy question inevitably comes up - but it's not one that he's prepared to answer - perhaps because despite the advancing years he's been asked one too many times by critics too blind to see that he is still vitally involved in his craft.</p><p>\"How do I want to be remembered? Perhaps as a Margherita pizza. A good slice of pizza can be remembered a long time,\" he says glibly. \"But seriously. Reputation and fame and fortune, that's all over very quickly. More quickly than we think. All those ashes of celebrity will be blown away. What does remain are good deeds. That's where I think my legacy might be, in trying to help.\"</p><p>Shatner has had something of a record run in television, including hit series such as T.J. Hooker, regularly appearing in shows such as The Practice and Boston Legal (for which he earned two Emmy Awards), and becoming the first Canadian to star in three different series at different times on the big three American networks.</p><p>He's also been involved in numerous charity initiatives, including the Hollywood Charity Horse Show, which raises money for children's charities. And he's shameless - including not being beyond selling his kidney stone for $25,000 to build a house for Habitat for Humanity.</p><p>But it is on his Twitter feed that he seems unfiltered and unadulterated, frequently asking his 2.5 million followers to help each other out, or to donate to a specific charity.</p><p>Shatner uses a specific word that sounds like he lifted it from a classic Star Trek script. \"I've been doing Ubuntu,\" he says.</p><p>You're doing what? \"Ubuntu, it's African. It's about doing good deeds.\" (I later look up the word and find it's a South African concept meaning, essentially, humanity toward others.)</p><p>\"Doing something like tweeting really can help,\" he says. \"I've come to realize that the ugliness that people cloaked in anonymity in social media is far outweighed overall by the goodness that people want to express. I've basically been able to help people by getting their neighbours to help them. Maybe building that barn for the neighbour whose barn burned down. Sometimes even people give me strange things that I auction off for charity. It's all bringing our humanity together.\"</p><p>My cellphone buzzes at that point. It's a message coming in from the William Shatner fan club, of which I am a member. I show Shatner my iPhone screen with a comment from a fan.</p><p>\"You know it's completely free to join and you get discounts for upcoming events,\" he points out, suddenly turning into the pitchman from Priceline.</p><p>That drive, it seems is key to Shatner's longevity in the business. Despite the fame, he isn't afraid to reel in one fan at a time.</p><p>\"Now I've gotta go back to work.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

AP Photo</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The technology sector has led global equity markets in recent years as the powerful applications of cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) are deployed across an increasingly digital economy. This digital transition has accelerated during the era of Covid-19, as businesses and households have leveraged communications technologies and online commerce to sustain their daily activities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So far, little has seemed capable of impeding the tech sector's strong run. Investors have taken notice of large tech companies recently being hauled before Congress in the US, the Trump administration's rhetoric about Chinese divestiture of US tech assets and still-simmering trade tensions. Will greater regulatory oversight and changes in trade policy be the impediments that finally cool tech's hot streak?</p><p>While these developments merit attention, we believe that on their own, they will not dramatically alter the sector's trajectory. Tech's secular drivers remain intact and we expect the sector can harvest a greater share of earnings as their products and services add value across an ever-expanding customer base. Still, investors must be mindful of the regulatory landscape. As with any threat, one must ask what the likelihood is that a business model could be altered and, should that occur, to what degree future earnings growth would be affected?</p><p>Read More</p><p>Are US stocks destined to repeat history?</p><p>Google's search business targeted in looming US anti-trust case</p><p>Slack calls for EU probe into Microsoft over Teams bundling</p><p>Big Tech needs to be reined in</p><p>With the chief executives of several leading tech companies appearing before Congress, one may get the impression that these entities are confronted with similar regulatory challenges. That is not the case. There is a range of behaviours that legislatures likely believe require scrutiny.</p><p>Among these is purported anti-competitive behaviour. This is an activity that has invited past regulatory action. Perhaps the highest-profile example was Microsoft's long battle over bundling products like Internet Explorer into its operating system.</p><p>Amazon's relationship with vendors on its third-party marketplace platform has come into question. Concerns have emerged that third-party vendor data have been leveraged to benefit Amazon's private label offerings. Given the profitability of this business line, any forced changes would have to be factored into Amazon's future earnings profile. However, it can be argued that third-party vendors gain tremendous value from their relationship with Amazon due to the latter's marketing, fulfilment and logistics capabilities.</p><p>Similar concerns have emerged over Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Here, too, there are two sides for regulators to consider. As the company's search business has slowed, it has relied on mobile screens to generate a greater share of earnings. New services meant to achieve this often compete with companies that have historically been advertisers on the search platform. The question regulators are interested in is whether Alphabet has altered its algorithms to benefit its own services. Authorities may also want to review whether the company forced mobile device makers using the Android operating system to load a host of Google apps. Given the regulators' stance on Microsoft's bundling practices, the company could find itself fielding a range of questions from multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>Perhaps the highest-profile subject of regulatory enquiry has been Facebook and the power it wields by dominating social media. Facebook first came under scrutiny for its stewardship of personal data. Since 2018, however, it seems that the company has improved security, transparency and the ability for users to control their own personal information.</p><p>Of greater relevance is Facebook's role as a content moderator. In the US, under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, internet platforms were classified as distributors of content, not creators, and thus exempted from the liabilities publishers face for disseminated illegal content. This exemption has led many to complain that social media companies do too little to police their platforms for inappropriate content.</p><p>As with other sectors, tech appears caught in the lurch away from globalisation</p><p>Denny Fish, portfolio manager</p><p>Janus Henderson Investors</p><p>In recent years, politicians in the US and elsewhere have come to suspect that social media platforms can exert tremendous power in influencing user behaviour by allowing or blocking certain content based on their terms of service. Up for debate is whether those terms should remain narrowly defined \u2013 largely aligning with the \"illicit activity\" standard \u2013 or be expanded in a manner that compels platforms to act as arbiters of truth. Given the large role social media plays in hosting political discourse, it is easy to see why policy makers would want to revisit the issue of content moderation.</p><p>In all of these cases, we believe authorities will have to take a balanced approach. A long-held threshold for greater regulation has been whether consumers have been harmed. That would be hard to argue given the breadth of largely free and convenient value-added services available on these platforms. The sector is also a major source of well-paying jobs, and legislators, especially in the US, may view these companies as 'national champions' to be supported.</p><p>As with other sectors, tech appears caught in the lurch away from globalisation. Often this is guided by policy initiative such as tariffs. Over the past two decades, manufacturing has flowed towards countries with lower-cost labour. Now, either to evade tariffs, prohibitions or to diversify supply chains, costs are no longer the sole factor in choosing manufacturing bases. While this could impact profitability, the transition will take years to play out.</p><p>Of special note is the semiconductor industry. China desperately wants to build out its design and software capabilities to complement its manufacturing prowess. This has proven harder than expected. Now, the US has become more proactive in creating hurdles for Chinese companies to access complex technologies. This has ramifications not only for commercial relationships, but also potential merger and acquisition activity, thus possibly taking sources of future economic gains off the table.</p><p>Another geopolitical tussle in which authorities may have their say is Chinese ownership of Western tech companies and Western communications firms being pressured to not use Chinese vendors in building out their 5G networks. At present, countries are having to balance security and economic concerns as well as their relationship with the US.</p><p>Each of these instances indicate that the more complex geopolitical and regulatory landscape means that economics will not be the only factors at play as tech companies face future business decisions.</p><p>Denny Fish is a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, a member of The Gulf Bond and Sukuk Association</p><p>Updated: September 28, 2020 03:29 PM</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/10/160135929918.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/233/818/10/160135929918.jpg</url></p><p>A historic Alphabet share price graph.

I'm Gerri Willis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight on \"The Willis Report.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WILLIS (voice-over): The government wants to see a two-year financial accounts. But is their plan violating your privacy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Are you missing out on a perfect getaway? What you need to know about your frequent-flier miles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And we all know you shouldn't text and drive. But what is wrong with using Google maps when you're behind the wheel. One man tells us his story.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're covering all this and more tonight on the \"The Willis Report.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>WILLIS: Our top story, is the government about to violate your privacy under the guise of protecting you? The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau demanding big banks release customer data and using taxpayer money to buy information on how taxpayers use credit.</p><p>With more on this, Chris Conley, staff attorney at ACLU Technology Civil Liberties Project. Chris, thanks for stopping by. I appreciate your time. You know, I'm looking at this. The CFPB says we got to have data driven information to make the right kinds of rules, make sure we understand what consumers are doing. But what they're doing is peering over our shoulder, looking into our bank accounts, our credit card accounts, our mortgages. Isn't that just big brother?</p><p>CHRIS CONLEY, ACLU TECHNOLOGY CIVIL LIBERTIES PROJECT STAFF ATTOREY: Well, it is certainly concerning. Your financial information reveals quite a bit about you. As you said, your credit card records, your bank records, revealing not just your financial status but also interesting things about your habits -- where you go, how much you travel, who you see and what you do. And it certainly is concerning the government is looking into using data brokers and other sources to find out incredible amounts of information about all sorts of people.</p><p>WILLIS: Here is what they want to spend. 20 million altogether, 8.4 million to Experion alone to get our credit records. Now, I mean, you know, look, the government has been regulating banks and consumer financial products -- bank accounts, credit cards forever without this level of detail about us. Why do they have to have all of this personal data to make these kinds of decisions?</p><p>CONLEY: I mean that has been the question recently. Everyone seems to think that big data is the solution to everything. You know, you have more data and you could make better decisions. But its not that simple. Companies and the government need to realize both of their costs to data in terms of invading privacy and affecting individuals but just simply more information does not make for better decisions. There may be ways to use this responsibly but is not a matter of having access to everything and then we'll sort it all out later.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, I couldn't agree more. You know, the kinds of things that we are gaining access to, credit card information from (INAUDIBLE). They're going to know if you have over drafted your account. They're going to know if you buy an add-on products to keep your information safe. Credit scores, they're going to have that. Then there's a separate deal where they're picking up mortgage information. I can't imagine the worse idea than the government being able to spy on every account I have. Is there anyway I am going to be able to fight back?</p><p>CONLEY: That's the question. So there are laws on the books that restrict the government from actually using this information to personally identify or profile individuals. But as we have seen in many, many other contexts, the fact that there is a law on the book doesn't mean it doesn't happen. You know, government agents have gone into driver's license records to look at photos or driving records, all sorts of other records that are in your possession if it is not properly protected, if there isn't oversight and auditing to make sure that they're following the rules that they say they're following, this can be really vulnerable. And as you said, it can be really sensitive and really dangerous to people.</p><p>WILLIS: What do you think the ultimate risk is?</p><p>CONLEY: I think the risk here is that consumers could have their permission exposed to the government. You know, it could be your spouse or your boyfriend works for the government and has access to information that he simply shouldn't see. It could be that there is more systemic problems when this information is used not just for consumer protection but handed over to law enforcement or handed over to immigration or other agencies that should not have access to the information without proper procedural safeguards in place.</p><p>So you want to make sure this information is used only for the right purposes and not fair game for anything that anyone can possibly dream up.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, Chris, when it comes to the government, knowing things they shouldn't and being involved in privacy issues. Recently state attorney generals decided they were going to team up with what company but Facebook to promote privacy. You know, we're going to keep you safe. And the experts we are bringing in here is Facebook. They settle with the Federal Trade Commission not too long ago on charges that they were giving away information. That was your private information. When they promised not to. Is the government just stupid or what?</p><p>CONLEY: I'm not going to directly answer that question, but it certainly is a concern because Facebook while they are cooperating with the government and while they are trying to teach people how to protect their information is not and does not have a pristine record on actually doing so.</p><p>In fact, we sponsored a law in California called the Right to Know Act that would allow consumers to ask companies like Facebook, what information do you have about me and who are you sharing it with? And Facebook is part of several industry groups that are opposing this legislation. So the question is whether Facebook is really supporting individual's right to transparency and privacy or whether they're cooperating with the attorney generals and not really standing up behind their principles.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, every where I go, somebody seems to be wanting all my personal details. When I get my zip code at the store, when I'm buying something, they're all getting all my private details. Chris, thanks for coming on tonight. It's a story we will continue to review many times, I'm sure and we look forward to seeing you again.</p><p>CONLEY: Great. Thank you very much for having me.</p><p>WILLIS: Unbelievable. What are they going to think up next?</p><p>Now we want to know what you think. Here's our question tonight -- Do you trust the government with your private data? Log on to gerriwillis.com and vote on the right-hand side of the screen. I'll share the results at the end of tonight's show.</p><p>Also tonight, talk about being brazen. Dozens of IRS workers are charged with stealing government benefits. These are the very same workers who are supposed to protect taxpayer dollars. Instead they're ripping off the system. Liz MacDonald is here with more on the story.</p><p>Liz, great to have you here.</p><p>LIZ MACDONALD, FOX BUSINESS: Good to be with you, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS: So tell me about this story.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. So this is a story that is coming out of Tennessee, and what happened was basically we found IRS workers essentially telling the U.S. government, \"Hey, we are being furloughed. We're out of a job. So we need to get unemployment benefits, welfare, housing vouchers, and food stamps.\" And what happened was the state found out. They crossed checked it and they essentially found them stealing 250,000 plus in government benefits.</p><p>Now, you're right. These are the guys who are supposed to be watching out for things like false tax refunds going out the door.</p><p>WILLIS: Unbelievable.</p><p>MACDONALD: So this is a twist on, you know, we have been asked to pay our fair share. Now these workers have been caught taking their fair share. This has national implications because of the government furloughs, right, Gerri? In other words, budget cuts, federal workers being laid off. And the federal workers are basically allegedly getting government benefits but then getting rehired and not telling the government that they have been rehired. So 13 of these IRS workers were caught essentially lying saying there were still out of a job when they weren't.</p><p>WILLIS: What a story, but you know, what it reminds me of, didn't you report not too long ago that lots and lots of federal workers don't pay their income taxes?</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, Gerri. That's right. Three, something like $3.5 billion in back taxes owed by -- I tell you the number that we saw was 312,000 federal workers searching all across branches of the federal government. The department of Housing and Urban Development, the government printing office, who was found the most tax cheats. Even the Treasury Department, some IRS workers are not paying their federal taxes.</p><p>WILLIS: You got to be kidding.</p><p>MACDONALD: And Gerri, get this. There's another twist to this. We are hearing too that the Treasury Department has launched, the inspector general's office, (INAUDIBLE) tax administration launched something called Operation Double Dip to stop IRS workers from double dipping. In other words, getting government benefits they're not entitled to essentially that is what they're looking at. So this could be a story we are going to see more headlines coming at a later on.</p><p>WILLIS: So is Operation Double Dip going to be a good thing?</p><p>MACDONALD: I think it would be a good thing if it stops the problem of workers, IRS workers getting government benefits that are due.</p><p>WILLIS: Nobody is better at covering the IRS than you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you. Sure.</p><p>WILLIS: Thanks for coming on tonight.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS: Unbelievable. Well, now we want to bring you the latest developments to a story we have been following. Yesterday I told you how outrage I am that for every dollar homeowners who are wrongly foreclosed on get -- from a recent settlement, consultants get $4. Apparently it gets worse. Some of these 1.5 million homeowners after waiting for three years are getting their compensation in the form of checks that bounced.</p><p>As some go to deposit checks there being told funds are not available. Unbelievable. How many things can go wrong with this program? A lot apparently.</p><p>And broadcasters aren't giving up the fight. PBS, Univision and our parent company, Fox, are turning to appeal a recent decision allowing (INAUDIBLE) to stream network content over this antennas. A panel of judges earlier this month ruled AREO (ph) doesn't violate broadcaster's copyrights. AREO (PH) just currently in the New York City area but hopes to expand to 22 markets later this year.</p><p>We got more to come this hour. Just getting started, including an answer to the question, should you discuss your pay at work? Are you kidding me? And imagine seeing this the next time you go get cash. We're taking an inside look into the future of your ATM. Take a look at that. It's coming up.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>WILLIS: Tonight, I have the ATM of the future right here next to me, this machine. We are going to show you what it does in just a minute.</p><p>But first, I want to welcome Raja Bose, senior director for Diebold, the company that developed this machine. Now, Rajah, I thought Diebold made safes.</p><p>RAJA BOSE, DIEBOLD SENIOR DIRECTOR: Well, actually we have had a long history. We've been in the business for 150 years. And security is still a major part of our business. But 40 years ago we moved in the ATM business. But now we provide banks and credit unions around the world ATMs and self-service devices.</p><p>WILLIS: And consumers are changing in what they want out of these machines. How are you guys responding?</p><p>BOSE: Well, you know, we have done a lot of research in this, in the space. What consumers want more and more is they want additional convenience. They want to be able to access their bank, anytime, anywhere, anyhow. But at the same time they also want the ability to maintain that personal connection that they with their bankers. It's their money and it matters to them.</p><p>WILLIS: Listen, you know, what is so interesting about what you're doing, I don't think I have talked to a teller in two years, but today you're going to help me talk to a teller, right?</p><p>BOSE: Exactly. At the ATM, not in the branch.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Well, show me this machine.</p><p>BOSE: Sure. So what you have here is a standard ATM.</p><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p>BOSE: It's got a video camera here as well.</p><p>WILLIS: Right here.</p><p>BOSE: Right here actually and what this does, is everything that a normal ATM does.</p><p>WILLIS: OK.</p><p>BOSE: But at the same time this allows you to have a two-way video conversation. So shall I walk you through it.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p>BOSE: All right.</p><p>WILLIS: Put your card in.</p><p>BOSE: Put the card in. All right.</p><p>WILLIS: I'm going to put in my number. OK.</p><p>BOSE: OK. Put in your number.</p><p>WILLIS: All right.</p><p>BOSE: What you see here now -- this thing that you a certificate of deposit that is maturing. Now you can do one of two things. You can actually have a conversation with a video representative or can ignore it and move on to your transaction.</p><p>WILLIS: Look, you know, I didn't even know that. I'm going to say, yes, \"I want to know and boy, here's a lot of information -</p><p>BOSE: Right.</p><p>WILLIS: On different CDs that I can sign up for. Oh, my gosh.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi, Gerri. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WILLIS: I'm good, Jennifer.</p><p>WILLIS: Hey, I see there is a lot of information here on a CD. I could get different kind of rates, the maturities. I think that probably what I want to do is just roll over into the same kind of CD I have before. Can I do that?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely. E-mail us. I can send you a confirmation.</p><p>WILLIS: Oh, I'd love that. Thank you. Nice to meet you, Jennifer. You're looking mighty pretty today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thank you, Gerri. Have a good day.</p><p>BOSE: In addition to this, what we can also do is you can ask another question, if you wanted to you. So for example, we lost Jennifer actually but if you want to even ask about -- a check that you sent on (INAUDIBLE) clear and she can answer that question for you as well.</p><p>WILLIS: That is what I like. Because, for example, you're putting in $500, some kind of check and you want to know when this is all going to clear. You just hit a button, talk to a teller and find that out pronto without even having to walk really into the bank office.</p><p>BOSE: Exactly. In the past, you have to go to the branch, stand in line, wait to talk to a teller. And now you can do that instantaneously. So we think from a consumer's perspective it is a much better experience that the banks can provide.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, it occurs to me that banks are using these ATMs in the first place it allow them to save money on tellers. But now we're bringing the teller back. Is that demand from consumers? Why are we doing that?</p><p>BOSE: Again, going back to what I said before, consumers really like the personal connection with the people in the bank. And so, while they want the added convenience of a quick conversation like this, this does not mean that tellers are going away. They're just going to be doing different things. They're going to be doing more value-added services and not doing transactions for you, helping you with your finances, solving complex problems.</p><p>WILLIS: I hope they don't sell me too many products. I got to tell you, I got enough of that. But tell me this, when will I start seeing it at my city.</p><p>BOSE: Well, you know, we're working with a number of institutions today and they've received very positive results. So we would expect the next six to nine months, you're going to hear a lot more about this in the marketplace.</p><p>WILLIS: Rolling out everywhere and I got to tell you, it's really easy to use.</p><p>BOSE: It is.</p><p>WILLIS: I mean this is any example and we are just seeing really the early versions of this. It's going to be easy to use and we will be able to help you out with your financial issues.</p><p>BOSE: Well, exactly. And one of the stories that I like to say is that my parents talk to my kids on my tablet on video all the time. So now seeing someone on video is not a foreign concept anymore. People, consumers are getting increasingly comfortable with this.</p><p>WILLIS: Raja, thank you for coming on. It's great to see you.</p><p>BOSE: Thank you very much.</p><p>WILLIS: Interesting product. Really fun to see. Thank you.</p><p>BOSE: Thank you for having us.</p><p>WILLIS; Way cool.</p><p>Well, later in the show, figuring out your frequent-flier miles is no easy task. We got tips to making the most out of your miles. And is talking about your pay at work still taboo. More and more people saying no. Believe it or not. But how do you do that? Answers after the break.</p><p>WILLIS: How do you discuss your pay with co-workers? My answer, you don't. But some are saying it is not taboo anymore. Unbelievable. Details next.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Should you discuss your pay with co-workers? Apparently there are people out there who think this is a good idea. So how do you do that? Joining me now Rusty Rueff, career and workplace expert at Glassdoor. Rusty, I got to tell you, I can think of few things that are a worse idea than talking to your co-workers about what kind of money you make. You say it makes sense. Why?</p><p>RUSTY REUFF, GLASSDOOR CAREER AND WORKPLACE EXPERT: Well, we are in a different age, Gerri. We're in the age of transparency, and we got a younger generation that is becoming, well, behind you and me, we're pretty used to sharing everything on social media. And so pay, while it's a tough conversation to have, they're comfortable with it.</p><p>WILLIS: So you're telling me I'm old and I'm just not with it and if I was smart I would be sharing my pay. Here are my questions. OK. So if I am sharing my pay with co-workers, how do I know they're even telling me the truth. I mean, I would lie if my co-worker came to me and said \"Gerri, I'm making twice where you are and here is the number.\" I'd say, \"You're wrong. I'm making more than you.\" I would never tell them the truth. Why would you expect your co-workers to tell you the truth about pay?</p><p>REUFF: Well, I think you're also demanding or looking at trust there as well. And so I mean, that's one of the things we always say is you know, don't talk to someone you don't really trust because that could backfire on you. And you know, know your own motivation anyway. It's not about bragging. It's not about comparing yours versus mine. It's about learning and better educating yourself on what's going on with pay (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Learning and educating, but Rusty to what end? Why am I asking my co-workers for how much money they make?</p><p>REUFF: Because -</p><p>WILLIS: How can I use that to my advantage?</p><p>REUFF: Yes, because really pay practices and companies are a bit like a black hole of knowledge.</p><p>WILLIS: That's true.</p><p>REUFF: Companies don't necessarily inform us well enough about that. And so you're trying to figure out what do I need to know to best be equip to have this conversation with my manager about my pay in the future.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, what would you think? Because your web site and others like Payscale, they put out averages for pay for different vocations all over the country. They tell people what the averages are. So if your goal is to get your pay to go higher and you plan to negotiate with your boss, wouldn't it be just as good, if not better to get to one of these web sites and get a number and walked in and say, \"Hey look, I'm 5,000 under the average?\"</p><p>REUFF: Yes, no doubt. Look, the conversation with your peers does not have to be the first conversation that you have to have. I mean we now are in this age a of transparency and we have sites like Glassdoor and others that you can do that. But I also think that it is -- because the one size fits one. Every company has got different ways of paying, understanding about what is going on around you that helps you be equipped for that conversation.</p><p>WILLIS: I'm still not.</p><p>REUFF: The other thing I would ask you, Gerri, you know -- you probably wouldn't share your pay but would you share it anonymously for the up-and-coming young journalists who some day is saying, you know, do I want to be, an anchor on Fox Business News. I think that would be very valuable for someone to know.</p><p>WILLIS: I don't' know that I would do that either. It is an interesting question though. It's an interesting question and I think that the information, if you can get it, is valuable, obviously, to your negotiation right. I mean, absolutely true. No question about it.</p><p>REUFF: That's right.</p><p>WILLIS: But the idea that you and your buddies at the coffee clash could sit around and share this information and you can rely on it for negotiation to me seems a little, I don't know, like, I wouldn't rely on it. I have friends there work.</p><p>REUFF: Yes, well I don't think it has to be perfect.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>REUFF: I think look, you're looking for ranges and you're trying to get a direction in the way your pay should go when you're having the conversation. The thing is is that you know, we are very used to having a one-way conversation, we're used to sitting down and our boss telling us what our pay increase is going to be. It's an uncomfortable conversation the other way to have that dialogue. And so being better equipped -</p><p>WILLIS: But the last thing I'm going to say (INAUDIBLE) that conversation is you know, \"Dora told me she is making this amount.\" You know, just think that -- your web site and others do have valid information about competitive pay. Rusty, come back. Maybe you can convince me next time.</p><p>REUFF: OK. Well, you probably don't have to talk about your own pay. You got somebody that can talk for you which is, you know, will be great if we all had that but we don't.</p><p>WILLIS: Rusty, thanks.</p><p>REUFF: You're welcome. Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, we want to talk a little bit about the stories that are trending tonight on Fox Business.com</p><p>Number one, countries with high unemployment. Europe is topping the list. The unemployment rate in Spain and Greece, over 26 percent. Small business owners want to change Obamacare. Of course they do. They are currently lobbying Congress for a fix. And Millenia will start throwing tradition out the window. Young couples are buying homes before they're even getting married and that's what's hot right now on FoxBusiness.com</p><p>Coming up, is using your smart phone GPS the case of distracted driving? We'll have the defendant in a shocking court case, next. You will want to see that.</p><p>And we try to clear up any confusion when it comes to your frequent- flier miles. Easy ways to find out how many you have and how not to waste. Coming up, next.</p><p>WILLIS: Confusion is in the air when it comes to people's frequent flier miles, nearly two thirds of Americans collect them and yet 73 percent have no clue how many they have. What's worse 25 percent of fliers are letting their miles go to waste altogether.</p><p>Joining me now with tips to maximize your Frequent Flyer miles, Rick Seaney, CEO of Farecompare.com. Rick, thanks for coming back on the show. It's always good to see you.</p><p>RICK SEANEY, CEO FARECOMPARE.COM: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: Why are people so confuse about this stuff?</p><p>SEANEY: Because it's confusing. It's a virtual currency. You get these points you don't know really what they are worth. You have an environment right now where there's no empty middle seats. So it is hard to redeem so the question is are they worth anything? And I think that's and there's so many different sources, credit card points, brand airline points, hotel points. It all gets a little bit confusing from time to time.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, 41 percent of people said they don't understand how the programs work and yet I know that you can tell us how to maximize these miles. Tell me how I can tract them first?</p><p>SEANEY: Yes, I mean there is a couple of companies, onepoints.com that can track many of the most popular ones, a lot of the companies that were logging in to your different accounts have been cut off by the airlines now. So, you have to really go through pointstock.com if you want to do most of them, or you can have to track them by hand. But that's the thing I use particularly. But I don't have a lot of accounts, I tend to try to accumulate my accounts in a couple of different areas. You're talking about a person as a 12 year-old daughter that has over 4,000 air miles that we use from time to time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: That's amazing. Now, you've got a good website for us, Wiretrack.com. What do they do there?</p><p>SEANEY: Yes, so they basically are going to track your different points, you can different - you can make it actually do a variety of points and management for you, they can look at different things, they can look at your emails from time to time. So, these types of sites can help. The airlines don't like them, they want you to do things - everything separately, credit-card companies don't want to give out - because in general you have to give out your user name and password for these things. Not a great thing to do, unless you trust the company that's doing it for you.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, that is a very good point, my friend. Let's talk about how you can maximize these miles? When to redeem? You've got actually sort of a world view on this, which I think is great. So, my ...</p><p>SEANEY: Yeah, I'm going to talk about my personal ...</p><p>WILLIS: Yeah, go ahead.</p><p>SEANEY: ... my personal experience - yeah, I know. I like to redeem them for number one, for last-minute emergencies.</p><p>WILLIS: Yeah.</p><p>SEANEY: Sometimes, a business trip I have to take sometimes, it's four - that is when a ticket costs $1,000. And that's when I want to use my miles. Second of all, I'd like to use them for upgrades and maybe very special trips, like, for example, I used my miles recently on a trip to go with my wife to Beijing and first class, for example, to do that. Once-in- a-lifetime trip to Beijing. So, it depends on your particular strategy, but the bottom line is that I have a break point for domestic tickets, if your ticket prices over $416 used points, if it's under that pay cash.</p><p>WILLIS: Oh, that's great. So, domestic round-trip under what - $460?</p><p>SEANEY: 460 and pay cash. If it's over that - consider using your points.</p><p>WILLIS: Coast-to-coast, that number is 525, you say? And four - if you want to make?</p><p>SEANEY: Yeah, a little bit more for Hawaii, yeah.</p><p>WILLIS: A little bit more for Hawaii. Hey, Rick, thanks for coming on tonight. It's always good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>SEANEY: I appreciate it. You too.</p><p>WILLIS: All right, no mapping while driving. It's a novel court case hitting up the web after a judge ruled our next guest violated the law when he used his smartphone map to navigate. Here to tell us his story, Steven Spriggs, a professional development officer at Fresno State University. Steve, thanks for coming on tonight.. Great to see you.</p><p>STEVEN SPRIGGS, FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY: Glad to be here.</p><p>WILLIS: Tell us, if you would, your basic story. What happened?</p><p>SPRIGGS: Well, I was driving down the freeway in a middle lane and traffic came to a stop because of construction and I reached over to grab my iPhone and punched a couple of buttons, brought up the map to see if I could find a different way home. Police officer, California highway patrol had stopped his motorcycle as I was stopped, right next to me, I was started to see him looking in my window, directing me to the side of the road to issuing me a citation.</p><p>WILLIS: Now, you say he shouldn't have stopped you because you were only looking at the map, right?</p><p>SPRIGGS: Well, I say the law doesn't apply in this case, because the law applies to talking or listening on the cellphone and I was doing neither.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, is it - so, does the of language actually say talking or listening?</p><p>SPRIGGS: Yes, the language in the law is very clear, it's less than 50 words long, it's very clear. It was instituted in 2009 and it basically outlawed using a cellphone while driving. It was so precise that two years later, they had to pass a second law to outlaw texting, but the local judges have interpreted this law to include all uses of that box that we call a cell phone.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SPRIGGS: While driving.</p><p>WILLIS: So you got a ticket for 160 bucks. You still were not happy, you wanted to fight it, I understand you wrote your own appellate brief. Where does this whole thing stand now?</p><p>SPRIGGS: Well, I wrote the appellate brief ticket to the three judge panel in Fresno County, they issued a decision that basically said I lost and expanded the definition of using a cell phone while driving to basically holding that box while you are in a car. I have been very fortunate a local law firm, McCormick Brisco, has agreed to take over the case for me pro bono and see if we might be able to get this to the fifth district to see if they can review the case. It is a bad decision that expands the law how the law was never intended.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, I want you - I've got that judge's ruling, a portion, small part of it that I want to read and then you can say what you think. This is what the judge said in the ruling.</p><p>\"The primary evil sought to be avoided, this is destruction that the driver faces when using his or her hands to operate the phone. That destruction would be present, whether the wireless telephone was being used as the telephone, a GPS navigator, a clock or a device for sending and receiving text messages and emails. So, what do you make of that? Because he's saying it doesn't really matter, whether you were talking or texting or listening, what matters is that you got that phone is in front of your face and it was distracting you from driving.</p><p>SPRIGGS: I fully agree with the judge's statement that using that cellphone while you're in the car is a distracting item. There is - we are all distracted all the time when we are driving, there is thousands of things, from birds to kids to other cars. Our job is to be sure that we do not let our distractions interfere in our driving. I didn't let that interfere. I was not unsafe. I was not weaving across lanes, I wasn't accelerating when I should not have. It was - I object to the expansion of the law to this extent. I firmly believe that we need to have stronger enforcement of distracted driving. My son is a victim of a distracted driver who was using his cell phone, cut across three lanes of traffic and took out my son in a bike lane. My son is going to have pain for the rest of his life. This is his leg. I firmly believe we need to enforce these laws, I just believe that this law was not intended to be enforced in this way.</p><p>WILLIS: All right, well, Steven, thank you for coming on. And I appreciate your time. It's an interesting debate. I have got to tell you I can see the judge's point, but I am sympathetic to you as well. Thank you.</p><p>SPRIGGS: Thanks for your time.</p><p>WILLIS: Interesting, right? Well, while you can argue looking at a map on your phone, isn't that distracting? There are lots of other things that people do while driving that isn't advised. That was this tonight's top five. Number five, picking your nose. You know that's distracting, and while it's distracting to other drivers around you - because we can see you, you know. And number for watching TV or reading. With all that newfangled technology in cars, drivers often have access to TVs on their dashboards, big mistake and you should also put down the Kindle II, OK? Number three, we all do it, singing and dancing. What is wrong with that? I sort of like this one. You can do it with your hands on the wheel and then there is no problem, right? Number two, eating. It is called a drive through, not an eat while you drive. Pull over to eat your french fries. Or better yet wait till you get home. And the number one thing people do in the car besides driving, is put on makeup. Ladies, we're all guilty of this, I have a producer who said she used to put on makeup while driving a standard car, so she was shifting. Just be ready before you leave the house or make him drive.</p><p>When we come back, Lou Dobbs gives us his take on a big day in D.C. and we'll tell you why it's a big day for New York sports fans. \"Today in Business\" comes up after the break. Don't go away.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, the corps of Democrats fed up with Obamacare is growing louder. Now, another senior senator who helped write the law and has supported it, stunned the administration at a routine budget hearing. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MAX BAUCUS, (D), MONTANA: I just see a huge train wreck coming down - you and I discussed this many times. I don't see any results yet. What can you do that to help all these people around the country - what in the world do I do? I don't know what to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: A train wreck. That's what Baucus says, and he faces a tough reelection next year in a state that has shown its skepticism about Obamacare. In response, Health and Humane Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius did what this White House always does - she blamed everything on the Republicans. Meanwhile, senators are formally unveiling their compromised immigration bill today. The Gang of Eight plan has support from business executives, religious leaders, activists and others, but is that enough to get something through this do nothing Senate? Let's bring in Lou Dobbs. Lou?</p><p>LOU DOBBS, \"LOU DOBBS TONIGHT\" HOST: Gerri, how are you?</p><p>WILLIS: I'm very good.</p><p>DOBBS: And the idea that we suddenly have an immigration plan that's just going to sail right through the Senate and onto the House and the president will sign it, is running into early obstacles, including the fact that somebody did not figure out what the real cost of this plan would be. We're hearing numbers, Gerri, now. We know about the 17 billion that the Gang of Eight has provided everybody. But Senator Sessions and others have pointed out that there will also be cost for the social for the social safety net that comes with living in America. They are projecting that those who go through the 13 year period, who do become citizens and these are - remember, low-skilled and for the most part, lower educated immigrants coming into this country and finding a pathway to citizenship, they're estimating the cost to be somewhere between two and four and a half trillion dollars, that's unfunded liabilities, plus the direct cost of Medicare and Medicaid, and for the number of over 11 million people who would be affected with this program, plus, of course, those that they bring in from those families are to join - to join them in this country. In some cases there was family members already here, as you know, Gerri.</p><p>So I mean it's really a staggering issue, and it's one of those things that has got to be sorted out in the markup and the hearings into this, and what normally would happen, as it did back in the mid '80s when they took up amnesty, they had over 100 hours of hearings, they had 300 witnesses, the American people had a voice, if they wanted it to be heard. Pat Leahy, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee is saying, we think maybe one will do you (inaudible) fine. We're going to have Trey Gowdy on tonight. By the way, it's the top of the hour. In about 15 minutes the Congressman - Congressman Trey Gowdy is one of the best informed, one of the finest public servants in the country and we are really looking forward to bringing him to our audience. Because, as I say, he is relentlessly knowledgeable and concerned about the national interest.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, that's sometimes rare among elected officials.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>So, I'm glad you found one of them, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, we've got one or two.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DOBBS: And he's certainly amongst them.</p><p>WILLIS: Thank you, sir, good to see you.</p><p>DOBBS: Good to see you, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS: I appreciate your time, have a great show.</p><p>DOBBS: You too, thanks.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, it was on this business day back in 1923, the original Yankee Stadium opened in the Bronx, more than 70,000 baseball fans, that was a lot back then, bought tickets for $1.10 and watched the Yankees beat the Red Sox four to one. At the time, stadium was hailed as a one-of-a- kind facility in the country for its size costing $2.5 million to build. That was big time back then. After 6,000 regular season home games, the Yankee moved across the street in 2009 to their brand new 1.5 billion - I couldn't even get that word out - billion dollar home. Today, Yankee Stadium is the most expensive baseball stadium ever built and it's the second most expensive stadium of any kind after Metlife in New Jersey, but it was today, April 18th, the original Yankee Stadium opened for its first home game 90 years ago. I bet you don't remember that.</p><p>Still to come, 2013 has not been kind to Apple investors as the stock folks, the new record lows, will the shine on the world's biggest tech company ever come back? Stay with us.</p><p>WILLIS: Coming up, Apple stock falling below 400 bucks for the first time since 2011. Is there any hope left for Apple investors? Find out after the break.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, we've got a few big earnings reports coming out tomorrow that are going to probably move the market. McDonald's and G.E among the bigger ones to watch. No major economic news expected, but we will be waiting to hear what Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has to say. He'll be speaking on the state of the global economy at a conference in D.C.. Also in Washington tomorrow, the postmaster general Tom Donahoe will present the agency's new five-year business plan if it lasts that long. In the report to Congress today, Donahoe said the post office is losing $25 million a day. Wow.</p><p>Well, on the stock it was the must-own stock of 2012, not anymore. Apple's $700 days are long gone. Today it dipped below 400 bucks, a 42 percent drop from its all-time high. Rob Morgan, chief investment strategist for Fulcrum Securities joins me now. Good to have you back, you know, somebody on our air says something really interesting about Apple stock - you know, back when it was trading at the nosebleed levels he said that about 30 percent of that stock price was just sheer love. People loving that brand, maybe irrationally, and just pumping up the price of that stock. Do you agree?</p><p>ROB MORGAN, FULCRUM SECURITIES CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST: Well, sure. I mean any time a stock has a run like Google, I think - I think there's some high (inaudible) of loving in it.</p><p>WILLIS: You mean Apple?</p><p>MORGAN: I'm sorry, yeah, Apple. But and when I was on your show in January of last year we put Apple on our top-ten list, we wrote it up, got out of it in December at 5:15. So, we didn't get out of it at the top, either.</p><p>But at the same time, you know, during the break or before the break you were asking the question is there any hope for Apple investors right now? And the expectations have come down so much. There is definitely no love in the stock right now.</p><p>WILLIS: Are you a buyer here? You are a buyer here.</p><p>MORGAN: No, it's still too early in my book ...</p><p>WILLIS: OK.</p><p>MORGAN: For individuals running a performance account, it's still too early, but for a long-term investor who can weather the dead money period, which is going to last for a while, it is very cheap. So, and it does have some compelling --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: It is cheap, you know, it's trading at nine times EPS. But I've got to tell you - maybe be it's cheap for a reason.</p><p>MORGAN: Well, they, you know, there is - I guess as far as the management team goes with Steve Jobs passing away, they still have to prove themselves, there is still some skepticism there, but they've got - aside from the fact that you and I talk about how Samsung is eating their lunch in one area, obviously ...</p><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p>MORGAN: They still have a pretty good compelling broad product line.</p><p>WILLIS: Yeah, and they still have people who adore everything they put out.</p><p>MORGAN: Yeah, absolutely.</p><p>WILLIS: There's another impact, though, that I want to talk to you about. And that's how it impacts the rest of the market, because at one point Apple was so big that any tiny little movement in the share price would swing, the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq composite, but now it's losing that. If you look at, for example, the Nasdaq 100, Apple gains (ph) are 12.1 percent of that index, the Nasdaq Composite eight percent, the S&amp;P 500 2.8 percent. So, this stock - its influence diminishing here.</p><p>MORGAN: Yeah, absolutely. And I think another - the flip side of that, too, is that once the stock gets big enough where it dominates in index, you know, Apple here, or G.E in the past, with the S&amp;P 500, or Cisco back in the - back in the late '90s, with the tech bubble. That's a good sign that maybe it's time to bail out as well.</p><p>WILLIS: Google, Microsoft, IBM, all reporting earnings tonight after the bell. You know, there has been a lot of big questions about technology. Have these stock been oversold?</p><p>MORGAN: You know, I don't think they have necessarily been oversold. And for one thing, you know, with these - and I've talked about this before, you know, these big cap multinationals, and, of course, it was three big tech companies today, you know, the dollar has been moving up a bit, that's one reason I suggested the shift to the smaller cap companies, but I think - I think the earnings expectations for these tech companies got a little - a little out of line to the high side, that made the stocks expensive, and, of course, now that we're seeing this shift into more defensive stocks, and tech stocks are cyclical and not defensive, that is another reason why they're taking a hit. So, I - you know, I wouldn't necessarily - my overweights on financials and consumer staples, not technology. I don't think they are cheap enough yet to buy the overall ....</p><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, I relate to you on one level here, because you're talking about what's cheap, right? You know, remember when we used to pick value plays all the time? Remember when people talked about value ...</p><p>MORGAN: Oh, yeah.</p><p>WILLIS: Instead of just throwing, you know, darts at a board?</p><p>MORGAN: Where do you think the value is in the market right now?</p><p>WILLIS: Well, I think, you know, I think it's - I think it's still in financials, because it's still, you know, they've got beaten up so bad and yes, they have done pretty well, but they have a long way to go and right now, at least, and financials, I think, is probably a longer term secular trend, consumer staples from an earnings, and technical standpoint, at least, for right now also look - So I guess, that - those of the two sectors I like, I'd say financials probably a longer term play, consumer staples may be more in the shorter run.</p><p>WILLIS: Consumer staples. That seems like a weird part of the economic cycle ...</p><p>MORGAN: I know. Hey, you talk about McDonald's - you talk about McDonald's reporting tomorrow. I mean it's, you know, it's ...</p><p>WILLIS: Right there. All right.</p><p>MORGAN: There will be a bellwether, you know.</p><p>WILLIS: Rob, thanks for coming on. Interesting stuff. Really appreciate your time.</p><p>MORGAN: Thanks, Gerri.</p><p>We will be right back with the answer to our question of the day, do you trust the government with your personal data? We're going to find out. Stay with us.</p><p>WILLIS: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is paying banks, credit agencies and even mortgage companies for info about you. They say, as a way, to protect you. Do you trust the government with your personal data? Here's what you're posting on a Facebook page. Sandy said this: \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sounds like a contradiction in terms to me, gathering my private information does not protect me from the government, government is now in every aspect of our lives.\" And just says this, short but good, he says: \"I don't trust the government with a ham sandwich.\" Love that. All right.</p><p>We also asked the question on gerriwillis.com. Nobody said \"yes', all of you said, a 100 percent said no, we do not trust the government with our personal data. I can't blame you there. Log onto Gerriwillis.com for our online question every weekday.</p><p>And finally tonight, Uncle Sam is putting you to work an extra five days this year just to pay off your taxes. Today is Tax Freedom Day, the day when Americans have earned enough money to pay off their total tax bill for the whole year. This break even point has been pushed back every year since President Obama took office. The tax foundation, that is, says you pay more in taxes this year than you've spent on food. clothing and housing combined. Americans work 40 days on average to pay off federal, state, and local income taxes for a grand total of $4 trillion. Right. The new payroll taxes require another 24 days of work, plus 15 days for sales and excise taxes, 12 days for property taxes and nine days for corporate income taxes. And what about our federal budget deficit? Well, you'll have to work until May 9th to close that gap. Look, if you want to jumpstart the economy, why don't you take your hands out of the cookie jar?
