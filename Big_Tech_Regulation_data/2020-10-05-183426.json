Necessity being the mother of invention, consumers rapidly reset their lives around digit...</p><p>Anecdotal evidence has shown that the digitization of consumer habits began the day stay-at-home orders effectively shut down in-person interaction in the real world.   Necessity being the mother of invention, consumers rapidly reset their lives around digital across the board \u2014 from working to shopping to learning to managing their financial lives online. But Ondot Systems Vice President of Customer Success Balu Kikkeri told PYMNTS that evidence of that great digital shift is now visible not only anecdotally, but in the data as well.   He said research has shown that as of June, 17 percent of senior citizens were logging into their financial accounts via smartphones at least once a week. And the share of digitized consumers only goes up as ages go down. That number climbs to 38 percent among baby boomers, 74 percent for Generation Xers and 85 percent for millennials and Generation Z consumers.   Kikkeri said this is the highest penetration that mobile banking has ever seen among consumers. And for financial institutions (FIs), that translates into an incredible opportunity to build better digital banking journeys for their customers.   But an opportunity is only as good as the bank\u2019s ability to pursue it. Kikkeri said that\u2019s why FIs must consider how to leverage their FinTech partnerships and push to market the digital services that customers have become habituated to in the past six months.   \u201cConsumers are expected to be able to undertake digital journeys that are truly self-service,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, if I should lose my card, I should be able [to] get a replacement, get it instantly pushed to my digital wallet and be able to activate it instantly online.\u201d   But the playing field to providing those services to increasingly digitized consumers is getting both more crowded and more competitive, Kikkeri said, and banks need to build partnerships to deliver on consumers\u2019 emerging needs, or risk being disrupted right out of the game by Big Tech players who will.   Getting Ready To Fight Off Apple And Google   Kikkeri said the pandemic\u2019s shift in consumer behavior isn\u2019t the only big change to the market that has recently appeared on the horizon. He said FIs are also increasingly feeling competitive pressure from the Apples and Googles of the world, which have begun moving quickly into the segment and applying lots of pressure on incumbent players.   \u201c Apple and Google are bringing a new level of user experience to banking and payments that did not exist before now,\u201d Kikkeri said. \u201cThey're clearly shaking up the industry, as they are teaching consumers to really expect convenience and simplicity.\u201d   He added that while convenience and simplicity both sound like easy and obvious goals, providing them in a secure manner to customers across any and all channels isn\u2019t.   That\u2019s where FinTechs can come in. However, Kikkeri said FIs should consider the robustness of potential FinTech partners\u2019 offerings. Is something geared toward transactions across multiple channels? Does the FI understand the FinTech\u2019s ecosystem beyond simple licensing requirements? Is a given FinTech looking ahead to technology shifts to things like real-time transaction cards? What is the process implementation period like?   \u201cAny new technology requires an initial output of funds,\u201d Kikkeri noted. \u201cSo, when working with partners, it is about finding a robust infrastructure in the cloud that scales as the customers\u2019 needs increase overtime.\u201d   A Better System Benefits Everyone   Kikkeri added that it\u2019s important to keep in mind the many ways that improving the customer journey also improves the bank\u2019s experience in provisioning services to consumers.   For example, Kikkeri said that the simple upgrade of improving the transaction data that customers see on their digital card statements can take pressure off of an FI\u2019s call center.   \u201cIf a customer sees a transaction labeled as going to \u2018RBX Idaho,\u2019 it leaves them wondering if they have ever been to Idaho, and [they] have no idea what \u2018RBX\u2019 means,\u201d he said. \u201cThat confusion will often make them call a call center to find out what's going on. On the other hand, if that same statement reflects a Redbox kiosk near their home, it won\u2019t merit a call now. They remember the purchase.\u201d   Kikkeri said such self-service solutions can also reduce pressure on call centers. For instance, a customer who can report and replace a lost card in-app without a stopover on the phone will often jump at the opportunity.   He said that means banks need to consider how to partner with FinTechs to build those services and push them to market quickly. Customers are looking to make connections with providers that have risen to and exceeded the challenge of digitization.   \u201cRight now, what banks need to be considering is how they can offer services to their customer outside what they would normally do with banking and loan products,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is going to be what is truly helping as we move forward over the next 18 to 24 months.\u201d   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    LIVE PYMNTS TV OCTOBER SERIES: POWERING THE DIGITAL SHIFT \u2013 B2B PAYMENTS 2021      Banks, corporates and even regulators now recognize the imperative to modernize \u2014 not just digitize \u2014the infrastructures and workflows that move money and data between businesses domestically and cross-border.

I set a date of around September 15th, at which point it will be out of business in the United States. But over in China, social media has been evolving in a different way. Earlier this year, before the pandemic took hold, Stephen Beckett went to Beijing to meet some of the major players in the Chinese social media landscape. </p><p>China, with its huge population of over 1.3 billion people has plenty of room for social ideas. And the competition is intense. These are the head offices of Kuaishou, they're one of the biggest social networks here, they've got over 200 million active users, but unless you're in China, you probably haven't heard of it. Kuaishou has made a name for itself by targeting China's relatively-untapped rural population, and that's a lot of people - around 40% don't live in cities. And that has led to a platform where the stars aren't necessarily what you'd expect. Kuaishou's secret sauce is the options it gives streamers to make their streams pay. TRANSLATION: I'm a professional musician. I also give lectures via Kuaishou in my spare time, which teach people how to play the Chinese sorna. I try to popularise Chinese traditional music and knowledge. Between sales of recorded lessons, purchases of virtual gifts during livestreams, he says he makes around #15,000 a month, and that is after Kuaishou takes their 25% commission. But Kuaishou's 200 million users isn't quite so impressive when you compare it to China's social titan Tencent, and their so-called mega app WeChat. And now WeChat is becoming a daily part of life, thanks to something called Mini-Programs. TRANSLATION: WeChat Mini-Programs are an app that doesn't require you to download and install, they are sub-applications within the WeChat ecosystem, and a new tool developed by WeChat. Many programmes allow third parties to add new features to WeChat on demand. It's a bit like having the entire App Store already on your phone. The idea is that you can pretty much do everything you could ever want on your phone without ever closing WeChat. These vending machines are set up to use WeChat's new facial pay feature. The idea is you opt into it in the app and once you've done that, you can use your face to buy anything from these machines. It basically links your face to your face to your WeChat account and your government ID. But, is the convenience worth the possible cost to privacy? In 2016, Amnesty International awarded the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, zero out of 100 for their privacy practices. I think there's a common perception that people in China don't care about their privacy, and that perception is completely false. The government over the last few years has been trying to roll out its own cybersecurity regulations and trying to educate consumers about the dangers of data being lost or leaked. WeChat's privacy policy says it will provide the Chinese government access to much of what you do in the app when legally required, including the things you type and data like your location. It's hard to deny that social apps in China have taken on a life of their own, if not outpacing, then going in new directions to competitors in the West. The big question is whether more Chinese apps can follow TikTok in going global, despite the concerns around privacy and censorship. That was Stephen Beckett's view of China. And since the explosion of TikTok in the West, other apps have been springing up to try and compete. And Chris Fox has been looking at some of the alternatives that are available. If you can't get enough of short, hyper-edited videos, luckily there are plenty of apps that have cottoned on to the format. This is Triller, which I think is fair to say, has taken a bit of inspiration from TikTok. You can record clips with special effects and share them onto an endless scrolling feed of content. Triller seems to have done quite well out of all this uncertainty, at the start of August, it topped the app store charts on both iOS and Android and has managed to attract some big-name TikTok stars and celebrities over to its platform, including Mike Tyson and magician Dynamo. Another app offering a similar experience is Byte, which has also been popping in and out of the App Store top download charts. Like TikTok, it offers you creative effects for your videos, although it is trailing behind Triller, it's been downloaded over 1 million times on Google Play, whereas Triller has had more than ten million. Tiktok's biggest competition may come from Instagram Reels, Instagram's newly-launched rival.

We'll be taking a look at tomorrow morning's papers in a moment. First, the headlines. The Prime Minister pledges two-and-a-half billion pounds to create ten-thousand new prison places - and says all police forces will be given extended stop and search powers. </p><p>The FBI is investigating the death of the multi-millionaire businessman and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his New York prison cell. Police in Hong Kong fire tear gas at pro-democracy protesters in the tenth consecutive weekend of anti-government demonstrations. An 18-year-old man who got into difficulty in the sea off the Essex coast has died - days after his teenage sister lost her life in the same incident. Hello and welcome to our look ahead to what the the papers will be bringing us tomorrow. With me are journalist and author, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown and former Conservative advisor, Mo Hussein. Many of tomorrow's front pages are already in. The i leads on a story we've covered today - Boris Johnson's promise to expand stop-and-search powers. Drug lords are luring children as young as seven into crime, by offering them free food - that's according to the Metro. Banker job cuts make the front page of the Financial Times. It says almost 30,000 job losses globally have been announced since April. The Telegraph reports on a Government crackdown on social media which, the paper says, will see tech giants heavily fined for showing harmful videos. And the Guardian reveals that hundreds of people deported from the UK were restrained by methods including shackles and belts. That information was provided to the newspaper after a freedom of information request. So, a varied set of front pages - let's see what our reviewers make of it all. We're going to start off with the Telegraph. Why do you talk us through what it is, tech giants to be fined millions for toxic videos. This seems to be often discussed in government in Whitehall but not really acted upon, action against tech companies for showing videos that are harmful against children or depicting violence, and it will result in, you know, hit the bottom line of these big tech giants, hit it where it hurts, resulting in fines. When I was in the Home Office, we did a lot of work with tech giants, in terms of taking down illegal content, terrorist content, and there was a lot of focus on them coming up with the solutions. It feels like we have now moved on whether government is creating the solution and imposing it upon them. But I think this raises a lot of questions in terms of how it can be enforced, who will watch these videos and decides what is good, what is bad, and the key thing is it has to be international. It doesn't just exist in the UK so where is the international consensus to try and reel with this problem? That's exactly right this is very interesting, though. Quite low down in this story there is an acknowledgement, even in the Telegraph, that this move has been made possible by the legislation set out in EU directive, so the EU certainly has been talking about action -- to talking about taking action for a long time. I personally asked Nick Clegg this March at the Facebook headquarters what they were going to do about this, and he said well, government should be regulating. I said to him, you know very well, exactly what Mo said, a single group of governments aren't as strong as you skies, it has to be much than that. They have been shoving responsivity on to government, will see. Are you vaguely optimistic or pessimistic that this will make a difference? I am optimistic, I think it is quite a big step to take for the government. To actually take this step, along with things like the digital services tax that is meant to be coming in, it is quite significant I think the thing to watch, actually, is what the US reaction will be. Trump has already spoken about attacking, these are American companies being attacked, will this behaviour played to a future trade deal, and how will it impact them? There is more to come. But the issue is very real, it really impacts on people's lives, the live streaming issue, technology can be a wonderful thing but it cannot be without any</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-3a4d3bc31ce6404bbb4f62c28aedcbe1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WSV-V361-DY08-30CJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

But at the briefing with the Prime Minister's posters in this morning, they refuse to discuss any of this it would not confirm or deny whether the Prime Minister agree to disagree with these views and it really was extraordinary way of operating and going back to your point about this culture Dominic Cummings wants to bring in, he wants to move fast and break things. That is what he is doing and they if majority and as you know it is the elected dictatorship you get in Britain if you get a big majority and you can do whatever you want to essentially an Dominic Cummings seems to be coming -- testing that to its destruction here. What it does show is despite having been majority, and a much opposition because they are in leadership contest and Labour, there are still some boundaries and norms having met. </p><p>And because Andrew Sabisky resigned, he had the feeling he was resigning before he was pushed out because all the stuff admin building up today but also the Conservative MPC were starting to say, Caroline notes said today that this is an excitable and people were getting very nervous and just thinking what is going on here and why are we doing this because the fact is the Johnson government does have a big majority in parliament. They have got lots of things they want to do and lots of things they can do so why bring in this guy who has got this very controversial pastor we have now had two days of arguing about whether or not Boris Johnson does or does not support an adviser who believes that black people have lower IQs and what people and who is promoting eugenics in various ways and you could talk about all the policy thinks the government wants to do. So on the power of Dominic Cummings, obviously he is not getting as well everything but we should contrast it with a reshuffle last week where the ousting of the Chancellor and the rise of that was all about Dominic Cummings and Whitehall is littered with people who've underestimated his power and influence celestial think he has still got a lot of influence Number ten. OK with little time left in malaise with a couple of stories from your paper and I'll ask Grace with the first one, no, you because you have written half of it. Indeed I have. Your byline is there. What does it say? David Frost Kim of the cheap rates negotiated for the Prime Minister has given a speech in Brussels tonight and normally they don't get public speeches and he set out in some detail his vision for that trade deal that needs to be struck by the end of this year and in this, he was basically saying the whole fundamental idea behind Brexit and that Prime Minister profit view a Brexit is having the ability to do things differently for that beef you don't understand that, there is not going to be a trade deal and this gets to the big issue which is alignment on rules and regulations. Because the EU wants to lock the UK into that as part of future trade deals and David Frost says we will not do that so it is a very much kind of vision speech setting out where he thinks Brexit should go but I do think it is him doing this because the EU in the first age of Brexit was much clearer and his intentions and the government here was criticised for not being so clear and he has gone out and given a speech about this whole thing about rules and sovereignty is all we are going to hear about when the talks start up again in March. OK, and grace, the story that caught your eye on the front page of the FT, Facebook talks. Part of a long-standing face-off if you will between the big tech giants and the EU because referring to these issues around regulation, using a much stronger approach to regulating what it sees is monopolistic companies especially in the tech sector and prosecuting them over issues around data privacy and things and it has created some tension with the US where most of these companies are headquartered. Which is now kind of Donald Trump taking a bit more of an active stance on pushing back against these regulations which speaks to Sebastian's point about how alignment on rules and regulations and nontariff barriers as they are often referred to is the big battle now in international trade and you will see it with the with the EU and the US. So I think the EU kind of going to Facebook is saying we are going to regulate you more tightly and going to have lungs into discussions about these companies behaviours on taxes and the EU will be coming for these companies and kind of adopting a more social democratic approach of regulation in the way -- like a Brexit is an indication of I think things to come. Just a little while left and Sebastian came about in the front page of the Daily Telegraph and really interesting bit of news in brief with the Chancellor and his</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-067ea40887b348d882dfff8c8196b00d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7F-N4T1-JBH6-C1R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"849\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

If six gets damaged, it can still fly which we thought was amazing, however as you can see right now, it is missing stabilisation, this is quite broken. But perhaps overall the event showed the human flying skills on show were often the deciding factor. It looks so easy because they are so adept at it. </p><p>Your brain does somersaults and it's flicking back the other way and it's all bonkers and the speed with which those drones, they are flying over my head now, the speed with which they make decisions and flips and reverse is just nuts. This is an airborne version of Robot Wars. My kids know nothing of Robot Wars but they will know about this. Both my boys have drones so aerial battling drones, it doesn't get any better. There is a Tesla coil in there, for God's sake. On the fringes of the battlefield, companies in the growing business of taking down drones were showing off their solutions. This system is already operating at a Norwegian airport. It tracks and then identifies drones as a threat before jamming the frequencies used to control them. In a usual environment, when you jam the drone, it will either start hovering and go back to his sender, his operator or it will go down eventually on the battery. It can also jam the global positioning system. The drone will start hovering around, flying around because it doesn't know where it is and eventually it will go down also on its battery. This beast is the drone catcher, making use of radar systems already in the field to get its targets' real-time 3D co-ordinates before automatically flying to the area and lining up its prey. We shoot the net over the drone. We can carry it away with a wire and drop it down with a parachute. And then there is this. The gun emits a powerful electromagnetic beam, knocking out the command and control, video link and GPS frequencies used by the drone. Strict regulations in Europe mean it can't be used here but its Dutch makers told me they are doing good business with governments in the Middle East. Back in the arena, and the final was under way. In the end, it came down to brute force and battery power, with Belgium's Team Slunse flying away with the 30k prize. The Dutch authorities certainly have a more entertaining way of learning how to down rogue drones than standing around and scratching their heads. Now, in some parts of the world it has become pretty commonplace for kids to learn to code, but for those with vision problems, it is still fairly inaccessible so we sent Paul Carter to find out what some of the big tech companies are doing to try and open up coding to children who are blind or partially sighted. And then what happens? I'm just having a word with this naughty pod. Oh, yes. It's trying to run away. This is eight-year-old Ellie. Like many other children her age she is learning how to code. She also happens to be blind. Do you have it on the one you want to happen first? Yeah. Ellie is using a physical, tactile coding language called Code Jumper. Developed by Microsoft, it is a block-based modular system consisting of a series of pods. Each of which contains a single line of code, making up a story, a poem or in this case, a song. _ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream, life is but a dream..._ Coding is by its nature a visual medium and often requires being able to see the whole picture. What makes Code Jumper unique is that it allows blind and partially sighted children to have an overview of their code with their hands. The woman leading the project is Cecily Morrison, a computer scientist at Microsoft's Cambridge research laboratory, who herself has a blind son. For blind and no-vision children specifically, the technologies that were available were not accessible to them, so many children now learn programming, starting at the age of seven, with block-base languages. The other aspect that we should not forget about is that we created this to be available to children regardless of their level of vision so that means that it is available to children who are blind with no vision, it's equally available for children who are sighted. That is one of the things that we were very aware of, is that we did not want to create a technology that isolated the blind or low-vision child at the back of the class, in a different classroom, doing their own thing. We wanted something they could engage with other children, encode together. But Code Jumper is only one solution to the issue of getting children with vision impairment to coding. Some of you are new to Apple iPad accessibility and coding so today we're going to run a session...</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-be5ebc962388479bbe77f80b2eba3654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VR3-8JT1-JBH6-C1KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

I'm not sure how help for that is, it's all retrospective and what the new leader does. Do they move back to the centre in a place occupied by Tony Blair. It's a protest movement with cult trimmings. </p><p>There is this problem of how you can have a Labour leadership contest that can tackle some of the issues that some people argue cause the loss. When the structure for the voting system is such that you are likely to get someone who shares a lot of the ideology that underpinned the big rise to power. There is an element of history repeating itself in more ways than just the fact they got Tony Blair out again. Let's go back on the front page of the FT. We mention it just there, a bit doubtful about whether this can all be wrap up, the new trade deal in 2020. The basic reasoning behind this is that trade deals take a long time, they are very complicated, trade negotiations are as ever intricate. This will be especially intricate because it's a reverse trade negotiation, a decoupling of a very deep economic partnership so the idea that it can be signed, sealed, delivered and enacted is very difficult. You won't find many trade experts find a credible. Whether or not is a different way to have someone coming out saying immediately before the UK government has gotten established, I don't know, it might have been more helpful to have come out after the withdrawal agreement Bill came out on Friday, to reset the relationship and say we've got the deadline, we got the boat coming through on the EU side to try and get it ratified, that might have been the moment to do this because very few people will disagree with Von Der Leyen from a practical point of view. In the last parliament, the government were forced to offer concession to the pro-EU Tories who said we need to have a vote to extend the transition period in July because their argument throughout the election campaign and opposition to the deal is, there is still the chance of a cliff edge exit, we could still leave the EU on WTO terms and we need to make sure Parliament has a way of stopping it and on Friday when the withdrawal agreement Bill comes through, it doesn't include that concession and it's Boris Johnson playing hardball. Things can look very different if we come to July -- July. The Prime Minister knows all too well, the voters who vote in the ballot box, depends on us getting a deal with the EU for many jobs. Let's turn to the other side of the front pages. Maybe they can get Google Assessment, Alexa and Siri, and it looks like Amazon, Google and Apple are going to team up. I love it because unless they achieve some kind of integration, having spent a lot of their prototype stages making sure you can't use the same cable for the same device, the only way to stop it being a house full of stuff that has extra electricity demand and become the Internet of things is to collaborate and allow a level of compatibility. How that will work when it comes to them being arch enemies in terms of intellectual property is fascinating. It's a bit strange that they've had to reassess the fact that it's going to be the Internet so you have to have a shared basis of communication for it to be the Internet of things, you can't have communication between devices unless you think about how they integrate so it's weirdly reinventing the wheel. It's interesting they are collaborating now and doing so very openly at a time when the other story that is being shared on this front page is about big tech regulation so I think there might be a sense of the big boys getting together to see what they can do to try and make a case that they are being more friendly going forward. That is interesting political signalling. The idea of these devices communicating, microwave talking to your fridge,</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-c1bec327990145ada91bbdd0fc780b67</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSF-F091-JBH6-C42X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

In 2016 we saw a disastrous night for social networks, their systems abuse and this information was spread and targeting users in a way that none of the companies really expected. I think the mid-term vote has certainly been a chance for those companies to show that they had learnt the lessons from 2016 and were putting in place measures to prevent it happening again. I have to tell you that are out today I have been monitoring this closely, speaking to experts backtrack this kind of nefarious activity on these networks and they say it does seem that Facebook and Twitter and other networks as well have stood up to this challenge so far, but they stress that this is something that comes almost in two phases at. Phase one has been Tuesday, the day of the vote to stop voter suppression attempts by some of these actors. Tomorrow could be a different picture, particularly, they say, if it is a good night for the Democrats. I have been talking to a man called Alex Stamos, the head of cyber Security at Facebook, he says his biggest worry is that campaigns may have been laying the groundwork to come back on Wednesday and try to delegitimise the result of today's vote. It has been good work so far by these networks, they will be pleased what has happened on Tuesday but on Wednesday the real test will come. We talked to David previously I doubt the regulation of social media in times like this, how much has changed since 2016? There hasn't been much new regulation, lots of hearings to discuss potential regulation and what happens today is going to be seen as a big factor in what those regulations may be copied throughout all of those hearings and I listen to just about all of them, whether it was Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey from Twitter being questioned, the question continually topping up is are you going to be able to protect the US midterms integrity of that vote and the discussion around it.

We could talk Welcome to both of you, thank you so for hours and days about how the media have been covering this in the lead up, but let's talk about what is happening right now online at the moment, in particular looking at Politico, giving their predictions are. What did you make of this? It seems to line up with what a lot of polls have been predict in, including the Economists model, which we have been tracking and adding specific out to. It is still very early and obviously way too close to call, but it is looking like the Democrats will take the lower house and it is looking like Republicans are likely to keep hold of the Senate. This has some pretty serious political ramifications, which we could discuss four days, but it makes life more difficult for <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>There is so much we can discuss in ten minutes.

He ignores the fact that there is no Planet B, that the Earth is our only living planet, she is Gaia, she is alive.</p><p>Musk talked about being emotional during the launch of Space X. Powerful men have 'emotions' for their machines, not for people or other beings. They talk of humans becoming a 'space bearing civilization and a multi-planetary species'.  They are still in denial that we are all earthlings who share life with other beings on the earth, our common home.</p><p>The billionaires who have violated Planetary boundaries and contributed to the destruction of the earth and injustice and inequality in society, seem to want to 'escape' from their humanity and the threat of extinction they helped create.</p><p>As members of the earth community they have the responsibility to care for the earth, not exploit her and when the damage is done, decide to abandon her to colonise other planets.</p><p>With the money Musk is pouring into Space X, millions would be fed and engaged creatively in regenerating the Earth, our common home, making it livable for present and future generations, everywhere.</p><p>The sixth mass extinction is a manmade phenomenon:  It is driven by the limitless greed of the few.</p><p>Take just one example, even when it is painted 'green' - the limitless appetite of Musk's electric car industry for Lithium has led to the expansion of lithium mines in Northern Tibet , Southern America and Chile, and Bolivia.  With the demand for electric cars, the demand for lithium is expected to more than double by 2025 with exponential damage to the environment and surrounding communities.</p><p>According to Evo Morales, the former President of Bolivia, the coup against him was a lithium coup. The coup came a week after Morales nationalised lithium on 4 November 2019, saying it belongs to the Bolivian people, not to multinationals, and cancelled the December 2018 agreement  with Germany's ACI Systems Alemania (ACISA) following weeks of protests from residents of the Potos\u00ed area which has 50% to 70% of the world's lithium reserves in the Salar de Uyuni salt flats. ACISA provides batteries to Tesla owned by Leon Musk and the coup resulted in a massive rise in the company's stock. [1] [2]</p><p>When the rich and powerful destroyed the binding Climate Change treaty in Copenhagen in 2009, Evo Morales  addressed the Conference of Parties, reminding everyone  that governments were supposed to be negotiating ways to protect Mother Earth, not the rights of polluters.  As a countermeasure, he announced he would call a people's Summit on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth.  I was honoured to work with the group created by the Government of Bolivia to prepare a Draft Universal Declaration on the Rights of Mother Earth.[3]</p><p>As Earth Citizens we have a choice - to either follow the market's laws of greed and unlimited profit or the laws of the Earth.</p><p>As we make shifts to a post Covid economy, we need to take into account the full ecological, social, and political costs of what is being offered and what choices we make. Rendering invisible the real costs to the earth and people is how the mega corporate world accumulates its wealth, polarizing society further, denying millions their fundamental rights, undermining democracy, and increasing their ecological footprint, leaving these costs to be born by the earth and vulnerable communities.</p><p>As always, colonisers leave the places and spaces they have destroyed and polluted, and find new colonies to occupy and extract from, touting them as the next step of progress, as solutions to the ecological and poverty crises they have contributed to, finding other places and other people to dominate and plunder.</p><p>Cecil Rhodes who colonized Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) stated frankly 'We must find new lands from which we can easily obtain raw materials and at the same time exploit the cheap slave labour that is available from the natives of the colonies. The colonies would also provide a dumping ground for the surplus goods produced in our factories '.[4]</p><p>This is still the model of the economy of the 1%. The tools of extraction, and the colonies might change but the patterns of colonization remain unchanged - grab and steal what belongs to others, make it your own property, collect rents from the original owners, transform the displaced  into cheap slave labour to provide cheap raw materials, and turn them into consumers for your industrial products.</p><p>For Elon Musk, the colonies are both other planets like Mars and countries rich in lithium.  For Bill Gates and Big Tech, the new colonies are our bodies and minds - as spelled out in WIPO's patent no. WO2020/06060 which the billionaire has just been granted at the peak of the Corona virus and in the midst of lockdown at the end of March.   This Is the next step in the tech giants' plan for the digitalization of the world where people and their work are being rendered 'useless' and are being reduced to 'users' of the 'machines'.</p><p>A digital dictatorship  based on the premise that 90% of humanity is disposable has no obligation to social justice and human rights.  A digital dictatorship is not a life generating and livelihood supporting economy. It can work through extraction of data from our minds and bodies for a few years as 'surveillance capitalism', but because it does not create the generative conditions that support life in nature's economy and the sustenance economy of people, because it does not nourish our health, our bodies and minds, or our creativity, our freedom or our earth being - it will destroy the ecological and social base of the economy and our future as a species.</p><p>Denial of ecological processes that support the economy, and externalising social and ecological costs, creates conditions for ecological collapse.</p><p>Economy and Ecology are both derived from the same word 'oikos' our home , both our planetary home as well as the particular places we call home. Yet what is called economy today is destroying our common home.</p><p>Aristotle defined 'oikonomia' as the 'art of living'.  He differentiated it from the  ' art of money making'  which he referred to as 'chrematistics'.</p><p>The game billionaires play is not worthy of being called economy , either as care for the home, or as the art of living. It is exractive, naked money making, at war with life and creativity.</p><p>The Digital Giants are misleadingly creating the language of 'dematerialization' , as if the digital economy will run on thin air, with no resources, no energy. However , a digital economy is very energy intensive and has a very heavy social and ecological footprint. Digital technologies now emit 4% of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and its energy consumption is increasing by 9% a year. Data traffic is responsible for more than half of digital technology's global impact, with 55% of its annual energy consumption. Every byte transferred or stored requires large scale and energy-greedy terminals and infrastructures (data centers, networks). This traffic is currently increasing by more than 25% a year. How long will it take before the ecological load of the digitalisation of every aspect of our life will push the remaining ecosystems to collapse, driving the surviving species to extinction?[5]</p><p>All democratic societies and citizens need to assess these costs, and ensure that the 'precautionary principle' and 'polluters pays principle' are applied to the digital economy. That polluters do not 'escape' their ecological and democratic responsibilities, and dictators do not impose their 'surveillance capitalism'.</p><p>There are options beyond colonization, beyond extinction ,which first pushed other species and other cultures to extinction - and is now threatening the extinction of the entire human species.</p><p>Instead of the rich ignoring and fleeing  from the Earth, the path as humanity we should be following is to Return to Earth, in our minds, our hearts, and in our lives - as one Earth Community with a potential to cocreate, coproduce, and regenerate and allow the earth to provide for all.   This is the path to reclaiming our creative powers to shape our economies and democracies from the bottom up. This is the practice of Earth Democracy.</p><p>We need to shift from Anthropocentrism to the recognition that all humans and all beings are members of one Earth Family. The assumption of superiority of humans over other species, and some humans over others of a different colour, gender, or religion is at the root of violence against women, blacks, and indigenous people. It has justified extermination of species and cultures.  It is what led to the brutal killing of George Floyd, and many others before him.  And this assumption of anthropocentrism is at the root of the extinction crisis.</p><p>We need to shift from the assumption that violating planetary boundaries, ecosystem boundaries, species boundaries, and human rights is a measure of progress and superiority - to creating economies based on respecting ecological laws and ecological limits, and respecting the rights of the last person, the last child.</p><p>We need to shift from seeing money and technology as masters in a new religion of money making , 'chrematistics', to recognizing they are mere means that must be governed and regulated democratically for higher ecological and human ends.</p><p>We need to shift from extractivism as the basis of the economy to solidarity and giving as the basis of circular, solidarity economies of permanence.</p><p>We need to shift from enclosure of the commons by the 1 % to recovery of the commons for the common good and well being of all.</p><p>Humanity must opt for staying alive by caring for our common home, the Earth and each other, rejuvenating the Planet, and through it sowing the seeds of our common future.</p><p>'Only as one earth community and one humanity, united in our diversities, can we hold ourselves together and step away from the precipice, and escape the destructive, ecocidal, genocidal rule of the 1% and the hallucinations of the mechanical mind. The 1% have brought us to this point, like sheep to slaughter. But we can turn around and walk away, to our freedom. To live free. To think free. To breathe free. To eat free. Seeding the Future is in our minds, our hearts, our hands'.</p><p>References:</p><p>[1] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/was-bolivia-s-coup-over-lithium-32033\">https://www.trtworld.com/magazine/was-bolivia-s-coup-over-lithium-32033</url></p><p>[2] <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/11/bolivian-coup-comes-less-week-after-morales-stopped-multinational-firms-lithium-deal\">https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/11/bolivian-coup-comes-less-week-after-morales-stopped-multinational-firms-lithium-deal</url></p><p>[3] <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.navdanya.org/newsite/index.php?option=com_k2\">http://www.navdanya.org/newsite/index.php?option=com_k2</url> and view=item and id=343:universal-declaration-of-the-rights-of-mother-earth and Itemid=214 and tmpl=component and print=1</p><p>[4] (Pg 116  Terry Gibbs, Why the Dalai Lama is a Socialist)</p><p>[5] (Source: <url normalizedValue=\"https://theshiftproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-02.pdf\">https://theshiftproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-02.pdf</url>)</p><p>TRANSCEND Member Prof. Vandana Shiva is a physicist, ecofeminist, philosopher, activist, and author of more than 20 books and 500 papers. She is the founder of the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, and has campaigned for biodiversity, conservation and farmers' rights, winning the Right Livelihood Award [Alternative Nobel Prize] in 1993. She is executive director of the Navdanya Trust.</p><p>Navdanya and the Navdanya movement were created by Dr. Vandana Shiva 30 years ago in India to defend Seed and Food sovereignty and small farmers around the world. Navdanya pioneered the movement of seed saving and seed freedom, which began in response to the crisis of erosion of agricultural biodiversity and introduction of GMOs and patents on seeds through intellectual property rights (IPRs) and so-called 'free trade' agreements. It has long fought against biopiracy, the patenting of indigenous knowledge by self-interested multinational corporations and won cases related to Neem, basmati rice and wheat in India. Navdanya promotes a new agricultural and economic paradigm, a culture of food for health, where ecological responsibility and economic justice replace the present greed, consumerism and competition which have become dominant in society. It aims at regaining the common good as a foundation for a renewed sense of community, solidarity and culture of peace. We strive to achieve these goals through the conservation, renewal and rejuvenation of the gifts of biodiversity we have received from nature and our ancestors, and to defend these gifts as commons.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRENZA-PRESZA1406202000002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRENZA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:604R-5C81-F00C-60JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2169\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

You began to ask questions and demand answers, which in turn pushed politicians to take (at least some, if not enough) action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Few now view giant social-media platforms, global search sites, apps or data-driven personal devices as benign data gatherers. We are all more aware that when we use platforms, services and devices, we hand over data that discloses much of who we are and that is able to track our location constantly. Such data is used to categorise us and to market to us but also market us as products; and to influence, at an unprecedented, individualised level, how we think, act and vote.</p><p>In 2018 we learned that many third parties could access our data, either directly - because it was sold to them or sent to them as part of their arrangements with the big data gatherers - or indirectly, through advertising access to precisely targeted audiences. </p><p>The latter, incidentally, is one reason why Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg kept misleadingly telling politicians at those US and EU hearings last year that Facebook doesn't \"sell\" personal data. This is just semantics. Targeted access based on personal data is Facebook selling access to you, as defined by your data. </p><p>But why did this broad public mindset shift and drive for greater accountability and transparency happen to such a significant degree last year, and not before? In short: it has taken time and a gradual drawing back of the curtains to see, even if only partially, what is happening with our data.</p><h>Snowden effect Ever since Edward Snowden revealed the extent and scope of secret US mass data surveillance projects in 2013, awareness of data privacy issues has been rising gradually. </h><p>Until then many people seemed ready to accept, and even expect, the security risks of the mass digitisation of business, government and society. We recognised the increasing amounts of digital data associated with credit cards or personal data records was at risk of being hacked and stolen. But the value and vulnerability of digital data remained a stubbornly abstract concept. </p><p>From the viewpoint of an individual, personal data could appear to be of so little interest. Who would really care about, much less want access to, one person's Google searches over a year, or Facebook posts about holiday trips or family reunions? </p><p>By 2018 people had begun to see how these small details swiftly aggregate - sometimes with data gathered from other places, revealing purchases, financial transactions or health and activity data, for example - to give precise and revealing pictures of each of us. </p><p>Thanks to whistleblowers such as former Cambridge Analyica programmer Chris Wylie, the public gained unprecedented insight last year into the complex and hidden ways in which technology and social media companies gather, share and use such data - and how easily they also may lose control of it. </p><h>Murky manipulation</h><p> It was a year too in which, under public pressure, online giants began to acknowledge the murky manipulation and misuse of online advertising on social-media platforms in past elections in the US, the UK and the EU (and, it seems, during the referendum on the Eighth Amendment in Ireland).  </p><p>Slow-burning public anger at one such revelation after another - particularly regarding giants Facebook and Google - ultimately compelled politicians to call their chief executives and other top brass before congressional and EU and Irish parliamentary committees.</p><p>We are where we are now - more cynical about tech company claims, less inclined to believe their excuses or tolerate their repeated apologies, wanting more and better answers and pressuring politicians to act - not because any one thing occurred in 2018. Rather, it's because, by 2018, we had benefited from a half decade of whistleblowers, investigative journalism, public interest lawsuits, vocal campaigns by privacy organisations, protests by employees of technology companies and a range of hashtag campaigns on social media. </p><p>And, of course, privacy legislation forcing more disclosure.

Who Could Object?<br/>\"Tonight I would like to share with you an idea that I am extremely passionate about,\" the young man said. His long black hair was swept back like a rock star's, or a gangster's. \"Think about this,\" he continued. \"Throughout all human history, the way that we have expressed our intent, the way we have expressed our goals, the way we have expressed our desires, has been limited by our bodies.\" When he inhaled, his rib cage expanded and filled out the fabric of his shirt. Gesturing toward his body, he said, \"We are born into this world with this. Whatever nature or luck has given us.\"</p><p><br/>To hear more feature stories, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/audio-articles/?utm_source=feed\">see our full list</url> or <url normalizedValue=\"https://app.adjust.com/q51hnyl\">get the Audm iPhone app.</url><br/>His speech then took a turn: \"Now, we've had a lot of interesting tools over the years, but fundamentally the way that we work with those tools is through our bodies.\" Then a further turn: \"Here's a situation that I know all of you know very well-your frustration with your smartphones, right? This is another tool, right? And we are still communicating with these tools through our bodies.\"<br/>And then it made a leap: \"I would claim to you that these tools are not so smart. And maybe one of the reasons why they're not so smart is because they're not connected to our brains. Maybe if we could hook those devices into our brains, they could have some idea of what our goals are, what our intent is, and what our frustration is.\"<br/>So began \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VumV_5ojlxk\">Beyond Bionics</url>,\" a talk by Justin C. Sanchez, then an associate professor of biomedical engineering and neuroscience at the University of Miami, and a faculty member of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. He was speaking at a tedx conference in Florida in 2012. What lies beyond bionics? Sanchez described his work as trying to \"understand the neural code,\" which would involve putting \"very fine microwire electrodes\"-the diameter of a human hair-\"into the brain.\" When we do that, he said, we would be able to \"listen in to the music of the brain\" and \"listen in to what somebody's motor intent might be\" and get a glimpse of \"your goals and your rewards\" and then \"start to understand how the brain encodes behavior.\"<br/>He explained, \"With all of this knowledge, what we're trying to do is build new medical devices, new implantable chips for the body that can be encoded or programmed with all of these different aspects. Now, you may be wondering, what are we going to do with those chips? Well, the first recipients of these kinds of technologies will be the paralyzed. It would make me so happy by the end of my career if I could help get somebody out of their wheelchair.\"<br/>Sanchez went on, \"The people that we are trying to help should never be imprisoned by their bodies. And today we can design technologies that can help liberate them from that. I'm truly inspired by that. It drives me every day when I wake up and get out of bed. Thank you so much.\" He blew a kiss to the audience.<br/>A year later, Justin Sanchez went to work for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Pentagon's R&amp;amp;D department. At DARPA, he now oversees all research on the healing and enhancement of the human mind and body. And his ambition involves more than helping get disabled people out of their wheelchair-much more.<br/>DARPA has dreamed for decades of merging human beings and machines. Some years ago, when the prospect of mind-controlled weapons became a public-relations liability for the agency, officials resorted to characteristic ingenuity. They recast the stated purpose of their neurotechnology research to focus ostensibly on the narrow goal of healing injury and curing illness. The work wasn't about weaponry or warfare, agency officials claimed. It was about therapy and health care. Who could object? But even if this claim were true, such changes would have extensive ethical, social, and metaphysical implications. Within decades, neurotechnology could cause social disruption on a scale that would make smartphones and the internet look like gentle ripples on the pond of history.<br/>Most unsettling, neurotechnology confounds age-old answers to this question: What is a human being?<br/>II. High Risk, High Reward<br/>In his 1958 State of the Union address, President Dwight Eisenhower declared that the United States of America \"must be forward-looking in our research and development to anticipate the unimagined weapons of the future.\" A few weeks later, his administration created the Advanced Research Projects Agency, a bureaucratically independent body that reported to the secretary of defense. This move had been prompted by the Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite. The agency's original remit was to hasten America's entry into space.<br/>During the next few years, arpa's mission grew to encompass research into \"man-computer symbiosis\" and a classified program of experiments in mind control that was code-named Project Pandora. There were bizarre efforts that involved trying to move objects at a distance by means of thought alone. In 1972, with an increment of candor, the word Defense was added to the name, and the agency became DARPA. Pursuing its mission, DARPA funded researchers who helped invent technologies that changed the nature of battle (stealth aircraft, drones) and shaped daily life for billions (voice-recognition technology, GPS devices). Its best-known creation is the internet.<br/>The agency's penchant for what it calls \"high-risk, high-reward\" research ensured that it would also fund a cavalcade of folly. Project Seesaw, a quintessential Cold War boondoggle, envisioned a \"particle-beam weapon\" that could be deployed in the event of a Soviet attack. The idea was to set off a series of nuclear explosions beneath the Great Lakes, creating a giant underground chamber. Then the lakes would be drained, in a period of 15 minutes, to generate the electricity needed to set off a particle beam. The beam would accelerate through tunnels hundreds of miles long (also carved out by underground nuclear explosions) in order to muster enough force to shoot up into the atmosphere and knock incoming Soviet missiles out of the sky. During the Vietnam War, DARPA tried to build a Cybernetic Anthropomorphous Machine, a jungle vehicle that officials called a \"mechanical elephant.\"<br/>The diverse and sometimes even opposing goals of DARPA scientists and their Defense Department overlords merged into a murky, symbiotic research culture-\"unencumbered by the typical bureaucratic oversight and uninhibited by the restraints of scientific peer review,\" Sharon Weinberger wrote in a recent book, The Imagineers of War. In Weinberger's account, DARPA's institutional history involves many episodes of introducing a new technology in the context of one appealing application, while hiding other genuine but more troubling motives. At DARPA, the left hand knows, and doesn't know, what the right hand is doing.<br/>The agency is deceptively compact. A mere 220 employees, supported by about 1,000 contractors, report for work each day at DARPA's headquarters, a nondescript glass-and-steel building in Arlington, Virginia, across the street from the practice rink for the Washington Capitals. About 100 of these employees are program managers-scientists and engineers, part of whose job is to oversee about 2,000 outsourcing arrangements with corporations, universities, and government labs. The effective workforce of DARPA actually runs into the range of tens of thousands. The budget is officially said to be about $3 billion, and has stood at roughly that level for an implausibly long time-the past 14 years.<br/>The Biological Technologies Office, created in 2014, is the newest of DARPA's six main divisions. This is the office headed by Justin Sanchez. One purpose of the office is to \"restore and maintain warfighter abilities\" by various means, including many that emphasize neurotechnology-applying engineering principles to the biology of the nervous system. For instance, the Restoring Active Memory program develops neuroprosthetics-tiny electronic components implanted in brain tissue-that aim to alter memory formation so as to counteract traumatic brain injury. Does DARPA also run secret biological programs? In the past, the Department of Defense has done such things. It has conducted tests on human subjects that were questionable, unethical, or, many have argued, illegal. The Big Boy protocol, for example, compared radiation exposure of sailors who worked above and below deck on a battleship, never informing the sailors that they were part of an experiment.<br/>Last year I asked Sanchez directly whether any of DARPA's neurotechnology work, specifically, was classified. He broke eye contact and said, \"I can't-We'll have to get off that topic, because I can't answer one way or another.\" When I framed the question personally-\"Are you involved with any classified neuroscience project?\"-he looked me in the eye and said, \"I'm not doing any classified work on the neurotechnology end.\"<br/>If his speech is careful, it is not spare. Sanchez has appeared at public events with some frequency (videos are posted on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/DARPAtv\">DARPA's YouTube channel</url>), to articulate joyful streams of good news about DARPA's proven applications-for instance, brain-controlled prosthetic arms for soldiers who have lost limbs. Occasionally he also mentions some of his more distant aspirations. One of them is the ability, via computer, to transfer knowledge and thoughts from one person's mind to another's.<br/>III. \"We Try to Find Ways to Say Yes\"<br/>Medicine and biology were of minor interest to DARPA until the 1990s, when biological weapons became a threat to U.S. national security. The agency made a significant investment in biology in 1997, when DARPA created the Controlled Biological Systems program. The zoologist Alan S. Rudolph managed this sprawling effort to integrate the built world with the natural world. As he explained it to me, the aim was \"to increase, if you will, the baud rate, or the cross-communication, between living and nonliving systems.\" He spent his days working through questions such as \"Could we unlock the signals in the brain associated with movement in order to allow you to control something outside your body, like a prosthetic leg or an arm, a robot, a smart home-or to send the signal to somebody else and have them receive it?\"<br/>Human enhancement became an agency priority. \"Soldiers having no physical, physiological, or cognitive limitation will be key to survival and operational dominance in the future,\" predicted Michael Goldblatt, who had been the science and technology officer at McDonald's before joining DARPA in 1999. To enlarge humanity's capacity to \"control evolution,\" he assembled a portfolio of programs with names that sounded like they'd been taken from video games or sci-fi movies: Metabolic Dominance, Persistence in Combat, Continuous Assisted Performance, Augmented Cognition, Peak Soldier Performance, Brain-Machine Interface.<br/>The programs of this era, as described by Annie Jacobsen in her 2015 book, The Pentagon's Brain, often shaded into mad-scientist territory. The Continuous Assisted Performance project attempted to create a \"24/7 soldier\" who could go without sleep for up to a week. (\"My measure of success,\" one DARPA official said of these programs, \"is that the International Olympic Committee bans everything we do.\")<br/>Dick Cheney relished this kind of research. In the summer of 2001, an array of \"super-soldier\" programs was presented to the vice president. His enthusiasm contributed to the latitude that President George W. Bush's administration gave DARPA-at a time when the agency's foundation was shifting. Academic science gave way to tech-industry \"innovation.\" Tony Tether, who had spent his career working alternately for Big Tech, defense contractors, and the Pentagon, became DARPA's director. After the 9/11 attacks, the agency announced plans for a surveillance program called Total Information Awareness, whose logo included an all-seeing eye emitting rays of light that scanned the globe. The pushback was intense, and Congress took DARPA to task for Orwellian overreach. The head of the program-Admiral John Poindexter, who had been tainted by scandal back in the Reagan years-later resigned, in 2003. The controversy also drew unwanted attention to DARPA's research on super-soldiers and the melding of mind and machine. That research made people nervous, and Alan Rudolph, too, found himself on the way out.<br/>In this time of crisis, DARPA invited Geoff Ling, a neurology'ICU physician and, at the time, an active-duty Army officer, to join the Defense Sciences Office. (Ling went on to work in the Biological Technologies Office when it spun out from Defense Sciences, in 2014.) When Ling was interviewed for his first job at DARPA, in 2002, he was preparing for deployment to Afghanistan and thinking about very specific combat needs. One was a \"pharmacy on demand\" that would eliminate the bulk of powdery fillers from drugs in pill or capsule form and instead would formulate active ingredients for ingestion via a lighter, more compact, dissolving substance-like Listerine breath strips. This eventually became a DARPA program. The agency's brazen sense of possibility buoyed Ling, who recalls with pleasure how colleagues told him, \"We try to find ways to say yes, not ways to say no.\" With Rudolph gone, Ling picked up the torch.<br/>Ling talks fast. He has a tough-guy voice. The faster he talks, the tougher he sounds, and when I met him, his voice hit top speed as he described a first principle of Defense Sciences. He said he had learned this \"particularly\" from Alan Rudolph: \"Your brain tells your hands what to do. Your hands basically are its tools, okay? And that was a revelation to me.\" He continued, \"We are tool users-that's what humans are. A human wants to fly, he builds an airplane and flies. A human wants to have recorded history, and he creates a pen. Everything we do is because we use tools, right? And the ultimate tools are our hands and feet. Our hands allow us to work with the environment to do stuff, and our feet take us where our brain wants to go. The brain is the most important thing.\"<br/>Ling connected this idea of the brain's primacy with his own clinical experience of the battlefield. He asked himself, \"How can I liberate mankind from the limitations of the body?\" The program for which Ling became best known is called Revolutionizing Prosthetics. Since the Civil War, as Ling has said, the prosthetic arm given to most amputees has been barely more sophisticated than \"a hook,\" and not without risks: \"Try taking care of your morning ablutions with that bad boy, and you're going to need a proctologist every goddamn day.\" With help from DARPA colleagues and academic and corporate researchers, Ling and his team built something that was once all but unimaginable: a brain-controlled prosthetic arm.<br/>No invention since the internet has been such a reliable source of good publicity for DARPA. Milestones in its development were hailed with wonder. In 2012, 60 Minutes showed a paralyzed woman named Jan Scheuermann <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paralyzed-woman-controls-robotic-arm-with-her-mind/\">feeding herself a bar of chocolate using a robotic arm</url> that she manipulated by means of a brain implant.<br/>Yet DARPA's work to repair damaged bodies was merely a marker on a road to somewhere else. The agency has always had a larger mission, and in a 2015 presentation, one program manager-a Silicon Valley recruit-described that mission: to \"free the mind from the limitations of even healthy bodies.\" What the agency learns from healing makes way for enhancement. The mission is to make human beings something other than what we are, with powers beyond the ones we're born with and beyond the ones we can organically attain.<br/>The internal workings of DARPA are complicated. The goals and values of its research shift and evolve in the manner of a strange, half-conscious shell game. The line between healing and enhancement blurs. And no one should lose sight of the fact that D is the first letter in DARPA's name. A year and a half after the video of Jan Scheuermann feeding herself chocolate was shown on television, DARPA made another video of her, in which her brain-computer interface <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/03/03/a-paralyzed-woman-flew-a-f-35-fighter-jet-in-a-simulator-using-only-her-mind/\">was connected to an F-35 flight simulator</url>, and she was flying the airplane. DARPA later disclosed this at a conference called Future of War.<br/>Geoff Ling's efforts have been carried on by Justin Sanchez. In 2016, Sanchez appeared at DARPA's \"Demo Day\" with a man named Johnny Matheny, whom agency officials describe as the first \"osseointegrated\" upper-limb amputee-the first man with a prosthetic arm attached directly to bone. Matheny demonstrated what was, at the time, DARPA's most advanced prosthetic arm. He told the attendees, \"I can sit here and curl a 45-pound dumbbell all day long, till the battery runs dead.\" The next day, Gizmodo ran this headline above its report from the event: \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://gizmodo.com/darpas-mind-controlled-arm-will-make-you-wish-you-were-1776130193\">DARPA's Mind-Controlled Arm Will Make You Wish You Were a Cyborg</url>.\"<br/>Since then, DARPA's work in neurotechnology has avowedly widened in scope, to embrace \"the broader aspects of life,\" Sanchez told me, \"beyond the person in the hospital who is using it to heal.\" The logical progression of all this research is the creation of human beings who are ever more perfect, by certain technological standards. New and improved soldiers are necessary and desirable for DARPA, but they are just the window-display version of the life that lies ahead.<br/>IV. \"Over the Horizon\"<br/>Consider memory, Sanchez told me: \"Everybody thinks about what it would be like to give memory a boost by 20, 30, 40 percent-pick your favorite number-and how that would be transformative.\" He spoke of memory enhancement through neural interface as an alternative form of education. \"School in its most fundamental form is a technology that we have developed as a society to help our brains to do more,\" he said. \"In a different way, neurotechnology uses other tools and techniques to help our brains be the best that they can be.\" One technique was described in a 2013 paper, a study involving researchers at Wake Forest University, the University of Southern California, and the University of Kentucky. Researchers performed surgery on 11 rats. Into each rat's brain, an electronic array-featuring 16 stainless-steel wires-was implanted. After the rats recovered from surgery, they were separated into two groups, and they spent a period of weeks getting educated, though one group was educated more than the other.<br/>The less educated group learned a simple task, involving how to procure a droplet of water. The more educated group learned a complex version of that same task-to procure the water, these rats had to persistently poke levers with their nose despite confounding delays in the delivery of the water droplet. When the more educated group of rats attained mastery of this task, the researchers exported the neural-firing patterns recorded in the rats' brains-the memory of how to perform the complex task-to a computer.<br/>\"What we did then was we took those signals and we gave it to an animal that was stupid,\" Geoff Ling said at a DARPA event in 2015-meaning that researchers took the neural-firing patterns encoding the memory of how to perform the more complex task, recorded from the brains of the more educated rats, and transferred those patterns into the brains of the less educated rats-\"and that stupid animal got it. They were able to execute that full thing.\" Ling summarized: \"For this rat, we reduced the learning period from eight weeks down to seconds.\"<br/>\"They could inject memory using the precise neural codes for certain skills,\" Sanchez told me. He believes that the Wake Forest experiment amounts to a foundational step toward \"memory prosthesis.\" This is the stuff of The Matrix. Though many researchers question the findings-cautioning that, really, it can't be this simple-Sanchez is confident: \"If I know the neural codes in one individual, could I give that neural code to another person? I think you could.\" Under Sanchez, DARPA has funded human experiments at Wake Forest, the University of Southern California, and the University of Pennsylvania, using similar mechanisms in analogous parts of the brain. These experiments did not transfer memory from one person to another, but instead gave individuals a memory \"boost.\" Implanted electrodes recorded neuronal activity associated with recognizing patterns (at Wake Forest and USC) and memorizing word lists (at Penn) in certain brain circuits. Then electrodes fed back those recordings of neuronal activity into the same circuits as a form of reinforcement. The result, in both cases, was significantly improved memory recall.<br/>Doug Weber, a neural engineer at the University of Pittsburgh who recently finished a four-year term as a DARPA program manager, working with Sanchez, is a memory-transfer skeptic. Born in Wisconsin, he has the demeanor of a sitcom dad: not too polished, not too rumpled. \"I don't believe in the infinite limits of technology evolution,\" he told me. \"I do believe there are going to be some technical challenges which are impossible to achieve.\" For instance, when scientists put electrodes in the brain, those devices eventually fail-after a few months or a few years. The most intractable problem is blood leakage. When foreign material is put into the brain, Weber said, \"you undergo this process of wounding, bleeding, healing, wounding, bleeding, healing, and whenever blood leaks into the brain compartment, the activity in the cells goes way down, so they become sick, essentially.\" More effectively than any fortress, the brain rejects invasion.<br/>Even if the interface problems that limit us now didn't exist, Weber went on to say, he still would not believe that neuroscientists could enable the memory-prosthesis scenario. Some people like to think about the brain as if it were a computer, Weber explained, \"where information goes from A to B to C, like everything is very modular. And certainly there is clear modular organization in the brain. But it's not nearly as sharp as it is in a computer. All information is everywhere all the time, right? It's so widely distributed that achieving that level of integration with the brain is far out of reach right now.\"<br/>Peripheral nerves, by contrast, conduct signals in a more modular fashion. The biggest, longest peripheral nerve is the vagus. It connects the brain with the heart, the lungs, the digestive tract, and more. Neuroscientists understand the brain's relationship with the vagus nerve more clearly than they understand the intricacies of memory formation and recall among neurons within the brain. Weber believes that it may be possible to stimulate the vagus nerve in ways that enhance the process of learning-not by transferring experiential memories, but by sharpening the facility for certain skills.<br/>To test this hypothesis, Weber directed the creation of a new program in the Biological Technologies Office, called Targeted Neuroplasticity Training (TNT). Teams of researchers at seven universities are investigating whether vagal-nerve stimulation can enhance learning in three areas: marksmanship, surveillance and reconnaissance, and language. The team at Arizona State has an ethicist on staff whose job, according to Weber, \"is to be looking over the horizon to anticipate potential challenges and conflicts that may arise\" regarding the ethical dimensions of the program's technology, \"before we let the genie out of the bottle.\" At a TNT kickoff meeting, the research teams spent 90 minutes discussing the ethical questions involved in their work-the start of a fraught conversation that will broaden to include many others, and last for a very long time.<br/>DARPA officials refer to the potential consequences of neurotechnology by invoking the acronym elsi, a term of art devised for the Human Genome Project. It stands for \"ethical, legal, social implications.\" The man who led the discussion on ethics among the research teams was Steven Hyman, a neuroscientist and neuroethicist at MIT and Harvard's Broad Institute. Hyman is also a former head of the National Institute of Mental Health. When I spoke with him about his work on DARPA programs, he noted that one issue needing attention is \"cross talk.\" A man-machine interface that does not just \"read\" someone's brain but also \"writes into\" someone's brain would almost certainly create \"cross talk between those circuits which we are targeting and the circuits which are engaged in what we might call social and moral emotions,\" he said. It is impossible to predict the effects of such cross talk on \"the conduct of war\" (the example he gave), much less, of course, on ordinary life.<br/>Weber and a DARPA spokesperson related some of the questions the researchers asked in their ethics discussion: Who will decide how this technology gets used? Would a superior be able to force subordinates to use it? Will genetic tests be able to determine how responsive someone would be to targeted neuroplasticity training? Would such tests be voluntary or mandatory? Could the results of such tests lead to discrimination in school admissions or employment? What if the technology affects moral or emotional cognition-our ability to tell right from wrong or to control our own behavior?<br/>Recalling the ethics discussion, Weber told me, \"The main thing I remember is that we ran out of time.\"<br/>V. \"You Can Weaponize Anything\"<br/>In The Pentagon's Brain, Annie Jacobsen suggested that DARPA's neurotechnology research, including upper-limb prosthetics and the brain-machine interface, is not what it seems: \"It is likely that DARPA's primary goal in advancing prosthetics is to give robots, not men, better arms and hands.\" Geoff Ling rejected the gist of her conclusion when I summarized it for him (he hadn't read the book). He told me, \"When we talk about stuff like this, and people are looking for nefarious things, I always say to them, ~Do you honestly believe that the military that your grandfather served in, your uncle served in, has changed into being Nazis or the Russian army?' Everything we did in the Revolutionizing Prosthetics program-everything we did-is published. If we were really building an autonomous-weapons system, why would we publish it in the open literature for our adversaries to read? We hid nothing. We hid not a thing. And you know what? That meant that we didn't just do it for America. We did it for the world.\"<br/>I started to say that publishing this research would not prevent its being misused. But the terms use and misuse overlook a bigger issue at the core of any meaningful neurotechnology-ethics discussion. Will an enhanced human being-a human being possessing a neural interface with a computer-still be human, as people have experienced humanity through all of time? Or will such a person be a different sort of creature?<br/>The U.S. government has put limits on DARPA's power to experiment with enhancing human capabilities. Ling says colleagues told him of a \"directive\": \"Congress was very specific,\" he said. \"They don't want us to build a superperson.\" This can't be the announced goal, Congress seems to be saying, but if we get there by accident-well, that's another story. Ling's imagination remains at large. He told me, \"If I gave you a third eye, and the eye can see in the ultraviolet, that would be incorporated into everything that you do. If I gave you a third ear that could hear at a very high frequency, like a bat or like a snake, then you would incorporate all those senses into your experience and you would use that to your advantage. If you can see at night, you're better than the person who can't see at night.\"<br/>Enhancing the senses to gain superior advantage-this language suggests weaponry. Such capacities could certainly have military applications, Ling acknowledged-\"You can weaponize anything, right?\"-before he dismissed the idea and returned to the party line: \"No, actually, this has to do with increasing a human's capability\" in a way that he compared to military training and civilian education, and justified in economic terms.<br/>\"Let's say I gave you a third arm,\" and then a fourth arm-so, two additional hands, he said. \"You would be more capable; you would do more things, right?\" And if you could control four hands as seamlessly as you're controlling your current two hands, he continued, \"you would actually be doing double the amount of work that you would normally do. It's as simple as that. You're increasing your productivity to do whatever you want to do.\" I started to picture his vision-working with four arms, four hands-and asked, \"Where does it end?\"<br/>\"It won't ever end,\" Ling said. \"I mean, it will constantly get better and better-\" His cellphone rang. He took the call, then resumed where he had left off: \"What DARPA does is we provide a fundamental tool so that other people can take those tools and do great things with them that we're not even thinking about.\"<br/>Judging by what he said next, however, the number of things that DARPA is thinking about far exceeds what it typically talks about in public. \"If a brain can control a robot that looks like a hand,\" Ling said, \"why can't it control a robot that looks like a snake? Why can't that brain control a robot that looks like a big mass of Jell-O, able to get around corners and up and down and through things? I mean, somebody will find an application for that. They couldn't do it now, because they can't become that glob, right? But in my world, with their brain now having a direct interface with that glob, that glob is the embodiment of them. So now they're basically the glob, and they can go do everything a glob can do.\"<br/>VI. Gold Rush<br/>DARPA's developing capabilities still hover at or near a proof-of-concept stage. But that's close enough to have drawn investment from some of the world's richest corporations. In 1990, during the administration of President George H. W. Bush, DARPA Director Craig I. Fields lost his job because, according to contemporary news accounts, he intentionally fostered business development with some Silicon Valley companies, and White House officials deemed that inappropriate. Since the administration of the second President Bush, however, such sensitivities have faded.<br/>Over time, DARPA has become something of a farm team for Silicon Valley. Regina Dugan, who was appointed DARPA director by President Barack Obama, went on to head Google's Advanced Technology and Projects group, and other former DARPA officials went to work for her there. She then led R&amp;amp;D for the analogous group at Facebook, called Building 8. (She has since left Facebook.)<br/>DARPA's neurotechnology research has been affected in recent years by corporate poaching. Doug Weber told me that some DARPA researchers have been \"scooped up\" by companies including Verily, the life-sciences division of Alphabet (the parent company of Google), which, in partnership with the British pharmaceutical conglomerate GlaxoSmithKline, created a company called Galvani Bioelectronics, to bring neuro-modulation devices to market. Galvani calls its business \"bioelectric medicine,\" which conveys an aura of warmth and trustworthiness. Ted Berger, a University of Southern California biomedical engineer who collaborated with the Wake Forest researchers on their studies of memory transfer in rats, worked as the chief science officer at the neurotechnology company Kernel, which plans to build \"advanced neural interfaces to treat disease and dysfunction, illuminate the mechanisms of intelligence, and extend cognition.\" Elon Musk has courted DARPA researchers to join his company Neuralink, which is said to be developing an interface known as \"neural lace.\" Facebook's Building 8 is working on a neural interface too. In 2017, Regina Dugan said that 60 engineers were at work on a system with the goal of allowing users to type 100 words a minute \"directly from your brain.\" Geoff Ling is on Building 8's advisory board.<br/>Talking with Justin Sanchez, I speculated that if he realizes his ambitions, he could change daily life in even more fundamental and lasting ways than Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey have. Sanchez blushes easily, and he breaks eye contact when he is uncomfortable, but he did not look away when he heard his name mentioned in such company. Remembering a remark that he had once made about his hope for neurotechnology's wide adoption, but with \"appropriate checks to make sure that it's done in the right way,\" I asked him to talk about what the right way might look like. Did any member of Congress strike him as having good ideas about legal or regulatory structures that might shape an emerging neural-interface industry? He demurred (\"DARPA's mission isn't to define or even direct those things\") and suggested that, in reality, market forces would do more to shape the evolution of neurotechnology than laws or regulations or deliberate policy choices. What will happen, he said, is that scientists at universities will sell their discoveries or create start-ups. The marketplace will take it from there: \"As they develop their companies, and as they develop their products, they're going to be subject to convincing people that whatever they're developing makes sense, that it helps people to be a better version of themselves. And that process-that day-to-day development-will ultimately guide where these technologies go. I mean, I think that's the frank reality of how it ultimately will unfold.\"<br/>He seemed entirely untroubled by what may be the most troubling aspect of DARPA's work: not that it discovers what it discovers, but that the world has, so far, always been ready to buy it.<br/><br/>This article appears in the November 2018 print edition with the headline \"The Pentagon Wants to Weaponize the Brain.

Peretti acknowledged that there was \"a real sense of crisis in Silicon Valley,\" but implied that the solution wasn't necessarily to break up platforms, but rather \"platforms and media working together.\" \"The people at the platforms are good people. </p><p>They have families. They're not anti-vaxxers themselves,\" Peretti said during his keynote presentation at SXSW. AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 The rise of tech giants like Facebook and Google has made the big only bigger, shaking up media and marketing with more mega-conglomerates like that of AT...nd Time Warner and Disney with Fox. But while presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren says[1] that big tech companies like Facebook and Google need to be broken up and regulated, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti differs. Peretti acknowledged that there was \"a real sense of crisis in Silicon Valley\" to do with the way consumers access content and maintain integrity of that content. But he implied that the solution wasn't necessarily to break up platforms, but rather \"platforms and media working together.\" \"The people at the platforms are good people. They have families. They're not anti-vaxxers themselves,\" Peretti said during his keynote presentation at SXSW. \"They're spending billions of dollars trying to moderate the content, but the better solution is to create better models for the good content to thrive.\" He made the comments while sharing a broader strategy memo that BuzzFeed released timed with SXSW on Friday, outlining BuzzFeed's path ahead. He said his goal was fix the internet and make it less of a \"dumpster fire.\" Other industry watchers said that breaking up the tech giants would spread digital ad dollars around more evenly. Read More: Warren's proposal to break up the tech giants could give marketers more choice, but it could also cause 'unmitigated chaos'[2] BuzzFeed was the most recent media company hit by sizable layoffs in January as many have begun to question the long-term sustainability of media-business models that rely on platforms like Facebook for distribution. But Peretti said he sees \"a clear path to a bright future for BuzzFeed.\" He argued that publishers are \"fixing\" the platforms by filling \"the void\" with quality content, with the void referring to \"opportunistic bad actors\" like anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, misogynists, racists, and pedophiles. Peretti recently did something of an about-face on Facebook[3]. Once a consummate Facebook booster as BuzzFeed scaled the platform to big heights, he's become critical more, calling for the platform to share more revenue with publishers. Warren, on the other hand, proposed that tech companies should be regulated. \"Today's big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" the senator wrote in a Medium post[4]. She said that she would require tech giants to be classified as platform utilities, barring them from sharing data with third parties. She also said she would undo mergers like Facebook and Instagram and Google and DoubleClick. NOW WATCH: Elon Musk sent a $100K Tesla Roadster to space a year ago.

Instead, they ought to stop yapping, take some driving lessons and help design a new car. It is only when Europe becomes a global leader in tech again that it can hope to control the destination of travel in the 21st century.</p><p>As almost every aspect of our lives turns digital, Europe\u2019s leaders are right to worry that too much power is being grabbed by consumer internet giants, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon, and Chinese hardware manufacturers, such as Huawei, which runs 5G networks. Sovereign governments used to wield exclusive power over validating identity, running critical infrastructure, regulating information flows and creating money. Several of those functions are being usurped by the latest tech.</p><p>Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/07/emmanuel-macron-in-his-own-words-english\"> recently told The Economist</url> that Europe had inadvertently abandoned the \u201cgrammar\u201d of sovereignty by allowing private companies, rather than public interest, to decide on digital infrastructure. In 10 years\u2019 time, he feared, Europe would no longer be able to guarantee the soundness of its cyber infrastructure or control its citizens\u2019 and companies\u2019 data. </p><p>The instinctive response of many European politicians is to invest in grand, state-led projects and to regulate the life out of Big Tech. A recent proposal to launch a European cloud computing company, called Gaia-X, reflects the same impulse that lay behind the creation of Quaero, the Franco-German search engine set up in 2008 to challenge Google. That you have to Google \u201cQuaero\u201d rather than Quaero \u201cQuaero\u201d tells you how that fared. The risk of ill-designed regulation is that it can stifle innovation and strengthen the grip of dominant companies.</p><p>Rather than just trying to shore up the diminishing sovereignty of European governments and prop up obsolete national industrial champions, leaders may do better to reshape the rules of the data economy to empower users and stimulate a new wave of innovation. True sovereignty, after all, lies in the hands of the people.</p><p>To this end, Europe should encourage greater efforts to \u201cre-decentralise the web\u201d, as computer scientists say, to accelerate the development of the next generation internet. The principle of privacy by design should be enshrined in the next batch of regulations, following the EU\u2019s landmark General Data Protection Regulation, and written into all public procurement contracts.</p><p>The most persuasive champion of this redesigned future is Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, who has <url normalizedValue=\"https://solid.inrupt.com/\"> since launched Solid</url> technology to give users greater data rights. \u201cWe have to imagine a world in which any data you create is under your control,\u201d Sir Tim told me at the Open Data Institute conference this month. \u201cBy default you will control your data. By default it will not be shared with anybody.\u201d</p><p>What that means in practice has been spelt out by Francesca Bria, the former chief technology officer for Barcelona, now a senior adviser at the UN. Europe, she says, now has a chance to set the privacy and security standards for the digital economy that will define future platform innovation. </p><p>\u201cEurope should invest in technologies that are decentralised, privacy-enhancing and rights-preserving, that give data control back to citizens, so citizens are able to decide what data they want to keep private, what data they want to share, with whom, on what terms,\u201d she says. </p><p>The shift from surveillance capitalism to a more user-centric data economy is already opening up new business opportunities. Europe has the chance to jump ahead of this coming revolution, rather than just playing catch-up with the US and China.</p><p>Graham Cooke, a former Google employee and chief executive of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.qubit.com/author/graham-cooke\">Qubit data company</url>, says the very dominance of the US tech companies could blind them to this coming shift. Big Tech has built powerful, and highly profitable, technological engines fuelled by all the data they have acquired. But there may soon be a switch in that fuel supply. </p><p>\u201cJust like Microsoft lost out to the web, Facebook and Google will be taken off guard by that change of fuel. I think it is inevitable but we just cannot see it yet,\u201d Mr Cooke says. \u201cConsumers will be empowered by owning data. This is such a disruptive thing that is happening so soon.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p><p/><p>Follow John Thornhill with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/john-thornhill\"> myFT</url></p><p>Letter in response to this column: </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Legal instruments exist to empower us data subjects / From Sylvie Delacroix and Neil Lawrence, The Alan Turing Institute</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-9ca5b0b20f6411eaa7e662bf4f9e548a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKF-5N11-JB77-K3MK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><timeReceived>1:47 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Regulators should be thinking about how to use federal incentives to spur small business creation to bring meaningful jobs and new innovations to this country; how to persuade investors to spread more venture capital beyond the three states (California, Massachusetts and New York) that get most of it; how to push for a more diverse work force and fund ambitious education programs, which other countries do without pause; how to anticipate the human impact of the next group of technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced robotics; how to create the most forward-thinking infrastructure plan to modernize our cities; and how to encourage tech to focus on innovations to combat existential issues like climate change, and food and water shortages.</p><p>But hey, at least they are all over the regulation of electric scooters.

John McDuling reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was Sunday afternoon in Silicon Valley when the emails, text messages and phone calls from Australia started rolling in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The news had just surfaced that the competition regulator Down Under was about to release the preliminary findings from a 12-month inquiry into Google and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The regulatory departments inside the two digital behemoths had been bracing for this moment for a while. But when it came, it turned out to be worse than they'd feared.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When you have market power, which both Google and Facebook have, with that comes special responsibilities,\" Rod Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, declared at a press conference in Sydney, where it was lunchtime on Monday. \"And that means, also, additional scrutiny.\"</p><p>The Australian government had given Sims the task of investigating the impact of Google and Facebook on traditional media. He had assembled a team of 14 investigators, lawyers and economists to work with him on the probe. Half were under the age of 30.</p><p>Being a government department, they used Microsoft's Outlook email client and the Skype instant-messaging service rather than (Facebook-owned) WhatsApp or (Google's) Gmail to communicate.</p><p>The wide-ranging, \"world first\" probe was secured by the Nick Xenophon Team in the manoeuvring over the repeal of cross-media ownership laws last year.</p><p>But following a string of scandals involving the two digital behemoths, including massive privacy breaches, the spread of fake news and revelations the platforms had been manipulated by Russian hackers, it took on global significance.</p><p>\"We have formed the view they [Google and Facebook] have got market power, they have significantly disrupted media, journalism and their business models,\" said Sims. \"We recognise in market economies you do have creative destruction ... but I think great care needs to be taken when it comes to talking about news and journalism. News and journalism play a critical role in our society.\"</p><p>His words were music to the ears of traditional publishers.</p><p>Led by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, they have for years bemoaned the digital duopoly's stranglehold over the online advertising market, and their comparative lack of regulation and accountability. For a sober, independent government body to agree with this view, following an exhaustive, year-long analysis, was a striking vindication of that position.</p><p>Yet for the digital giants, the ACCC's findings were troubling, and risked setting a global precedent.</p><p>Among other things, the regulator proposed a new body to monitor the algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook's news feed, and the traffic they send to publishers. It would also scrutinise their conduct in the advertising market, including the way they price ads and claims over their efficacy.</p><p>The ACCC also proposed a new ombudsman to monitor consumer complaints (similar to the bodies that exist for other industries) as well as measures to prevent the digital giants from collecting data without clear and unambiguous consent from users.</p><p>Facebook has come out hard against the concept of an algorithm regulator, describing the proposal as \"unworkable\", \"unnecessary\" and \"unprecedented\".</p><p>Google (whose CEO Sundar Pichai was grilled by US politicians in Washington this week over similar issues) has been slower to respond.</p><p>The two digital giants have a collective market value north of a trillion dollars and almost unfathomable power. They may be chastened, but they won't accept the ACCC's recommendations without a fight.</p><p>Silicon Valley has a fierce anti-authority streak and typically isn't supportive of added regulation. But unlike the furore over Australia's recent encryption laws, the response to the ACCC inquiry was broadly positive.</p><p>\"Coming off the lows of that encryption debacle, this is at the other end of the spectrum,\" says James Allworth, an Australian tech executive based in San Francisco who hosts the widely followed Exponent.fm podcast.</p><p>\"It was clear they have a pretty solid understanding of the dynamics. On the whole I would say their assessment, their diagnosis of the situation, is pretty accurate.\"</p><p>That said, scepticism about the ACCC's ability to actually regulate two of the most powerful companies in history remains.</p><p>\"I deeply suspect that the solution to media's woes is not going to come from another regulator,\" says Sydney entrepreneur Mark Tanner, who worked for Google in Sydney and New York. \"There are legitimate social problems these companies have created with their algorithms, but I don't think this addresses that.\"</p><p>Traditional media companies are bound by defamation laws, the Australian Press Council and the Australian Communications and Media Authority. That Facebook and Google are comparatively under-regulated is undeniable.</p><p>Still, it is hard to fathom how a government body would be able to manage the task of monitoring their algorithms.</p><p>\"There is not like, one person at Google who understands how its search engine works,\" says Tanner. \"It has got to be millions and millions and millions of lines of code, written by thousands of engineers, drawing on thousands of databases, some of which are truly gigantic. I don't understand how you'd do that.\"</p><p>These days, Tanner runs his own start-up, Qwilr, which makes tools to create advanced pitch documents used by sales and marketing teams. He acknowledges that the dominance of Google and Facebook is an issue for businesses like his.</p><p>\"As far as a start-up is concerned, the challenge is that there is nowhere else to go for that type of ad; they are the only two shops in town, and they are getting expensive as more and more companies move their ad spend there,\" he says.</p><p>Allworth says Facebook's aggressive response to the report was telling. \"Their [Facebook's] reaction was not 'we're happy to work with regulators'. It was straight out of the gate 'No'. Which means, maybe they [the regulators] are on to something here.\"</p><p>But he also has reservations about the concept of an algorithm regulator. \"If every country's regulator wants to control the news feed, well, if Donald Trump is in power in the US - if he starts saying everything is fake news, do we really want him having the power to implement that on Facebook? Maybe a regulator tweaking the algorithm is going to work in a way that you really don't want it to work.\"</p><p>After Sims finished his press conference in Sydney, he immediately starting working the phones, calling his counterparts within the international regulatory community and the influential Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to drum up support for his proposals.</p><p>He has been flooded with speaking offers and will visit the US early next year to talk through his ideas. Sims has made little secret of his desire to generate global momentum for the measures he unveiled this week.</p><p>\"Our report is extremely timely. Governments overseas are looking at Facebook and Google, we have come up with information that others haven't had,\" he said. \"Our report will feed into that international discussion of these issues. We are very well connected with our international counterparts.\"</p><p>The tech companies are expected to formally respond in February. Then, in June, the ACCC will deliver its final report, with recommendations to the government.</p><p>It might well be a different government by then, with a federal election likely in May. But that is unlikely to change the politics of the report. It is hard to see anyone opposing more regulation of the digital giants (or, conversely, standing up for them).</p><p>\"We would argue consumers underestimate how much of their data is being collected from them, and overestimate the level of control they have over that,\" Sims said this week.</p><p>\"You can't separate privacy from looking at Google and Facebook. Their business system is gathering data about you and they do that in many more ways than you think.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc736rxcpojt2gh57m98y</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYM-FD51-JD34-V2PJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1331\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 15, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

The regulatory departments inside the two digital behemoths had been bracing for this moment for a while. But when it came, it turned out worse than they'd feared.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When you have market power, which both Google and Facebook have, with that comes special responsibilities,\" Rod Sims, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, declared at a press conference in Sydney, where it was lunchtime on Monday. \"And that means, also, additional scrutiny.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sims had been tasked by the Australian government with investigating the impact of Google and Facebook on traditional media. He had assembled a team of 14 investigators, lawyers and economists to work with him on the probe. Half of them were under the age of 30.</p><p>Being a government department, they used Microsoft's Outlook email client and the Skype instant-messaging service rather than (Facebook-owned) WhatsApp or (Google's) Gmail to communicate.</p><p>The wide-ranging, \"world first\" probe was secured by the Nick Xenophon Team in the manoeuvring the over the repeal of cross-media ownership laws last year.</p><p>But, following a string of scandals involving the two digital behemoths, including massive privacy breaches, the spread of fake news and revelations the platforms had been manipulated by Russian hackers, it took on added global significance.</p><p>\"We have formed the view they [Google and Facebook] have got market power, they have significantly disrupted media, journalism and their business models,\" said Sims. \"We recognise in market economies you do have creative destruction ... but I think great care needs to be taken when it comes to talking about news and journalism. News and journalism play a critical role in our society.\"</p><p>His words were music to the ears of traditional publishers.</p><p>Led by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, they have for years bemoaned the digital duoploy's stranglehold over the online advertising market, and their comparative lack of regulation and accountability. For a sober, independent government body to agree with this view, following an exhaustive, year-long analysis, was a striking vindication of that position.</p><p>Yet for the digital giants, the ACCC's findings were troubling, and risked setting a global precedent.</p><p>Among other things, the regulator proposed a new body to monitor the algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook's news feed, and the traffic they send to publishers. It would also scrutinise their conduct in the advertising market, including the way they price ads and claims over their efficacy.</p><p>The ACCC also proposed a new ombudsman to monitor consumer complaints (similar to the bodies that exist for other industries such as telecommunications and financial services) as well as measures to prevent the digital giants from collecting data without clear and unambiguous consent of users.</p><p>Facebook has come out hard against the concept of an algorithm regulator, describing the proposal as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/unworkable-unnecessary-unprecedented-facebook-hits-back-at-accc-20181212-p50lvk.html\">\"unworkable\", \"unnecessary\" and \"unprecedented\"</url>.</p><p>Google (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/google-ceo-explains-to-congress-why-trump-comes-up-when-you-search-idiot-20181212-p50ln9.html\">whose CEO Sundar Pichai was grilled by US politicians in Washington</url> this week over similar issues) has been slower to respond.</p><p>The two digital giants have a collective market value north of $US1 trillion and almost unfathomable power. They may be chastened, but they won't accept the ACCCs recommendations without a fight.</p><p>The view from Silicon Valley</p><p>Silicon Valley has a fierce anti-authority streak and typically isn't supportive of added regulation. But unlike the furore over Australia's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/police-spies-gain-powers-to-access-encrypted-messages-after-political-deal-struck-20181204-p50k74.html\">recent encryption laws</url>, the response to the ACCC inquiry was broadly positive.</p><p>\"Coming the off the lows of that encryption debacle, this is at the other end of the spectrum,\" says James Allworth, an Australian tech executive based in San Francisco who hosts the widely followed Exponent.fm podcast.</p><p>\"It was clear they have a pretty solid understanding of the dynamics. On the whole I would say their assessment, their diagnosis of the situation, is pretty accurate.\"</p><p>That said, scepticism about the ACCC's ability to actually regulate two of the most powerful companies history remains.</p><p>\"I deeply suspect that the solution to media's woes is not going to come from another regulator,\" says Sydney entrepreneur Mark Tanner, who worked for Google in Sydney and New York. \"There are legitimate social problems these companies have created with their algorithms, but I don't think this addresses that.\"</p><p>Traditional media companies are bound by defamation laws, the Australian Press Council, and the Australian Communications and Media Authority. That Facebook and Google are comparatively under-regulated is undeniable.</p><p>Still, it is hard to fathom how a government body would be able to manage the task of monitoring their algorithms.</p><p>\"There is not like, one person at Google who understands how its search engine works,\" says Tanner. \"It has got to be millions and millions and millions of lines of code, written by thousands of engineers, drawing on thousands of databases, some of which are truly gigantic. I don't understand how you'd do that.\"</p><p>These days, Tanner runs his own start-up, Qwilr, which makes tools to create advanced pitch documents used by sales and marketing teams. He acknowledges that the dominance of Google and Facebook is an issue for businesses like his.</p><p>\"As far as a start-up is concerned, the challenge is that there is no where else to go for that type of ad; they are the only two shops in town, and they are getting expensive as more and more companies move their ad spend there,\" he says.</p><p>Allworth says Facebook's aggressive response to the report was telling. \"Their [Facebook's] reaction was not 'we happy to work with regulators'. It was straight out of the gate 'No'. Which means, maybe they [the regulators] are on to something here.\"</p><p>But he also has reservations about the concept of an algorithm regulator. \"If every country's regulator wants to control the news feed, well, if Donald Trump is in power in the US - if he starts saying everything is fake news, do we really want him having the power to implement that on Facebook? Maybe a regulator tweaking the algorithm is going to work in a way that you really don't want it to work.\"</p><p>An international outlook</p><p>After Sims finished his press conference in Sydney, he immediately starting working the phones, calling his counterparts within the international regulatory community and the influential Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to drum up support for his proposals.</p><p>He has been flooded with speaking offers and will visit the US early next year to talk through his ideas. Sims has made little secret of his desire to generate global momentum for the measures he unveiled this week.</p><p>\"Our report is extremely timely. Governments overseas are looking at Facebook and Google, we have come up with information that others haven't had,\" he said. \"Our report will feed into that international discussion of these issues. We are very well connected with our international counterparts.\"</p><p>The tech companies are expected to formally respond in February. Then, in June, the ACCC will deliver its final report, with recommendations to the government.</p><p>It might well be a different government by then, with a federal election likely in May. But that is unlikely to change the politics of this report. It is hard to see anyone opposing more regulation of the digital giants (or conversely, standing up for them).</p><p>\"We would argue consumers underestimate how much of their data is being collected from them, and overestimate the level of control they have over that,\" Sims said this week.</p><p>\"You can't separate privacy from looking at Google and Facebook. Their business system is gathering data about you and they do that in many more ways than you think.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520080726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYP-32C1-DY19-C3GM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1329\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The regulatory departments inside the two digital behemoths had been bracing for this moment for a while. But when it came, it turned out worse than they'd feared.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When you have market power, which both Google and Facebook have, with that comes special responsibilities,\" Rod Sims, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, declared at a press conference in Sydney, where it was lunchtime on Monday. \"And that means, also, additional scrutiny.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sims had been tasked by the Australian government with investigating the impact of Google and Facebook on traditional media. He had assembled a team of 14 investigators, lawyers and economists to work with him on the probe. Half of them were under the age of 30.</p><p>Being a government department, they used Microsoft's Outlook email client and the Skype instant-messaging service rather than (Facebook-owned) WhatsApp or (Google's) Gmail to communicate.</p><p>The wide-ranging, \"world first\" probe was secured by the Nick Xenophon Team in the manoeuvring the over the repeal of cross-media ownership laws last year.</p><p>But, following a string of scandals involving the two digital behemoths, including massive privacy breaches, the spread of fake news and revelations the platforms had been manipulated by Russian hackers, it took on added global significance.</p><p>\"We have formed the view they [Google and Facebook] have got market power, they have significantly disrupted media, journalism and their business models,\" said Sims. \"We recognise in market economies you do have creative destruction ... but I think great care needs to be taken when it comes to talking about news and journalism. News and journalism play a critical role in our society.\"</p><p>His words were music to the ears of traditional publishers.</p><p>Led by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, they have for years bemoaned the digital duoploy's stranglehold over the online advertising market, and their comparative lack of regulation and accountability. For a sober, independent government body to agree with this view, following an exhaustive, year-long analysis, was a striking vindication of that position.</p><p>Yet for the digital giants, the ACCC's findings were troubling, and risked setting a global precedent.</p><p>Among other things, the regulator proposed a new body to monitor the algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook's news feed, and the traffic they send to publishers. It would also scrutinise their conduct in the advertising market, including the way they price ads and claims over their efficacy.</p><p>The ACCC also proposed a new ombudsman to monitor consumer complaints (similar to the bodies that exist for other industries such as telecommunications and financial services) as well as measures to prevent the digital giants from collecting data without clear and unambiguous consent of users.</p><p>Facebook has come out hard against the concept of an algorithm regulator, describing the proposal as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/unworkable-unnecessary-unprecedented-facebook-hits-back-at-accc-20181212-p50lvk.html\">\"unworkable\", \"unnecessary\" and \"unprecedented\"</url>.</p><p>Google (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/google-ceo-explains-to-congress-why-trump-comes-up-when-you-search-idiot-20181212-p50ln9.html\">whose CEO Sundar Pichai was grilled by US politicians in Washington</url> this week over similar issues) has been slower to respond.</p><p>The two digital giants have a collective market value north of $US1 trillion and almost unfathomable power. They may be chastened, but they won't accept the ACCCs recommendations without a fight.</p><p>The view from Silicon Valley</p><p>Silicon Valley has a fierce anti-authority streak and typically isn't supportive of added regulation. But unlike the furore over Australia's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/police-spies-gain-powers-to-access-encrypted-messages-after-political-deal-struck-20181204-p50k74.html\">recent encryption laws</url>, the response to the ACCC inquiry was broadly positive.</p><p>\"Coming the off the lows of that encryption debacle, this is at the other end of the spectrum,\" says James Allworth, an Australian tech executive based in San Francisco who hosts the widely followed Exponent.fm podcast.</p><p>\"It was clear they have a pretty solid understanding of the dynamics. On the whole I would say their assessment, their diagnosis of the situation, is pretty accurate.\"</p><p>That said, scepticism about the ACCC's ability to actually regulate two of the most powerful companies history remains.</p><p>\"I deeply suspect that the solution to media's woes is not going to come from another regulator,\" says Sydney entrepreneur Mark Tanner, who worked for Google in Sydney and New York. \"There are legitimate social problems these companies have created with their algorithms, but I don't think this addresses that.\"</p><p>Traditional media companies are bound by defamation laws, the Australian Press Council, and the Australian Communications and Media Authority. That Facebook and Google are comparatively under-regulated is undeniable.</p><p>Still, it is hard to fathom how a government body would be able to manage the task of monitoring their algorithms.</p><p>\"There is not like, one person at Google who understands how its search engine works,\" says Tanner. \"It has got to be millions and millions and millions of lines of code, written by thousands of engineers, drawing on thousands of databases, some of which are truly gigantic. I don't understand how you'd do that.\"</p><p>These days, Tanner runs his own start-up, Qwilr, which makes tools to create advanced pitch documents used by sales and marketing teams. He acknowledges that the dominance of Google and Facebook is an issue for businesses like his.</p><p>\"As far as a start-up is concerned, the challenge is that there is no where else to go for that type of ad; they are the only two shops in town, and they are getting expensive as more and more companies move their ad spend there,\" he says.</p><p>Allworth says Facebook's aggressive response to the report was telling. \"Their [Facebook's] reaction was not 'we happy to work with regulators'. It was straight out of the gate 'No'. Which means, maybe they [the regulators] are on to something here.\"</p><p>But he also has reservations about the concept of an algorithm regulator. \"If every country's regulator wants to control the news feed, well, if Donald Trump is in power in the US - if he starts saying everything is fake news, do we really want him having the power to implement that on Facebook? Maybe a regulator tweaking the algorithm is going to work in a way that you really don't want it to work.\"</p><p>An international outlook</p><p>After Sims finished his press conference in Sydney, he immediately starting working the phones, calling his counterparts within the international regulatory community and the influential Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to drum up support for his proposals.</p><p>He has been flooded with speaking offers and will visit the US early next year to talk through his ideas. Sims has made little secret of his desire to generate global momentum for the measures he unveiled this week.</p><p>\"Our report is extremely timely. Governments overseas are looking at Facebook and Google, we have come up with information that others haven't had,\" he said. \"Our report will feed into that international discussion of these issues. We are very well connected with our international counterparts.\"</p><p>The tech companies are expected to formally respond in February. Then, in June, the ACCC will deliver its final report, with recommendations to the government.</p><p>It might well be a different government by then, with a federal election likely in May. But that is unlikely to change the politics of this report. It is hard to see anyone opposing more regulation of the digital giants (or conversely, standing up for them).</p><p>\"We would argue consumers underestimate how much of their data is being collected from them, and overestimate the level of control they have over that,\" Sims said this week.</p><p>\"You can't separate privacy from looking at Google and Facebook. Their business system is gathering data about you and they do that in many more ways than you think.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNBTOL-1520080726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNBTOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYS-8P91-DY19-C44G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437139</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1329\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The regulatory departments inside the two digital behemoths had been bracing for this moment for a while. But when it came, it turned out worse than they'd feared.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When you have market power, which both Google and Facebook have, with that comes special responsibilities,\" Rod Sims, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, declared at a press conference in Sydney, where it was lunchtime on Monday. \"And that means, also, additional scrutiny.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sims had been tasked by the Australian government with investigating the impact of Google and Facebook on traditional media. He had assembled a team of 14 investigators, lawyers and economists to work with him on the probe. Half of them were under the age of 30.</p><p>Being a government department, they used Microsoft's Outlook email client and the Skype instant-messaging service rather than (Facebook-owned) WhatsApp or (Google's) Gmail to communicate.</p><p>The wide-ranging, \"world first\" probe was secured by the Nick Xenophon Team in the manoeuvring the over the repeal of cross-media ownership laws last year.</p><p>But, following a string of scandals involving the two digital behemoths, including massive privacy breaches, the spread of fake news and revelations the platforms had been manipulated by Russian hackers, it took on added global significance.</p><p>\"We have formed the view they [Google and Facebook] have got market power, they have significantly disrupted media, journalism and their business models,\" said Sims. \"We recognise in market economies you do have creative destruction ... but I think great care needs to be taken when it comes to talking about news and journalism. News and journalism play a critical role in our society.\"</p><p>His words were music to the ears of traditional publishers.</p><p>Led by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, they have for years bemoaned the digital duoploy's stranglehold over the online advertising market, and their comparative lack of regulation and accountability. For a sober, independent government body to agree with this view, following an exhaustive, year-long analysis, was a striking vindication of that position.</p><p>Yet for the digital giants, the ACCC's findings were troubling, and risked setting a global precedent.</p><p>Among other things, the regulator proposed a new body to monitor the algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook's news feed, and the traffic they send to publishers. It would also scrutinise their conduct in the advertising market, including the way they price ads and claims over their efficacy.</p><p>The ACCC also proposed a new ombudsman to monitor consumer complaints (similar to the bodies that exist for other industries such as telecommunications and financial services) as well as measures to prevent the digital giants from collecting data without clear and unambiguous consent of users.</p><p>Facebook has come out hard against the concept of an algorithm regulator, describing the proposal as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/unworkable-unnecessary-unprecedented-facebook-hits-back-at-accc-20181212-p50lvk.html\">\"unworkable\", \"unnecessary\" and \"unprecedented\"</url>.</p><p>Google (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/google-ceo-explains-to-congress-why-trump-comes-up-when-you-search-idiot-20181212-p50ln9.html\">whose CEO Sundar Pichai was grilled by US politicians in Washington</url> this week over similar issues) has been slower to respond.</p><p>The two digital giants have a collective market value north of $US1 trillion and almost unfathomable power. They may be chastened, but they won't accept the ACCCs recommendations without a fight.</p><p>The view from Silicon Valley</p><p>Silicon Valley has a fierce anti-authority streak and typically isn't supportive of added regulation. But unlike the furore over Australia's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/police-spies-gain-powers-to-access-encrypted-messages-after-political-deal-struck-20181204-p50k74.html\">recent encryption laws</url>, the response to the ACCC inquiry was broadly positive.</p><p>\"Coming the off the lows of that encryption debacle, this is at the other end of the spectrum,\" says James Allworth, an Australian tech executive based in San Francisco who hosts the widely followed Exponent.fm podcast.</p><p>\"It was clear they have a pretty solid understanding of the dynamics. On the whole I would say their assessment, their diagnosis of the situation, is pretty accurate.\"</p><p>That said, scepticism about the ACCC's ability to actually regulate two of the most powerful companies history remains.</p><p>\"I deeply suspect that the solution to media's woes is not going to come from another regulator,\" says Sydney entrepreneur Mark Tanner, who worked for Google in Sydney and New York. \"There are legitimate social problems these companies have created with their algorithms, but I don't think this addresses that.\"</p><p>Traditional media companies are bound by defamation laws, the Australian Press Council, and the Australian Communications and Media Authority. That Facebook and Google are comparatively under-regulated is undeniable.</p><p>Still, it is hard to fathom how a government body would be able to manage the task of monitoring their algorithms.</p><p>\"There is not like, one person at Google who understands how its search engine works,\" says Tanner. \"It has got to be millions and millions and millions of lines of code, written by thousands of engineers, drawing on thousands of databases, some of which are truly gigantic. I don't understand how you'd do that.\"</p><p>These days, Tanner runs his own start-up, Qwilr, which makes tools to create advanced pitch documents used by sales and marketing teams. He acknowledges that the dominance of Google and Facebook is an issue for businesses like his.</p><p>\"As far as a start-up is concerned, the challenge is that there is no where else to go for that type of ad; they are the only two shops in town, and they are getting expensive as more and more companies move their ad spend there,\" he says.</p><p>Allworth says Facebook's aggressive response to the report was telling. \"Their [Facebook's] reaction was not 'we happy to work with regulators'. It was straight out of the gate 'No'. Which means, maybe they [the regulators] are on to something here.\"</p><p>But he also has reservations about the concept of an algorithm regulator. \"If every country's regulator wants to control the news feed, well, if Donald Trump is in power in the US - if he starts saying everything is fake news, do we really want him having the power to implement that on Facebook? Maybe a regulator tweaking the algorithm is going to work in a way that you really don't want it to work.\"</p><p>An international outlook</p><p>After Sims finished his press conference in Sydney, he immediately starting working the phones, calling his counterparts within the international regulatory community and the influential Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to drum up support for his proposals.</p><p>He has been flooded with speaking offers and will visit the US early next year to talk through his ideas. Sims has made little secret of his desire to generate global momentum for the measures he unveiled this week.</p><p>\"Our report is extremely timely. Governments overseas are looking at Facebook and Google, we have come up with information that others haven't had,\" he said. \"Our report will feed into that international discussion of these issues. We are very well connected with our international counterparts.\"</p><p>The tech companies are expected to formally respond in February. Then, in June, the ACCC will deliver its final report, with recommendations to the government.</p><p>It might well be a different government by then, with a federal election likely in May. But that is unlikely to change the politics of this report. It is hard to see anyone opposing more regulation of the digital giants (or conversely, standing up for them).</p><p>\"We would argue consumers underestimate how much of their data is being collected from them, and overestimate the level of control they have over that,\" Sims said this week.</p><p>\"You can't separate privacy from looking at Google and Facebook. Their business system is gathering data about you and they do that in many more ways than you think.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520080726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYN-K941-JBJ7-N4WS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1329\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The regulatory departments inside the two digital behemoths had been bracing for this moment for a while. But when it came, it turned out worse than they'd feared.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When you have market power, which both Google and Facebook have, with that comes special responsibilities,\" Rod Sims, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, declared at a press conference in Sydney, where it was lunchtime on Monday. \"And that means, also, additional scrutiny.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sims had been tasked by the Australian government with investigating the impact of Google and Facebook on traditional media. He had assembled a team of 14 investigators, lawyers and economists to work with him on the probe. Half of them were under the age of 30.</p><p>Being a government department, they used Microsoft's Outlook email client and the Skype instant-messaging service rather than (Facebook-owned) WhatsApp or (Google's) Gmail to communicate.</p><p>The wide-ranging, \"world first\" probe was secured by the Nick Xenophon Team in the manoeuvring the over the repeal of cross-media ownership laws last year.</p><p>But, following a string of scandals involving the two digital behemoths, including massive privacy breaches, the spread of fake news and revelations the platforms had been manipulated by Russian hackers, it took on added global significance.</p><p>\"We have formed the view they [Google and Facebook] have got market power, they have significantly disrupted media, journalism and their business models,\" said Sims. \"We recognise in market economies you do have creative destruction ... but I think great care needs to be taken when it comes to talking about news and journalism. News and journalism play a critical role in our society.\"</p><p>His words were music to the ears of traditional publishers.</p><p>Led by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, they have for years bemoaned the digital duoploy's stranglehold over the online advertising market, and their comparative lack of regulation and accountability. For a sober, independent government body to agree with this view, following an exhaustive, year-long analysis, was a striking vindication of that position.</p><p>Yet for the digital giants, the ACCC's findings were troubling, and risked setting a global precedent.</p><p>Among other things, the regulator proposed a new body to monitor the algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook's news feed, and the traffic they send to publishers. It would also scrutinise their conduct in the advertising market, including the way they price ads and claims over their efficacy.</p><p>The ACCC also proposed a new ombudsman to monitor consumer complaints (similar to the bodies that exist for other industries such as telecommunications and financial services) as well as measures to prevent the digital giants from collecting data without clear and unambiguous consent of users.</p><p>Facebook has come out hard against the concept of an algorithm regulator, describing the proposal as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/unworkable-unnecessary-unprecedented-facebook-hits-back-at-accc-20181212-p50lvk.html\">\"unworkable\", \"unnecessary\" and \"unprecedented\"</url>.</p><p>Google (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/google-ceo-explains-to-congress-why-trump-comes-up-when-you-search-idiot-20181212-p50ln9.html\">whose CEO Sundar Pichai was grilled by US politicians in Washington</url> this week over similar issues) has been slower to respond.</p><p>The two digital giants have a collective market value north of $US1 trillion and almost unfathomable power. They may be chastened, but they won't accept the ACCCs recommendations without a fight.</p><p>The view from Silicon Valley</p><p>Silicon Valley has a fierce anti-authority streak and typically isn't supportive of added regulation. But unlike the furore over Australia's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/police-spies-gain-powers-to-access-encrypted-messages-after-political-deal-struck-20181204-p50k74.html\">recent encryption laws</url>, the response to the ACCC inquiry was broadly positive.</p><p>\"Coming the off the lows of that encryption debacle, this is at the other end of the spectrum,\" says James Allworth, an Australian tech executive based in San Francisco who hosts the widely followed Exponent.fm podcast.</p><p>\"It was clear they have a pretty solid understanding of the dynamics. On the whole I would say their assessment, their diagnosis of the situation, is pretty accurate.\"</p><p>That said, scepticism about the ACCC's ability to actually regulate two of the most powerful companies history remains.</p><p>\"I deeply suspect that the solution to media's woes is not going to come from another regulator,\" says Sydney entrepreneur Mark Tanner, who worked for Google in Sydney and New York. \"There are legitimate social problems these companies have created with their algorithms, but I don't think this addresses that.\"</p><p>Traditional media companies are bound by defamation laws, the Australian Press Council, and the Australian Communications and Media Authority. That Facebook and Google are comparatively under-regulated is undeniable.</p><p>Still, it is hard to fathom how a government body would be able to manage the task of monitoring their algorithms.</p><p>\"There is not like, one person at Google who understands how its search engine works,\" says Tanner. \"It has got to be millions and millions and millions of lines of code, written by thousands of engineers, drawing on thousands of databases, some of which are truly gigantic. I don't understand how you'd do that.\"</p><p>These days, Tanner runs his own start-up, Qwilr, which makes tools to create advanced pitch documents used by sales and marketing teams. He acknowledges that the dominance of Google and Facebook is an issue for businesses like his.</p><p>\"As far as a start-up is concerned, the challenge is that there is no where else to go for that type of ad; they are the only two shops in town, and they are getting expensive as more and more companies move their ad spend there,\" he says.</p><p>Allworth says Facebook's aggressive response to the report was telling. \"Their [Facebook's] reaction was not 'we happy to work with regulators'. It was straight out of the gate 'No'. Which means, maybe they [the regulators] are on to something here.\"</p><p>But he also has reservations about the concept of an algorithm regulator. \"If every country's regulator wants to control the news feed, well, if Donald Trump is in power in the US - if he starts saying everything is fake news, do we really want him having the power to implement that on Facebook? Maybe a regulator tweaking the algorithm is going to work in a way that you really don't want it to work.\"</p><p>An international outlook</p><p>After Sims finished his press conference in Sydney, he immediately starting working the phones, calling his counterparts within the international regulatory community and the influential Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to drum up support for his proposals.</p><p>He has been flooded with speaking offers and will visit the US early next year to talk through his ideas. Sims has made little secret of his desire to generate global momentum for the measures he unveiled this week.</p><p>\"Our report is extremely timely. Governments overseas are looking at Facebook and Google, we have come up with information that others haven't had,\" he said. \"Our report will feed into that international discussion of these issues. We are very well connected with our international counterparts.\"</p><p>The tech companies are expected to formally respond in February. Then, in June, the ACCC will deliver its final report, with recommendations to the government.</p><p>It might well be a different government by then, with a federal election likely in May. But that is unlikely to change the politics of this report. It is hard to see anyone opposing more regulation of the digital giants (or conversely, standing up for them).</p><p>\"We would argue consumers underestimate how much of their data is being collected from them, and overestimate the level of control they have over that,\" Sims said this week.</p><p>\"You can't separate privacy from looking at Google and Facebook. Their business system is gathering data about you and they do that in many more ways than you think.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520080726</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYS-8P91-DY19-C449-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1329\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The regulatory departments inside the two digital behemoths had been bracing for this moment for a while. But when it came, it turned out worse than they'd feared.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"When you have market power, which both Google and Facebook have, with that comes special responsibilities,\" Rod Sims, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, declared at a press conference in Sydney, where it was lunchtime on Monday. \"And that means, also, additional scrutiny.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sims had been tasked by the Australian government with investigating the impact of Google and Facebook on traditional media. He had assembled a team of 14 investigators, lawyers and economists to work with him on the probe. Half of them were under the age of 30.</p><p>Being a government department, they used Microsoft's Outlook email client and the Skype instant-messaging service rather than (Facebook-owned) WhatsApp or (Google's) Gmail to communicate.</p><p>The wide-ranging, \"world first\" probe was secured by the Nick Xenophon Team in the manoeuvring the over the repeal of cross-media ownership laws last year.</p><p>But, following a string of scandals involving the two digital behemoths, including massive privacy breaches, the spread of fake news and revelations the platforms had been manipulated by Russian hackers, it took on added global significance.</p><p>\"We have formed the view they [Google and Facebook] have got market power, they have significantly disrupted media, journalism and their business models,\" said Sims. \"We recognise in market economies you do have creative destruction ... but I think great care needs to be taken when it comes to talking about news and journalism. News and journalism play a critical role in our society.\"</p><p>His words were music to the ears of traditional publishers.</p><p>Led by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, they have for years bemoaned the digital duoploy's stranglehold over the online advertising market, and their comparative lack of regulation and accountability. For a sober, independent government body to agree with this view, following an exhaustive, year-long analysis, was a striking vindication of that position.</p><p>Yet for the digital giants, the ACCC's findings were troubling, and risked setting a global precedent.</p><p>Among other things, the regulator proposed a new body to monitor the algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook's news feed, and the traffic they send to publishers. It would also scrutinise their conduct in the advertising market, including the way they price ads and claims over their efficacy.</p><p>The ACCC also proposed a new ombudsman to monitor consumer complaints (similar to the bodies that exist for other industries such as telecommunications and financial services) as well as measures to prevent the digital giants from collecting data without clear and unambiguous consent of users.</p><p>Facebook has come out hard against the concept of an algorithm regulator, describing the proposal as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/unworkable-unnecessary-unprecedented-facebook-hits-back-at-accc-20181212-p50lvk.html\">\"unworkable\", \"unnecessary\" and \"unprecedented\"</url>.</p><p>Google (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/google-ceo-explains-to-congress-why-trump-comes-up-when-you-search-idiot-20181212-p50ln9.html\">whose CEO Sundar Pichai was grilled by US politicians in Washington</url> this week over similar issues) has been slower to respond.</p><p>The two digital giants have a collective market value north of $US1 trillion and almost unfathomable power. They may be chastened, but they won't accept the ACCCs recommendations without a fight.</p><p>The view from Silicon Valley</p><p>Silicon Valley has a fierce anti-authority streak and typically isn't supportive of added regulation. But unlike the furore over Australia's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/police-spies-gain-powers-to-access-encrypted-messages-after-political-deal-struck-20181204-p50k74.html\">recent encryption laws</url>, the response to the ACCC inquiry was broadly positive.</p><p>\"Coming the off the lows of that encryption debacle, this is at the other end of the spectrum,\" says James Allworth, an Australian tech executive based in San Francisco who hosts the widely followed Exponent.fm podcast.</p><p>\"It was clear they have a pretty solid understanding of the dynamics. On the whole I would say their assessment, their diagnosis of the situation, is pretty accurate.\"</p><p>That said, scepticism about the ACCC's ability to actually regulate two of the most powerful companies history remains.</p><p>\"I deeply suspect that the solution to media's woes is not going to come from another regulator,\" says Sydney entrepreneur Mark Tanner, who worked for Google in Sydney and New York. \"There are legitimate social problems these companies have created with their algorithms, but I don't think this addresses that.\"</p><p>Traditional media companies are bound by defamation laws, the Australian Press Council, and the Australian Communications and Media Authority. That Facebook and Google are comparatively under-regulated is undeniable.</p><p>Still, it is hard to fathom how a government body would be able to manage the task of monitoring their algorithms.</p><p>\"There is not like, one person at Google who understands how its search engine works,\" says Tanner. \"It has got to be millions and millions and millions of lines of code, written by thousands of engineers, drawing on thousands of databases, some of which are truly gigantic. I don't understand how you'd do that.\"</p><p>These days, Tanner runs his own start-up, Qwilr, which makes tools to create advanced pitch documents used by sales and marketing teams. He acknowledges that the dominance of Google and Facebook is an issue for businesses like his.</p><p>\"As far as a start-up is concerned, the challenge is that there is no where else to go for that type of ad; they are the only two shops in town, and they are getting expensive as more and more companies move their ad spend there,\" he says.</p><p>Allworth says Facebook's aggressive response to the report was telling. \"Their [Facebook's] reaction was not 'we happy to work with regulators'. It was straight out of the gate 'No'. Which means, maybe they [the regulators] are on to something here.\"</p><p>But he also has reservations about the concept of an algorithm regulator. \"If every country's regulator wants to control the news feed, well, if Donald Trump is in power in the US - if he starts saying everything is fake news, do we really want him having the power to implement that on Facebook? Maybe a regulator tweaking the algorithm is going to work in a way that you really don't want it to work.\"</p><p>An international outlook</p><p>After Sims finished his press conference in Sydney, he immediately starting working the phones, calling his counterparts within the international regulatory community and the influential Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to drum up support for his proposals.</p><p>He has been flooded with speaking offers and will visit the US early next year to talk through his ideas. Sims has made little secret of his desire to generate global momentum for the measures he unveiled this week.</p><p>\"Our report is extremely timely. Governments overseas are looking at Facebook and Google, we have come up with information that others haven't had,\" he said. \"Our report will feed into that international discussion of these issues. We are very well connected with our international counterparts.\"</p><p>The tech companies are expected to formally respond in February. Then, in June, the ACCC will deliver its final report, with recommendations to the government.</p><p>It might well be a different government by then, with a federal election likely in May. But that is unlikely to change the politics of this report.

Here's a look at the challenges they will face this year</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last year, Facebook, Google and Tesla in particular faced widespread criticism from both inside and outside their respective companies. The wounds were largely self-inflicted, as some of the world's biggest innovators grappled with their outsized influence in every aspect of our lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's unlikely that any of these companies will fail in 2019, but what is likely is that the tech giants will continue to lose the trust of the public at large, unless they do something about it.</p><p>It wasn't always this way. Technology at its best gave a voice to the voiceless, enabled instant communication across borders and enabled new businesses to form that would not have been possible otherwise. Tech got lost along the way, however. It has given rise to fake news, has divided societies along political fault lines like never before, and invaded the most intimate aspects of our daily lives. The tech giants of today are facing something of an identity crisis, unsure of their roles and responsibilities and under more pressure than ever before. Social media giants such as Facebook and Twitter are no longer allowed to be neutral platforms, and have been forced to remove hate speech and actively police what can be said and what cannot. To date they haven't been up to the task, with users becoming increasingly disillusioned with what used to be merely fun places to hang out online.</p><p>Governments, including in Australia, are beginning to intervene. Google has been fined $80 million by French data regulator CNIL for breaching the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which passed in May 2017, in what's now the biggest fine levied under that rule. The fine was doled out for Google's failures of transparency and consent over how the company was monetising user data, an issue that will be probed by the ACCC in Australia this year. The EU has been on the front foot when regulating the big technology giants for years now, having set firm rules for what data they can collect from users and what they can do with it.</p><p>So 2019 will be the year in which Australia's role in reining in the world's tech giants will become clear, as will the question of just how much the world falls out of love with these companies that have kept us hooked for so long</p><p>FACEBOOK The social media giant faced relentless questioning in 2018 - from the US Congress, which probed it about election meddling, to more existential questions from inside and outside the company about what role Facebook plays in our lives and whether it's a social good or otherwise. That's only set to deepen in 2019 and Australia will be a key proving ground for the company, with the ACCC announcing an inquiry into its algorithms as well as its effect on the media and our lives more broadly.</p><p>For all of the uncertainty surrounding Facebook, one thing is clear: Mark Zuckerberg will remain its CEO, unless he volunteers to step down. The way the company's board and voting rights are structured means that even if the board turns on \"Zuck\", it has no mechanism for removing him - the CEO has about 60 per cent voting power.</p><p>One moment to watch for in 2019 is a vote on a proposal to oust Zuckerberg, set to go to the Facebook board in May. The proposal, filed by New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer along with US state treasurers from Illinois, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania, accuses Zuckerberg of mishandling company scandals, including huge security breaches and the spread of misinformation, or \"fake news\". Many experts believe this is simply a symbolic move intended to put pressure on the company's co-founder.</p><p>It is, however, just one example of the way Facebook is fighting to establish its identity and right a ship that for some time now has seemed off course.</p><p>GOOGLE Alphabet-owned Google was one of the few tech companies caught up in the #MeToo movement of last year, with about 20,000 employees, including some in Sydney, walking out, protesting against the way the company has handled sexual harassment allegations.</p><p>The revolt focused on one case in particular: Andy Rubin, the founder of Google's mobile operating system Android, had received a $US90 million ($125 million) payout after leaving the company despite having a credible complaint of sexual misconduct against him from another Google employee.</p><p>There's little to suggest the mass protests will have a material impact on the company's revenues or its broader business strategy, but they do represent a growing frustration from inside Google, which also extends to the company's controversial China strategy and its projects for the US military.</p><p>As well as internal pressures, in 2019 Google will face the same ACCC inquiry as Facebook, which is sure to throw up some uncomfortable questions.</p><p>Ultimately, however, Alphabet is a very different beast from, say, Facebook, with its business units spanning not just search and social but also self-driving cars, broadband and even hot air balloons. That diversity of operations means it is well positioned to take on whatever tech trends the future holds, however far-fetched they seem</p><p>APPLEApple and its boss Tim Cook are under pressure this year for a very simple reason: they're not selling enough iPhones. The days when Apple superfans would queue for blocks for the latest device have long gone, replaced by a widespread apathy about phones that are slightly thinner and have slightly bigger displays each year. On January 2, Apple issued a rare earnings revision, slashing quarterly estimates for the first time in 16 years.</p><p>The company has been hardest hit in China, where consumers are opting for cheaper phones. \"Lower than anticipated iPhone revenue, primarily in Greater China, accounts for all of our revenue shortfall to our guidance and for much more than our entire year-on-year revenue decline,\" Cook said.</p><p>\"In some developed markets iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be.\" Cook has long faced questions about whether he can continue innovating at the pace of his predecessor, the late Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. Cook's tenure has focused less on flashy devices and more on the services component of Apple's business, which includes Apple Music, Apple iCloud and Apple Pay. Some investors are beginning to get restless, however, and Apple is looking less invincible than it did only six months ago, when it was the world's most valuable company. It doesn't need a massive new product - a TV or a car, for example - to succeed in 2019, but it does need to find a way to get customers excited about its products once again.</p><p>TWITTER One of the few tech giants to enjoy a solid 2018, Twitter was admittedly coming off a lower base than some of its peers, but it had a positive, if unspectacular, year. Its shares dipped in December when one analyst called it the \"Harvey Weinstein of social media\" after Amnesty International research declared it \"a toxic place for women\". And while the platform is still littered with hate messages from trolls (and the US President), Twitter is delivering where it counts - revenue growth.</p><p>At the end of 2018, it posted its fourth straight quarter of profitability, in Q3 reporting a revenue increase of 29 per cent year-on-year due to strong advertising sales. The fact it has flown under the radar compared to rivals such as Facebook means it has a lot of potential to still hit the mainstream. Moves such as acquiring sports rights and becoming the best place to consume breaking news mean 2019 could be Twitter's year.</p><p>AMAZON Jeff Bezos' e-commerce behemoth is, much like Facebook and Alphabet, far more influential and wide-reaching than when it was launched more than two decades ago. Amazon has grown from a modest online book retailer to - at the time of publishing - the world's most valuable company, outstripping even Apple as the king of big tech. It has largely managed to avoid some of the scandals that have plagued its peers, though it does receive regular criticism for the treatment of its factory workers, who often describe a culture of obscene pressure and mistreatment.</p><p>The question for Amazon in 2019 is: can it continue to be everything to everyone, or will it be stretched too thin?

Amid persistently low interest rates, German banks' operating income, calculated as the sum of net interest income, net commission income, trading result and other operating income, was down by 3.8% on the year to \u20ac123.1 billion. This was mainly due to the considerable decline in net interest income, which could only be partly compensated for by the increase in net commission income. It was not possible to offset this shortfall through other profit contributions from operating business since the rise in the trading result and the decline in the other operating result - both of which largely affected the big banks sector - cancelled each other out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a comparison of categories of banks, profit (loss) from operating business showed mixed trends. Big banks and Landesbanken, as well as mortgage banks, reported a considerable decline in net interest income amidst falling total assets. Since this decline could not be offset by other net earnings from operating business, operating income in these categories of banks contracted markedly.</p><p>By contrast, savings banks and credit cooperatives (primary institutions), whose business is largely dependent on interest income, as well as regional and other commercial banks, experienced a moderate decline in their net interest income, which was supported once again by an expansion in these institutions' credit volume. However, since at the same time net commission income grew considerably more strongly than in earlier years, operating income among these categories of banks rose slightly.</p><p>To further stabilise their net interest income, credit institutions increasingly cut their deposit rates even into negative territory. According to statements by the credit institutions, for the most part only large-volume sight deposits in corporate banking business have been affected thus far.</p><p>At all events, aggregated across all German banks, the cost-cutting measures already taken have only managed to offset the cost- driving factors. Given virtually no change in administrative spending, the cost/income ratio deteriorated by 2.6 percentage points to 71.9%.</p><p>The profit for the financial year before tax was down by \u20ac0.3 billion from the previous year yet, at \u20ac27.4 billion, was once again well in excess of its long-term average. This trend was bolstered by the favourable economic framework conditions and the once again very low net expenditure on risk provisioning. Of the annual profit, on balance \u20ac12.7 billion was transferred to balance sheet capital (total equity including the fund for general banking risks).</p><p>I Banks' business environment</p><p>Low interest rate environment still determining banks' performance</p><p>The financial market environment remained challenging in the reporting year. As in previous years, German banks' operating business was shaped by negative interest rates in the money and capital markets. The business policy and competition-driven de facto zero lower bound prevented the widespread passing-on of negative interest rates, particularly on households' deposits. Competition with institutional investors and with non-bank providers of digital financial services additionally squeezed profit margins. The fact that little risk provisioning was needed, to which the upbeat economy contributed,1 proved a driver of performance, however. Overall, the German economy expanded by a price and calendar-adjusted rate of 2.5% on the year in 2017.</p><p>Eurosystem monetary policy measures key driver behind further increase in excess liquidity...</p><p>Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the Eurosystem has adopted various non-standard monetary policy measures. Among these, the expanded asset purchase programme (APP), in particular, was designed to reduce the longerrun interest rate when the de facto zero lower bound on interest rates had nearly been reached.2 The monetary policy measures improved funding conditions and were responsible in great measure for a renewed distinct rise in German institutions' excess liquidity.3 Looking at the annual average, this metric doubled from the previous year to around 6% of the German banking system's aggregate total assets.</p><p>... and persistent pressure on margins</p><p>The low level of interest rates associated with the accommodative monetary policy measures and the flat yield curve, along with the negative interest rate on banks' excess deposits with the Eurosystem, which has stood at -0.4% since 16 March 2016, reduced banks' net interest income, ceteris paribus. Thus, the interest costs of excess liquidity grew considerably to \u20ac2.2 billion.4 Those German institutions which regularly take part in the Eurosystem's Bank Lending Survey (BLS) reported that the expanded APP and the negative interest rate on the deposit facility have been squeezing net interest margins.5</p><p>Consolidation in banking sector still continues</p><p>Smaller and medium-sized banks, in particular, encountered increased pressure to merge to form larger units in order to reduce costs through economies of scale. The consolidation process in the German banking sector has thus perpetuated itself.6 In the course of the year, the number of credit institutions covered by statistics on the profit and loss accounts fell by 73. This was mainly due to mergers in the cooperative and savings bank sectors. In the Landesbanken sector, too, the challenges posed by the shipping crisis led to the merger of two institutions. The following figures are based on a reporting population of 1,538 institutions with total assets of \u20ac8.2 trillion.</p><p>I Underlying trends in banking business</p><p>Diverging trend in operating business</p><p>In a comparison of categories of banks, profit (loss) from operating business showed diverging trends.</p><p>- Big banks and Landesbanken, as well as mortgage banks, again reported a perceptible decline in net interest income amid falling total assets. Since this decline could not be offset by other net earnings from operat ing business, operating income in these categories of banks contracted markedly.</p><p>- By contrast, savings banks and credit cooperatives, whose business is largely dependent on interest income, as well as regional and other commercial banks, experienced a moderate decline in their net interest income, which was boosted once again by an expansion in their credit volume. However, since at the same time net commission income grew considerably more strongly than in earlier years, operating income among these categories of banks rose slightly.</p><p>This means that many banks have successfully put into practice the plans they announced in the 2015 and 2017 low interest rate surveys to increasingly use higher net commission income to offset the shrinking margins in interest business. Building and loan associations were the only banking category to record growth in net interest income, largely on account of the elimination of a one-off effect relating to a building and loan association a year earlier. Their operating income consequently rose perceptibly during the year under review.</p><p>I Net interest income down perceptibly</p><p>Net interest income - the most important source of operating income</p><p>Net interest income is defined as the contribution to performance by directly interest-related business (net interest income in the narrower sense)7 plus current income8 and income from profit transfers.9 Current income and income from profit transfers, which are relatively volatile components, are largely an issue for the big banks which have international operations. Net interest income aggregated across all banks accounts for 73.0% of operating income on a long-term average, making it by far the most important source of income for German banks. It contracted by 6.2% on the year to \u20ac85.5 billion. Its share of operating income, at 69.5%, was also down by 1.7 percentage points.</p><p>Perceptible reduction in contribution to earnings from directly interestrelated business</p><p>Net interest income in the narrower sense shrank by 7.0% to \u20ac71.1 billion across all banks. Perceptible factors in this development were the gradual expiry of higher-yielding existing business and the still-sluggish passing-on of negative interest rates, especially on households' sight deposits. Interest income fell more sharply than interest expenditure, both relative to total assets. Among the income components included in net interest income apart from directly interest-related business, current income from shares and other variable-yield securities improved considerably by \u20ac1.1 billion to \u20ac6.9 billion owing to the favourable economy, while current income from participating inter ests and shares in affiliated enterprises, at \u20ac4.2 billion, remained at the previous year's level. Income from profit transfers decreased by \u20ac1.3 billion to \u20ac3.4 billion. All together, net income contributions outside directly interest-related business shrank by 2.1% to \u20ac14.4 billion.</p><p>Interbank market interest rates still at all-time lows</p><p>As in previous years, banks benefited from a favourable funding situation. The interest rates on the main refinancing operations, the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility of the Eurosystem remained at their all-time lows of, respectively, 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% during the year under review. Interest rates in the interbank market likewise remained in the vicinity of their all-time lows the entire year. In December, the monthly average interest rate EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) on unsecured money market transactions in interbank trading with a maturity of three months stood at -0.33%, and the unsecured interbank overnight interest rate EONIA (Euro OverNight Index Average) stood at -0.34%.</p><p>Big banks and Landesbanken used marketbased funding at favourable rates</p><p>Targeted measures by the Landesbanken and mortgage banks to shrink their balance sheets were largely responsible for the diminishing importance of market-based financing for the German banking system after 2008.10 This shrinkage process decelerated beginning in 2015, however. Since then, negotiable debt securities have accounted for around 15% of total assets. Big banks and mortgage banks, in particular, have increasingly been resorting to capital market funding at very favourable terms and conditions. During the year under review, investors were primarily interested in shorter maturities up to and including four years. Net issuance in this segment amounted to \u20ac8.5 billion. Investors' preference for liquidity was probably a factor in the reduced interest in the maturity segment of over four years, where redemptions exceeded issuance by \u20ac2.5 billion on balance.</p><p>Further shortening of maturities on the liabilities side boosting earnings from maturity transformation</p><p>Given that negative interest rates have still not been extensively passed through to households and that non-banks continue to prefer highly liquid, low-risk forms of investment, the buildup of sight deposits in progress since the autumn of 2008 has continued. All other types of deposits have seen net outflows. Non-banks' sight deposits as a percentage of all German banks' aggregate total assets have gone up by 1.7 percentage points to 26.2%. As was already the case in earlier years, this development has been driven by domestic households' investment behaviour. Given a further improvement in the income and wealth situation, these bank clients' sight deposit volume grew by 1.4 percentage points to just over 14.4% of aggregate total assets, although the MFI interest rate statistics show this form of investment, with an average remuneration of 0.04%, to have generated practically no return to speak of. The attendant persisting shortening of maturities on the liabilities side led to more and more loans with long interest rate lock-in periods being financed on a very short-term basis. Banks with deposit-based funding, in particular, were thus able to further increase the contribution made by on-balance sheet maturity transformation to net income (structural contribution11) and thus bolster somewhat the ever-shrinking contribution to net income being made by interest-related business. Were interest rates to rise, however, it is highly probable that the interest rate risk and liquidity risk incurred through the considerable expansion of maturity transformation would materialise, impacting adversely on earnings. At the primary institutions, whose focus is on traditional deposit and lending business, non-banks' sight deposits made up nearly half of total assets in the year under review. Meanwhile, long-term loans to non-banks12 accounted for just over 58% of savings banks' total assets and just over 55% of credit cooperatives' total assets.</p><p>Higher interest expenditure due to negative interest rates</p><p>In order to gain a better overview of the impact of negative interest rates on profitability, the annual reports of 30 institutions from various categories of banks, accounting for a combined nearly two-thirds of all German banks' total assets, were again reviewed for data on negative and positive interest rates.13 It was found that interest expenditure on asset items rose considerably by \u20ac1.1 billion to \u20ac2.7 billion. However, interest received on liability items also went up, by \u20ac0.8 billion to \u20ac2.2 billion. At \u20ac0.5 billion, the net expenditure was nearly twice as high as one year earlier. Twelve banks posted a positive balance totalling \u20ac0.3 billion, while 17 banks reported a negative contribution to the result totalling \u20ac0.8 billion. One bank broke even.</p><p>Pass-through of negative interest rates ...</p><p>According to statements made in the 2017 low interest rate survey, the surveyed institutions expect the already considerably diminished spread of deposits-based funding over the price of matched-maturity funding in the money or capital markets (liabilities-side margin contribution) to shrink further in the coming years. This negative expectation regarding the development of net interest income is probably related in large part to the competition-driven de facto zero lower bound. In the target scenario of the low interest rate survey, passing negative interest rates through to clients is an option for only one in four institutions. The number of credit institutions to already have made use of this option in the year under review, however, has risen considerably. This is borne out by the figures published in the MFI interest rate statistics, which are conducted monthly as a partial survey and, at the end of the year under review, comprised 223 institu tions.14 Over the course of the year under review, the share of institutions in this partial survey reporting average volume-weighted negative interest rates on sight deposits went up from around 26% in January to just over 50% in December. Large-volume sight deposits in corporate banking business have been primarily affected. The volume of these sight deposits with a negative interest rate rose nearly 9 percentage points between January and December 2017 to just over 40% of all sight deposits in corporate banking business reported in this partial survey. Around half of this volume of sight deposits with a negative interest rate was concentrated on seven banks from the cat egories of big banks and Landesbanken. Just over one-third was dispersed across 90 institutions in the savings bank and cooperative bank sectors.</p><p>... increasingly affecting those households' sight deposits</p><p>Banks are increasingly also remunerating households' deposits at negative rates in order to stabilise their interest margins. Among the banks required to report for the MFI interest rate statistics, the number of institutions reporting average volume-weighted negative interest rates on households' sight deposits nearly quadrupled to around 12% over the course of the year. The volume of these negative interest-bearing sight deposits likewise increased significantly over the course of the year to 4% of all households' sight deposits reported in this partial survey, yet fell far short of the figure reached for corporate banking business. As was the case in corporate banking business, these are likely mainly to be largevolume sight deposits. In terms of both the number of institutions and the volume of sight deposits, it was primarily savings banks which remunerated households' sight deposits at negative rates.</p><p>Interest margin narrowed discernibly</p><p>Aggregate total assets across all banks fell slightly to \u20ac8.2 trillion. As a result of the sharper decline in net interest income, the interest margin, calculated as the ratio of net interest income to total assets, narrowed discernibly on the year to 1.04%.15 The interest margin in the narrower sense, which is the ratio of net interest income from interest-related business to interest-bearing assets,16 also dropped markedly to 1.43%. For banks focusing on traditional deposit and lending business, whose earnings are more reliant on maturity transformation, these margins can serve as a key indication of profitability. These institutions include, in particular, savings banks and credit cooperatives. The interest-bearing assets that they hold account for around 80% of total assets, a much higher share than for most of the other categories of banks. In the savings bank sector, the interest margin narrowed to 1.87%, while it shrank markedly to 1.90% in the cooperative bank sector. Nevertheless, these figures were still the best in a comparison of categories of banks.</p><p>Loans to households still driven by housing loans</p><p>Growth in lending to the domestic private sector accelerated markedly. Households, in particular, again recorded large net inflows. Once again, this was driven by loans for house purchase, where growth increased slightly on the year to 4.0%. In addition to German households' very favourable income and asset situation, stable consumer confidence and house holds' upbeat assessment of housing market prospects, the ongoing strong demand for housing loans is also likely to have been spurred on by the still exceptionally favourable financing conditions.17 While MFI interest rate statistics show the interest rate on new loans to households for house purchase with an initial rate fixation period of over ten years to have been, at 1.86% at year-end, above the all-time low of 1.66% recorded in September 2016, it was still extremely low in a long-term comparison.</p><p>Another marked increase in loans to enterprises</p><p>At an annual rate of 4.3%, growth in lending business with domestic non-financial corporations was significantly more lively than in the previous year. This is probably due not only to very low interest rates but also to the high level of capacity utilisation and positive business expectations. In terms of maturities, non-financial corporations continued to show a preference for long-term loans.</p><p>I Net interest income, by category of banks</p><p>Net interest income declining in big banks sector...</p><p>In the big banks sector, the significant contraction In net interest income by almost one-fifth to \u20ac16.4 billion (57.3% of operating income) was primarily on account of the markedly lower contribution to earnings made by net interest income in the narrower sense. This was smaller due to declining interest income coupled with a slight increase in interest expenditure by almost one-quarter to \u20ac9.7 billion. In addition to growing pressure on margins in the low interest rate environment, another contributing factor was the absence of a one-off factor that had markedly benefited one big bank's profits in the previous year. Furthermore, income components outside directly interest-related business shrank by 9.1% to \u20ac6.7 billion. The \u20ac1.0 billion drop in income from profit transfers to \u20ac1.7 billion was offset to only to a small extent by the \u20ac0.3 billion increase in current income to \u20ac5.0 billion. Given that the fall in net interest income was much more pronounced than the reduction in total assets, the interest margin narrowed discernibly to 0.68%.18</p><p>... as well as in Landesbank sector and at mortgage banks</p><p>Lower net interest income at the merged Landesbank (compared to the sum of the two institutions' net interest income in the previous year) and the marked decline in income from profit transfers at another Landesbank played a large part in reducing net interest income by 9.6% to \u20ac6.8 billion (73.9% of operating income) in the Landesbank sector. The interest margin fell moderately to 0.73% amid declining total assets. In the mortgage bank category, net interest income fell by 13.1% to \u20ac1.4 billion. Adjusted for the negative one-off factor at one mortgage bank, net interest income would have risen on the year. Mortgage banks' specific business model means that net interest income is virtually their only source of income.</p><p>Given the slightly negative earnings contributions from net commission income and the other operating result, net interest income as a percentage of operating income overshot the 100% mark once again, hitting 106.5%. As the reduction in total assets was much more pronounced than the loss of net interest income, the interest margin increased slightly to 0.58%. In the case of both Landesbanken and mortgage banks, the major driving force behind the decline in total assets was structural developments.19</p><p>Rising pressure on margins for banks with deposit-based funding</p><p>The effects of margin pressure are becoming ever more visible at savings banks and credit cooperatives. Despite volumes and terms of loans having been increased further, primary institutions' net result from directly interestrelated business fell for the third year in a row. In year-on-year terms, it fell by 5.2% to \u20ac19.1 billion in the case of savings banks and by 2.3% to \u20ac14.9 billion in the case of credit cooperatives. By contrast, current income grew by 16.0% to \u20ac2.8 billion in the case of savings banks and by 19.6% to \u20ac1.6 billion in the case of credit cooperatives. Here, primary institutions generate income from their investments in specialised funds, in particular. All in all, the net interest income earned by savings banks shrank markedly by 2.9% to \u20ac22.0 billion (73.9% of operating income), while, in the case of credit cooperatives, it edged down by 0.6% to \u20ac16.5 billion (75.3% of operating income). However, given that, at 4.2%, the increase in total assets at credit cooperatives was twice as high as at savings banks, the reduction in interest margins in the two categories of banks to 1.90% and 1.87% respectively was more or less identical, at just under 5%. At regional and other commercial banks, which are likewise heavily reliant on deposit-based funding, net interest income fell by 0.9% to \u20ac14.2 billion (64.8% of operating income) amidst a significant rise in total assets.20 The interest margin narrowed substantially to 1.36%. With an increase in total assets,21 building and loan associations recorded growth of 5.2% to \u20ac2.6 billion (92.3% of operating income). At 1.16%, the interest margin was on a par with the previous year's level.</p><p>I Higher contribution to earnings from commissions business</p><p>Marked growth in net commission income</p><p>Net commission income comprises, in particular, fees for giro transactions and payments as well as for securities and safe custody business, and remuneration for brokerage activities relating to loan contracts, savings agreements, savings and loan agreements, and insurance contracts. Accounting for a long-term average share of 22.5% in operating income, net commission income aggregated across all banks is the second most important income component. It rose by 2.7% to \u20ac30.6 billion in the re porting year. Its share of operating income climbed by 1.6 percentage points to 24.8%, thus reaching its highest level since 2009. The commission margin, calculated as the ratio of net commission income to total assets, improved slightly to 0.37%. The rise in net commission income was due not only to an increase in fee-based services, particularly in the field of payments and account management, but also to brokerage income from funds and securities business. The growing importance of higher-yielding forms of investment, such as equity and mixed securities funds, probably had a positive impact here. Although households' preference for low-risk and liquid forms of investment remains high, yield consciousness has increased somewhat compared with previous years.22</p><p>Significant increase in net commission income for most banks relying primarily on interest business</p><p>As announced in the 2015 and 2017 low interest rate surveys, most of the banks surveyed have successfully put into practice their plans to increasingly use higher net commission income to offset the shrinking margins in interest business. Savings banks raised their net commission income by 8.8% to \u20ac7.6 billion (25.5% of operating income), credit cooperatives lifted it by 8.3% to \u20ac5.0 billion (22.7% of operating income), and regional and other commercial banks increased it by 8.1% to \u20ac5.7 billion (26.0% of operating income), with each of these rises being above average. As for big banks, which have a heavy business focus on the international capital markets, net commission income is, with a long-term average share of 33.2%, much more important for operating business than it is for the other categories of banks. Net commission income in the big banks category fell by 5.7% to \u20ac10.2 billion (35.7% of operating income), mainly as a result of declining income from services rendered within the group of one big bank. However, these losses were partly offset by lower costs stemming from intragroup transfer pricing, which had a favourable impact on administrative spending. Net commission income in the Landesbank sector was unchanged on the year at \u20ac1.2 billion (13.4% of operating income). Developments were very mixed in this category of banks.</p><p>I Trading result almost doubled</p><p>Increase driven by developments in big banks sector</p><p>The trading result is a highly volatile income component with a relatively low long-term average share of operating income aggregated across all banks of 2.8%. Institutions report that trading income stems less from proprietary business than from own-account trading in financial instruments on behalf of clients. Big banks and Landesbanken are the main banks to generate earnings from this source. Chiefly as a result of the significantly elevated trading result in the big banks sector, the aggregate trading result across all banks almost doubled to \u20ac5.6 billion (4.5% of operating income).</p><p>I Other operating result down significantly</p><p>Reduction driven by one- off effects</p><p>The other operating result is a summary item used to record income and charges from operating business that have no connection to the net interest, net commission or trading result. Aggregated across all banks, it fell by almost two-thirds to just \u20ac1.5 billion (1.2% of operating income). This development was driven, in particular, by one-off factors in the big banks sector. A further decline was prevented by the again high withdrawals from the fund required by the building and loan association rules (Fonds zur bauspartechnischen Absicherung - FbtA), which building and loan associations reported as other operating income and which, at \u20ac0.7 billion, matched the previous year's re cord high.23 As in the preceding year, these amounts were, for the most part, transferred to the fund for general banking risks in the context of profit appropriation to strengthen balance sheet capital (total equity).</p><p>I Administrative spending still high</p><p>Administrative spending virtually unchanged on previous year</p><p>Banks' cost side is largely determined by administrative spending. This comprises staff costs and other administrative expenditure.24 Standing at \u20ac88.5 billion, this figure was only marginally lower than in the previous year.</p><p>Looking at all banks, at least, the cost-cutting measures already taken therefore only managed to offset the cost-driving factors. The ratio of administrative spending to total assets has actually increased over the past few years.</p><p>Increased spending on pension obligations offset by falling wage and salary costs</p><p>Staff costs include not only wage and salary payments but also social security contributions and operating expenditure on pension obligations. Aggregated across all banks, staff costs remained at the previous year's level (\u20ac44.6 billion), as increased social security contributions and spending on pension obligations were offset by falling wage and salary payments. The renewed drop in the number of employees in the banking sector and modest pay rises set out in pay agreements negotiated in 2016 for the reporting year are likely to have been contributing factors.</p><p>Other administrative spending at previous year's level</p><p>Other administrative spending includes not only the bank levy,25 which amounted to \u20ac1.71 billion for German banks in the reporting year,26 but also the costs associated with maintaining the branch network as well as non-staff costs and expenditure on external services such as legal, auditing, consultancy and IT services. Aggregated across all banks, other administrative spending was also unchanged on the year at \u20ac44.0 billion.</p><p>Administrative spending, by category of banks</p><p>Developments were mixed across categories of banks. In the big banks sector, the reduction in administrative spending by 4.0% to \u20ac25.3 billion was related, above all, to successfully implemented restructuring measures at one big bank and a further decrease in expenditure resulting from intragroup transfer pricing at another big bank. The latter was accompanied by lower net commission income at this big bank. Administrative spending in the Landesbank sector increased by 4.5% to \u20ac6.7 billion, mainly as a result of higher spending on pension obligations. At regional and other commercial banks, both staff costs and other administrative spending went up, meaning that overall administrative costs swelled considerably by 6.2% to \u20ac14.9 billion. As a result of intragroup restructuring measures between a mortgage bank and a building and loan association, administrative expenditure fell by 4.3% to \u20ac0.9 billion at mortgage banks but rose by 5.2% to \u20ac1.9 billion in the building and loan association sector.27 In the savings bank and cooperative bank sectors, administrative spending was down only slightly on the previous year's level (\u20ac20.0 billion and \u20ac14.4 billion respectively). Once again, the high investment costs involved in adapting to technological change and linking digital and conventional access channels to banking services are likely to have watered down the positive effects of the further reduction in the costly branch network.</p><p>Decreased cost efficiency</p><p>The cost/income ratio, calculated as the ratio of administrative spending to operating income, can provide an important indication of how cost-effective an enterprise is. The lower this ratio, the more operating income is left over after deducting administrative spending, i.e. the more cost-efficiently the enterprise has been operating. In view of the fact that administrative outlays remained virtually unchanged and operating income decreased, the efficiency of the German banking sector as measured in this manner was worse in the reporting year than in the previous year, with the cost/income ratio rising to 71.9%. Compared with the previous year, an additional \u20ac2.60 - and, compared with the long-term average, as much as \u20ac4.80 more - in administrative expenditure was needed in order to generate operating income of \u20ac100.</p><p>Cost/ income ratio, by category of banks</p><p>Although the big banks are likely to benefit from economies of scale, they have been the banks with the highest and thus worst cost/income ratio for years. As the decline in operating income was far more pronounced than that in administrative spending, big banks continued to trail behind the other categories of banks in 2017 with a cost/ \u00a1 ncome ratio that rose by 7.3 percentage points to 88.7%. In the case of mortgage banks, where operating income also fell much faster than administrative spending, the ratio increased by as much as 9.2 percentage points to 70.2%. Chiefly on account of falling net interest income and higher administrative spending, the cost/ i ncome ratio in the Landesbank sector was, at 72.5%, the highest and thus worst value recorded for this category of banks in the reporting period since 1999. At regional and other commercial banks, the cost/i ncome ratio rose by 3.8 percentage points to 68.0%, driven by a considerable increase in administrative expenditure. In the building and loan association sector, the ratio hit another all-time low of 66.3%. As in the previous year, this was primarily due to large FbtA withdrawals. Thanks, in particular, to the stabilising effect of the contribution to earnings from commissions business, primary institutions were the only category of banks to improve their cost/income ratio. It declined slightly to 67.1% in the savings bank sector and to 65.7% in the cooperative bank sector. The ratio remained within the usual range for both categories of banks. The cost/i ncome ratio figures as an indicator of cost efficiency should, however, be interpreted with caution, particularly when making a cross-sector comparison, as the business models of the various categories of banks differ significantly with regard to their cost structure. Return on equity and assets can shed further light on this subject.28</p><p>I Significant reduction in net transfers to risk provisions</p><p>Net valuation result remains a mainstay of profitability</p><p>In the year under review, the net valuation result aggregated across all banks29 was once again extremely low, with net valuation charges of just \u20ac3.7 billion.30 This was mainly due to the positive economic situation of firms and households, which had a beneficial effect on portfolio quality and thus on the need for credit risk provisions. These favourable economic conditions were also reflected in the further reduction in the number of individuals and businesses becoming insolvent in the year under review. The latter fell to its lowest level since the introduction of the insolvency framework in 1999.31</p><p>Significant improvement in the big bank and Landesbank sectors</p><p>The big bank sector's net valuation result, which had been hit hard by very high value adjustments to shipping loans at specific big banks in the previous year, improved by \u20ac4.7 billion in the year under review, once again reaching a positive value, of \u20ac0.7 billion. The Landesbanken clearly reduced their net valuation charges by \u20ac1.5 billion to \u20ac2.3 billion. Developments within this category of banks were nevertheless heterogeneous.32 Mortgage banks, whose net valuation result in the period under review (\u20ac0.03 billion) was positive for the first time since 1999, benefited from further balance sheet and risk reductions. By contrast, regional and other commercial banks expanded their risk provisioning by more than a quarter, recording net valuation charges of \u20ac1.3 billion. Buoyed up by the favourable economic framework conditions, which meant that the need for risk provisioning for loans to households was regarded as low, the net valuation result for savings banks and credit cooperatives was again very low. In line with further net releases of undisclosed reserves pursuant to Section 340 f of the German Commercial Code,33 savings banks recorded a positive net valuation result for the seventh year in a row. At \u20ac0.2 billion, it was \u20ac0.8 billion lower than in the previous year, however. The net valuation result for credit cooperatives moved slightly into negative territory again, at -\u20ac0.2 billion. The building and loan association sector recorded a negative net valuation result again (-\u20ac0.06 billion) after a positive result in the preceding year of \u20ac0.02 billion. There was no repeat of the high realisation gains from the scheduled liquidation of one building and loan association's financial and capital investments; these gains had dominated the sector's net valuation result in the previous year.</p><p>I Slight rise in operating result</p><p>Operating result benefits from extremely low net risk provisioning costs</p><p>The operating result before the valuation of assets is calculated by subtracting administrative spending from operating income. In the aggregate, the operating result (\u20ac34.5 billion) was significantly worse than in the previous year. After deducting the very low level of credit risk provisioning, the operating result (after valuation of assets) improved by 0.8% on the year to \u20ac30.8 billion.</p><p>I Extraordinary account negative balance increased significantly</p><p>Impact of various individual effects</p><p>The balance shown in the other and extraordinary account comprises not only the extraordinary profit or loss in the stricter sense34 but also the result from financial investment business35 as well as loss transfers. Furthermore, charges arising from profit transfers36 are recorded here, as they cannot be assigned to actual operating business. The balance aggregated across all banks deteriorated by just over one-fifth to -\u20ac3.4 billion. Developments were mixed across the categories of banks. The big banks sector's result was well into negative territory once again (-\u20ac1.1 billion) after having been positive the previous year (\u20ac1.1 billion) for the first time since 2007.37 The improvement in the Landesbank sector by \u20ac1.2 billion to \u20ac0.7 billion was primarily linked to the merger of two Landesbanken. In particular, the absence of large write-downs on the participating inter est in the subsidiary, which had weighed on the previous year's result, and the merger gain in the year under review were significant factors in this positive development. The credit cooperatives' result, which had been shored up in the previous year by revaluation gains from participating interests arising from the merger of the two regional institutions of credit co operatives, dipped slightly into negative territory, from \u20ac0.4 billion in the previous year.</p><p>I Profit for the financial year before tax still high despite marginal decline</p><p>Pre-tax profit for the year still high</p><p>Aggregated across all banks, the profit for the financial year before tax fell slightly by 1.2% to \u20ac27.4 billion. At the banking categories level, only Landesbanken and building and loan associations recorded an increase, with Landesbanken experiencing a significant rise in their profit for the financial year before tax to \u20ac0.9 billion. In the previous year, extremely high annual losses at the two Landesbanken that merged in the year under review had had a major negative impact on this category's result. Building and loan associations also improved their profit for the financial year before tax by 11.3% to \u20ac1.0 billion. While this increase is due to the one-off effect in net interest income and the gain in the extraordinary account, the FbtA withdrawals are the main reason that the profit for the financial year before tax has been high for the past two years. Profit for the financial year before tax fell by 3.6% to \u20ac9.9 billion in the savings bank sector, by 5.4% to \u20ac7.3 billion in the cooperative bank sector and by 4.0% to \u20ac3.3 billion for regional and other commercial banks. For mortgage banks, the decline by 7.2% to \u20ac0.5 billion was much smaller than in the previous year. The big banks sector's profit for the financial year before tax saw a considerable contraction of 11.6% to \u20ac2.8 billion. Nevertheless, in the year under review, the profit for the financial year before tax was well above its long-term average for all banking groups.</p><p>I Appropriation of profit for the financial year</p><p>Transfers to the fund for general banking risks still high</p><p>After deducting taxes on income of \u20ac7.5 billion and the aggregate net loss brought forward of \u20ac4.0 billion, which, as in the previous year, related mainly to individual mortgage banks, regional and other commercial banks and individual banks with special, development and other central support tasks, this left on balance a slightly higher profit for the financial year before tax of \u20ac15.9 billion. The fund for general banking risks grew for the ninth time in succession as a result of hedging against the special risks of banking business and to strengthen regulatory equity capital. Net transfers amounted to a combined total of \u20ac10.1 billion (compared with \u20ac10.8 billion in the previous year). Savings banks and credit cooperatives transferred the largest amounts to the fund on balance (net transfers of \u20ac5.0 billion and \u20ac3.1 billion, respectively). The building and loan association sector trans ferred \u20ac0.7 billion net. In addition to the fund for general banking risks, reserves were increased by \u20ac2.6 billion net, meaning that overall a net \u20ac12.7 billion was transferred to balance sheet capital (total equity).</p><p>I Equity and profitability</p><p>Equity ratio at a historical high</p><p>In the year under review, the total balance sheet capital (total equity) of all German banks was, at \u20ac489 billion, 5.0% above the previous year's value and has therefore risen by 53% since 2007. Except for the categories Landesbanken and mortgage banks, which are affected by structural changes, balance sheet capital (total equity) rose in all categories of banks. The equity ratio, calculated as the ratio of balance sheet capital (total equity) to total assets, reached a new peak of 5.9%. When interpreting the data on total equity, which are calculated as annual average values, it should be borne in mind that the amounts transferred from the profit for the respective financial year do not increase balance sheet capital (total equity) until the year after the annual accounts are adopted, while withdrawals from equity items are to be deducted when the annual accounts are prepared at the latest.</p><p>Return on equity down slightly</p><p>The return on equity, calculated as the ratio of profit for the financial year before tax to balance sheet capital (total equity), provides information on the rate of return on the equity employed by the equity holders. The slight drop in the profit for the financial year and the simultaneous rise in the equity base meant that the return on equity for the entire German banking system was, at 5.6%, 0.4 percentage point below the previous year's figure, yet remained within the long-term average range.38 At the level of the categories of banks, only Landesbanken and building and loan associations increased their ratios. In the case of Landesbanken, the ratio flipped back into positive territory, moving from -1.0% to 1.8%. Building and loan associations boosted their return on equity by 0.3 percentage point to 9.2%, almost reaching the long-term average. Excluding the effects of the FbtA withdrawals on the profit for the financial year before tax, the return on equity in this category of banks would have been only 2.9%. Savings banks and credit cooperatives remained the most profitable categories of banks, with returns on equity of 9.4% and 10.1%, respectively.</p><p>Primary institutions the sole category of banks with exclusively positive returns on assets</p><p>The return on assets, calculated as the ratio of the profit for the financial year before tax to total assets, provides information on profitability per euro of assets used. Aggregated across all banks, this ratio was, at 0.33%, stable at the previous year's level. An analysis of individual institutions' returns on assets revealed that the worst 10% of institutions as measured by their return on assets make up more than half of the aggregate total assets in the German banking system. This is largely because several big banks and Landesbanken have a very low return on assets. 40 banks, which together make up around 5% of aggregate total assets, reported negative returns on assets in the year under review. Savings banks and cooperative banks were the only categories of banks in which all institutions had a positive return on assets.</p><p>I Balance sheet profit</p><p>Balance sheet profit down again due to lack of one- off effects</p><p>To calculate the balance sheet profit, taxes on earnings, the balance of profits or losses brought forward, net transfers to reserves and net transfers to the fund for general banking risks are deducted from the profit for the financial year before tax. The big banks sector's balance sheet profit, which was pushed up in the previous year by one big bank's withdrawals of equity capital in order to transfer it to its parent company, contracted by \u20ac2.4 billion to just \u20ac1.8 billion. This development was one of the main reasons why the balance sheet profit aggregated across all banks stood at \u20ac3.2 billion, which is around two-thirds of the previous year's figure. Since net transfers to equity capital exceeded the profit for the financial year before tax in the Landesbank sector, it recorded a balance sheet loss of \u20ac0.2 billion. Savings banks and credit cooperatives hovered around the previous years' level with balance sheet profits of \u20ac1.5 billion and \u20ac1.3 billion, respectively. Largely as a consequence of a development bank with a very high loss brought forward switching to another category of banks, regional and other commercial banks recorded a balance sheet loss of \u20ac1.6 billion following a balance sheet profit of \u20ac0.7 billion in the previous year. For the eleventh year in succession, mortgage banks reported a negative result, though they were able to almost halve this to \u20ac0.4 billion compared to the previous year.</p><p>I Outlook</p><p>Challenging financial market environment set to continue</p><p>Favourable economic conditions are likely to benefit German banks again this year, while low interest rates and the flat yield curve will continue to present the banking sector with challenges. In June 2018, the Governing Council of the ECB communicated that it expects key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary. At the same time, it announced the prospective end to net purchases within the asset purchase programme. Subject to confirmation of its current assessment of the medium-term outlook by newly available data, the Governing Council anticipates that it will discontinue monthly purchases entirely after the end of December 2018. In doing so, it has signalled the start of monetary policy returning to normal.</p><p>Maturities continue to be shortened on the liabilities side and longterm lending volume increases further</p><p>In 2018, the contribution to earnings from maturity transformation is likely to support net interest income again. On the one hand, the interest charged on new loans to households for house purchase with an initial rate fixation period of over ten years rose a little further as compared to the level at the end of 2017, on the other hand, the interest costs for households' overnight deposits edged down a little more in the same period. The continued shortening of maturities on the liabilities side and the further increase in long-term lending volume on the assets side are also likely to help stabilise net interest income. The interest rate and liquidity risks associated with this balance sheet structure are also very likely to materialise in the event of an interest rate hike, entailing a negative impact on profitability. These negative consequences of a hike in rates for earnings, which will prevail in the short term, may be softened by higher commission income. In the medium to long term, however, an interest rate increase will probably have a positive effect on banks' profitability thanks to rising interest income.39</p><p>Negative interest rates increasingly passed on</p><p>More and more banks are using the option of lowering financing costs by collecting negative interest particularly on large-scale deposits in corporate banking business. By July 2018, the banks required to report for the MFI interest rate statistics had already collected negative interest on just under 45% of all overnight deposits of non-financial corporations. The reduction in interest rates for participation in the second series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations is likely to be another factor with positive effects on profitability. For those banks that took part in the operations and whose eligible net lending in the period from 1 February 2016 to 31 January 2018 exceeded their individual benchmark, the booking of the reductions in interest accumulated since the start of the contract is likely to have a positive effect on profitability in 2018.40</p><p>Methodological notes</p><p>Data based on individual accounts prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code and on monthly balance sheet statistics</p><p>The results from the profit and loss accounts are based on the published annual accounts of the individual institutions in accordance with the provisions set forth in the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) and the Regulation on the Accounting of Credit Institutions (Verordnung \u00fcber die Rechnungslegung der Kreditinstitute). They differ in terms of their conception, structure and definitions from the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)1 for publicly traded groups. This means that - for methodological reasons - business performance and certain balance sheet or individual profit and loss items are not comparable across the national and international accounting frameworks. For reasons of comparability within Germany, it is therefore advisable to consider the individual accounts when analysing fi nancial performance.</p><p>The fi gures for balance sheet capital (total equity), total assets and other stock variables are not obtained from the annual reports but are taken as annual average values on the basis of the monthly balance sheet statistics reported for the institution as a whole.</p><p>Reporting group</p><p>The reporting group for statistics on banks' profit and loss accounts (profit and loss statistics) includes all banks that are both monetary financial institutions (MFIs) and credit institutions as defi ned in the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz - KWG) and are domiciled in Germany. All institutions that accept deposits or close substitutes for deposits (for example, through the issue of securities) from the general public and grant loans (including in the form of securities purchases) for their own account are deemed to be MFIs. In the German banking statistics, they are also referred to as banks. Branches of foreign banks that are exempted from the provisions of Sec tion 53 of the Banking Act, banks in liquidation and banks with a fi nancial year of less than 12 months (truncated financial year) are not included in this performance analysis.</p><p>As in the monthly balance sheet statistics, the category \"Regional institutions of credit cooperatives\" is no longer reported separately in the profit and loss statistics for data protection reasons. The earnings data of DZ Bank AG Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank, Frankfurt am Main, which was created in July 2016 through the merger between DZ Bank AG Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank, Frankfurt am Main and WGZ BANK AG Westdeutsche Genossenschafts-Zentralbank, D\u00fcsseldorf, are included in the category \"Banks with special, development and other central support tasks\" in the long-term time series from the reporting year 2016 onwards. However, in the tables and charts, as well as in the tables accompanying this Monthly Report article, they are assigned to this category for the entire period under observation (2008 to 2017).</p><p>Calculation of the long-term average</p><p>At the launch of monetary union in 1999, the reporting group relevant for calculating the money supply and for monetary analysis was uniformly defined by the Eurosystem for the euro area as a whole and referred to as the monetary fi nancial institutions (MFI) sector. Unlike the population of banks used for the Bundesbank analysis up to that point, building and loan associations are also included. Except where another time period is explicitly mentioned, the calculations with regard to the longer-term average cover the years since the launch of monetary union, i.e. from 1999 to 2017.</p><p>1 IFRS-based financial statements are of relevance, for instance, to matters of macroprudential analysis and oversight, concentrating on systemically important banks and their international business activities (including their foreign subsidiaries).

For incumbent credit institutions and insurance companies, in particular, which are increasingly confronted with new technologies and innovative business models, there is an increasing need to adapt in order to remain competitive. Customers, who are now accustomed to using bank services and products anywhere and anytime as a matter of course, are also increasingly changing their expectations and behaviour, using digital platforms to access traditional fi nancial services more and more frequently. These platforms provide their fi - nancial products and services via standard interfaces with credit institutions.</p><p>Technological innovations outside of the banking sector are gaining in importance. New players (fi ntech fi rms) that understand how to harness the innovative potential of digitalisation are increasingly offering customised digital solutions and benefiting from their agility and adaptability in developing these. In contrast to banks or insurers, these players do not typically provide a full range of services or products. Instead, they focus on individual areas in the value chain of traditional financial corporations. These areas include, in particular, payments, clearing and settlement, and the lending and deposit business. The entry of large incumbent technology firms, known as Big Tech players, into the financial sector has the greatest potential to intensify competition. As opposed to fintech companies, which tend to be small, these enterprises already have access to a large number of customers via their platforms.1 The extent to which competition will increase as a result of digitalisation also depends on whether banks cooperate with fi ntech fi rms, and if so how. Many banks have recognised the competitive pressure exerted by both fintech firms and rapidly changing customer needs. Together with these companies, digitalisation efforts have been driven forward in the fields of payments and investment services in particular. Furthermore, some institutions are also working on their own digitalisation projects.</p><p>Digitalisation has potential implications for financial institutions' strategies, processes and systems and entails both opportunities and risks. Greater automation and more efficient processes allow cost savings and relieve employees of routine work, allowing them, for example, to take on more demanding tasks if appropriately qualified. An efficient and modern IT infrastructure is one of the prerequisites to realising these efficiencies and must, at the same time, be safeguarded against its heightened vulnerability to cyberattacks. This will require considerable investment by many banks in the short to medium term, with cost savings typically likely to materialise in the medium term at the earliest.</p><p>While digital innovations may lead to macroeconomic benefits, it is important for supervisors to identify risks in a timely manner, particularly those that pose a danger to the stability of fi nancial markets.2 To get a better idea of the opportunities and risks presented by digitalisation in the fi nancial sector, the G20 commissioned the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to take stock of technology-based financial innovations and their implications for financial stability. The report, published on 27 June 2017, classifi es fi ntech innovations according to their respective economic function, rather than on the basis of the underlying technology or regulatory classification. An intensifi cation of international cooperation is set to focus, in particular, on risks arising from the cooperation of financial intermediaries with non-supervised third-party service providers, cyber risks and the monitoring of macro-financial risks.3</p><p>1 On the impact of fintech players on competition and the business models of banks, see European Banking Authority (2018), EBA report on the impact of FinTech on incumbent credit institutions' business models.</p><p>2 For more information, see also Deutsche Bundesbank, Shaping digitalisation, Annual Report 2017, p. 23 f.</p><p>3 For more information, see also Financial Stability Board, Financial stability implications from FinTech - supervisory and regulatory issues that merit authorities' attention, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/\">http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/</url> R270617.pdf</p><p>The importance of net commission income for banks primarily engaged in lending and deposit business</p><p>The low interest rate environment presents a major challenge, and will continue to do so, for savings banks, credit cooperatives and other institutions that primarily engage in traditional lending and deposit business.1</p><p>Many of these smaller and medium-sized banks that are particularly reliant on net interest income are therefore attempting to stabilise their profits with earnings from noninterest-related business, for example by generating net commission income.2 Alongside income from securities business, this mainly includes fees and commissions from payment transactions and account management, which are closely linked to lending and deposit business.</p><p>An empirical analysis on the basis of data provided by the German Savings Banks Association (Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband - DSGV) indicates that the profitability of savings banks increases in step with the share of operating income accounted for by fees and commissions from payment transactions.3 According to the DSGV data, the latter make up roughly half of the net commission income generated by savings banks, on average. Savings banks with a high share of income from securities business also have higher profits. Securities business mainly includes fees for managing client securities accounts and executing securities trades on behalf of the client. Income from securities business is significantly more volatile than income from payment transactions, but is independent of lending and deposit business. According to the study, around 20% of net commission income in the savings bank sector comes from this source, on average. The remaining net commission income is attributable to brokerage business (15%), foreign business (3%) and all other business (12%). Despite these business lines increasing in volume, this structure of fees and commissions is unlikely to have changed much even over the past few years.</p><p>The savings banks have recently boosted their earnings significantly due to higher net com mission income from payment transactions and securities business. The earnings data from the profit and loss statistics for 2017 show that they compensated for the decline in net interest income almost fully by increasing net commission income by \u20ac0.6 billion to \u20ac7.6 billion (25.5% of operating income4). In the case of the credit cooperatives, which saw an improvement of \u20ac0.4 billion in their net commission income (\u20ac5.0 billion, or 22.7% of operating income), the earnings growth even considerably outstripped the decline in net interest income that had to be offset. For this category of bank, too, the increase in net commission income was chiefly generated from higher fees for account management and payment transactions as well as stronger securities and funds business, as customers increasingly sought higher-yielding investments in the persistent low interest rate setting.5 The drop in net interest income at regional banks and other commercial banks was also more than offset by a \u20ac0.4 billion increase in net commission income (\u20ac5.7 billion, or 26.0% of operating income). Only 7.4% of savings banks, 12.5% of credit cooperatives and 38.2% of regional and other commercial banks saw a decline in net commission income.</p><p>1 According to the results of the 2017 low interest rate survey, many banks are not expecting any fundamental change in the interest rate setting in the next few years.</p><p>2 See Deutsche Bundesbank, Overview of the results of the 2017 low- i nterest-rate survey, Monthly Report, September 2017, pp. 57-58.</p><p>3 See M.

In the mortgage bank sector, the reporting year saw one institution surrender its banking licence, and one institution was assigned to the regional and other commercial banks category. In addition, a mortgage division that was still part of one mortgage bank was transferred to a building and loan association as part of an intragroup restructuring measure. The increase in total assets in the building and loan association sector was also connected to this restructuring measure.</p><p>20 In addition to increased lending volumes, this was primarily due to a large development bank moving from one category of banks to another: it was reassigned to the regional and other commercial banks category following a change in its business model.</p><p>21 See also footnote 19.</p><p>22See Deutsche Bundesbank, Financial accounts for Germany 2012 to 2017, Special Statistical Publication 4, July 2018, pp. 14 f.</p><p>23 Building and loan associations once again took advantage of the greater flexibility regarding the use of this fund ushered in by the amended Building and Loan Associations Act (Bausparkassengesetz) and the Regulation concerning Building and Loan Associations (Bausparkassen-Verordnung) that came into force at the end of 2015 and withdrew substantial amounts in some cases.

Resolution funds are financed by bank levies raised in advance. All institutions are obliged to pay a yearly bank levy. The levy mainly consists of a basic contribution, which is based on the bank's size and is also adjusted according to the institution's risk profile.</p><p>26 See <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fmsa.de/fileadmin/user_upload_fmsa/\">https://www.fmsa.de/fileadmin/user_upload_fmsa/</url> Pressemitteilungen/deutsch/2 0170512_PM_FMSA.pdf</p><p>27See also footnote 19 on p. 41</p><p>28 For more information, see also the comments on equity and profitability on pp. 50 ff.</p><p>29 The net valuation result comprises the effects of value adjustments, write-ups and write-downs on accounts receivable and securities in the liquidity reserve. In addition, income and charges in connection with transfers from and to loan-loss provisions are taken into account, as are transfers and releases relating to undisclosed reserves pursuant to Section 340 f of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch). The net valuation result makes use of the cross-offsetting option permissible under the German Commercial Code. Reallocations within the fund for general banking risks pursuant to Section 340 g of the German Commercial Code are not recorded in the profit and loss account, but are recognised only in the context of profit appropriation as part of the present profit and loss analysis.</p><p>30 At -\u20ac8.8 billion, the net valuation result in 2016 experienced a one-off shift away from the historically favourable level it has stood at since 2011, mainly as a consequence of high write-downs in shipping finance by individual big banks and Landesbanken.</p><p>31 See Statistisches Bundesamt (Federal Statistical Office), Unternehmen und Arbeitsst\u00e4tten, Fachserie 2, Reihe 4.1, Insolvenzverfahren Dezember und Jahr 2017.</p><p>32 For one Landesbank, the scheduled liquidation of legacy assets as part of the privatisation process resulted in additional specific value adjustments on a large scale, while the improvement in the merged Landesbank's net valuation result significantly improved the aggregate net valuation result compared to the previous year.</p><p>33 However, because these were mostly allocated to the disclosed reserves pursuant to Section 340 g of the German Commercial Code in the context of profit appropriation to strengthen the core capital base, this is primarily an accounting measure without any effect on earnings. For more information, see also Deutsche Bundesbank, The effect of reallocating undisclosed reserves pursuant to section 340f of the German Commercial Code as disclosed reserves pursuant to section 340 g of the German Commercial Code on the annual profit in the profit and loss statistics, Monthly Report, September 2012, p. 27 f.</p><p>34 Only extraordinary events which interrupt the normal financial year are recorded in this item. These include merger gains and losses, reorganisation gains and losses, debt forgiveness in restructurings as well as charges for redundancy programmes and restructuring.</p><p>35 Financial investment business comprises the balance of income from value adjustments in respect of participating interests, shares in affiliated enterprises and securities treated as fixed assets as well as write-downs and writeoffs in respect of these items.</p><p>36 This relates to charges from profits transferred under profit pooling, a profit transfer agreement or a partial profit transfer agreement. By contrast, income from profit transfers is reported under net interest income; the assumption is that they are part of the business strategy and hence of operating business.</p><p>37 In the previous year, the profit from the complete liquidation of a mortgage bank as the subsidiary of a big bank, recorded as extraordinary income, contributed significantly to boosting the sector's result.</p><p>38Despite this decline, Dombret, G\u00fcnd\u00fcz and Rocholl (2017), Will German Banks Earn their Cost of Capital?, forthcoming in Contemporary Economic Policy, show in an investigation of the effects of a protracted period of low interest rates on the German banking sector's outlook for profitability after 2015 that most German banks will manage to cover their cost of capital in this setting according to their forecasts.</p><p>39 See Deutsche Bundesbank, The importance of bank profitability and bank capital for monetary policy, Monthly Report, January 2018, pp. 27-52.</p><p>40 For more information, see also Decision (EU) 2016/810 of the European Central Bank of 28 April 2016 on a second series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (ECB/ 2016/10).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">REPDEU-2123025490</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REPDEUSeptember 2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGG-46T1-JBHT-D4DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470566</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"11857\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright September 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright September 2018 Deutsche Bundesbank Sep 2018</copyright><publicationName>Monthly Report of the Deutsche Bundesbank</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 04188292</issn><volume>Vol. 70</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

John Perry Barlow, a lion of the early internet, addressed his ''Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace'' to the ''governments of the industrial world,'' saying that for him and his fellow netizens, these creaky institutions had ''no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But that was before privacy scandals, antitrust investigations, congressional hearings, Chinese tariffs, presidential tweets and Senator Elizabeth Warren. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Now, as they try to fend off regulation and avoid being broken up, some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley are tripping over their Allbirds in a race to cozy up to the United States government. These companies' motives vary -- some are vying for lucrative public-sector contracts, while others are lobbying against regulation by painting China as a red menace that must be defeated for the good of the country.</p><p>  Either way, the game is the same: Salute the flag, save our bacon.</p><p>  The latest example of Silicon Valley's patriotic playacting comes courtesy of Peter Thiel, the Trump-backing venture capitalist. In an op-ed in The New York Times this month, Mr. Thiel took Google to task for opening an artificial intelligence lab in Beijing while canceling a controversial Pentagon contract, accusing the company of trying to ''evade responsibility for the good of the country.''</p><p>  Mr. Thiel's obvious conflicts of interest aside (he is on the board of Facebook, Google's rival, and is the chairman of the technology firm Palantir, which has lucrative government contracts of its own), seeing him lecture anyone on patriotism is rich. He was among the first major supporters of the Seasteading movement -- a group of libertarians who wanted to flee the United States and build a floating city in international waters -- and in 2011, he became a New Zealand citizen after buying up property there. (''It would give me great pride to let it be known that I am a New Zealand citizen and an enthusiastic supporter of the country,'' Mr. Thiel wrote in his citizenship application.)</p><p>  But Mr. Thiel, who did not respond to a request for comment, is far from the only tech titan trading in his hoodie for a flag pin.</p><p>  Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief, has also been warning that if the social network -- the proud, American social network, that is -- is broken up or harshly regulated, it will be only a matter of time before China takes over the global tech industry.</p><p>  In an interview last year, Mr. Zuckerberg said that if Facebook were broken up by American regulators, ''the alternative, frankly, is going to be the Chinese companies.''</p><p>  David Marcus, one of Mr. Zuckerberg's lieutenants and the executive in charge of Facebook's digital currency project, Libra, echoed that point while testifying before Congress last month.</p><p>  ''I believe that if America does not lead innovation in the digital currency and payments area, others will,'' Mr. Marcus said. ''If we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different.''</p><p>  Mr. Zuckerberg, who speaks Mandarin, is an odd choice to lead the charge against China. He has spent much of the last decade trying desperately to curry favor with the Chinese government in hopes of getting Facebook's apps -- which are banned there -- permission to operate in one of the world's most lucrative markets. Mr. Zuckerberg even reportedly offered to let Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, name his second child. (Mr. Xi declined.)</p><p>Google, too, is rallying around the flag. The company's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, went to the White House to visit with President Trump in March, to discuss government contracts and reassure the president that Google does not discriminate against conservatives. This month, in a series of tweets attacking Mr. Pichai and Google, Mr. Trump recalled that meeting, which he described as ''Mr. Pichai working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing, that Google was not involved with China's military, that they didn't help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election.''</p><p>  Like Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Pichai was a China booster before he began distancing himself from the country. Last year, Mr. Pichai had a large team of Google engineers building a prototype search engine, called Dragonfly, that was designed to be compatible with China's censorship regime. The project was dropped amid heated internal dissent from Google employees. But it reportedly would have blocked sites like Wikipedia, as well as other material considered objectionable by Chinese authorities.</p><p>Amazon and Apple, two tech giants that love America so much that they have gone to elaborate lengths to avoid paying taxes to its Treasury, are also promoting themselves as national champions. After Mr. Trump criticized Apple's plans to do some of the assembly of its Mac Pro in China, the company reiterated its desire to keep much of the computer's assembly in the United States. And Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has knocked rival firms for insufficient patriotism, saying that ''if big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.''</p><p>  Representatives for Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple all declined to comment.</p><p>  Conspicuous patriotism is not a new tactic for companies accused of bad behavior. In the 1980s and 1990s, defenders of American tech giants like IBM and Microsoft argued that those companies' monopolistic behaviors were necessary to stave off competition from Japanese rivals. During World War II, Hollywood movie studios delayed a federal antitrust crackdown, in part by agreeing to help the military in the war effort.</p><p>  Meredith Whittaker, a co-founder of the AI Now Institute at New York University and a former Google employee, characterized the tech industry's scaremongering about China as a tactical move meant to deflect criticism.</p><p>  ''It's a really convenient narrative,'' Ms. Whittaker said. ''It evokes nationalism and a red scare trope that has worked in the past. And it implies that regulation, accountability and taking a pause to consider ethics would be counter to 'winning.'''</p><p>  Patriotic posturing may be a cynical tactic, but it could also be a smart one. Today's big tech companies are in a better negotiating position than most industries under fire. The meteoric growth of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon has bolstered the American stock market and made Silicon Valley a global innovation hub. Even if the motives of the tech giants are questionable, the importance of technologies like 5G connectivity and artificial intelligence to the country's competitive position isn't lost on lawmakers.</p><p>  Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents parts of Silicon Valley in Congress, has called for greater regulation of tech companies. But in an interview this month, he told me that the risk of losing ground to China worried him.</p><p>  ''There is a risk that we could see a Berlin digital wall,'' Mr. Khanna said. ''The question is, are the values of liberty, privacy and freedom of speech going to be embedded in technology platforms? China's platforms do not have many of the values that liberal democracies believe in.''</p><p>  There is nothing inherently wrong with the belief that America's values are superior to those found in Shanghai and Shenzhen, or that American tech companies should act in the country's best interest. But lawmakers should be appropriately wary of Silicon Valley's charm campaign, and they should avoid conflating what's good for Facebook, Google and other tech companies with what's good for the nation. Tech executives might be whistling ''I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,'' but they really just want to be left alone.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Sundar Pichai, the chief of Google, top</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>the venture capitalist Peter Thiel, left</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>and Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, have all promoted themselves recently as champions of the United States.

How opportunistic of them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not long ago, many leading technologists considered themselves too lofty and idealistic to concern themselves with the petty affairs of government.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/obituaries/john-perry-barlow-internet-champion-dies.html\"/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/obituaries/john-perry-barlow-internet-champion-dies.html\">John Perry Barlow</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/obituaries/john-perry-barlow-internet-champion-dies.html\">, a lion of the early internet</url>, addressed his \u201cDeclaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\u201d to the \u201cgovernments of the industrial world,\u201d saying that for him and his fellow netizens, these creaky institutions had \u201cno moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.\u201d </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But that was before privacy scandals, antitrust investigations, congressional hearings, Chinese tariffs, presidential tweets and Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, as they try to fend off regulation and avoid being broken up, some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley are tripping over their Allbirds in a race to cozy up to the United States government. These companies\u2019 motives vary \u2014 some are vying for lucrative public-sector contracts, while others are lobbying against regulation by painting China as a red menace that must be defeated for the good of the country. </p><p>Either way, the game is the same: Salute the flag, save our bacon.</p><p>The latest example of Silicon Valley\u2019s patriotic playacting comes courtesy of Peter Thiel, the Trump-backing venture capitalist. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/opinion/peter-thiel-google.html\">an op-ed in The New York Times this month</url>, Mr. Thiel took Google to task for opening an artificial intelligence lab in Beijing while canceling a controversial Pentagon contract, accusing the company of trying to \u201cevade responsibility for the good of the country.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Thiel\u2019s obvious conflicts of interest aside (he is on the board of Facebook, Google\u2019s rival, and is the chairman of the technology firm Palantir, which has <url normalizedValue=\"https://mijente.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Mijente-The-War-Against-Immigrants_-Trumps-Tech-Tools-Powered-by-Palantir_.pdf\">lucrative government contracts</url> of its own), seeing him lecture anyone on patriotism is rich. He was among the first major       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://ideas.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/the-diy-mini-nation/\">supporters</url> of the Seasteading movement \u2014 a group of libertarians who wanted to flee the United States and build a floating city in international waters \u2014 and in 2011, he       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/business/peter-thiel-new-zealand-citizenship.html\">became a New Zealand citizen</url> after buying up property there. (\u201cIt would give me great pride to let it be known that I am a New Zealand citizen and an enthusiastic supporter of the country,\u201d Mr. Thiel wrote in his citizenship application.)</p><p>But Mr. Thiel, who did not respond to a request for comment, is far from the only tech titan trading in his hoodie for a flag pin.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief, has also been warning that if the social network \u2014 the proud, American social network, that is \u2014 is broken up or harshly regulated, it will be only a matter of time before China takes over the global tech industry.</p><p>In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/7/18/17584482/mark-zuckerberg-china-antitrust-breakup-artificial-intelligence\">an interview</url> last year, Mr. Zuckerberg said that if Facebook were broken up by American regulators, \u201cthe alternative, frankly, is going to be the Chinese companies.\u201d</p><p>David Marcus, one of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s lieutenants and the executive in charge of Facebook\u2019s digital currency project, Libra, echoed that point while testifying before Congress last month.</p><p>\u201cI believe that if America does not lead innovation in the digital currency and payments area, others will,\u201d Mr. Marcus said. \u201cIf we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, who speaks Mandarin, is an odd choice to lead the charge against China. He has spent much of the last decade trying desperately to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/technology/facebook-censorship-tool-china.html\">curry favor</url> with the Chinese government in hopes of getting Facebook\u2019s apps \u2014 which are banned there \u2014 permission to operate in one of the world\u2019s most lucrative markets. Mr. Zuckerberg even       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/china-s-president-xi-jinping-turns-down-mark-zuckerberg-s-request-to-name-his-unborn-child-at-white-a6679156.html\">reportedly offered</url> to let Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, name his second child. (Mr. Xi declined.)</p><p>Google, too, is rallying around the flag. The company\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18284415/sundar-pichai-donald-trump-meeting-white-house\">went to the White House</url> to visit with President Trump in March, to discuss government contracts and reassure the president that Google does not discriminate against conservatives. This month, in a series of tweets attacking Mr. Pichai and Google, Mr. Trump recalled that meeting, which he described as \u201cMr. Pichai working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing, that Google was not involved with China\u2019s military, that they didn\u2019t help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election.\u201d</p><p>Like Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Pichai was a China booster before he began distancing himself from the country. Last year, Mr. Pichai had a large team of Google engineers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/technology/google-employees-protest-search-censored-china.html\">building a prototype search engine</url>, called Dragonfly, that was designed to be compatible with China\u2019s censorship regime. The project was dropped amid heated internal dissent from Google employees. But it       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17638480/google-china-search-engine-censored-report\">reportedly</url> would have blocked sites like Wikipedia, as well as other material considered objectionable by Chinese authorities.</p><p>Amazon and Apple, two tech giants that love America so much that they have gone to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/20/18231742/amazon-federal-taxes-zero-corporate-income\">elaborate</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/06/world/apple-taxes-jersey.html\">lengths</url> to avoid paying taxes to its Treasury, are also promoting themselves as national champions. After Mr. Trump criticized Apple\u2019s plans to do some of the assembly of its Mac Pro in China, the company       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/30/tim-cook-apple-mac-pro-1441235\">reiterated</url> its desire to keep much of the computer\u2019s assembly in the United States. And Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-45871248\">knocked rival firms</url> for insufficient patriotism, saying that \u201cif big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple all declined to comment.</p><p>Conspicuous patriotism is not a new tactic for companies accused of bad behavior. In the 1980s and 1990s, defenders of American tech giants like IBM and Microsoft<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/ibm-and-microsoft-antitrust-then-and-now/\">argued</url> that those companies\u2019 monopolistic behaviors were necessary to stave off competition from Japanese rivals. During World War II, Hollywood movie studios delayed a federal antitrust crackdown, in part by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-day-the-supreme-court-killed-hollywoods-studio-system\">agreeing to help</url> the military in the war effort. </p><p>Meredith Whittaker, a co-founder of the AI Now Institute at New York University and a former Google employee, characterized the tech industry\u2019s scaremongering about China as a tactical move meant to deflect criticism.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really convenient narrative,\u201d Ms. Whittaker said. \u201cIt evokes nationalism and a red scare trope that has worked in the past. And it implies that regulation, accountability and taking a pause to consider ethics would be counter to \u2018winning.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Patriotic posturing may be a cynical tactic, but it could also be a smart one. Today\u2019s big tech companies are in a better negotiating position than most industries under fire. The meteoric growth of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon has bolstered the American stock market and made Silicon Valley a global innovation hub. Even if the motives of the tech giants are questionable, the importance of technologies like 5G connectivity and artificial intelligence to the country\u2019s competitive position isn\u2019t lost on lawmakers.</p><p>Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents parts of Silicon Valley in Congress, has called for greater regulation of tech companies. But in an interview this month, he told me that the risk of losing ground to China worried him.</p><p>\u201cThere is a risk that we could see a Berlin digital wall,\u201d Mr. Khanna said. \u201cThe question is, are the values of liberty, privacy and freedom of speech going to be embedded in technology platforms? China\u2019s platforms do not have many of the values that liberal democracies believe in.\u201d</p><p>There is nothing inherently wrong with the belief that America\u2019s values are superior to those found in Shanghai and Shenzhen, or that American tech companies should act in the country\u2019s best interest. But lawmakers should be appropriately wary of Silicon Valley\u2019s charm campaign, and they should avoid conflating what\u2019s good for Facebook, Google and other tech companies with what\u2019s good for the nation. Tech executives might be whistling \u201cI\u2019m a Yankee Doodle Dandy,\u201d but they really just want to be left alone.</p><p>PHOTOS: Sundar Pichai, the chief of Google, top; the venture capitalist Peter Thiel, left; and Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, have all promoted themselves recently as champions of the United States.

How opportunistic of them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not long ago, many leading technologists considered themselves too lofty and idealistic to concern themselves with the petty affairs of government. John Perry Barlow, a lion of the early internet, addressed his \"Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\" to the \"governments of the industrial world,\" saying that for him and his fellow netizens, these creaky institutions had \"no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But that was before privacy scandals, antitrust investigations, congressional hearings, Chinese tariffs, presidential tweets and Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, as they try to fend off regulation and avoid being broken up, some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley are tripping over their Allbirds in a race to cozy up to the United States government. These companies' motives vary - some are vying for lucrative public-sector contracts, while others are lobbying against regulation by painting China as a red menace that must be defeated for the good of the country. </p><p>Either way, the game is the same: Salute the flag, save our bacon.</p><p>The latest example of Silicon Valley's patriotic playacting comes courtesy of Peter Thiel, the Trump-backing venture capitalist. In an op-ed in The New York Times this month, Mr. Thiel took Google to task for opening an artificial intelligence lab in Beijing while canceling a controversial Pentagon contract, accusing the company of trying to \"evade responsibility for the good of the country.\"</p><p>Mr. Thiel's obvious conflicts of interest aside (he is on the board of Facebook, Google's rival, and is the chairman of the technology firm Palantir, which has lucrative government contracts of its own), seeing him lecture anyone on patriotism is rich. He was among the first major supporters of the Seasteading movement - a group of libertarians who wanted to flee the United States and build a floating city in international waters - and in 2011, he became a New Zealand citizen after buying up property there. (\"It would give me great pride to let it be known that I am a New Zealand citizen and an enthusiastic supporter of the country,\" Mr. Thiel wrote in his citizenship application.)</p><p>But Mr. Thiel, who did not respond to a request for comment, is far from the only tech titan trading in his hoodie for a flag pin.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief, has also been warning that if the social network - the proud, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">American</emphasis> social network, that is - is broken up or harshly regulated, it will be only a matter of time before China takes over the global tech industry.</p><p>In an interview last year, Mr. Zuckerberg said that if Facebook were broken up by American regulators, \"the alternative, frankly, is going to be the Chinese companies.\"</p><p>David Marcus, one of Mr. Zuckerberg's lieutenants and the executive in charge of Facebook's digital currency project, Libra, echoed that point while testifying before Congress last month.</p><p>\"I believe that if America does not lead innovation in the digital currency and payments area, others will,\" Mr. Marcus said. \"If we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different.\"</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, who speaks Mandarin, is an odd choice to lead the charge against China. He has spent much of the last decade trying desperately to curry favor with the Chinese government in hopes of getting Facebook's apps - which are banned there - permission to operate in one of the world's most lucrative markets. Mr. Zuckerberg even reportedly offered to let Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, name his second child. (Mr. Xi declined.)</p><p>Google, too, is rallying around the flag. The company's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, went to the White House to visit with President Trump in March, to discuss government contracts and reassure the president that Google does not discriminate against conservatives. This month, in a series of tweets attacking Mr. Pichai and Google, Mr. Trump recalled that meeting, which he described as \"Mr. Pichai working very hard to explain how much he liked me, what a great job the Administration is doing, that Google was not involved with China's military, that they didn't help Crooked Hillary over me in the 2016 Election.\"</p><p>Like Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Pichai was a China booster before he began distancing himself from the country. Last year, Mr. Pichai had a large team of Google engineers building a prototype search engine, called Dragonfly, that was designed to be compatible with China's censorship regime. The project was dropped amid heated internal dissent from Google employees. But it reportedly would have blocked sites like Wikipedia, as well as other material considered objectionable by Chinese authorities.</p><p>Amazon and Apple, two tech giants that love America so much that they have gone to elaborate lengths to avoid paying taxes to its Treasury, are also promoting themselves as national champions. After Mr. Trump criticized Apple's plans to do some of the assembly of its Mac Pro in China, the company reiterated its desire to keep much of the computer's assembly in the United States. And Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has knocked rival firms for insufficient patriotism, saying that \"if big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.\"</p><p>Representatives for Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple all declined to comment.</p><p>Conspicuous patriotism is not a new tactic for companies accused of bad behavior. In the 1980s and 1990s, defenders of American tech giants like IBM and Microsoft argued that those companies' monopolistic behaviors were necessary to stave off competition from Japanese rivals. During World War II, Hollywood movie studios delayed a federal antitrust crackdown, in part by agreeing to help the military in the war effort. </p><p>Meredith Whittaker, a co-founder of the AI Now Institute at New York University and a former Google employee, characterized the tech industry's scaremongering about China as a tactical move meant to deflect criticism.</p><p>\"It's a really convenient narrative,\" Ms. Whittaker said. \"It evokes nationalism and a red scare trope that has worked in the past. And it implies that regulation, accountability and taking a pause to consider ethics would be counter to 'winning.'\"</p><p>Patriotic posturing may be a cynical tactic, but it could also be a smart one. Today's big tech companies are in a better negotiating position than most industries under fire. The meteoric growth of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon has bolstered the American stock market and made Silicon Valley a global innovation hub. Even if the motives of the tech giants are questionable, the importance of technologies like 5G connectivity and artificial intelligence to the country's competitive position isn't lost on lawmakers.</p><p>Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents parts of Silicon Valley in Congress, has called for greater regulation of tech companies. But in an interview this month, he told me that the risk of losing ground to China worried him.</p><p>\"There is a risk that we could see a Berlin digital wall,\" Mr. Khanna said. \"The question is, are the values of liberty, privacy and freedom of speech going to be embedded in technology platforms? China's platforms do not have many of the values that liberal democracies believe in.\"</p><p>There is nothing inherently wrong with the belief that America's values are superior to those found in Shanghai and Shenzhen, or that American tech companies should act in the country's best interest. But lawmakers should be appropriately wary of Silicon Valley's charm campaign, and they should avoid conflating what's good for Facebook, Google and other tech companies with what's good for the nation. Tech executives might be whistling \"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy,\" but they really just want to be left alone.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006655179</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT8-FCM1-JC85-N3K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1326\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 14, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Now, the NY Times has a detailed article on exactly that. It's about how a broad coalition of big, old, legacy companies are conspiring to punish Google and Facebook[2] by convincing the media and politicians that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is bad. The headline lists three companies: IBM, Marriott, and Disney. </p><p>While that might seem like \"an unusual constellation of powerful companies\" -- as the article puts it -- there is a simple thing tying them together: all three failed to adapt to an open internet. And now they're trying to kill it.Disney and its powerful trade association have fought to stop the law's spread abroad. Marriott has asked Congress to amend the law. IBM has a plan to slim it down. An unusual constellation of powerful companies and industries are fighting to weaken Big Tech by limiting the reach of one of its most sacred laws. The law, known as Section 230, makes it nearly impossible to sue platforms like Facebook or Google for the words, images and videos posted by their users.We've discussed each of these companies and their motivations in the past. Disney, of course, is a stand-in for the MPAA and all of the big Hollywood movie studios. Indeed, while Disney led the copyright lobbying charge in the 80s and 90s, the company leading the way against the internet and Section 230 over the past decade has been Fox. But, of course, Disney recently bought Fox. Hollywood has been fighting against the open internet for years, and its lobbyists have been planting false narratives about 230 for years, and eagerly fan the flames at every opportunity. Their hope has always been to chip away at 230 to make Google and Facebook more vulnerable, and to force them to negotiate some sort of huge transfer of money. Marriott, somewhat famously, has been screaming bloody murder about Airbnb for years[3], because it can't stand having competition that actually offers better service. Its hatred of 230[4] is because Airbnb has argued (though not always successfully), that 230 protects it from liability over user listings -- which, if successful, would block some of the laws Marriott and the wider hotel industry have been pushing to hinder Airbnb. Finally, there's IBM. And while the article doesn't mention it, it's really IBM and Oracle teaming up here. Last summer we wrote about IBM's sad attack on 230[5], a law that it doesn't rely on. Once again, with IBM and Oracle, we see two giant, lumbering tech companies, that made bad bets on the internet, and rather than recognizing that they messed up, they're using lobbying and the political process to harm the competitors who built the products people actually want. Neither IBM nor Oracle rely on Section 230, since they don't run consumer facing internet services. Both bet that the enterprise market and data would be where the market was -- but it actually turned out to be in consumer facing services. In both cases, the bottom-up open internet has also enabled smaller enterprise focused offerings to chip away increasingly at the bottom of their markets. A decade ago, we wrote about writer Andy Kessler's concept of political entrepreneurs v. market entrepreneurs[6]. One of them builds better, more innovative products that increase consumer welfare and increase the overall size of the pie by making things people want. The other uses its enormous power and political connections to pass regulations that hinder competitors who have innovated. One becomes successful through building services that make money from happy customers. One makes money by creating a restrained market in which they can collect monopoly rents above and beyond what an open market would bear. The latter -- the old legacy companies using lobbying to stomp out competition -- are a form of dangerous \"unproductive entrepreneurship.\"[7] It does not make the world a better place. It limits innovation and limits consumer welfare. So the next time you hear about the \"techlash\" and the \"problems\" of Section 230, consider who actually stands to benefit from chipping away (or removing entirely) Section 230. It is not you or me. It is not those who rely on a wide variety of internet services to express ourselves. It is the legacy companies which have fallen behind, which have not adapted, and which are using their political will to try to suppress and destroy the open systems that the rest of us now depend on.Permalink[8] | Comments[9] | Email This Story[10] [ 1]: <url

ReichBREAK 'EM UPRecovering Our Freedom From Big Ag, Big Tech, and Big MoneyBy Zephyr Teachout</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the mysteries in politics for decades now has been why white working-class Americans began to vote Republican in large numbers in the 1960s and 1970s. After all, it was Democrats who supported labor unions, higher minimum wages, expanded unemployment insurance, Medicare and generous Social Security, helping to lift workers into the middle class. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Of course, an alternative economic view, led by economists like Milton Friedman, was that this turn toward the Republican Party was rational and served workers' interests. He emphasized free markets, entrepreneurialism and the maximization of profit. These, Friedman argued, would raise wages for many and even most Americans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But wages did not rise. And yet many in the working class kept voting Republican, still seemingly angered by Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, which was dedicated to helping the poor and assuring equal rights for people of color. In the 1980s, under Ronald Reagan, income inequality began to rise sharply; wages for typical Americans stagnated and poverty and homelessness increased. Capital investment remained relatively weak despite deep tax cuts (as it does today under Donald Trump). At the same time, antitrust regulation was severely wounded, and giant corporations began to monopolize industry after industry.</p><p>  In 2004, Thomas Frank's book ''What's the Matter With Kansas?'' tried to explain why a once Democratic state had turned resolutely Republican. His eloquent review of the rhetoric of the age was instructive.</p><p>  But the presidential election of 2016 sent the sharpest message yet. Working-class voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin opted for Trump, and apparently against their economic interests. Trump had succeeded in appealing to their anger and the Democrats were caught flat-footed.</p><p>  Two new books, ''The System,'' by the former labor secretary Robert B. Reich, and ''Break 'Em Up,'' by the lawyer and activist Zephyr Teachout, a onetime candidate for New York State attorney general, are among the latest examples of an evolving set of explanations that try to make sense of the 2016 results.</p><p>  A powerful money-fueled oligarchy has emerged in America that is an enemy of democracy, Reich writes. The self-interested power of the nation's wealthy often goes unnoticed by voters, and is partly misdirected by right-wing rhetoric about issues like immigration. But it leads to lower wages, less product choice and abusive labor practices. Trump has harnessed the frustration of the working class, Reich says, but he was a ''smokescreen'' for the oligarchy. Reich has an almost unmatched ability to make insightful observations about the nation's inequities, and in ''The System,'' he observes that the question is no longer Democrat versus Republican or left versus right, but ''democracy versus oligarchy.''</p><p>  To Teachout, what's behind our rigged system is the close cousin of oligarchy: corporate monopoly. Teachout lists her culprits, among them familiar names: Amazon, Google, Facebook, Monsanto, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Walmart, Pfizer, Comcast, Apple and CVS. These companies ''represent a new political phenomenon,'' she says, ''a 21st-century form of centralized, authoritarian government.''</p><p>  Two dramatic related facts underscore the claims of both Reich and Teachout. The much discussed rise of wealth among the top 0.1 percent, which now has 20 percent of the nation's wealth compared with only 10 percent 40 years ago, has been brought to light in recent years by the innovative economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. The flip side is that wages for the large majority of American workers have stagnated more or less over this same period.</p><p>  According to Reich, the ''anti-establishment fury'' that is the result of such inequity supersedes racial prejudice as the cause of Trump's success. In 2001, more than three out of four workers were satisfied that they could get ahead by working hard. In 2014, only slightly more than one out of two thought so. Voters wanted badly to blame it all on the swamp Trump promised to clean up.</p><p>  For Reich, the big oligarchical companies have the lobbying and campaign-financing muscle to mold the rules in their own favor. They can win enormous tax cuts, suppress financial and environmental regulations, acquire new patents and subsidies, fight for free trade -- it is a long list. For years, they successfully battled against higher minimum wages and labor laws that restricted their union-busting efforts.</p><p>  Teachout, a dogged scholar, lays out a comprehensive list of damage done to American consumers by monopolized industries like Big Pharma, fossil fuels, Silicon Valley, health insurance, banking and communications giants from Verizon to Facebook and Google. She provides example after example of how these companies limit consumer choice and suppress regulation. Google and Facebook may make access to some news easier, but they also undermine the profitability of the print news organizations, putting many of them out of business. Big Pharma is protected from competition by questionable patents and by ever lighter regulations. The nation's private health care system, dominated by a relative handful of insurance companies, keeps costs much higher in the United States than in the rest of the rich world. For Teachout, the solution follows as night follows day. Break up the big companies and reintroduce competition. (Surprisingly, this is straightforward mainstream economic theory.)</p><p>  But both Reich and especially Teachout should temper their anticorporate zeal, at least to a degree. Big companies have often done good while also doing bad. In the 1800s, the A.&amp;P. grocery chain provided a wide range of products, though it put countless mom and pop stores out of business. Ford built a cheap functional car in the 1920s, and Apple an affordable personal computer in recent years. Some balance is required.</p><p>  Still, they are mostly right. Here is Teachout's general recommendation: ''Instead of protesting Pfizer on Tuesday for hiking drug prices, Comcast on Wednesday for suppressing union voices and Amazon on Thursday for getting billions in subsidies, we should unite behind a coherent agenda, demanding that antitrust authorities break up Pfizer and Comcast, Amazon and Facebook, Monsanto and Tyson.''</p><p>  Both authors say that Ronald Reagan led the way to the swift undoing of traditional antitrust regulation in the 1980s. But Reich is almost as harsh on the Clinton and Obama administrations. Even when the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, he writes, they allowed antitrust enforcement to ''ossify,'' let companies hammer away at trade unions and went easy on Wall Street. They were also soft on the issue of campaign contributions, failing to advocate for public financing of elections.</p><p>  Why? Reich argues that the Democrats chose to turn their backs on the working class and pursue suburban swing voters. He knows, he tells us. He was there. And he reports that the Democrats ''drank from the same campaign funding trough as the Republicans -- big corporations, Wall Street and the very wealthy.''</p><p>Reich makes an example of Jamie Dimon, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase. For Reich, he is representative of the C.E.O. class that talks about corporate social responsibility but rarely practices it. A lifetime Democrat, Dimon was a major supporter of the Trump tax cut and does not support an increase in the minimum wage.</p><p>  Teachout by and large shares Reich's anger and may even exceed it. Yet both find reasons for optimism in new laws and grass-roots movements. America achieved marriage equality for gays and lesbians, elected a Black man president and made the Affordable Care Act law. Reich insists democracy will ultimately prevail over oligarchy. And Teachout sees America embarking on a new antimonopoly moment.</p><p>  These are valuable books, and the anger they will generate may prove politically energizing. But Reich's claim that democracy will somehow prevail underestimates the dangers we face. As for Teachout, more competition may help alleviate some problems, but it is in fact an idealized version of free market thinking.</p><p>  Meanwhile, the current president is moving in exactly the opposite direction. He is promising cuts in social policies that may well increase middle-income and working-class frustration. He wants to rewrite the official definition of poverty to claim that there are fewer poor. He undermines the rule of law on a regular basis. The Supreme Court has been stacked with extreme conservatives. Voter suppression is common.</p><p>  Is it any wonder that many fear democracy in America may not prevail?Jeff Madrick, the author, most recently, of ''Invisible Americans: The Tragic Cost of Child Poverty,''  is the director of the Bernard Schwartz Rediscovering Government Initiative at the Century Foundation.THE SYSTEMWho Rigged It, How We Fix ItBy Robert B.

On Wednesday, The Washington Postreportedthat the social network was in negotiations with theFederal Trade Commissionover fines relating to the company's misuse of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Around the same time, Facebook made it public that it was setting aside between $3 billion and $5 billion for the fine. Let's assume the fine is at the top of the range, $5 billion. It's chump change to Facebook, which brings in around $15 billion in revenue per quarter. </p><p>And that's bugging the crap out of some people because they want Facebook to feel the sting, to hurt, to suffer, and while even $3 billion would probably be hard on most of us, not Zuck. What does a good, meaningful fine actually look like? Would it need to wipe out one quarter's revenue (roughly $15 billion)? Is a fine meaningless unless it's recurring (penalties for every quarter or year since Facebook last settled with the F.T.C. for violating user privacy in 2011)? What's missing here is some minimal recognition of why companies are punished by fines in the first instance. What purpose is served? What are the legitimate reasons to impose a fine, and what reasons justify a greater (or lesser) fine? This is what questions look like in the hands of the people who take for granted that wrongs inherently demand punishment. And that's long before reaching the problem of proportionality. At the core of these hypothetical arguments is the large question of not only how to regulate Facebook but of how to conceptualize an entity that operates largely without meaningful competitors and collects troves of information on more than two billion human beings. Facebook \u2014 alongside Big Tech counterparts of Google and Amazon \u2014 is operating at a vast scale. As such, any meaningful attempts to hold the company accountable should be equally disruptive, to borrow a Silicon Valley term of art. That the F.T.C. is negotiating what appears to be a trivial fine, suggests that the organization isn't just deferential to Facebook, but that it doesn't truly understand the company's power. What Charlie Warzel means when he calls $5 billion a 'trivial fine' isn't that it's a trivial amount of money, given that it's enough to bankrupt most businesses and individuals in America, likely Warzel included. But that tech giants, being tech giants, need to be tamed by the government to comply with its dictates, and so he reaches into the nether reaches of renowned legal theorist code monkey Anil Dash for answers. 'We don't have a good regulatory framework [for Facebook] because this kind of scale and impact is unprecedented. And our ideas for remedies, things like fines, are based on an outdated view of how markets work,' the Glitch C.E.O. and longtime developer, Anil Dash, told me. I've engaged with Dash in the past, something about either extra whip in my latte or his outrage that J.K. Rowling didn't write Harry Potter to look like him. 'The F.T.C. is based on the premise of markets where consumers have choice,' Mr. Dash continued. 'As long as their remedies are conceived of within that outdated framework, it will remain structurally impossible for them to hold any major platform accountable in any meaningful way.' If Dash had any grasp of the subject matter, he might have used the word 'deterrence' instead of 'markets,' if only because he's talking about fines rather than some jealous view of market share. Don't believe the critics? Then just ask the market. AsBuzzFeed News pointed out[2]on Wednesday, in justone hourof after-hours trading after signaling its impending $3 billion to $5 billion fine, Facebook's market capitalization increased by $40 billion. Which means that most fines likely to be considered by the F.T.C. might amount to what Matt Stoller, a fellow at the Open Markets Institute, described to me as 'a parking ticket and a news release.' Facebook has to sell a lot of click ads to earn $5 billion, but what it told the markets is that the fine won't bankrupt the Zuck or its other shareholders. Was it supposed to? Was the point of the fine to cripple the company, bring it down? David Carroll, a professor at the New School, who took legal action against Cambridge Analytica in the United Kingdom, agreed that, 'no fine would be adequate for a monopoly. Advertisers, users, and investors do not register the fines in their economic activity. [They're] still buying, using investing. It causes no material harm to Facebook. It's just bad PR.' What does he have in mind? 'Seizure of servers, criminal penalties against corporate directors and StopData Processingorders would actually be painful penalties,' he argued. Or, even more intense, 'force Facebook to delete its user data and models and start from scratch under rigorous collection restrictions.' Seize its servers? Imprison corporate directors? Destroy Facebook? The problem isn't that the FTC doesn't grasp its inadequacy to punish Facebook by mere financial punishment, or that the issue of data security isn't real and huge. The problem is that these marketeers want to use criminal and quasi-criminal sanctions for all the wrong reasons, and in all the wrong ways. The disappointment of the tech privacy contingent is that they want their slingshot to bring down Goliath. Hard. But they also acknowledged that a ruling most likely won't satisfy the harshest critics. 'They're not going to be vengeful. People who are angry and hurt may be disappointed. People who want to see change while still using these services \u2014 they may be better served.' The FTC isn't there to exact vengeance for the angry and hurt, but to deter corporations from violating the law, whether intentionally or negligently. The question of how to compel Facebook to protect user data is a good one, but not the question at hand despite the cries that something must be done. Fines aren't levied to compensate for the sad tears of the disaffected when it comes to corporations anymore than when it comes to sentencing individuals. No matter how badly a victim cries of his trauma and pain after a mugging, the defendant still doesn't get life plus cancer for it. The idea of using criminal and quasi-criminal sanctions to cut corporations down to manageable size because they've been far more successful than you is an abuse of government power. The only potential crisis then seems reserved for us, the users. If the regulators fail to meet the moment they'll have wasted a rare opportunity for real accountability. Worse yet, quietly prompting Facebook to write a check for an amount it's already safely ferreted away will be an admission that regulators are out of ideas when it comes to the company's unprecedented power and reach. It's not that Facebook is too big to punish, but that the use of punishment isn't to re-engineer corporations to do what baristas want them to do. Nobody forces you to use Facebook, to give them an iota of your data. Maybe half the problem isn't their accountability at all, but users' responsibility for handing them all their personal information on a silver platter in exchange for a few 'likes' from people they've never met. Don't blame Facebook or the FTC for your lousy bargain.

He has given countless speeches and written many articles on US strategy. [12] He believes in American leadership, the liberal international order, democracy, alliances, treaties, and climate change. His track record is not without controversy. He has been criticised for lacking a coherent philosophy on the use of military force and for his proposal to partition Iraq in the mid-2000s.      Biden represents a return to America\u2019s traditional  post-Second World War foreign policy.      In this election, these quibbles have faded into insignificance. Biden represents a return to America\u2019s traditional post-Second World War foreign policy. He has built a tent large enough for Republican Never-Trumpers, Democratic centrists (of whom he is one), and progressives. He will seek to undo much of what Donald Trump has wrought \u2014 he will quickly rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change, he will try to revive the Iran nuclear deal, he will work with other nations on combatting COVID-19, and he will resume US support for its allies.    But in other ways, Biden is an enigma. If he becomes president, his differences from Trump will not suffice as an organising principle for his foreign policy. We know he will be different from Trump, but will his presidency differ in significant ways from that of Barack Obama? There is very little way to know the answer to this question from the campaign. There have been hints. Biden has called Saudi Arabia a \u201cpariah state\u201d. Does that portend a significant change in America\u2019s posture in the Middle East? He has taken a tough line on China. So, will he buy into the concept of great power competition? He has argued that globalisation must serve the middle class. Will he be more open to progressive reforms to the global economy? He is an avowed transatlanticist, but will he continue Obama\u2019s policy of pushing Europe to spend more on the military, even as the pandemic exerts downward pressure on defence budgets?   President Barack Obama jokes with Vice President Joe Biden in the Oval Office,  9 February 2015. Image: Pete Souza/Official White House photograph/Flickr   It is difficult to answer these questions because to draw a contrast with Trump, Biden only needs to paint in broad brushstrokes. He knows his connection to Obama is an asset, and no political benefit exists in distancing himself from the former president. There may not be much to learn from the formal foreign policy debate between the candidates, but there is a second parallel debate occurring in plain sight that is revealing. This is the intra-centrist Democratic debate on foreign policy between two groups \u2014 restorationists who generally continue to support President Obama\u2019s worldview and foreign policy, albeit updated for recent events, and reformers who question some of the assumptions underpinning it and favour significant changes. This debate actually started during the Obama administration and it was fairly heated by the end. So much so, that it was widely believed Hillary Clinton would chart a course correction, focusing more on geopolitical competition.    This debate continued throughout the Trump years and evolved in interesting ways. It is rarely explicit in critically referencing actions taken during the Obama administration, but some of the analysis is noteworthy for future policy. Few outside Washington have paid much attention to the debate among centrists. The progressive left tends to dismiss centrist thinking as unchanging from the Clinton or Obama administrations, but new strands of thought are evident in foreign policy journals, think tank reports, and the work of National Security Action, an umbrella organisation established in 2017. Understanding this centrist debate sheds light on how a Biden administration might see the world. Biden\u2019s record as a senator, vice president, and presidential candidate strongly suggests he will have an open mind about how to implement his worldview \u2014 he will likely encourage and adjudicate the debates in his team.      Understanding this centrist debate sheds light on how  a Biden administration might see the world.      One additional school of thought that is significant, but I do not deal with here, is progressive foreign policy. The progressives developed a critique of centrists during the primary campaign and were closely associated with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Many of the progressive experts have joined the Biden team as advisers. The progressives focus on the linkage between progressive goals at home and foreign policy, particularly relating to the global economy, which they want to reform. They want to reduce America\u2019s military commitments overseas, but also to compete with autocratic and kleptocratic regimes and movements in non-military ways. The progressives will have influence in a Biden administration in particular areas \u2014 such as foreign economic policy, where they and the reformers see the issue similarly \u2014 and in Congress where an increasing number of representatives and senators identify as progressive. The progressive centrist divide has already been widely discussed. However, the intra-centrist debate, which will be embedded in a Biden administration, has been almost completely overlooked. [13]      The Obama Baseline      President Obama\u2019s worldview often appeared contradictory. He was a liberal who believed in progress and the necessity of American leadership in bringing it about. He was influenced by Samantha Power\u2019s writings and hired her and other liberal internationalists as key members of his team. Obama was also a student of the theologian and realist scholar Reinhold Niebuhr, and of former president George H W Bush. He had realist instincts; he worried about US actions creating more problems than they solved. He was unsentimental about the country\u2019s commitments. He believed the foreign policy establishment frequently inflated threats and had an unthinking bias towards action. In the early years of his presidency, these conflicting impulses and pressures clashed, and the outcome was often uncertain. By the end, it was clear the classical realist impulses had prevailed, at least when it came to military intervention and great power competition.   President Barack Obama meeting in the Situation Room with national security advisers to discuss postponing  a military strike in response to the Syrian government chemical weapons attack, 31 August 2013.  Image: Pete Souza/Official White House photograph/Flickr   Obama had become wary about military intervention, seeing his support for operations in Libya as a mistake. He was proud of his decision not to strike Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces after they crossed the red line in using chemical weapons in 2013. He would privately say his policy was \u201cdon\u2019t do stupid shit\u201d. [14] Others who served in his administration, including Clinton, were frustrated \u2014 \u2018\u201cDon\u2019t do stupid stuff\u201d is not an organizing principle\u201d, she said, much to Obama\u2019s annoyance. The spat was trivial in a sense, but in another way it was revealing \u2014 as his presidency progressed, Obama, and some on his team, harboured a hostility to the Democratic foreign policy establishment, or what deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes called \u2018The Blob\u2019. This extended beyond the Middle East, to the question of sending lethal assistance to Ukraine to repel Russian-backed forces. When confronted with such choices, Obama would always ask about the long-term effect \u2014 was there a risk his decision could start an escalation ladder that might result in a drawn out conflict involving Americans in the months or years to come?    In some ways, Obama\u2019s scepticism of American activism stemmed from his optimism about American power. He believed that if the United States got its own house in order and acted responsibly on the world stage, China, Russia, and other potential challengers would not be able to compete. He believed in \"the long game\". [15] In a sense, Obama was a Zen master \u2014 counting on America\u2019s adversaries to knock themselves out. Russia would get bogged down in Syria. China would create the antibodies to its own rise. He was wary of those who saw these challenges as existential. He routinely described Russia as a regional power that could not rival the United States. He toughened America\u2019s China policy, but also wanted to preserve cooperation with China on shared challenges such as climate change and pandemic disease.      In some ways, Obama\u2019s scepticism of American activism  stemmed from his optimism about American power.      When it came to foreign economic policy, Obama was something of a traditionalist. He was proud of the role his administration played in responding to the financial crisis in 2009. He championed new free trade agreements, justifying them to progressives by ensuring these agreements better reflected their concerns on labour and environmental standards. Ultimately, though, he was a believer in globalisation and did not seek to radically change or reverse it.    One group of Democrats continues to believe in this approach and has not fundamentally changed their worldview since the Obama administration. For sure, they have updated it to incorporate new challenges \u2014 they want to protect American democracy against foreign interference, they are more wary of Russia, and they recognise COVID-19 as one of the most severe crises to hit the United States and the international order over the past fifty years. But they also continue to believe that the arc of history favours the United States, they are sceptical of military interventionism, they do not want US foreign policy to be defined or constrained by geopolitical competition, even though they accept the United States must stand up for its interests against China, and they continue to believe in the economic and geopolitical benefits of globalisation. This group can be described as restorationist.    There were those within the Obama administration who disagreed with the president on a number of these issues. It is now well documented how Victoria Nuland and Celeste Wallander pressed Obama to do more to deter Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. [16] Samantha Power and others made the case for intervention in Syria. Less publicly, there were a considerable number of officials who argued for a tougher stance towards China.    In the past four years these debates have expanded and deepened. A number of leading Democrats have questioned some of the basic orthodoxies that underpinned Obama\u2019s foreign policy. They see Trump as an existential threat to American democracy and the international order, but they are not preoccupied with him when it comes to future foreign policy. They believe that the world has changed in fundamental ways in the past eight years since Xi Jinping came to power in China, Vladimir Putin returned as Russia\u2019s president, and Obama was re-elected. Nationalist populists have gained power in several countries, leading to a weakening of democratic institutions and an existential crisis for centrists. Authoritarian regimes have used new technologies to modernise the tactics and tools of repression and control. Autocratic leaders have become more assertive and aggressive internationally as the domestic and international constraints fell away. Shared problems, such as climate change and pandemics, have worsened, but international cooperation has become harder to achieve and to explain to domestic audiences. The conviction that the world has fundamentally changed has led this group to revisit the core tenets and assumptions of Democratic foreign policy in at least four areas: China, cooperation among democracies, foreign economic policy, and the Middle East. They can be called the reformers.    No issue has been more controversial or widely discussed than how the United States should approach China. In 2018, Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs during the Obama administration, and Ely Ratner, Biden\u2019s deputy national security adviser in Obama\u2019s second term, published an influential article in Foreign Affairs arguing that some of the key assumptions underpinning China policy in successive administrations \u2014 for instance, that commercial engagement with China would lead to economic liberalisation, and that China would become a responsible stakeholder in the international order \u2014 were wrong. [17] A year later, Campbell co-authored another article, this time with Jake Sullivan, who held several senior positions in the Obama administration, on how the United States could take a more competitive approach to China while avoiding confrontation. [18]   President Xi with President Trump on his official visit to China, 8 November 2017.  Image: Shealah Craighead/Official White House photograph/Flickr   Although there is a spectrum of opinion among reformers on China, some generalisations are possible. They generally believe, for example, that under Xi, China has become more of a dictatorship than an autocratic system where power is shared or at least somewhat limited by a politburo. They also consider that China is becoming more repressive, as demonstrated by the deployment of facial recognition technologies and social credit systems, the widespread use of concentration camps in Xinjiang, and the destruction of Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 model. What they are unsure about is the degree to which this will transform China\u2019s behaviour internationally, which brings us to the second generalisation.    The reformers want the United States to adopt a much more competitive strategy than the Obama administration did, but they are preoccupied with the question of how to blend competition and diplomacy so rivalry does not turn into confrontation and conflict, and so some cooperation on shared interests remains possible. Both parts of this equation are important. The reformers are more willing than the Trump administration to invest in diplomacy with China, but they will not dial back competition in exchange for cooperation on shared problems, as the Obama administration was sometimes willing to do.      The reformers worry that the United States is falling  behind technologically and economically.      The reformers worry that the United States is falling behind technologically and economically, and they believe major changes to US policy are required to get back into the lead. They want to see competition with China at the heart of America\u2019s alliances, including the transatlantic alliance, and they are generally willing to use the China challenge to advocate for domestic policy changes. They are open to the possibility of a limited decoupling between the United States and China, particularly on technology and supply chains for critical health supplies and other strategically important parts of the economy.    By contrast, the restorationists tend to be less willing to accept that Xi has transformed China into a different type of regime that is inherently unreasonable and dictatorial. They stress the continuity of today\u2019s China with the early and pre-Xi periods. They are less pessimistic about the changes in the distribution of power and oppose using the China threat to mobilise the political system behind domestic changes. They are highly sceptical of any decoupling between the United States and China. They do not believe that with the benefit of hindsight Obama got China wrong \u2014 as they see it, he did stand up to and compete with China.      Cooperation among Democracies      If the Democrats have one big idea, it is that the United States must deepen its cooperation with other democracies. At first glance, this is not new. Proposals for a concert or league of democracies have been around for at least 15 years, but the Trump administration has given them new life. Its infringement of democracy at home, combined with the president\u2019s preference for authoritarianism overseas, makes cooperation with other democracies an obvious and necessary corrective to the Trump years. However, the question is what form will this take?    In its most basic form \u2014 one to which Biden has already publicly committed \u2014 the United States would convene a summit of democracies, modelled on the Nuclear Security Summit, in which members commit to strengthen democracy at home and overseas. [19] The United States would also deepen its engagement with democratic allies. However, the reformers have a more radical version in mind.      The reformers see democracy versus authoritarianism  as a fault-line in world politics.      The reformers see democracy versus authoritarianism as a fault-line in world politics, a view they share with the progressives. They want the United States to make democratic cooperation an organising principle of its foreign policy, partly as a means of competing with China, and partly because they believe that democracy itself is at grave risk. They want democracies to become collectively resilient, including partially decoupling from authoritarian countries. They want to work with other free societies to promote liberal norms and to compete with China and Russia in international institutions.    Restorationists, on the other hand, worry about creating an ideological fault-line in world politics that exacerbates competition with China. They see cooperation among democracies as just one piece of a larger diplomatic strategy. They tend to be more optimistic about the fate of democracy in the medium to long term. They will certainly support democracy, but they do not necessarily see it as an organising principle.      Foreign Economic Policy      In an article in early 2020, Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s former national security adviser, and Jennifer Harris, a former Obama-administration official, documented new ways of thinking about global economics and trade. [20] Moderate domestic economic thinkers, they said, are currently reckoning with ideas that neoliberalism got wrong over the past decade. The foreign-policy world needs to do the same. Sullivan and Harris argue for reforming trade deals to target tax havens, prevent currency manipulation, improve wages, and generate investment in the United States. Industrial policy should be used to compete with China, particularly in new technologies, and foreign policy should be a part of the antitrust debate on breaking up big tech.    The Sullivan\u2013Harris agenda is generally aligned with thinking on the progressive side of the Democratic Party, where experts like Ganesh Sitaraman, who advises Elizabeth Warren, argue that US foreign policy should take geo-economics much more seriously. [21] Authoritarianism, the progressives argue, thrives on corruption, oligarchy, and kleptocracy, and it poses a threat to democracy from within as well as from without. To counter it, the United States must root out corruption and reform the global economy, including eliminating tax havens, regulating global finance, and tackling inequality.      Authoritarianism, the progressives argue, thrives on corruption, oligarchy, and kleptocracy, and it poses a threat to democracy.      Reformers are also willing to use the China challenge, which they believe is real and daunting, to mobilise support for an ambitious economic agenda domestically and internationally. [22] They see China as the glue that could hold together a coalition for reform, facilitating a greater role for government investment and much greater economic cooperation and coordination between democracies so they can present Beijing with a united front.    The restorationists tend to favour re-engaging in free trade deals, such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), [23] however they are reluctant to use responding to China as an organising principle for the policy, and they are more incrementalist on reforms to international finance and the global economy.     Middle East   The final area of debate is on the Middle East. Centrist Democrats now openly question whether the region is worth the high levels of military engagement the United States has maintained for decades. In an article for Foreign Affairs in early 2019, former Obama administration officials Tamara Wittes and Mara Karlin argued that \u201c[a]lthough the Middle East still matters to the United States, it matters markedly less than it used to\u201d. [24] In early 2020, Martin Indyk, Obama\u2019s envoy for Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that after a lifetime of supporting a very activist US role in the region, he is now of the view that it is no longer worth it. [25] All three favour a significant reduction in US goals in the Middle East. This is not only about avoiding unnecessary military interventions. Indeed, some reformers acknowledge the need for continued operations against ISIS or its affiliates even as they want to avoid more protracted and large scale interventions. It is also about downsizing America\u2019s traditional commitments, including to the Gulf Arab allies. There are dissenting views within the reformist camp. Sullivan and Daniel Benaim, who also served in the Obama administration, have argued for a much more ambitious and assertive diplomatic initiative to forge an agreement between the region\u2019s major powers, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, that would make more use of leverage than the Obama administration did, including making US support and assistance for Gulf Arab states conditional on their behaviour.

Image: Cpl Miguel A Rosales/US Marine Corps, US Department of Defense/Flickr   On the Middle East, the restorationists have been relatively silent. One can assume that they will seek to restart where Obama left off \u2014 resurrecting the Iran nuclear deal and working with US allies to push back against Iran and counter ISIS. There may also be a renewed effort to save the two-state solution, albeit without using leverage to dramatically increase pressure on Israel.      In each of the four areas \u2014 China, cooperation among democracies, foreign economic policy, and the Middle East \u2014 the debate is between those who see little reason to change the principal assumptions underpinning Obama\u2019s approach, and those who do. Some of this divide is generational, although the lines can be blurred. The reformers tend to have the urgency of a group that believes the world is slipping away and can only be salvaged with major changes in approach, not just from Trump, but from Obama too. Both approaches are compatible with Biden\u2019s worldview. Restorationists and reformers are both likely to be represented in his administration and he will adjudicate between them.    Those who would likely represent some continuity with the Obama administration\u2019s worldview include Susan Rice, who has been mooted as Secretary of State, and Tony Blinken, who is widely tipped as National Security Adviser. They served as Obama's National Security Adviser and Deputy Secretary of State respectively. Those more likely to challenge some of the assumptions underpinning Obama\u2019s foreign policy include former Biden rivals Pete Buttigieg, who could be named to the post of UN Ambassador or the State Department, as well as some of those who authored the articles cited above.    The most likely outcome is that these dividing lines continue into a Biden administration, imbuing it with a creative tension and shaping the internal debates and discourse. This should not prevent it from moving quickly as there is much that restorationists and reformers agree on. A Biden administration could take a series of rapid and far-reaching actions early in the term, particularly on climate change, tackling COVID-19, immigration, and multilateralism. But over time, it will be forced to come to grips with the trade-offs and compromises that these different approaches entail.    Of course, looming over all of this is the coronavirus crisis, which is not just a public health emergency, but also an economic crisis and a massive foreign policy challenge. The coronavirus seems to have persuaded the Biden team that their presidency will require a transformative foreign policy in several respects \u2014 fighting the virus globally, including developing and fairly distributing a vaccine, reforming and rebuilding international institutions, rebuilding the national and international economy, and coming to terms with the fact that over a decade and a half of cooperation with China on public health did not noticeably improve its response from the SARS pandemic of 2003\u201304. These aspects to the debate have yet to be fully absorbed into the wider foreign policy discourse.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43210809344</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YW-4MJ1-F07F-82XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4270\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>LowyInstitute.org</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Arzan Financial Group for Financing and Investment KPSC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>ARZAN</className><className>KUW</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: KW0EQ0200331</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Presidential Succession</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUJFNTE2OUIxNkEzNEIxN0I4NkQ4NUUzOThEMDVBMzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Emboldened and unconstrained, a second Trump administration could spell the end of the alliance system and the postwar liberal international order.</p><p><br/><br/>A Biden administration would be a reprieve for the US-led international order, and will act on climate change, COVID-19, immigration, and multilateralism, while Biden will need to adjudicate internal debates on China, the Middle East, globalisation, and foreign economic policy.<br/>                Executive Summary<br/>In his first term, President Donald Trump tried to overturn key principles of American foreign policy since the Second World War \u2014 alliances, free trade, and support for democracy and human rights. His effort was blunted by members of his own administration and Congress. But we are now at the point of no return.<br/>If Trump is re-elected, he will be vindicated and emboldened. He will surround himself with loyalists and will act without constraint. The world may be irrevocably altered \u2014 alliances may come to an end, the global economy could close, and democracy could go into rapid retreat.<br/>On the other hand, if Biden wins, the US-led international order will be granted a reprieve. The question for Biden is not whether he will be different from Trump. That much is obvious. It is whether he will differ from President Barack Obama.<br/>To answer that\u00a0question, this paper\u00a0studies\u00a0the intra-centrist debate within the Democratic Party\u2019s foreign policy establishment \u2014\u00a0between restorationists\u00a0(those who would continue Obama\u2019s approach) and reformers (who would challenge key elements of it) \u2014 and how that plays out on China, foreign economic policy, the Middle East, and democracy.\u00a0The first half of a Biden term is likely to be defined by a struggle between these two worldviews.<br/>Introduction<br/>The election of 2016 plunged US foreign policy into its greatest crisis since the period immediately preceding America\u2019s entry into the Second World War, when an internationalist president grappled with the original America First movement and an isolationist public over whether the United States should act to prevent a Nazi victory in Europe. In the current crisis, an America First president has rejected the fundamental principles of US leadership since the Second World War, including the US alliance system in Europe and Asia, free trade and an open international economy, and support for democracy and human rights. He has sought to radically change US foreign policy in line with his views over the objections of most of his national security team and the institutions of the state, including the Pentagon, the State Department, the US intelligence community, the US Congress, and the American public, which polls show has become even more supportive of alliances, free trade, and democracy during his term.[1]<br/>An America First president has rejected the fundamental<br/>principles of US leadership since the Second World War.<br/>The president and internationalists within his own administration and Congress have fought to a stalemate so far. On one hand, US alliances remain intact, US forces remain forward positioned, and the official foreign policy doctrine of the United States is oriented around great power competition. On the other hand, the president has removed many of the constraints on his freedom of action, he is extremely critical of US allies, and the United States has abandoned any pretence to leadership in fighting the coronavirus pandemic, one of the greatest international crises of the past fifty years. Several former senior officials in the Trump administration believe that he could strike a devastating blow against internationalists in a second term, effectively dissolving US alliances and bringing the post-Second World War order to a formal end. This is what makes the election of 2020 even more important than 2016. It is the point of no return. The immune system of the postwar US national security state has been dramatically weakened. If the American people confirm their support for an America First president by giving Trump a second term, this system will break and be replaced by something else. Moreover, the international order is especially fragile, reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic recession, along with continued uncertainty about America\u2019s role in the world. If Trump is re-elected, the rest of the world will conclude that the United States has fundamentally changed and the period of postwar leadership has ended.[2]<br/>Of course, opinion polls consistently show that President Donald Trump is likely to lose. If Democratic nominee and former vice president Joe Biden becomes president, the postwar US order will be granted a last-minute reprieve. Biden is an enthusiastic advocate of US alliances and American leadership. Although the questions surrounding a Biden administration will not be existential, as they would be in a second Trump term, they would nevertheless be of great consequence: will the United States be able to reconstitute the international order? Will Biden continue down the path of great power competition with China and Russia? Will Biden take advantage of the COVID-19 crisis to introduce major reforms to the international order, and what will the content of those reforms be? Most important of all, can Biden set the stage for a renewal of American leadership, or will history remember his administration as a brief and futile last gasp of the foreign policy establishment that was preceded and succeeded by a more durable nationalist alternative?<br/>President Donald Trump disembarks from Air Force One in Minnesota for a campaign rally,<br/>18 September 2020. Image: Tia Dufour/Official White House photograph/Flickr<br/>For some elections, it has been possible to argue that the two candidates would pursue different versions of the same foreign policy if elected. This is not so for 2020. The choice between Trump and Biden is so stark and consequential that the two outcomes are unlikely to bear any resemblance to each other. Therefore, this paper analyses each of the candidates on their own terms to narrow down the range of possibilities for their foreign policy if they were to be elected president. There are two principal findings:<br/>There is no reason to believe that President Trump will follow in the tradition of Republican presidents like George W Bush and Ronald Reagan and pursue a more multilateral and cooperative strategy in his second term. The best guide to President Trump\u2019s foreign policy is to understand his psychology and disposition, not to study his administration\u2019s formal policy documents and actions. In his first term, Trump systematically removed the constraints on his freedom of action and installed ultra-loyalists who would indulge his whims and preferences. This will continue and accelerate in a second term because he would view an electoral victory as an utter vindication of his approach. He will likely pursue his instincts on alliances, trade, autocrats, and the grandeur of his own role with vigour and few constraints. This could result in dramatic departures from America\u2019s traditional postwar policy, including the effective dissolution of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and other alliances. His administration will continue to show more interest in signalling its conservative bona fides than in building an international coalition to advance US interests.<br/>The question with Biden is not how he is different from Trump. That much is obvious. It is whether he will be different from President Barack Obama. Will his administration be a third Obama term, or will it be distinctive in its own right? The most significant and overlooked piece of evidence in answering this question is a series of substantive debates between centrists in the Democratic Party, which continues an earlier debate inside the Obama administration. This has taken place in parallel with the progressive-centrist debate, which received considerably more attention in the primary campaign. The intra-centrist debate has two schools \u2014 a restorationist group that holds to the Obama\u00a0worldview,\u00a0and a reform group that questions some of the basic assumptions of that administration, on China, globalisation, the Middle East, and the long-term future of the liberal international order. The first half of a Biden term is likely to be defined by a struggle between these two worldviews. The coronavirus crisis will cast a shadow over all of this and raise fundamental questions about the future of the global economy, cooperation with China, and the future of international institutions. The debate on these issues has barely begun.<br/>If there is a unifying\u00a0theme among these findings, it is that foreign policy is in a crisis that is coming to a boiling point.<br/>If there is a unifying theme among these findings, it is that US foreign policy is in a crisis that is coming to a boiling point. The question is whether those who believe in the tradition of American leadership since the Second World War receive a reprieve. If they do not, will there be anything left by the end of Trump\u2019s second term? If they do, how will they handle the opportunity: by reverting to the way things were in 2016, or by doing something dramatically different?<br/>I: Predicting Trump\u2019s Second Term<br/>To understand what a second Trump term would look like, it is necessary to understand the trajectory of his first term, which can be best thought of as occurring in four phases.[3] This is not intended as just a history, but as analysis of where things are likely heading. Trump has already gone through several stages, has learned several lessons, and will, from his point of view, absorb and act on those in a second term.<br/>Phase 1: The Axis of Adults<br/>Trump has a set of visceral beliefs about the world that dates back to the mid-1980s.[4] He is sceptical of America\u2019s alliances, feels that free trade is bad for the United States, and has a fondness for authoritarian strongmen. These are the themes he has returned to again and again over a thirty year period. When he is stuck for something to say, or just riffing in front of a rally, this is where he finds his voice. However, when he unexpectedly won the presidency in 2016, he had a problem. He had paid no attention to how to convert these visceral beliefs into policy and there were very few foreign policy experts who believed what he believed, certainly none who were confirmable by the Senate. He was somewhat insecure. He had no intention of bringing back the so-called Never Trumpers, but he did need experience. So he turned to former generals and business leaders, men such as James Mattis, John Kelly, H R McMaster (after a brief and catastrophic couple of weeks with Michael Flynn), Rex Tillerson, and Gary Cohn.<br/>National Security Adviser H R McMaster, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Vice President Mike Pence, and<br/>Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with President Donald Trump in the White House Cabinet Room,\u00a07 September 2017.<br/>Image: Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images<br/>Trump liked the idea of military leaders and CEOs, all deferential to him. But the \u2018axis of adults\u2019, as they were quickly labelled, were traditionalists. For the most part, they believed in alliances, democracy, and free trade. They saw their role as placing a check on the president, not satisfying his whims and desires. They sought to constrain his choices and box him in to a \u2018normal\u2019 foreign policy. When he rebelled \u2014 for instance, when he refused to endorse Article 5 in a speech at the new NATO headquarters \u2014 they prevailed on him to reverse course. The first six months were chaotic \u2014 and the \u2018adults\u2019, particularly Tillerson, deserve their fair share of the blame \u2014 but in retrospect those months were the most normal of Trump\u2019s presidency in that there was a process of sorts and the agencies of the US government sought continuity with the postwar foreign policy tradition.<br/>Trump liked the idea of military leaders<br/>and CEOs,\u00a0all deferential to him.<br/>Trump was never going to accept a second fiddle role in his own administration and he grew resentful at being managed. As John Bolton notes in his book The Room Where It Happened, the adults were \u201cso transparently self-serving and so publicly dismissive of many of Trump\u2019s very clear goals (whether worthy or unworthy) that they fed Trump\u2019s already-suspicious mindset\u201d. He \u201csecond-guessed people\u2019s motives, saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House\u201d.[5] A breaking point was reached on 17 July 2017 during an interagency meeting to decide whether to recertify Iran\u2019s compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an assessment that the United States was required to make every six months.[6] Trump\u2019s national security team presented him with three options, all of which involved staying in the deal. Trump was furious \u2014 he approved a recertification, but promised that it would be the last one. By the next deadline, he wanted the option to leave. A marker had been set. A second was laid down days later, at a meeting senior officials described as a \u201cshitshow\u201d, when McMaster, then national security adviser, spent considerable political capital to box the president into keeping troops in Afghanistan. Again Trump fumed. He would cave several weeks later and agree to keep troops there, but from that point forwards, he was determined to rid himself of these meddlesome priests of national security and go his own way.<br/>Throughout the northern autumn of 2017, rumours swirled of palace intrigue and upheaval. Trump began to realise that as president he could do things even if his team disagreed. In early 2018, Trump forced out the axis of adults, replacing Tillerson, Cohn, and McMaster with individuals who placed loyalty to the president over their own independent judgment \u2014 Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, and Larry Kudlow. This ushered in the second phase of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 the age of action.<br/>Phase 2: The Age of Action<br/>Trump now acted more freely, pursuing his instincts even when they conflicted with the advice of his officials. He announced talks with Kim Jong-un without consulting his cabinet. He moved the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal. He tweeted his response to Bashar al-Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons before talking with his national security team. He imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum. He held a summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki and publicly accepted the Russian president\u2019s word on election interference over the unanimous views of the US intelligence community. He started a trade war with China. He mused about buying Greenland. He even ordered a military parade over the objections of the Pentagon. Bolton effectively abolished the interagency process through which the Departments of Defense and State and other entities have formal seats at the table where decisions are made. The removal of constraints was complete when Mattis resigned in December 2018 following Trump\u2019s pledge to withdraw troops from Syria.<br/>The first US president to set foot in North Korea, President Donald Trump meets with Kim Jong-un, 30 June 2019<br/>at the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Image: Shealah Craighead/Official White House photograph/Flickr<br/>For Trump, the age of action was exhilarating. It fulfilled his expectations of what it meant to be president. It was free-wheeling. He still gave orders that were not always followed, but less so than before, and none of his officials publicly defied him. On the rare occasion where a member of his national security team sought to undermine his policy, they were marginalised and excluded. For example, shortly after Bolton became national security adviser, he said in an interview that North Korea should follow the Libya model for denuclearisation. It was a remark intended to torpedo the US\u2013North Korea talks before they got going. Trump took a while to notice, but when he did, he was furious. Bolton was subsequently frozen out of all policymaking on North Korea, and Trump was clear that if it were to happen again, Bolton would be out.<br/>But it could not last forever. Trump\u2019s actions were always focused on the short term and what served his political interest or aligned with his long-standing instincts. They were frequently riven with contradictions. Things could change from one day to the next. There was never an end goal or a strategy for how to get there. He was often indecisive and insecure and could be swayed by pundits on cable news. The United States is a very powerful country. It can make mistakes for some time without incurring the costs that normal powers would experience. But it cannot do so indefinitely. This brought us to phase three.<br/>Phase 3: The Age of Reckoning<br/>The age of reckoning finally arrived on 21 June 2019, when Trump ordered air strikes on Iran in retaliation for its drone attack on a Saudi airfield, and then changed his mind. At this moment, the contradictions in his Iran policy were laid bare. Trump wanted to shred the Iran nuclear deal and impose maximum pressure on the Iranian regime. He also wanted to avoid embroiling America in a new conflict in the Middle East. He could not have both. But for more than a year, he pretended as if these two goals were not in conflict. Perhaps he believed the Iranians would surrender without a fight. Or that they would come to the negotiating table from a position of weakness. Or perhaps he did not think about the endgame at all until he had to. When push came to shove, he decided he did not want a new war in the Middle East. His hawkish team saw the climb down as humiliating.<br/>The same dynamic played itself out with China. The administration was pursuing a tough and competitive strategy towards Beijing, but Trump was primarily motivated by trade and economics. He never bought into the idea of a full spectrum great power competition \u2014 the centrepiece of his National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy. He did not care about regional equilibriums or human rights (according to Bolton, he twice told Xi Jinping he supported the building of concentration camps in Xinjiang).[7] Just as he had railed against Japan in the 1980s for being an economic competitor to the United States, he focused his ire on China\u2019s economy. All along he hoped for an economically beneficial\u00a0deal that he could sell politically as a major win.<br/>To Trump, rivals are like mountains to a mountaineer.<br/>They are there to be climbed.<br/>Trump has always had a dual narrative about his own prowess. He wants to be seen as the militarist \u2014 the\u00a0toughest guy in town, willing to do things no one else is willing to do. He also wants to be seen as the dealmaker and negotiator in chief, someone who can reach agreement with the toughest foe. To Trump, rivals are like mountains to a mountaineer. They are there to be climbed. Thus his fascination with Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Recep Erdo?an, and Kim Jong-un. The militarist and the dealmaker are not always in\u00a0conflict with each other. On North Korea, one could argue Trump used the former to build up leverage and then cashed it in. But they are not always in harmony either. The two became contradictory in the northern summer of 2019. Trump would have to make a decision. With the election in sight, he chose to be a dealmaker so he could prevent his political opponents from describing him as a warmonger during the election campaign. He tried to strike deals even if the moment was not right. He sought talks with the Iranian leadership in September 2019. He tried to invite the Taliban to Camp David around the time of the 9/11 anniversary. He negotiated a trade deal with China. As an obstacle to this agenda, Bolton was forced out. Meanwhile, Trump continued to act as he wished, without any pushback from his team. Just to take one example, his compliant secretary of defence transferred funds from US forces in Europe to help build the wall on the southern US border.<br/>Phase 4: G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung<br/>Throughout the first three years of the Trump presidency, both critics and supporters of President Trump added the caveat \u201cassuming there is no crisis\u201d to their analysis of his foreign policy. Trump\u2019s personality and cognitive traits seem particularly ill-suited to a major crisis. In 2020, the long awaited crisis finally arrived and it was a whopper \u2014 a once in a century pandemic with an economic collapse to rival the Great Depression. This catastrophe could have been a political opportunity for another president. Here was a chance to reset public opinion. The president could have set politics aside, told the American people he would focus solely on defeating the virus, levelled with them about the severity of the challenge they faced, and presented himself as a can-do businessman who would reach across the aisle.<br/>President Donald Trump and Vice Premier of China, Liu He, sign the US-China Phase One Trade Agreement<br/>at\u00a0the White House, 15 January 2020.

In the early weeks, as the coronavirus spread through Wuhan, Trump prioritised the trade deal he had negotiated with China. It would be a key part of his election campaign \u2014 Trump the dealmaker. He dismissed the warnings from his national security and intelligence teams. He praised Xi and expressed the hope the virus would disappear, even though he privately knew it was a major and imminent threat to the United States. When COVID-19 became impossible to ignore, he reached for an eye-catching policy consistent with the Trump brand \u2014 the travel ban on China and subsequently on Europe \u2014 and declared victory. This took place on 31 January. He did almost nothing else on the coronavirus in the month of February.<br/>The following few months were a horror show. As cases and fatalities rose, Trump oscillated back and forth between bashing China and declaring the crisis over. He showed no interest in convening the international community or coordinating a national response. He liked to highlight the tribulations of other countries to portray his own failures in a better light. He actively spread disinformation about the virus and ways of treating it. The United States became a warning to others. Meanwhile, Trump continued to indulge his free-wheeling style and visceral instincts. With no rallies and very limited travel or capacity to host visitors, he grew more isolated and volatile on social media. He made an attempt to pivot back to the dealmaker narrative with the normalisation agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates in August 2020, and between Serbia and Kosovo in September 2020, but the crisis overwhelmed everything else.<br/>This was the first major international emergency since the Second World War in which the United States played no leadership role. As chair of the G7 and a close partner of G20 chair Saudi Arabia, the Trump administration could have convened world leaders to coordinate travel and economic restrictions, share information, and work on a vaccine. Not only did they show no interest, but Trump administration officials actively undermined the efforts of other nations who tried to fill the vacuum. When France tried to mobilise the G7 and the United Nations Security Council, the Trump administration insisted that these forums formally blame China as a precondition for action \u2014 dooming the effort before it began.<br/>In January, when Trump was praising China,<br/>the WHO was privately alarmed.<br/>Even more disturbing was the Trump administration\u2019s attitude towards the World Health Organization (WHO). In January, when Trump was praising China, the WHO was privately alarmed. Internal documents show that senior officials were concerned that China was covering up the virus but that they could not say so publicly in case it reduced China\u2019s cooperation even further. The United States had an opportunity to build a coalition, working with the WHO and the international community to press Beijing for greater transparency and cooperation. Instead, Washington did nothing. After the virus hit the United States, Trump blamed China and the WHO. He temporarily withheld funding from the WHO and set a 30-day deadline for talks with its leadership on reform. Just 8 days into the 30-day period, and unbeknown to his own officials, Trump announced he was withdrawing formally, dismaying America\u2019s allies and empowering Beijing.<br/>A Second Term<br/>Trump\u2019s first term followed a narrative arc of a president shedding constraints, becoming more comfortable wielding power, doing so in line with his own instincts and political interests, and persisting with this even as he encountered trouble and the catastrophic crisis the country is now engulfed in. There is absolutely no evidence from the first term that he will follow the historical trend of Republicans being more moderate in the second term,\u00a0as was the case with Ronald Reagan and George W Bush. As John Bolton concludes in his book, Trump in a second term will be \u201cfar less constrained by politics than he was in a first term\u201d.[8]<br/>Some analysts are more optimistic and believe that Trump will be less disruptive in a second term. They argue that his policy is rooted in a substantive shift towards great power competition that will continue if he is re-elected.[9] The problem the optimists have is that they largely leave Trump out of the story. A re-elected Trump will feel fully vindicated. He will once again have defied the experts. His psychological make-up will be a more important driver of his behaviour than formal policy documents in which he has little involvement. Not without reason, he will believe that he represents the views of the public on foreign policy far better than those of the establishment or former members of his team who now snipe at him from the sidelines.<br/>There are four specific predictions we can draw from this about his second term.<br/>The first is that he will double down on his instinct. He will look to build on the beliefs he has held for over thirty years. He and his team will be more prepared, both bureaucratically and psychologically, than they were in 2017. They will be willing to push the envelope further. There is a parallel with the administration\u2019s immigration policy \u2014 Trump began with opposition to illegal immigration, but over time this morphed into a larger assault on legal immigration. So what might this mean for national security? In his first term, Trump focused his criticism of America\u2019s alliances on defence spending. In his book, Bolton confirmed that Trump wanted to get out of NATO, something former officials have verified to me off the record.[10] In a second term, he could well try to unravel some of America\u2019s alliances. He could unilaterally reinterpret Article 5 to effectively destroy NATO (for instance by saying he will not use force to defend any country that does not pay the United States directly for providing security). He could use the status of forces negotiation to withdraw troops from South Korea. While Trump got on well with Japan\u2019s former prime minister Shinzo Abe, he could try the same tactic on new leader Yoshihide Suga.<br/>President Donald Trump and Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Angela Merkel, at the<br/>North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 70th anniversary meeting in London,<br/>4 December 2019. Image: Shealah Craighead/Official White House photograph/Flickr<br/>Second, Trump will choose a team that enables him to behave in this way. There will be no axis of adults to constrain the president this time around. Trump has made it clear he values loyalty above all else. He has used little-known legal provisions to impose his loyalists into positions temporarily without Senate approval, for example when\u00a0he moved Richard Grenell from the ambassadorship to Germany to become Director of National Intelligence. The White House personnel office has systematically tried to root out and remove officials in various departments and agencies who are not personally loyal to the president. In a second term, Trump has three pools of people from which to draw. The first are senior Republican politicians who have been steadfastly loyal to him, such as Senator Tom Cotton, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Josh Hawley, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, and, of course Mike Pompeo. He can also tap Republican governors who have been sufficiently loyal. These people also have some policy views that diverge from those of Trump, although they try to minimise them. The second are ultra-loyalists who have no real power base of their own and owe their influence entirely to the president personally. This pool includes people such as Grenell and retired US Army officers Anthony Tata, and Douglas Macgregor, who came to Trump\u2019s attention through their commentary on cable news. It also potentially includes family members, particularly Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump Jr. The third group are younger officials who will have gained experience in the first term. The end result will likely be a mix, but of the three groups, the second \u2014 the ultra-loyalists \u2014 is poised to be the most influential. The problem with the senior Republicans is that many have preferences that diverge from those of Trump \u2014 on alliances and Russia in particular \u2014 while the third group are too junior.<br/>President Donald Trump with [L to R] adviser Jared Kushner, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,<br/>adviser Ivanka Trump, and\u00a0Vice President Mike Pence before Secretary Pompeo's<br/>swearing in ceremony\u00a0in Washington DC, 2 May 2018. Image: US Dept of State<br/>Third, that part of the Republican foreign policy establishment that is still on good terms with Trump will try to make the containment of China the centrepiece of Trump\u2019s second term, but it is not clear if the president has fully bought into it. They will do this partly because they believe it, but also because it is the only reed they have to cling to in Trump\u2019s worldview. It is how they can, in their view, make lemonade out of lemons \u2014 they can persuade him to play a leadership role in Asia, and they can sell him on the utility of alliances, including in Europe. The problem they have is that Trump is mainly driven by concern about China\u2019s economic role. He has no issue with the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s domestic authoritarianism, and very limited interest in the geopolitical interests of US allies, including Taiwan. We can expect the Republican Party\u2019s attempts to influence Trump to be focused on encouraging him to stay the course on China.<br/>Fourth, a second Trump term will most likely mark the formal end of the post-Second World War and post-Cold War international order. By the end of Trump\u2019s first term, US-led international cooperation has effectively ground to a halt. The administration is much more interested in signalling its conservative bona fides to its base than in organising an international coalition. We may see bilateral initiatives, but the era of structured and sustained cooperation will be over. Other countries will adjust accordingly. Allies will simply stop looking to the United States for help. They cannot fill the vacuum, but they will try to limit the damage by working more closely with each other. This will most immediately be felt in the COVID-19 crisis \u2014 vaccine nationalism will prevail and there will be little effort to prevent the economic recovery from tilting in a protectionist direction. Adversaries will see an opportunity to erode liberal norms globally and to manipulate the American president through a mix of flattery and inducements.<br/>II: Predicting a Biden Administration<br/>In many ways, Joe Biden is a known quantity when it comes to foreign policy.[11] He served as a US senator for thirty-six years and as vice president for eight. He took an interest in world affairs from the beginning of his career and was chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His son, Beau, served in combat and Biden immersed himself in the policy questions surrounding the wars that followed 9/11, including travelling to Iraq and Afghanistan multiple times. He has given countless speeches and written many articles on US strategy.[12] He believes in American leadership, the liberal international order, democracy, alliances, treaties, and climate change. His track record is not without controversy. He has been criticised for lacking a coherent philosophy on the use of military force and for his proposal to partition Iraq in the mid-2000s.<br/>Biden represents a return to America\u2019s traditional<br/>post-Second World War foreign policy.<br/>In this election, these quibbles have faded into insignificance. Biden represents a return to America\u2019s traditional post-Second World War foreign policy. He has built a tent large enough for Republican Never-Trumpers, Democratic centrists (of whom he is one), and progressives. He will seek to undo much of what Donald Trump has wrought \u2014 he will quickly rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change, he will try to revive the Iran nuclear deal, he will work with other nations on combatting COVID-19, and he will resume US support for its allies.<br/>But in other ways, Biden is an enigma. If he becomes president, his differences from Trump will not suffice as an organising principle for his foreign policy. We know he will be different from Trump, but will his presidency differ in significant ways from that of Barack Obama? There is very little way to know the answer to this question from the campaign. There have been hints. Biden has called Saudi Arabia a \u201cpariah state\u201d. Does that portend a significant change in America\u2019s posture in the Middle East? He has taken a tough line on China. So, will he buy into the concept of great power competition? He has argued that globalisation must serve the middle class. Will he be more open to progressive reforms to the global economy? He is an avowed transatlanticist, but will he continue Obama\u2019s policy of pushing Europe to spend more on the military, even as the pandemic exerts downward pressure on defence budgets?<br/>President Barack Obama jokes with Vice President Joe Biden in the Oval Office,<br/>9 February 2015. Image: Pete Souza/Official White House photograph/Flickr<br/>It is difficult to answer these questions because to draw a contrast with Trump, Biden only needs to paint in broad brushstrokes. He knows his connection to Obama is an asset, and no political benefit exists in distancing himself from the former president. There may not be much to learn from the formal foreign policy debate between the candidates, but there is a second parallel debate occurring in plain sight that is revealing. This is the intra-centrist Democratic debate on foreign policy between two groups \u2014 restorationists who generally continue to support President Obama\u2019s worldview and foreign policy, albeit updated for recent events, and reformers who question some of the assumptions underpinning it and favour significant changes. This debate actually started during the Obama administration and it was fairly heated by the end. So much so, that it was widely believed Hillary Clinton would chart a course correction, focusing more on geopolitical competition.<br/>This debate continued throughout the Trump years and evolved in interesting ways. It is rarely explicit in critically referencing actions taken during the Obama administration, but some of the analysis is noteworthy for future policy. Few outside Washington have paid much attention to the debate among centrists. The progressive left tends to dismiss centrist thinking as unchanging from the Clinton or Obama administrations, but new strands of thought are evident in foreign policy journals, think tank reports, and the work of National Security Action, an umbrella organisation established in 2017. Understanding this centrist debate sheds light on how a Biden administration might see the world. Biden\u2019s record as a senator, vice president, and presidential candidate strongly suggests he will have an open mind about how to implement his worldview \u2014 he will likely encourage and adjudicate the debates in his team.<br/>Understanding this centrist debate sheds light on how<br/>a Biden administration might see the world.<br/>One additional school of thought that is significant, but I do not deal with here, is progressive foreign policy. The progressives developed a critique of centrists during the primary campaign and were closely associated with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Many of the progressive experts have joined the Biden team as advisers. The progressives focus on the linkage between progressive goals at home and foreign policy, particularly relating to the global economy, which they want to reform. They want to reduce America\u2019s military commitments overseas, but also to compete with autocratic and kleptocratic regimes and movements in non-military ways. The progressives will have influence in a Biden administration in particular areas \u2014 such as foreign economic policy, where they and the reformers see the issue similarly \u2014 and in Congress where an increasing number of representatives and senators identify as progressive. The progressive centrist divide has already been widely discussed. However, the intra-centrist debate, which will be embedded in a Biden administration, has been almost completely overlooked.[13]<br/>The Obama Baseline<br/>President Obama\u2019s worldview often appeared contradictory. He was a liberal who believed in progress and the necessity of American leadership in bringing it about. He was influenced by Samantha Power\u2019s writings and hired her and other liberal internationalists as key members of his team. Obama was also a student of the theologian and realist scholar Reinhold Niebuhr, and of former president George H W Bush. He had realist instincts; he worried about US actions creating more problems than they solved. He was unsentimental about the country\u2019s commitments. He believed the foreign policy establishment frequently inflated threats and had an unthinking bias towards action. In the early years of his presidency, these conflicting impulses and pressures clashed, and the outcome was often uncertain. By the end, it was clear the classical realist impulses had prevailed, at least when it came to military intervention and great power competition.<br/>President Barack Obama meeting in the Situation Room with national security advisers to discuss postponing<br/>a military strike in response to the Syrian government chemical weapons attack, 31 August 2013.<br/>Image: Pete Souza/Official White House photograph/Flickr<br/>Obama had become wary about military intervention, seeing his support for operations in Libya as a mistake. He was proud of his decision not to strike Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces after they crossed the red line in using chemical weapons in 2013. He would privately say his policy was \u201cdon\u2019t do stupid shit\u201d.[14] Others who served in his administration, including Clinton, were frustrated \u2014 \u2018\u201cDon\u2019t do stupid stuff\u201d is not an organizing principle\u201d, she said, much to Obama\u2019s annoyance. The spat was trivial in a sense, but in another way it was revealing \u2014 as his presidency progressed, Obama, and some on his team, harboured a hostility to the Democratic foreign policy establishment, or what deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes called \u2018The Blob\u2019. This extended beyond the Middle East, to the question of sending lethal assistance to Ukraine to repel Russian-backed forces. When confronted with such choices, Obama would always ask about the long-term effect \u2014 was there a risk his decision could start an escalation ladder that might result in a drawn out conflict involving Americans in the months or years to come?<br/>In some ways, Obama\u2019s scepticism of American activism stemmed from his optimism about American power. He believed that if the United States got its own house in order and acted responsibly on the world stage, China, Russia, and other potential challengers would not be able to compete. He believed in \"the long game\".[15] In a sense, Obama was a Zen master \u2014 counting on America\u2019s adversaries to knock themselves out. Russia would get bogged down in Syria. China would create the antibodies to its own rise. He was wary of those who saw these challenges as existential. He routinely described Russia as a regional power that could not rival the United States. He toughened America\u2019s China policy, but also wanted to preserve cooperation with China on shared challenges such as climate change and pandemic disease.<br/>In some ways, Obama\u2019s scepticism of American activism<br/>stemmed from his optimism about American power.<br/>When it came to foreign economic policy, Obama was something of a traditionalist. He was proud of the role his administration played in responding to the financial crisis in 2009. He championed new free trade agreements, justifying them to progressives by ensuring these agreements better reflected their concerns on labour and environmental standards. Ultimately, though, he was a believer in globalisation and did not seek to radically change or reverse it.<br/>One group of Democrats continues to believe in this approach and has not fundamentally changed their worldview since the Obama administration. For sure, they have updated it to incorporate new\u00a0challenges \u2014 they want to protect American democracy against foreign interference, they are more wary of Russia, and they recognise COVID-19 as one of the most severe crises to hit the United States and the international order over the past fifty years. But they also continue to believe that the arc of history favours the United States, they are sceptical of military interventionism, they do not want US foreign policy to be defined or constrained by geopolitical competition, even though they accept the United States must stand up for its interests against China, and they continue to believe in the economic and geopolitical benefits of globalisation. This group can be described as restorationist.<br/>There were those within the Obama administration who disagreed with the president on a number of these issues. It is now well documented how Victoria Nuland and Celeste Wallander pressed Obama to do more to deter Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.[16] Samantha Power and others made the case for intervention in Syria. Less publicly, there were a considerable number of officials who argued for a tougher stance towards China.<br/>In the past four years these debates have expanded and deepened. A number of leading Democrats have questioned some of the basic orthodoxies that underpinned Obama\u2019s foreign policy. They see Trump as an existential threat to American democracy and the international order, but they are not preoccupied with him when it comes to future foreign policy. They believe that the world has changed in fundamental ways in the past eight years since Xi Jinping came to power in China, Vladimir Putin returned as Russia\u2019s president, and Obama was re-elected. Nationalist populists have gained power in several countries, leading to a weakening of democratic institutions and an existential crisis for centrists. Authoritarian regimes have used new technologies to modernise the tactics and tools of repression and control. Autocratic leaders have become more assertive and aggressive internationally as the domestic and international constraints fell away. Shared problems, such as climate change and pandemics, have worsened, but international cooperation has become harder to achieve and to explain to domestic audiences. The conviction that the world has fundamentally changed has led this group to revisit the core tenets and assumptions of Democratic foreign policy in at least four areas: China, cooperation among democracies, foreign economic policy, and the Middle East. They can be called the reformers.<br/>China<br/>No issue has been more controversial or widely discussed than how the United States should approach China. In 2018, Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs during the Obama administration, and Ely Ratner, Biden\u2019s deputy national security adviser in Obama\u2019s second term, published an influential article in Foreign Affairs arguing that some of the key assumptions underpinning China policy in successive administrations \u2014 for instance, that commercial engagement with China would lead to economic liberalisation, and that China would become a responsible stakeholder in the international order \u2014 were wrong.[17] A year later, Campbell co-authored another article, this time with Jake Sullivan, who held several senior positions in the Obama administration, on how the United States could take a more competitive approach to China while avoiding confrontation.[18]<br/>President Xi with President Trump on his official visit to China, 8 November 2017.<br/>Image: Shealah Craighead/Official White House photograph/Flickr<br/>Although there is a spectrum of opinion among reformers on China, some generalisations are possible. They generally believe, for example, that under Xi, China has become more of a dictatorship than an autocratic system where power is shared or at least somewhat limited by a politburo. They also consider that China is becoming more repressive, as demonstrated by the deployment of facial recognition technologies and social credit systems, the widespread use of concentration camps in Xinjiang, and the destruction of Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 model. What they are unsure about is the degree to which this will transform China\u2019s behaviour internationally, which brings us to the second generalisation.<br/>The reformers want the United States to adopt a much more competitive strategy than the Obama administration did, but they are preoccupied with the question of how to blend competition and diplomacy so rivalry does not turn into confrontation and conflict, and so some cooperation on shared interests remains possible. Both parts of this equation are important. The reformers are more willing than the Trump administration to invest in diplomacy with China, but they will not dial back competition in exchange for cooperation on shared problems, as the Obama administration was sometimes willing to do.<br/>The reformers worry that the United States is falling<br/>behind technologically and economically.<br/>The reformers worry that the United States is falling behind technologically and economically, and they believe major changes to US policy are required to get back into the lead. They want to see competition with China at the heart of America\u2019s alliances, including the transatlantic alliance, and they are generally willing to use the China challenge to advocate for domestic policy changes. They are open to the possibility of a limited decoupling between the United States and China, particularly on technology and supply chains for critical health supplies and other strategically important parts of the economy.<br/>By contrast, the restorationists tend to be less willing to accept that Xi has transformed China into a different type of regime that is inherently unreasonable and dictatorial. They stress the continuity of today\u2019s China with the early and pre-Xi periods. They are less pessimistic about the changes in the distribution of power and oppose using the China threat to mobilise the political system behind domestic changes. They are highly sceptical of any decoupling between the United States and China. They do not believe that with the benefit of hindsight Obama got China wrong \u2014 as they see it, he did stand up to and compete with China.<br/>Cooperation among Democracies<br/>If the Democrats have one big idea, it is that the United States must deepen its cooperation with other democracies. At first glance, this is not new. Proposals for a concert or league of democracies have been around for at least 15 years, but the Trump administration has given them new life. Its infringement of democracy at home, combined with the president\u2019s preference for authoritarianism overseas, makes cooperation with other democracies an obvious and necessary corrective to the Trump years. However, the question is what form will this take?<br/>In its most basic form \u2014 one to which Biden has already publicly committed \u2014 the United States would convene a summit of democracies, modelled on the Nuclear Security Summit, in which members commit to strengthen democracy at home and overseas.[19] The United States would also deepen its engagement with democratic allies. However, the reformers have a more radical version in mind.<br/>The reformers see democracy versus authoritarianism<br/>as a fault-line in world politics.<br/>The reformers see democracy versus authoritarianism as a fault-line in world politics, a view they share with the progressives. They want the United States to make democratic cooperation an organising principle of its foreign policy, partly as a means of competing with China, and partly because they believe that democracy itself is at grave risk. They want democracies to become collectively resilient, including partially decoupling from authoritarian countries. They want to work with other free societies to promote liberal norms and to compete with China and Russia in international institutions.<br/>Restorationists, on the other hand, worry about creating an ideological fault-line in world politics that exacerbates competition with China. They see cooperation among democracies as just one piece of a larger diplomatic strategy. They tend to be more optimistic about the fate of democracy in the medium to long term. They will certainly support democracy, but they do not necessarily see it as an organising principle.<br/>Foreign Economic Policy<br/>In an article in early 2020, Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s former national security adviser, and Jennifer Harris, a former Obama-administration official, documented new ways of thinking about global economics and trade.[20] Moderate domestic economic thinkers, they said, are currently reckoning with ideas that neoliberalism got wrong over the past decade. The foreign-policy world needs to do the same. Sullivan and Harris argue for reforming trade deals to target tax havens, prevent currency manipulation, improve wages, and generate investment in the United States. Industrial policy should be used to compete with China, particularly in new technologies, and foreign policy should be a part of the antitrust debate on breaking up big tech.<br/>The Sullivan\u2013Harris agenda is generally aligned with thinking on the progressive side of the Democratic Party, where experts like Ganesh Sitaraman, who advises Elizabeth Warren, argue that US foreign policy should take geo-economics much more seriously.[21] Authoritarianism, the progressives argue, thrives on corruption, oligarchy, and kleptocracy, and it poses a threat to democracy from within as well as from without. To counter it, the United States must root out corruption and reform the global economy, including eliminating tax havens, regulating global finance, and tackling inequality.<br/>Authoritarianism, the progressives argue, thrives on corruption, oligarchy, and kleptocracy, and it poses a threat to democracy.<br/>Reformers are also willing to use the China challenge, which they believe is real and daunting, to mobilise support for an ambitious economic agenda domestically and internationally.[22] They see China as the glue that could hold together a coalition for reform, facilitating a greater role for government investment and much greater economic cooperation and coordination between democracies so they can present Beijing with a united front.<br/>The restorationists tend to favour re-engaging in free trade deals, such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),[23] however they are reluctant to use responding to China as an organising principle for the policy, and they are more incrementalist on reforms to international finance and the global economy.<br/>Middle East<br/>The final area of debate is on the Middle East. Centrist Democrats now openly question whether the region is worth the high levels of military engagement the United States has maintained for decades. In an article for Foreign Affairs in early 2019, former Obama administration officials Tamara Wittes and Mara Karlin argued that \u201c[a]lthough the Middle East still matters to the United States, it matters markedly less than it used to\u201d.[24] In early 2020, Martin Indyk, Obama\u2019s envoy for Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that after a lifetime of supporting a very activist US role in the region, he is now of the view that it is no longer worth it.[25]All three favour a significant reduction in US goals in the Middle East. This is not only about avoiding unnecessary military interventions. Indeed, some reformers acknowledge the need for continued operations against ISIS or its affiliates even as they want to avoid more protracted and large scale interventions. It is also about downsizing America\u2019s traditional commitments, including to the Gulf Arab allies. There are dissenting views within the reformist camp. Sullivan and Daniel Benaim, who also served in the Obama administration, have argued for a much more ambitious and assertive diplomatic initiative to forge an agreement between the region\u2019s major powers, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, that would make more use of leverage than the Obama administration did, including making US support and assistance for Gulf Arab states conditional on their behaviour.[26]<br/>US Marines attached to Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force Crisis Response-Central Command,<br/>post security during a Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel Exercise at Camp Buehring, Kuwait, August 2019.<br/>Image: Cpl Miguel A Rosales/US Marine Corps, US Department of Defense/Flickr<br/>On the Middle East, the restorationists have been relatively silent. One can assume that they will seek to restart where Obama left off \u2014 resurrecting the Iran nuclear deal and working with US allies to push back against Iran and counter ISIS. There may also be a renewed effort to save the two-state solution, albeit without using leverage to dramatically increase pressure on Israel.<br/>In each of the four areas \u2014 China, cooperation among democracies, foreign economic policy, and the Middle East \u2014 the debate is between those who see little reason to change the principal assumptions underpinning Obama\u2019s approach, and those who do. Some of this divide is generational, although the lines can be blurred. The reformers tend to have the urgency of a group that believes the world is slipping away and can only be salvaged with major changes in approach, not just from Trump, but from Obama too. Both approaches are compatible with Biden\u2019s worldview. Restorationists and reformers are both likely to be represented in his administration and he will adjudicate between them.<br/>Those who would likely represent some continuity with the Obama administration\u2019s worldview include Susan Rice, who has been mooted as Secretary of State, and Tony Blinken, who is widely tipped as National Security Adviser. They served as Obama's National Security Adviser and Deputy Secretary of State respectively. Those more likely to challenge some of the assumptions underpinning Obama\u2019s foreign policy include former Biden rival\u00a0Pete Buttigieg, who could be named to the post of UN Ambassador or the State Department, as well as some of those who authored the articles cited above.<br/>The most likely outcome is that these dividing lines continue into a Biden administration, imbuing it with a creative tension and shaping the internal debates and discourse. This should not prevent it from moving quickly as there is much that restorationists and reformers agree on. A Biden administration could take a series of rapid and far-reaching actions early in the term, particularly on climate change, tackling COVID-19, immigration, and multilateralism. But over time, it will be forced to come to grips with the trade-offs and compromises that these different approaches entail.<br/>Of course, looming over all of this is the coronavirus crisis, which is not just a public health emergency, but also an economic crisis and a massive foreign policy challenge. The coronavirus seems to have persuaded the Biden team that their presidency will require a transformative foreign policy in several respects \u2014 fighting the virus globally, including developing and fairly distributing a vaccine, reforming and rebuilding international institutions, rebuilding the national and international economy, and coming to terms with the fact that over a decade and a half of cooperation with China on public health did not noticeably improve its response from the SARS pandemic of 2003\u201304. These aspects to the debate have yet to be fully absorbed into the wider foreign policy discourse.<br/>The Obama BaselineChinaCooperation among DemocraciesForeign Economic PolicyMiddle East<br/>The final area of debate is on the Middle East.

Sullivan and Daniel Benaim, who also served in the Obama administration, have argued for a much more ambitious and assertive diplomatic initiative to forge an agreement between the region\u2019s major powers, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, that would make more use of leverage than the Obama administration did, including making US support and assistance for Gulf Arab states conditional on their behaviour.[26]<br/>US Marines attached to Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force Crisis Response-Central Command,<br/>post security during a Tac         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-115266</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YY-DSF1-DY1R-B27H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9815\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 <br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Foundation For Research On Equal Opportunity</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Executive Offices</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUNDOTU3NEExMTQxNDUzRkFFQUFDNkZGRUFGNzY1QTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>Labor Provisions</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjM2REZGRTc4MTg3NDM2REFBOTk5ODRFNUM2MTE5QjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Military &amp;

[11] He served as a US senator for thirty-six years and as vice president for eight. He took an interest in world affairs from the beginning of his career and was chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His son, Beau, served in combat and Biden immersed himself in the policy questions surrounding the wars that followed 9/11, including travelling to Iraq and Afghanistan multiple times. He has given countless speeches and written many articles on US strategy. [12] He believes in American leadership, the liberal international order, democracy, alliances, treaties, and climate change. His track record is not without controversy. He has been criticised for lacking a coherent philosophy on the use of military force and for his proposal to partition Iraq in the mid-2000s.      Biden represents a return to America\u2019s traditional  post-Second World War foreign policy.      In this election, these quibbles have faded into insignificance. Biden represents a return to America\u2019s traditional post-Second World War foreign policy. He has built a tent large enough for Republican Never-Trumpers, Democratic centrists (of whom he is one), and progressives. He will seek to undo much of what Donald Trump has wrought \u2014 he will quickly rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate change, he will try to revive the Iran nuclear deal, he will work with other nations on combatting COVID-19, and he will resume US support for its allies.    But in other ways, Biden is an enigma. If he becomes president, his differences from Trump will not suffice as an organising principle for his foreign policy. We know he will be different from Trump, but will his presidency differ in significant ways from that of Barack Obama? There is very little way to know the answer to this question from the campaign. There have been hints. Biden has called Saudi Arabia a \u201cpariah state\u201d. Does that portend a significant change in America\u2019s posture in the Middle East? He has taken a tough line on China. So, will he buy into the concept of great power competition? He has argued that globalisation must serve the middle class. Will he be more open to progressive reforms to the global economy? He is an avowed transatlanticist, but will he continue Obama\u2019s policy of pushing Europe to spend more on the military, even as the pandemic exerts downward pressure on defence budgets?   President Barack Obama jokes with Vice President Joe Biden in the Oval Office,  9 February 2015. Image: Pete Souza/Official White House photograph/Flickr   It is difficult to answer these questions because to draw a contrast with Trump, Biden only needs to paint in broad brushstrokes. He knows his connection to Obama is an asset, and no political benefit exists in distancing himself from the former president. There may not be much to learn from the formal foreign policy debate between the candidates, but there is a second parallel debate occurring in plain sight that is revealing. This is the intra-centrist Democratic debate on foreign policy between two groups \u2014 restorationists who generally continue to support President Obama\u2019s worldview and foreign policy, albeit updated for recent events, and reformers who question some of the assumptions underpinning it and favour significant changes. This debate actually started during the Obama administration and it was fairly heated by the end. So much so, that it was widely believed Hillary Clinton would chart a course correction, focusing more on geopolitical competition.    This debate continued throughout the Trump years and evolved in interesting ways. It is rarely explicit in critically referencing actions taken during the Obama administration, but some of the analysis is noteworthy for future policy. Few outside Washington have paid much attention to the debate among centrists. The progressive left tends to dismiss centrist thinking as unchanging from the Clinton or Obama administrations, but new strands of thought are evident in foreign policy journals, think tank reports, and the work of National Security Action, an umbrella organisation established in 2017. Understanding this centrist debate sheds light on how a Biden administration might see the world. Biden\u2019s record as a senator, vice president, and presidential candidate strongly suggests he will have an open mind about how to implement his worldview \u2014 he will likely encourage and adjudicate the debates in his team.      Understanding this centrist debate sheds light on how  a Biden administration might see the world.      One additional school of thought that is significant, but I do not deal with here, is progressive foreign policy. The progressives developed a critique of centrists during the primary campaign and were closely associated with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Many of the progressive experts have joined the Biden team as advisers. The progressives focus on the linkage between progressive goals at home and foreign policy, particularly relating to the global economy, which they want to reform. They want to reduce America\u2019s military commitments overseas, but also to compete with autocratic and kleptocratic regimes and movements in non-military ways. The progressives will have influence in a Biden administration in particular areas \u2014 such as foreign economic policy, where they and the reformers see the issue similarly \u2014 and in Congress where an increasing number of representatives and senators identify as progressive. The progressive centrist divide has already been widely discussed. However, the intra-centrist debate, which will be embedded in a Biden administration, has been almost completely overlooked. [13]      The Obama Baseline      President Obama\u2019s worldview often appeared contradictory. He was a liberal who believed in progress and the necessity of American leadership in bringing it about. He was influenced by Samantha Power\u2019s writings and hired her and other liberal internationalists as key members of his team. Obama was also a student of the theologian and realist scholar Reinhold Niebuhr, and of former president George H W Bush. He had realist instincts; he worried about US actions creating more problems than they solved. He was unsentimental about the country\u2019s commitments. He believed the foreign policy establishment frequently inflated threats and had an unthinking bias towards action. In the early years of his presidency, these conflicting impulses and pressures clashed, and the outcome was often uncertain. By the end, it was clear the classical realist impulses had prevailed, at least when it came to military intervention and great power competition.   President Barack Obama meeting in the Situation Room with national security advisers to discuss postponing  a military strike in response to the Syrian government chemical weapons attack, 31 August 2013.  Image: Pete Souza/Official White House photograph/Flickr   Obama had become wary about military intervention, seeing his support for operations in Libya as a mistake. He was proud of his decision not to strike Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces after they crossed the red line in using chemical weapons in 2013. He would privately say his policy was \u201cdon\u2019t do stupid shit\u201d. [14] Others who served in his administration, including Clinton, were frustrated \u2014 \u2018\u201cDon\u2019t do stupid stuff\u201d is not an organizing principle\u201d, she said, much to Obama\u2019s annoyance. The spat was trivial in a sense, but in another way it was revealing \u2014 as his presidency progressed, Obama, and some on his team, harboured a hostility to the Democratic foreign policy establishment, or what deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes called \u2018The Blob\u2019. This extended beyond the Middle East, to the question of sending lethal assistance to Ukraine to repel Russian-backed forces. When confronted with such choices, Obama would always ask about the long-term effect \u2014 was there a risk his decision could start an escalation ladder that might result in a drawn out conflict involving Americans in the months or years to come?    In some ways, Obama\u2019s scepticism of American activism stemmed from his optimism about American power. He believed that if the United States got its own house in order and acted responsibly on the world stage, China, Russia, and other potential challengers would not be able to compete. He believed in \"the long game\". [15] In a sense, Obama was a Zen master \u2014 counting on America\u2019s adversaries to knock themselves out. Russia would get bogged down in Syria. China would create the antibodies to its own rise. He was wary of those who saw these challenges as existential. He routinely described Russia as a regional power that could not rival the United States. He toughened America\u2019s China policy, but also wanted to preserve cooperation with China on shared challenges such as climate change and pandemic disease.      In some ways, Obama\u2019s scepticism of American activism  stemmed from his optimism about American power.      When it came to foreign economic policy, Obama was something of a traditionalist. He was proud of the role his administration played in responding to the financial crisis in 2009. He championed new free trade agreements, justifying them to progressives by ensuring these agreements better reflected their concerns on labour and environmental standards. Ultimately, though, he was a believer in globalisation and did not seek to radically change or reverse it.    One group of Democrats continues to believe in this approach and has not fundamentally changed their worldview since the Obama administration. For sure, they have updated it to incorporate new challenges \u2014 they want to protect American democracy against foreign interference, they are more wary of Russia, and they recognise COVID-19 as one of the most severe crises to hit the United States and the international order over the past fifty years. But they also continue to believe that the arc of history favours the United States, they are sceptical of military interventionism, they do not want US foreign policy to be defined or constrained by geopolitical competition, even though they accept the United States must stand up for its interests against China, and they continue to believe in the economic and geopolitical benefits of globalisation. This group can be described as restorationist.    There were those within the Obama administration who disagreed with the president on a number of these issues. It is now well documented how Victoria Nuland and Celeste Wallander pressed Obama to do more to deter Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. [16] Samantha Power and others made the case for intervention in Syria. Less publicly, there were a considerable number of officials who argued for a tougher stance towards China.    In the past four years these debates have expanded and deepened. A number of leading Democrats have questioned some of the basic orthodoxies that underpinned Obama\u2019s foreign policy. They see Trump as an existential threat to American democracy and the international order, but they are not preoccupied with him when it comes to future foreign policy. They believe that the world has changed in fundamental ways in the past eight years since Xi Jinping came to power in China, Vladimir Putin returned as Russia\u2019s president, and Obama was re-elected. Nationalist populists have gained power in several countries, leading to a weakening of democratic institutions and an existential crisis for centrists. Authoritarian regimes have used new technologies to modernise the tactics and tools of repression and control. Autocratic leaders have become more assertive and aggressive internationally as the domestic and international constraints fell away. Shared problems, such as climate change and pandemics, have worsened, but international cooperation has become harder to achieve and to explain to domestic audiences. The conviction that the world has fundamentally changed has led this group to revisit the core tenets and assumptions of Democratic foreign policy in at least four areas: China, cooperation among democracies, foreign economic policy, and the Middle East. They can be called the reformers.    No issue has been more controversial or widely discussed than how the United States should approach China. In 2018, Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs during the Obama administration, and Ely Ratner, Biden\u2019s deputy national security adviser in Obama\u2019s second term, published an influential article in Foreign Affairs arguing that some of the key assumptions underpinning China policy in successive administrations \u2014 for instance, that commercial engagement with China would lead to economic liberalisation, and that China would become a responsible stakeholder in the international order \u2014 were wrong. [17] A year later, Campbell co-authored another article, this time with Jake Sullivan, who held several senior positions in the Obama administration, on how the United States could take a more competitive approach to China while avoiding confrontation. [18]   President Xi with President Trump on his official visit to China, 8 November 2017.  Image: Shealah Craighead/Official White House photograph/Flickr   Although there is a spectrum of opinion among reformers on China, some generalisations are possible. They generally believe, for example, that under Xi, China has become more of a dictatorship than an autocratic system where power is shared or at least somewhat limited by a politburo. They also consider that China is becoming more repressive, as demonstrated by the deployment of facial recognition technologies and social credit systems, the widespread use of concentration camps in Xinjiang, and the destruction of Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 model. What they are unsure about is the degree to which this will transform China\u2019s behaviour internationally, which brings us to the second generalisation.    The reformers want the United States to adopt a much more competitive strategy than the Obama administration did, but they are preoccupied with the question of how to blend competition and diplomacy so rivalry does not turn into confrontation and conflict, and so some cooperation on shared interests remains possible. Both parts of this equation are important. The reformers are more willing than the Trump administration to invest in diplomacy with China, but they will not dial back competition in exchange for cooperation on shared problems, as the Obama administration was sometimes willing to do.      The reformers worry that the United States is falling  behind technologically and economically.      The reformers worry that the United States is falling behind technologically and economically, and they believe major changes to US policy are required to get back into the lead. They want to see competition with China at the heart of America\u2019s alliances, including the transatlantic alliance, and they are generally willing to use the China challenge to advocate for domestic policy changes. They are open to the possibility of a limited decoupling between the United States and China, particularly on technology and supply chains for critical health supplies and other strategically important parts of the economy.    By contrast, the restorationists tend to be less willing to accept that Xi has transformed China into a different type of regime that is inherently unreasonable and dictatorial. They stress the continuity of today\u2019s China with the early and pre-Xi periods. They are less pessimistic about the changes in the distribution of power and oppose using the China threat to mobilise the political system behind domestic changes. They are highly sceptical of any decoupling between the United States and China. They do not believe that with the benefit of hindsight Obama got China wrong \u2014 as they see it, he did stand up to and compete with China.      Cooperation among Democracies      If the Democrats have one big idea, it is that the United States must deepen its cooperation with other democracies. At first glance, this is not new. Proposals for a concert or league of democracies have been around for at least 15 years, but the Trump administration has given them new life. Its infringement of democracy at home, combined with the president\u2019s preference for authoritarianism overseas, makes cooperation with other democracies an obvious and necessary corrective to the Trump years. However, the question is what form will this take?    In its most basic form \u2014 one to which Biden has already publicly committed \u2014 the United States would convene a summit of democracies, modelled on the Nuclear Security Summit, in which members commit to strengthen democracy at home and overseas. [19] The United States would also deepen its engagement with democratic allies. However, the reformers have a more radical version in mind.      The reformers see democracy versus authoritarianism  as a fault-line in world politics.      The reformers see democracy versus authoritarianism as a fault-line in world politics, a view they share with the progressives. They want the United States to make democratic cooperation an organising principle of its foreign policy, partly as a means of competing with China, and partly because they believe that democracy itself is at grave risk. They want democracies to become collectively resilient, including partially decoupling from authoritarian countries. They want to work with other free societies to promote liberal norms and to compete with China and Russia in international institutions.    Restorationists, on the other hand, worry about creating an ideological fault-line in world politics that exacerbates competition with China. They see cooperation among democracies as just one piece of a larger diplomatic strategy. They tend to be more optimistic about the fate of democracy in the medium to long term. They will certainly support democracy, but they do not necessarily see it as an organising principle.      Foreign Economic Policy      In an article in early 2020, Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s former national security adviser, and Jennifer Harris, a former Obama-administration official, documented new ways of thinking about global economics and trade. [20] Moderate domestic economic thinkers, they said, are currently reckoning with ideas that neoliberalism got wrong over the past decade. The foreign-policy world needs to do the same. Sullivan and Harris argue for reforming trade deals to target tax havens, prevent currency manipulation, improve wages, and generate investment in the United States. Industrial policy should be used to compete with China, particularly in new technologies, and foreign policy should be a part of the antitrust debate on breaking up big tech.    The Sullivan\u2013Harris agenda is generally aligned with thinking on the progressive side of the Democratic Party, where experts like Ganesh Sitaraman, who advises Elizabeth Warren, argue that US foreign policy should take geo-economics much more seriously. [21] Authoritarianism, the progressives argue, thrives on corruption, oligarchy, and kleptocracy, and it poses a threat to democracy from within as well as from without. To counter it, the United States must root out corruption and reform the global economy, including eliminating tax havens, regulating global finance, and tackling inequality.      Authoritarianism, the progressives argue, thrives on corruption, oligarchy, and kleptocracy, and it poses a threat to democracy.      Reformers are also willing to use the China challenge, which they believe is real and daunting, to mobilise support for an ambitious economic agenda domestically and internationally. [22] They see China as the glue that could hold together a coalition for reform, facilitating a greater role for government investment and much greater economic cooperation and coordination between democracies so they can present Beijing with a united front.    The restorationists tend to favour re-engaging in free trade deals, such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), [23] however they are reluctant to use responding to China as an organising principle for the policy, and they are more incrementalist on reforms to international finance and the global economy.     Middle East   The final area of debate is on the Middle East. Centrist Democrats now openly question whether the region is worth the high levels of military engagement the United States has maintained for decades. In an article for Foreign Affairs in early 2019, former Obama administration officials Tamara Wittes and Mara Karlin argued that \u201c[a]lthough the Middle East still matters to the United States, it matters markedly less than it used to\u201d. [24] In early 2020, Martin Indyk, Obama\u2019s envoy for Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that after a lifetime of supporting a very activist US role in the region, he is now of the view that it is no longer worth it. [25] All three favour a significant reduction in US goals in the Middle East. This is not only about avoiding unnecessary military interventions. Indeed, some reformers acknowledge the need for continued operations against ISIS or its affiliates even as they want to avoid more protracted and large scale interventions. It is also about downsizing America\u2019s traditional commitments, including to the Gulf Arab allies. There are dissenting views within the reformist camp. Sullivan and Daniel Benaim, who also served in the Obama administration, have argued for a much more ambitious and assertive diplomatic initiative to forge an agreement between the region\u2019s major powers, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, that would make more use of leverage than the Obama administration did, including making US support and assistance for Gulf Arab states conditional on their behaviour.

Image: Cpl Miguel A Rosales/US Marine Corps, US Department of Defense/Flickr   On the Middle East, the restorationists have been relatively silent. One can assume that they will seek to restart where Obama left off \u2014 resurrecting the Iran nuclear deal and working with US allies to push back against Iran and counter ISIS. There may also be a renewed effort to save the two-state solution, albeit without using leverage to dramatically increase pressure on Israel.      In each of the four areas \u2014 China, cooperation among democracies, foreign economic policy, and the Middle East \u2014 the debate is between those who see little reason to change the principal assumptions underpinning Obama\u2019s approach, and those who do. Some of this divide is generational, although the lines can be blurred. The reformers tend to have the urgency of a group that believes the world is slipping away and can only be salvaged with major changes in approach, not just from Trump, but from Obama too. Both approaches are compatible with Biden\u2019s worldview. Restorationists and reformers are both likely to be represented in his administration and he will adjudicate between them.    Those who would likely represent some continuity with the Obama administration\u2019s worldview include Susan Rice, who has been mooted as Secretary of State, and Tony Blinken, who is widely tipped as National Security Adviser. They served as Obama's National Security Adviser and Deputy Secretary of State respectively. Those more likely to challenge some of the assumptions underpinning Obama\u2019s foreign policy include former Biden rivals Pete Buttigieg, who could be named to the post of UN Ambassador or the State Department, as well as some of those who authored the articles cited above.    The most likely outcome is that these dividing lines continue into a Biden administration, imbuing it with a creative tension and shaping the internal debates and discourse. This should not prevent it from moving quickly as there is much that restorationists and reformers agree on. A Biden administration could take a series of rapid and far-reaching actions early in the term, particularly on climate change, tackling COVID-19, immigration, and multilateralism. But over time, it will be forced to come to grips with the trade-offs and compromises that these different approaches entail.    Of course, looming over all of this is the coronavirus crisis, which is not just a public health emergency, but also an economic crisis and a massive foreign policy challenge. The coronavirus seems to have persuaded the Biden team that their presidency will require a transformative foreign policy in several respects \u2014 fighting the virus globally, including developing and fairly distributing a vaccine, reforming and rebuilding international institutions, rebuilding the national and international economy, and coming to terms with the fact that over a decade and a half of cooperation with China on public health did not noticeably improve its response from the SARS pandemic of 2003\u201304. These aspects to the debate have yet to be fully absorbed into the wider foreign policy discourse.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43210786652</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YW-FWB1-F07F-8064-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4270\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>LowyInstitute.org</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Arzan Financial Group for Financing and Investment KPSC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>ARZAN</className><className>KUW</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>ISIN: KW0EQ0200331</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Presidential Succession</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUJFNTE2OUIxNkEzNEIxN0I4NkQ4NUUzOThEMDVBMzY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

While some regulation of the technology sector could make sense, politics has turned much of the conversation into a continual \u201croast\u201d of these companies. Unfortunately, these political attacks \u2014 from both the left and right \u2014 threaten to result in bad regulations if we are not careful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most glaring example of this slippery slope is the issue of Section 230, the law that protects platforms from liability for the content that users upload or create. President Trump, and many notable conservatives such as Senator Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley,\u00a0argue [1]\u00a0that this law allows \u201cbig tech\u201d platforms to actively discriminate against conservative voices. To fix this, these politicians want to remove or limit Section 230 protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most examples of anti-conservative moderation bias really come down to individuals violating the platform\u2019s terms of service. </p><p>Though many of these examples can be easily explained, the president has led the charge in an effort to remove these protections. Beyond the damage already done by that threat alone, this could ultimately result in policies that will drive platforms to further\u00a0silence [2]\u00a0the type of content the president wants to support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, this would be a perfect opportunity for Democrats to push back on the president. After all, it\u2019s easy to explain why Section 230 protects free speech online and promotes competition, since the liability protections allow small companies to grow. However, many on the left feel that disinformation and hate speech online is the direct result of \u201cbig tech.\u201d As a result, both the left and right have set their sights on these tech companies. In fact, Biden has gone on the record arguing in favor of\u00a0revoking 230 [3]\u00a0entirely, a proposition that many 230 critics find untenable and ultimately counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big tech makes for an easy villain, so these political attacks should be no surprise. But bad policy threatens to rear its ugly head if these attacks devolve into a political show designed to raise campaign donations and increase the national profile of the politicians involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the\u00a0House Judiciary Committee [4]\u00a0will hold a hearing with the CEOs of many of the major tech companies. The topic is about the dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement. To be clear, Congress should continue to examine competition in the online space. But, as often happens with\u00a0hearings [5]\u00a0about technology companies, and with the added publicity that will be provided by bringing in these CEOs, members of Congress may see this as yet another opportunity to attack \u201cbig tech\u201d unfairly or to propose solutions that will do much more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These harms aren\u2019t hypothetical. Take, for example, a\u00a0copyright law [6]\u00a0in Spain, which allowed publications to charge news aggregators. Thanks, in part, to the narrative that \u201cbig tech\u201d hurt traditional publishing, Spain passed the law as a means to\u00a0go after [7]\u00a0companies like Google. However, news aggregators simply collect the headlines of the day, provide a little snippet and then direct users to the original websites to read the stories themselves. This is a valuable service, and one that many consumers want to use. Unfortunately, for those Spanish consumers, that service is now lost. This is because, due to the relative lack of profit that aggregation services provide companies like Google, it decided to simply pull the service. Likewise, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a well-intentioned law that regulates user privacy. However, with increased uncertainty and compliance costs, the regulation has thus far served as a means to entrench companies like\u00a0Facebook\u00a0 [8]into its current market positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that no reforms are due. But many of the factors that make tech platforms competitive also provide significant benefits to consumers. For example, more data often translates to better services. Users also want to use platforms that have a large number of other users (it is\u00a0social\u00a0media after all). The pro-competitive justifications can be lost when the debate transforms into political attacks and hyperbole. Considering the relatively limited costs of starting competing services and the\u00a0myriad [9]\u00a0of once-dominant tech companies that have been supplanted by start-ups, we shouldn\u2019t expect that major reforms to competition law are necessary for the market to provide checks on behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Congress does wish to reform competition law, any changes must be approached with healthy debate and consideration of the consequences that may come with them. Many of the practices that are being targeted actually provide significant pro-consumer benefits. If we allow the debate to devolve into \u201ctechnology is bad and therefore we must do something,\u201d it may make for good politics, but American consumers will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Endnotes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cargue\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/27/863422722/trump-accuses-social-media-of-anti-conservative-bias-after-twitter-marks-his-twe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201csilence\u201d:\">https://www.npr.org/2020/05/27/863422722/trump-accuses-social-media-of-anti-conservative-bias-after-twitter-marks-his-twe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201csilence\u201d:</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201crevoking\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201crevoking</url> 230\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070403/joe-biden-president-election-section-230-communications-decency-act-revoke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cHouse\">https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070403/joe-biden-president-election-section-230-communications-decency-act-revoke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cHouse</url> Judiciary Committee\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3114&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201chearings\u201d:\">https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3114&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201chearings\u201d:</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/diamond-and-silk-testified-before-congress-yelled-a-bunch.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201ccopyright\">https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/diamond-and-silk-testified-before-congress-yelled-a-bunch.html&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201ccopyright</url> law\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30426496&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cgo\">https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30426496&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cgo</url> after\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141030/17102328990/spain-passes-copyright-law-demands-payment-snippets-linking-to-infringing-content.shtml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cFacebook\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141030/17102328990/spain-passes-copyright-law-demands-payment-snippets-linking-to-infringing-content.shtml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cFacebook</url>\u00a0\u201d: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/gdpr-has-been-a-boon-for-google-and-facebook-11560789219&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cmyriad\u201d:\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/gdpr-has-been-a-boon-for-google-and-facebook-11560789219&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\u201cmyriad\u201d:</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/25/failed-tech-companies-yahoo-verizon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The\">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/25/failed-tech-companies-yahoo-verizon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The</url> post The Political Attack on \u2018Big Tech\u2019 appeared first on R Street.&lt;/p&gt;

Old labels no longer fit, and the citizenry seems torn between competing desires for saviors and scapegoats.\" So began a 1995 story in WIRED on the state of digital-age politics. Electoral turmoil then amounted to a standoff between \"a Democratic president, a Republican Congress, and a slew of voters registering as 'Independent.'\" More innocent times, clearly. Still, the public seemed to be looking for new paradigms, which inspired WIRED to ask, \"Is there a new politics emerging in the Net/cyberspace/digital culture?\" The answer was, cautiously, yes. And that politics was libertarianism, with its zeal for laissez-faire capitalism and contempt for the ponderous institutions of Big Government.</p><p>If you asked a similar question today-is there a new Silicon Valley politics?- it would be pretty clear that libertarianism is no longer the answer. Sure, obstreperous free-market utopians are still some of the most quotable members of the tech scene, but truly, the last right-leaning presidential candidate to win Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley, was Ronald Reagan in 1984. As the tech industry has grown in power and influence, its politics have moved to the left. Bill Clinton pulled out wins in both his campaigns. In 2012, Barack Obama won with 70 percent of the vote to Mitt Romney's 27 percent, and employees of big tech companies like Apple and Google donated overwhelmingly to Obama's campaign. Four years later, Bernie Sanders got 42 percent of the Democratic primary vote, and Hillary Clinton won 73 percent of the general electorate in Santa Clara County, one of the most lopsided results in California. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson? He received 3.64 percent of the vote, close to his national average.</p><p>Today many people working inside Silicon Valley, and many on the right who vilify it from a distance, consider the community to be \"an extremely left-leaning place,\" as Mark Zuckerberg recently put it in congressional testimony. When people want to understand Silicon Valley's political leanings, they often look to California's 17th Congressional District. Apple and Intel are headquartered there, as is Tesla's manufacturing plant. In 2016, the voters of the 17th elected Ro Khanna, a former deputy assistant secretary in Obama's Commerce Department, to represent them. Based on his 2017 legislative record, GovTrack ranked Khanna the 14th-most-liberal representative in the House.</p><p>Khanna is running for reelection this year, and one Saturday afternoon in June, he arrived at Mission San Jose High School in Fremont for a town hall meeting. Standing at the podium wearing a dark suit and tie, he was sharp, funny, and in command of the room. For a time, Khanna was a visiting economics lecturer at Stanford University, and the general impression he gives onstage is of a garrulous professor entertaining his undergraduates.</p><p>During the 90-minute session, he delivered statements that would slot perfectly into the Sanders wing of the Democratic Party. He began with a homily on the importance of stricter gun control. He spoke up for Medicare for all and railed against the 2017 Republican tax cut, saying he would have preferred to eliminate all student debt. The son of first-generation Indian immigrants, he also made a case for the importance of immigration and diversity in driving innovation. \"I went to West Virginia,\" he told the crowd, \"and they started out by asking me, 'What do we need to do to get more tech here,' and I said, 'You need a few more Indian restaurants.'\" (Khanna knows his audience: His district is more than 50 percent Asian, many of South Asian ancestry.) Almost everything he advocated involved expanding the state apparatus, not starving it, as libertarians would presumably want to do.</p><p>But when you investigate the actual values held by the tech sector, the narrative of tech's steady leftward march gets much more complicated-and intriguing. A widely discussed 2017 study conducted by Stanford political economists David Broockman and Neil Malhotra, collaborating with technology journalist Greg Ferenstein, surveyed the political values of more than 600 tech company founders and CEOs-the elite of the tech elite. The top-line finding was, unsurprising by now, that Silicon Valley is not libertarian. The founders they surveyed were less likely than even <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Democrats</emphasis> to embrace the core expression of the libertarian worldview-that government should provide military and police protection and otherwise leave people alone to enrich themselves. They expressed overwhelming support for higher taxes on the wealthy and for universal health care. But in other ways they deviated from progressive orthodoxy. They were far more likely to emphasize the positive impact of entrepreneurial activity than progressives and had dim views of government regulation and labor unions that were closer to that of your average Republican donor than Democratic partisan.</p><p>If you plot those values on the matrix of conventional US politics, there appears to be a contradiction: The tech elite want an activist government, but they don't want the government actively restricting them. (Sixty-two percent of the tech elite told the Stanford researchers that government should not tightly regulate business but should tax the wealthy to fund social programs.) When it comes to wealth redistribution and the social safety net, they sound like North Sea progressives. When you ask them about unions or regulations, they sound like the Koch brothers. Seen together, those are not talking points that play well with either party's agenda.</p><p>The scholars Brink Lindsey and Steven Teles argue that the tech sector has actually stumbled into attitudes that approach a more coherent ideology than it would initially appear, one they have called \"liberaltarianism.\" Lindsey, who is vice president for policy at the Niskanen Center-a think tank that supports liberaltarian policies- describes the ideology as one animated by \"the idea of a free-market welfare state, which sounds like an oxymoron to most people but sounds to us like what good 21st-century governance looks like, combining significant redistribution and social spending with go-go competitive markets.\"</p><p>This is the new politics bubbling up in Silicon Valley. In an age characterized by ideological \"sorting,\" Silicon Valley's fundamental cosmopolitanism puts it all but fatally at odds with the Trumpist Republican Party; that leaves the stray liberaltarians of the tech industry to make do with a home within the Democratic coalition. Whether this ideology has traction beyond the Big Tech hub of Northern California is debatable-as is whether the current progressive backlash against the tech elite makes any such coalition far-fetched. But whatever you may think of Big Tech, it is arguably the single most influential concentration of new wealth and information networks in the history of humankind. It would be good to have an accurate read on what its politics are, and how they came to be.</p><p>Few people have a better vantage point to observe the shifting worldview of Bay Area technologists than Stewart Brand. The founder of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whole Earth Catalog</emphasis>, Brand helped record the legendary Douglas Engelbart demo of an early graphical user interface in 1968, organized the first hacker conference in the '80s, and cofounded the Well, one of the first online communities. Brand lives on a houseboat in Sausalito, and on a typically foggy day in late spring, I met him for lunch in a nearby diner to talk about the political changes he's observed. \"The people I knew in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whole Earth Catalog</emphasis> days were libertarian, and so was I, in a sort of knee-jerk way,\" he says. \"I bought Buckminster Fuller's line that if the world suddenly lost all of its politicians, everybody would carry on without a hiccup, but if it suddenly lost all its scientists and engineers, you wouldn't make it to Monday-and therefore, don't focus on politics, focus on real stuff.\" Steve Jobs called the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whole Earth Catalog</emphasis> \"one of the bibles\" of his generation. It fused the counterculture's interest in community with a technologist's obsession with tools that might expand human freedom and self-sufficiency. As Brand puts it, \"Our line was sort of: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ask not what your country can do for you-do it yourself! Leave the country out of it.</emphasis>\"</p><p>But in the mid-1970s, Brand went to work for Jerry Brown, who was then serving his first term as governor of California, and began to feel a shift in his own political philosophy. \"I got acquainted with what civil service people do,\" Brand recalls. \"They are hardworking, public-spirited-people who work together for decades and don't even know what party the other belongs to. And I realized that my libertarian friends had no idea what government does all day.\"</p><p>Brand realized that they had confused the \"whole debased process\" of electoral politics with governance, which was, in fact, something whose absence would be profoundly missed. \"So I came back from working with Jerry Brown a definite post-libertarian.\"</p><p>The generation of programmers coming up behind Brand hadn't yet had this revelation. \"The early hackers,\" he says, \"had grown up on Robert Heinlein, the adolescent science fiction of choice. And Heinlein was a serious libertarian.\" That antigovernment ethos was also fueled by the cryptographer's fear of a surveillance state. Fittingly, one of the first official advocacy groups born of the tech sector-the Electronic Frontier Foundation-focused on privacy and free-speech issues. It fought government overreach in communications but was largely agnostic about Big Government in other domains of society.</p><p>The crescendo of Silicon Valley libertarianism would come in the 1990s, with the inflation of the original internet bubble. Ideas that had been quietly percolating on bulletin boards and at hacker conferences in the Bay Area suddenly were embraced in mainstream culture. Empowered by that influence, public intellectuals from the tech sector offered up pronouncements that were genuinely antagonistic to the state, most famously John Perry Barlow's 1996 Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace. Its bombastic opening lines now read like a parody of cyber-libertarian extremism: \"Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.\" An influential critical essay from that period defined what the authors called the \"Californian Ideology,\" which they described as a kind of technological Manifest Destiny that inevitably leads to the deterioration of the state. \"Information technologies, so the argument goes, empower the individual, enhance personal freedom, and radically reduce the power of the nation-state.\" WIRED amplified these anti-state pronouncements, with covers celebrating right-wing intellectuals and politicians like George Gilder and Newt Gingrich.</p><p>But even in this period of peak techno-utopianism, the Valley was more apolitical than ideological. In that 1995 article, WIRED acknowledged that the digital generation had little to do with academic or party libertarianism. It was more of a folk, feral phenomenon, \"a pioneer/settler philosophy of self-reliance, direct action, and small-scale decentralism translated into pixels.\" Visionaries like Barlow loved throwing mind grenades into mainstream culture, but tech's rank and file consisted mainly of people who, as LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman puts it, \"just wanted to go build something that would make a big difference in the world.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley is still a place where people go to build and tinker with things. And it was perhaps inevitable that, over time, those who flocked there would get interested in tinkering with government. One of the milestones in the transformation of Silicon Valley's politics came in the first year of the Obama administration, with the publication of Tim O'Reilly's short essay \"Gov 2.0: It's All About the Platform.\" In 2004, O'Reilly had cofounded the Web 2.0 conference that laid the groundwork for the social media age. Now, his vision for a new model of governance broke decisively from the anti-statism that had defined Barlow's declaration a decade before. The tech sector shouldn't dismiss the \"weary giants of flesh and steel\" but, rather, should help government do a better job at delivering services. In the Valley of the techno-libertarians, a class of earnest, incrementalist liberal technocrats emerged.</p><p>Part of O'Reilly's inspiration had come from watching the success of Meetup ???<url normalizedValue=\"http://meetup.com\">http://meetup.com</url>???, which provided a platform for people to connect and fix local problems. Borrowing a metaphor from public policy expert Donald Kettl, O'Reilly argued, \"Too often, we think of government as a kind of vending machine. We put in our taxes, and get out services: roads, bridges, hospitals, fire brigades, police protection &amp;#230; Our idea of citizen engagement has somehow been reduced to shaking the vending machine. But what Meetup teaches us is that engagement may mean lending our hands, not just our voices.\"</p><p>Just as open platforms like the internet had offered a venue for innovation, so could the government if it opened its information channels to outside partners. The classic inefficiencies of big government were something that you could overcome (or at least reduce) with better human interface design.</p><p>O'Reilly's musings were accompanied by a conference, organized in 2009, called Gov 2.0. One of the key organizers of that conference was Jennifer Pahlka. (She and O'Reilly have since married.) The two of them, and the conference itself, were perfectly matched with the optimistic, solutions-oriented strain of Democratic politics then in power. In the months leading up to the conference, Pahlka found herself on a conference call with Obama's White House CTO, Aneesh Chopra. \"Obama really wants more than just a conference,\" Pahlka recalls Chopra telling her. \"He wants us to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">do something</emphasis>.\" That encouragement, in part, led Pahlka to found Code for America, one of the defining organizations shaping the tech sector's evolving attitudes toward government.</p><p>Today, Code for America has offices in downtown San Francisco, with motivational quotes about civic engagement painted on the walls. (\"Government can work for the people, by the people, in the digital age.\")</p><p>Code for America's ideology is fundamentally practical-\"delivery driven,\" as Pahlka puts it. In 2014, for example, California passed a ballot measure called Prop 47, which gave nonviolent felons the opportunity to downgrade their convictions to a misdemeanor and thus gain access to public housing and a better chance of getting jobs. But the process to get a felony conviction reduced is \"incredibly difficult,\" Pahlka says, and only a relatively small percentage of people who are eligible complete it. To smooth the way, Code for America is working on a \"user-centered, mobile-friendly tool\" called Clear My Record.</p><p>\"You think about advocacy in this country,\" Pahlka says, \"the win is getting the law passed. And then people are like, 'Great, we got the law passed!' But we didn't <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">implement</emphasis> it.\" Pahlka still believes in the power of technology to help government perform its essential tasks. But that data-driven, technocratic vision of a better government now faces an existential threat. Not only is the Trump administration eliminating or reducing the types of programs tech liberals would support, it's also making some people within tech companies question the government work they do. Employees at Microsoft, disturbed by the separation of parents and children at the border, recently protested the company's work for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And thousands of Google employees protested that company's work on an artificial intelligence project for the US military; Google recently announced it wouldn't pursue further contracts. Lurking behind these local skirmishes is a deeper feeling of dread: that the tech sector-and the social networks it spawned-contributed meaningfully to Donald Trump's victory.</p><p>In May, I went to visit Khanna in his Washington office in the Cannon House Office Building, which is decorated in the spare, patriotic style of most such spaces, an American flag standing next to framed photos of Khanna with his family and constituents. Khanna is a fan of Code for America and the Obama-era focus on government efficiency and civic participation; in a failed 2014 campaign for Congress, he was even fond of using the term \"Government 2.0.\" But now he thinks that approach alone is inadequate. He's got a bigger agenda-one informed by the loss of middle-class jobs, the Sanders campaign, and Trump's success with blue-collar voters. Sure, tech is about innovation, but \"the key component,\" he says, is \"What is our role in helping people get good-paying jobs?\" He points to Trump's campaign message to people in the coal and manufacturing industries: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">You built America, and by God, you're going to stay at the top of America. Not these other people who came after you.</emphasis> That message was potent and emotional. So, Khanna says, the response can't be \"Well you know what? We're going to be building better user interfaces for the federal government.\"</p><p>During Khanna's 2014 campaign, he ran as a pragmatic, tech-savvy progressive who could sling the vernacular of Silicon Valley against the longtime Democratic incumbent, Mike Honda. The political system, he told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The New Yorker</emphasis> at the time, was static and needed \"disruption\" to \"reintroduce the idea of risk-taking and meritocracy.\" After leaving the Obama administration, Khanna was an intellectual property lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, a venerable firm that had helped establish Silicon Valley as the corporate center of technology. He was, in other words, someone the tech community believed understood them in a way that Honda did not. Khanna racked up endorsements and donations from the biggest names in tech, including even legendary Valley libertarian Peter Thiel, as well as Marc Andreessen, not known as a raging liberal. Still, Khanna lost.</p><p>He ran again in 2016 with a more staunchly progressive campaign focused on economic inequality, and his list of Valley supporters showed no sign of deserting him; even Thiel re-upped. This time, Khanna won. Typically when a heavily funded candidate runs a populist campaign, he will tack back to the center once in office. But since Khanna has entered Congress, he's become even more vocal about his progressive views. Now he talks both about user-centric design and an ambitious expansion of government benefits. During his first year in Congress, Khanna proposed a radical increase in the Earned Income Tax Credit, supplementing the wages of some low-income earners by $10,000 a year. Khanna conceives of the program as a response both to wage stagnation and the rise of the gig economy. It would cost $1.4 trillion over 10 years-and hasn't the slightest chance of passing in the current Congress. He's also drafting plans for a government-subsidized jobs guarantee for the long-term unemployed. It's modeled after an Obama-era stimulus program-so it, too, is going nowhere.</p><p>But even Khanna's EITC expansion plan is less radical than universal basic income, a form of wealth redistribution that has become something of a fetish among some big names in the tech sector. Instead of tax cuts or wage supplements, UBI advocates propose providing a guaranteed income-a common sum cited is $12,000 a year-delivered to every American adult, regardless of income or employment. Wealthy tech executives did not come up with universal basic income-the concept's genealogy includes an interesting mix of Milton Friedman and Martin Luther King Jr.-but they have played a significant part in bringing UBI to mainstream notice. Supporters include Y Combinator's Sam Altman and Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes, who just published a book making the case for it. Greg Ferenstein suggests the enthusiasm for UBI can be explained by the idea that it is \"a sort of venture investment in citizens.\" Brink Lindsey sees the tech elite enthusiasm in a different light: The idea of UBI offers insurance against the backlash to the economic upheavals driven by technology.</p><p>\"You need a really well-constructed, comprehensive safety net,\" he says, \"to keep people from freaking out over all the creative destruction that's being fomented by Silicon Valley.\"</p><p>Khanna and his tech constituents may be aligned on the idea of addressing income inequality through government intervention, but in other ways, he is strikingly at odds with the prevailing views in his district, particularly when it comes to labor and regulation. With regard to labor, the big tech companies tend toward the paternalism of offering free goods and services on lavish campuses, as well as good pay. But their generosity has come with some caveats. In 2015, Adobe, Apple, Google, and Intel agreed to pay $415 million to settle a suit claiming they had violated antitrust laws by agreeing not to hire one another's engineers, which would have the effect of keeping salaries down. Nor do most tech companies directly employ the low-wage workers who would most benefit from unionization. Cleaning and delivery tend to be outsourced. In the Tesla manufacturing facility in Khanna's district, the company has reputedly blocked efforts by its employees to join the United Auto Workers union. CEO Elon Musk, via Twitter, has denied these accounts: \"Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tomorrow if they wanted. But why pay union dues and give up stock options for nothing?\" But the National Labor Relations Board has filed a complaint with multiple charges against the company.</p><p>Asked about those NLRB complaints, Khanna is quick to side with labor: \"I believe that Tesla needs to do a better job in allowing for union organizing at its plant and also working with union workers.\" But he's more philosophical about the tech sector's general resistance to unions. Tech culture celebrates iconoclasm, individualism, he says. \"But a union is very much about solidarity. About the community. About a social movement that you're part of.\"</p><p>The thornier issue for the tech sector is regulation. With growing calls for antitrust investigations of companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google, the tech sector's general contempt for the regulatory state looks less like a principled stance and more like an attempt to avoid responsibility for the social and economic harm it can foster. Tech is known for pushing back against regulatory oversight, from Uber's aggressive battles against taxi regulations to disputes with European Union officials that culminated earlier this year when the new GDPR regulations took effect.</p><p>Ron Conway, a \"superangel\" investor who is one of Khanna's major supporters and a key figure in Bay Area Democratic politics, says tech companies are still trying to figure out a way to avoid the heavy hand of state oversight: \"I think there's a very gradual migration to openness about regulation,\" he concedes. But according to Conway, Mark Zuckerberg's at times excruciating exchanges with tech-challenged politicians during his congressional testimony this spring may have reinforced the sector's belief that \"self-regulation\" would be preferable to \"poorly considered regulations developed by people with limited understanding of technology.\"</p><p>Of course most businesses would prefer to set their own voluntary industry standards. Khanna appears to have less faith than some of his Silicon Valley constituents in the capacity of Big Tech or any industry to follow through, and he's now bringing his understanding of technology to bear in a way that his Valley supporters might not have foreseen. After the scandals of recent months-Russian infiltration of Facebook's News Feed, political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica getting access to users' data without their permission, and the series of apologies and promises to do better next time-Khanna has begun work on a draft of what he calls an Internet Bill of Rights at the request of House minority leader Nancy Pelosi. The proposal would, Khanna says, ensure that consumers have some measure of data portability between online services, which would prevent the \"lock-in\" effects that can give rise to digital monopolies. Khanna also wants to broaden the scope of antitrust enforcement. He has spoken about the effect of monopoly power on wages and job loss, not just on whether concentration of economic power leads to higher prices for consumers.</p><p>When I ask Khanna about his support for government oversight of technology industries, he starts out strong: \"Regulation is needed, especially around privacy and data protections,\" he says. \"It's Congress' role to come up with legislation for these protections-it's not the job of thirtysomething entrepreneurs.\" But he's also careful not to get too specific and to offer up the expected paeans to the transformative power of technology. \"Any discussion of antitrust needs to be nuanced and not simply 'big is bad,'\" he says. \"We need to make sure there is room for vibrant competition and new entrants in tech to promote innovation.\"</p><p>He suggests that Big Tech has leverage with Congress over coming regulation. Despite the recent drubbing Facebook and other companies have received in the news, the big tech companies still have a stellar reputation among the public. \"These companies by and large are very popular now, according to polling,\" he says. \"They are far more popular than Congress is.\"</p><p>For a long time, even if it was difficult to locate Silicon Valley's views on the American political spectrum, it was fairly easy to characterize the tech industry's savvy with wielding political influence in Washington. Namely: Tech companies were neophytes. But that's changed. \"I've seen the tech community go from being totally head-in-the-sand and oblivious to the political environment to being very politically aware and civically engaged,\" Conway says. \"It's been a complete transformation-I think they got dragged into it by necessity, but it's a good thing that they're getting dragged into it.\"</p><p>Khanna is trying to drag them to the side of traditional progressives, and certainly there are many people within tech companies who are already there. But for some tech leaders, it may be too far. (The latest campaign finance records show that Andreessen and Thiel have not donated again, though Khanna's seat also seems safe.)</p><p>Lindsey suspects that some of the current appeal of left-wing politicians like Khanna can be attributed to the fact that the liberaltarian worldview doesn't have an obvious home in either party. It's a framework, he says, \"that people in Silicon Valley are intuitively groping toward. But because there isn't an '-ism' out there on the shelf for them to grab ... it's understandable that they're getting pulled toward standard progressive politicians.\"</p><p>Consider this thought experiment: If we handed over the reins of government to the tech elite surveyed in the Stanford study, supplemented by Khanna's proposals, what kind of society would they conjure? The stagnant wages of the past 20 years would be supplemented by an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit, paid for by higher individual and corporate taxes. Health care would be universal and free. Student debt would be wiped out. And every adult in the country would get a seed investment of $12,000 a year, no strings attached. In return for those benefits, unions would continue their long slide into irrelevance. Workers would have to accept volatility, job loss, and replacement by technology. Startups would continue to drive unpredictable change in the economy, with limited regulation. In short, the collisions and turbulence of constant disruption would continue, but we'd have economic air bags.</p><p>Interestingly, the closest real-world equivalent to that vision is in the more entrepreneurial countries of Northern Europe: Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands. As Lindsey puts it, those nations \"combine very free markets and free trade with very robust social spending.\" Still, even if the progressive left and the tech elite appreciate the balance of those North Sea societies, there are other obstacles. As popular as tech companies are with the public, progressives are likely to see Big Tech as monopolistic and as evil as they considered Big Oil in its heyday, and almost as toxic as Big Tobacco, at least where our social health is concerned. Sanders-style activists, enraged by the injustice of income inequality, aren't likely to find a natural ally in a bunch of tech plutocrats.</p><p>On the other hand, the 2016 election made it clear that there are no givens in US politics right now. The \"confusion\" that reigned in the political arena in 1995 looks quaint next to the chaos of the Trump era. In such a turbulent environment, new alliances might be possible-and so might new fractures. You don't have to be a cheerleader for Facebook and Google to believe that the broader culture that gave birth to those giants might have some useful and original ideas about how society should be organized. To date, those ideas have been diffuse, lacking a real coalition or a standard-bearer. Khanna, whose professional lineage makes him the most logical candidate, might have some difficulty reconciling his views on labor and regulation with those of his key supporters. After years of building software platforms that came to dominate the planet, the tech sector has started to build its own distinct political platform. The question is whether there's a political party in America right now capable of running on it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WIRED-10591028_WI_0818_24</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WIRED2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SW5-5631-JDMC-9102-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338905</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4969\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Conde Nast Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wired</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59741\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 1059-1028</issn><volume>Vol. 26</volume><issueNumber>No. 8</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>MAGAZINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Whether ideological disputes led to the dissolving of the 21st Knesset or not, at the end of the day, the upcoming elections are due to the failure to reach the required agreements in order to form a political coalition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Contrary to popular belief, the need to form a coalition does not exist only in the political world.

But few say how that would work or what the consequences might be.</p><p>At the same time, Silicon Valley is also a top fundraising destination for the candidates, with employees of major firms already having donated tens of thousands of dollars to their campaigns. </p><p>The most aggressive and fleshed-out proposal comes from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who will be one of the 14 candidates speaking at this weekend's California Democratic Party convention in San Francisco. Her campaign has booked a billboard for the week at Fourth and Townsend streets with her profile and the words \"Break Up Big Tech,\" encouraging people to text to support her campaign. </p><p>Warren <url normalizedValue=\"http://released a proposal\">released a proposal</url> in March to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon as anticompetitive monopolies. The senator is a persistent critic of corporate America and advocate for consumers. </p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" she wrote. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://Warren's plan\">Warren's plan</url> would designate big tech firms as \"platform utilities,\" which would restrict their ability to own entities with a stake on those platforms. That would require Amazon to spin off Amazon Basics, for example, and Google to spin off its advertising exchange business. The plan would also reverse mergers for each of the big three companies. </p><p>Other Democratic candidates have not gone as in-depth as Warren, but many have opened the door to splitting up the big firms. Sen. Bernie Sanders, independent-Vt.,<url normalizedValue=\"http://told Politico\">told Politico</url>that he \"of course\" backed calls to break up Facebook. California Sen. Kamala Harris told CNN that \"we have to seriously take a look at that,\" calling at least for \"serious regulation.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://said\">said</url>breaking up Facebook is \"something we should take a really hard look at.\"</p><p>New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said it would be inappropriate for a president to call for the breakup of a specific company without a process for evaluation, but told ABC News that whether \"it's Facebook, the pharma industry, even the agricultural industry - we've had a problem in America with corporate consolidation that is having really ill effects.\" </p><p>Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar <url normalizedValue=\"http://has proposed\">has proposed</url> more rigorous antitrust laws and taxing companies that sell data. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://called for more regulation\">called for more regulation</url> instead of splitting up the companies. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://said there should be regulatory action\">said there should be regulatory action</url> against the big tech companies but stopped short of calling for their breakup. </p><p>The willingness of Democrats to embrace calls to increase the pressure on Silicon Valley speaks to a broader shift within the party away from lionizing its young moguls as saviors.</p><p>\"Oh what a difference four years makes,\" said Carl Guardino, president of the pro-business trade association Silicon Valley Leadership Group. \"A political party that used to run toward tech often seems to be running from tech, while using tech tools to do so.\"</p><p>Tech entrepreneur Michael McNerney, who is well-connected to Bay Area Democratic politics, said that early on, the tech industry \"was marked by youth and excitement and this attitude that anything can be accomplished. It was very globalist, it was welcoming of immigrants and very socially liberal, and all of these things packaged together I think resonated really well with the Democratic Party, and the feeling was very mutual.\" </p><p>But in the past two years, Democrats have become disillusioned by the way tech has disrupted other industries and key sectors of the economy, has helped misinformation spread about the 2016 election and has concentrated an enormous amount of wealth. </p><p>Progressives are also increasingly frustrated with tech, echoing complaints from the right about companies picking and choosing what political speech is acceptable and what gets banned, seemingly without explanation. Their language about tech is also more closely resembling complaints about big business writ large. </p><p>\"You see the impact of the 'move fast and break things' mentality that Mark Zuckerberg popularized, and the problem is they're breaking things that are fundamental to American society,\" said Aram Fischer, a San Francisco organizer for the progressive advocacy group Indivisible. \"From our ability to put roofs over our heads to finding accurate information, we can no longer depend on the systems that existed in the past, and furthermore you have multibillion-dollar industries that are largely built on finding regulatory and tax loopholes.\"</p><p>Still, skeptics of breaking up Silicon Valley giants and supporters alike say most of the candidates' statements seem to be appealing to a Democratic base more than they are serious policy proposals. </p><p>\"There is this unfortunate focus on the fact that tech companies are big and therefore they are somehow per se scary, without a lot of nuance put behind that,\" said Tim Sparapani, a privacy and tech policy expert who has worked for Facebook and the American Civil Liberties Union. He questioned focusing on tech exclusively as opposed to other anticompetitive economic sectors with widespread impact, like agribusiness.</p><p>Sparapani also argued that splitting companies into smaller components would make oversight of each one more difficult. And with Chinese tech firms under no similar pressure to downsize, any breakup policy would risk undermining U.S. competitiveness in the tech industry, he said. That would have economic as well as national security implications. </p><p>\"Some of the proposals to break up these big tech companies have not thought two or three steps down the table,\" Sparapani said. \"It's not logical, and we may set off a chain reaction where we make it that the world's 10 largest tech companies are all Chinese and we have no influences as American voters over the patterns and practices of those companies. That would be a complete backfire.\"</p><p>For now, Democrats from different perspectives are waiting to see if candidates can develop more specific plans, to preserve the benefits of technology while cutting the negative effects. </p><p>\"I don't expect to be satisfied right now, and I'm paying a lot of attention and putting in actual work on this particular issue,\" said Fischer, who noted it's early in the race. </p><p>\"I'm ready to be wooed,\" Guardino said. </p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Complete convention coverage</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>At least 14 Democratic presidential candidates are coming to the Bay Area for the state party's San Francisco convention Friday through Sunday.

That was when he leapt out of the business pages and into mainstream consciousness after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/mike-cannonbrookes-concedes-battery-bet-with-elon-musk-20171124-gzsj25.html\">a Twitter bet</url> with an even more prominent tech entrepreneur, Tesla founder Elon Musk, over South Australia's energy crisis. The bet resulted in the world's biggest lithium-ion battery being built in the state. It also thrust Cannon-Brookes head-first into the culture wars, winning him praise from clean energy advocates and criticism from sceptics who saw it as a publicity stunt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since then, the co-founder of software giant <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/atlassian-customer-growth-hits-record-high-revenue-up-40-per-cent-20180420-h0z0pf\">Atlassian - Australia's biggest tech success story</url> - has voluntarily appeared at a Senate hearing on the future of work and opined on social issues ranging from immigration to education. In so doing, the 38-year-old billionaire has become Australia's proxy for the tech moguls who increasingly stride the world stage - and a spokesman not just for his own industry, but for a new global economy.</p><p>The day we meet at Atlassian's offices near Sydney's Martin Place offers some delicious symbolism. Less than a block away, Telstra, an icon of a bygone corporate era, announces plans to slash 8000 jobs. The scene inside Atlassian couldn't be more different. Everyone seems young and upbeat, plants adorn the foyer, almost every wall is a whiteboard - lest an impromptu team meeting be required - and nobody has a permanent office.</p><p>I'm ushered past the company's other co-founder, co-CEO and co-billionaire Scott Farquhar, who is working at a standing desk, and into a boardroom overlooking the historic General Post Office.</p><p>There, a heavily unshaven, barefoot Cannon-Brookes, wearing a baseball cap and white T-shirt, is seated. \"Hey,\" he says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You're now effectively a celebrity in Australia, and a hero to many in the tech and start-up communities. Is it weird to be famous?</emphasis></p><p>It certainly comes out in odd occasions. People know your name and come up and start chatting to you, and you think, \"F..., have I forgotten this person, or met this person?\" If I don't know anything about someone and they seem to know everything about me, it's an odd experience. I mean, you get used to it. I find it bizarre when people take surreptitious photos. I always wonder what they're going to do with that photo. You quickly get a radar for people treating you differently, but I try not to be defensive about the whole thing. I don't want to put up walls.</p><p>We've had our fair share of odd experiences at home: people wandering around sticking their heads over walls, stuff like that. [Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie have four children.] You have to kind of roll through it, though. Your alternative is to become a hermit and hide, and that's not going to make you very happy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you find that discussion of your wealth is awkward? </emphasis></p><p>I find it very, very strange that it's people's definition of success. Success for me is not defined by a number in a bank account, but for a lot of other people it is. Well, I don't know if it is, or if it's just the easiest thing to judge. It's a scoreboard, it's countable. People never talk about jobs created, or products created, or the impact those products have had on the rest of the world, or any of that sort of thing. Whenever the rich lists come out it's the worst time of the year. It's great if it motivates people to go and start a company, but yes, the constant discussion of wealth doesn't help. There's no upside, only downside. Unless you want to kind of show off in a weird way. But then buy a freakin' billboard, right?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How did you get interested in politics? Were you interested in public policy growing up?</emphasis></p><p>I had zero interest in public policy or politics! I've been asked that a lot. Like, are you going to run for prime minister? No effing way. Are you going to join politics? No. Were you in the Young Liberals or Young Labor? Neither. I had stuff to do in university. They [student politicians] just seemed to sit around and talk a lot. Ha, that's a bit unfair. But, no. I had no desire to do any of that stuff.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So what got you interested? </emphasis></p><p>A lot of issues that I'm interested in happen to require politics to solve them. Which means you have to learn something about that shadowy, dark world of Canberra. But it is not an interest area; the process in itself is not interesting to me. I think it's what you have to do to get things done. If you look at the few times we've gone through the front door, and the times we've just broken a side wall down, sometimes breaking the side wall down is the easier way to get shit done. You can't just constantly be turning up with a tank and blowing holes and stuff, it's not going to get you very many friends, but we just try to call it like it is.</p><p>Public policy does not interest me. The country making some shitty decisions that should be changed? That interests me. How do we get the country to change those decisions? Unfortunately you have to get involved with politicians sometimes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tell me about the bet with Elon Musk. Did you know him before those exchanges?</emphasis></p><p>There is always a conspiracy theory that it was concocted in the back room, which is kind of hilarious. Sometimes those things spiral.</p><p>That's one of the weird parts about Twitter. I still haven't met him in person. We spoke on a phone call. It was super brief.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What was he like?</emphasis></p><p>A bit odd. I mean, he's a fascinating dude. We're all probably a bit odd. He obviously fires from the hip as well. So we collectively fired the right set of shots that created some popular interest. The South Australian government came to the party in a big way, very quickly - which they should be given big credit for. I love Jay [Weatherill, former SA Labor premier]. I'm disappointed he got voted out. The way he and [federal environment and energy minister Josh] Frydenberg got in that big fight ??? If anything, the feds have been so wishy-washy. There is no clear position on where they stand, it seems to change. At least in South Australia, they had a very clear position of what they wanted, and they were willing to put money on the line and experiment with stuff and try stuff that might be unpopular. It worked, and for politicians that showed quite a lot of guts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It seems you saw a problem and the solution appeared logical to you, but for the politicians it was divided along tribal lines, which bogged down their attempts to fix it.</emphasis></p><p>Yes. For me, there are two problems with politics. One is, people start with a given position. They can't apply logic to it, they can't sit there and go, \"What is the best solution here? Let's go with that,\" because there are interest groups, there's how does that decision affect all sorts of other people. Someone asked me the other day, \"What's the biggest thing you would do if you were prime minister for a day?\" I'd say get rid of one level of government. We're a nation of 25 million people. It's insane, that's smaller than some US states, yet we have three tiers of government.</p><p>So the South Australia solution, on every scientific basis, totally obvious. And I'm really glad that it's been proven by three different groups to be working beyond everyone's expectations. It's not only that we thought it would be good, it's doing way better than people thought it would.</p><p>The second problem with politics is government's inability to experiment. Government is unable to say, \"Here's an idea. Let's try it.\" They have to be, \"Here's a plan. It's going to work.\" And then it has to work. That's where business and government are quite different. We experiment with lots of things. It fails. We learn. We sit and ask, \"Why did it fail?\" We try something else. Experimentation in government is really, really hard to do because you get voted out, or the other guys are like, \"Oh look at those idiots, that was never going to work.\" And that's really tough. I don't know how you change that other than somehow the population accepting that we can get stuff wrong - that's what experimentation is. But if everything has to work, then it requires so much upfront planning and costs and everything else that it's just crazy hard.</p><p>Think about the entirety of what start-ups are: lots of experiments going on constantly that work or don't work and then flame out. We all learn something, then we try to build another one. The other thing that's tricky for government is it's very hard to do long-term planning. I don't know if we should change three-year terms to four-year terms, but it's very hard for them to do real long-term planning.</p><p>I'm always worried about politics where you get people who are trying to push an agenda. I feel comfortable that our agenda is a country-led agenda rather than anything else. We've fought hard to be here for a long time and are pretty passionately Australian. [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/missed-opportunity-atlassian-and-the-australian-marketss-tech-headache-20171011-gyywmb.html\">Atlassian shares are listed on the US Nasdaq exchange</url>, and the company is officially domiciled in the United Kingdom. But its biggest office remains in Sydney, with more than 1000 staff.]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I've heard you're going to be spending more time in the US. </emphasis></p><p>Not more time, just differently. I went there 11 times last year for less than a week, which is pretty disruptive to families. I'm going to do one or two bigger blocks and one or two smaller blocks to make it less disruptive. So we'll see if that works.</p><p>It's just constantly trying to find the right strategy. I don't particularly want to move there. There's an obvious gravity to move. Neither Scott nor I have a desire to live there full-time, but work has certain requirements and constraints so we try to operate within those. Technology is built by people. It's still a people equation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are some of the bad decisions you think we're making as a country? </emphasis></p><p>Immigration. I just feel very bad about the whole situation, personally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you support a \"Big Australia\"? </emphasis></p><p>I do. That's where it gets politicised [Laughs]. Do we have the natural resources for a bigger population? Yes. Do we have a successful history of growing a bigger pie for everybody in Australia by immigration? Yes. Has it always been easy? No. It's always been hard! It just feels like we've gotten more successful as a nation, so we've tried to sort of shut the door a bit more. In a weird way, it becomes racial. It's not an economic or philosophical argument. The challenge there, too, is it requires forward planning. I was just in China for a few weeks, and again there are a lot of good things about China, and a lot of not so good things about China. It's a complicated place, but one of the things that's amazing is their ability to do long-term planning and stick to it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Would you attach a label to your political view - say, libertarian?</emphasis></p><p>Nah, libertarian seems like it gets into anarchist territory. No rules, total personal survival. They want, as far as I understand it - and I'm no expert - almost no government. Self-sufficiency. I think regulation has a totally valid place and there should be regulations for a whole lot of things for consumer protection.</p><p>A lot of government policies are quite sensible. They give you a platform to build on top of. So I'm not at all suggesting they should be torn down. If you look at, you know, public schooling and public health care, public welfare, those are necessary common goods. And that can only happen by lots of people paying tax and a small group of people saying, \"Hey, I'm going to take a piece of that tax revenue and put it towards this benefit for everybody.\"</p><p>I don't understand the world of, \"I just work for myself and everybody else works for themselves.\" It's almost like believing you don't need insurance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I'm fascinated by the politics of the tech industry. In the US, most people in the industry would support the Democratic Party. That's why billionaire venture capitalist and early Facebook backer Peter Thiel revealing himself to be a Trump supporter was such a shock. Although there do seem to be more techno-libertarians emerging over there now.</emphasis></p><p>I don't think there's any point in choosing a political side and sticking with it. That's part of the problem. If anything I'm a swing voter, and I think more people should be swing voters. Sometimes you agree with parts and disagree with parts. [But] it's probably not a very good way to be if you want to become a politician. I look at some of the politicians, and I'm very disappointed in their inability to be able to speak their minds. Having known a lot of them personally, I'm like, \"You really think that?\" And they say, \"No, I think the opposite, but the party position is this.\" On both sides. I find that a hard concept.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is it hypocritical for you and Scott to be weighing in on all these policy issues when Atlassian doesn't pay company tax in Australia? </emphasis></p><p>It's pretty simple. It's the job of any citizen to say when they understand things aren't going the way they think that they should. We certainly have some viewpoints on things like immigration and energy that I believe aren't going in the right direction as a democracy, in our country. And I'm happy to say and share my views when I think that, and debate other people who think differently.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you make of Elon Musk squabbling with the media? [Musk recently attacked journalists who criticised Tesla, and said he was planning to set up a crowd-sourced site to rank journalists and media outlets based on trustworthiness, called Pravda.] </emphasis></p><p>He's trying to do an incredibly hard thing [Tesla is trying to mass-produce electric cars. Musk's other main company, SpaceX, is developing reusable rockets for space travel]. And yeah, he probably needs as many supporters as he can in each of these businesses. I can sympathise with trying to be very careful about not being stretched too thin, because it's not a healthy place to be. He's an incredibly talented individual. They are a big customer [of Atlassian] and they have been really, really good to us, and it's kind of cool to know that we're a part of almost everything they build, in some small way.</p><p>The people you meet from Tesla, they want to change the planet. It's not just a company out to make money selling cars or roof tiles or batteries. They really believe that decarbonising the planet is the mission they're on. But it still has commercial reality. No doubt they're burning more cash than people ever thought possible - and does it work, or not work, at the end of the day? That's a whole separate interesting bet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You spend a lot of time in the US. The dark side of the tech industry seems to be a big theme there.</emphasis></p><p>Totally true. And I'm always surprised that people suddenly realise there's a dark side to it. But I'm very close to it all. There's no doubt if you zoom out to a philosophical level, technology is the single biggest driver of human progress. But none of that human progress, of any kind, is a linear path. It comes with ups and downs, rivers and valleys, and that's hard. Generally, humanity gets it right. We generally err on the side of improving things more than we make them worse. But it's not always three steps forward. It's sometimes two forward, one back. Moderation is important.</p><p>Pick sugar, pick technology, pick sports. Moderation is important in any of those things. If you entertain your kid 24 hours a day with an iPad, they are probably not going to turn out so great. But at the same time, technology is important. So we're obviously bullish on the learning of technology and understanding it in some way, and you kind of only get that through some form of playing with it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Many tech billionaires are trying to change the world through \"moonshot\" experiments, truly ambitious projects with potentially revolutionary results, such as exploring space and eradicating malaria. You put $100 million of your own money into Zoox, a company founded by another Australian that's trying to build an electric-powered, autonomous taxi. You also agreed to join its board. You must have a lot of conviction about it. </emphasis></p><p>My time is pretty precious, so if I'm going to put effort and money behind something, I want it to be something that I'm pretty passionate about helping bring to existence. Zoox is one of the most ambitious companies I've come across, and that makes it more exciting. The logic of the model, taking the biggest three transformations hitting the auto industry [electrification, autonomy and ride-sharing] and putting them all together at the same time, taking them to the limit of human visibility today - that's the way it should be done.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Five of the world's most valuable companies - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft - are from the tech sector, the biggest and most powerful on the planet.</emphasis></p><p>It's going to be fascinating to see what society does about Big Tech, because it's only getting bigger. It's growing faster than the biggest industry ever has. There's no doubt those five companies are particularly powerful. The interesting game to watch over the next 10 years will be whether those companies get into other industries faster than those other industries get into technology.</p><p>Does Netflix become HBO before HBO becomes Netflix? That tech versus old industry battle is going to be fascinating.</p><p>To read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend\">The Sydney Morning Herald</url> or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\">The Age.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520050892</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T43-NWX1-JBJ7-N2JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2859\"/><timeReceived>05:15 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

That was when he leapt out of the business pages and into mainstream consciousness after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/mike-cannonbrookes-concedes-battery-bet-with-elon-musk-20171124-gzsj25.html\">a Twitter bet</url> with an even more prominent tech entrepreneur, Tesla founder Elon Musk, over South Australia's energy crisis. The bet resulted in the world's biggest lithium-ion battery being built in the state. It also thrust Cannon-Brookes head-first into the culture wars, winning him praise from clean energy advocates and criticism from sceptics who saw it as a publicity stunt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since then, the co-founder of software giant <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/atlassian-customer-growth-hits-record-high-revenue-up-40-per-cent-20180420-h0z0pf\">Atlassian - Australia's biggest tech success story</url> - has voluntarily appeared at a Senate hearing on the future of work and opined on social issues ranging from immigration to education. In so doing, the 38-year-old billionaire has become Australia's proxy for the tech moguls who increasingly stride the world stage - and a spokesman not just for his own industry, but for a new global economy.</p><p>The day we meet at Atlassian's offices near Sydney's Martin Place offers some delicious symbolism. Less than a block away, Telstra, an icon of a bygone corporate era, announces plans to slash 8000 jobs. The scene inside Atlassian couldn't be more different. Everyone seems young and upbeat, plants adorn the foyer, almost every wall is a whiteboard - lest an impromptu team meeting be required - and nobody has a permanent office.</p><p>I'm ushered past the company's other co-founder, co-CEO and co-billionaire Scott Farquhar, who is working at a standing desk, and into a boardroom overlooking the historic General Post Office.</p><p>There, a heavily unshaven, barefoot Cannon-Brookes, wearing a baseball cap and white T-shirt, is seated. \"Hey,\" he says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You're now effectively a celebrity in Australia, and a hero to many in the tech and start-up communities. Is it weird to be famous?</emphasis></p><p>It certainly comes out in odd occasions. People know your name and come up and start chatting to you, and you think, \"F..., have I forgotten this person, or met this person?\" If I don't know anything about someone and they seem to know everything about me, it's an odd experience. I mean, you get used to it. I find it bizarre when people take surreptitious photos. I always wonder what they're going to do with that photo. You quickly get a radar for people treating you differently, but I try not to be defensive about the whole thing. I don't want to put up walls.</p><p>We've had our fair share of odd experiences at home: people wandering around sticking their heads over walls, stuff like that. [Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie have four children.] You have to kind of roll through it, though. Your alternative is to become a hermit and hide, and that's not going to make you very happy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you find that discussion of your wealth is awkward? </emphasis></p><p>I find it very, very strange that it's people's definition of success. Success for me is not defined by a number in a bank account, but for a lot of other people it is. Well, I don't know if it is, or if it's just the easiest thing to judge. It's a scoreboard, it's countable. People never talk about jobs created, or products created, or the impact those products have had on the rest of the world, or any of that sort of thing. Whenever the rich lists come out it's the worst time of the year. It's great if it motivates people to go and start a company, but yes, the constant discussion of wealth doesn't help. There's no upside, only downside. Unless you want to kind of show off in a weird way. But then buy a freakin' billboard, right?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How did you get interested in politics? Were you interested in public policy growing up?</emphasis></p><p>I had zero interest in public policy or politics! I've been asked that a lot. Like, are you going to run for prime minister? No effing way. Are you going to join politics? No. Were you in the Young Liberals or Young Labor? Neither. I had stuff to do in university. They [student politicians] just seemed to sit around and talk a lot. Ha, that's a bit unfair. But, no. I had no desire to do any of that stuff.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So what got you interested? </emphasis></p><p>A lot of issues that I'm interested in happen to require politics to solve them. Which means you have to learn something about that shadowy, dark world of Canberra. But it is not an interest area; the process in itself is not interesting to me. I think it's what you have to do to get things done. If you look at the few times we've gone through the front door, and the times we've just broken a side wall down, sometimes breaking the side wall down is the easier way to get shit done. You can't just constantly be turning up with a tank and blowing holes and stuff, it's not going to get you very many friends, but we just try to call it like it is.</p><p>Public policy does not interest me. The country making some shitty decisions that should be changed? That interests me. How do we get the country to change those decisions? Unfortunately you have to get involved with politicians sometimes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tell me about the bet with Elon Musk. Did you know him before those exchanges?</emphasis></p><p>There is always a conspiracy theory that it was concocted in the back room, which is kind of hilarious. Sometimes those things spiral.</p><p>That's one of the weird parts about Twitter. I still haven't met him in person. We spoke on a phone call. It was super brief.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What was he like?</emphasis></p><p>A bit odd. I mean, he's a fascinating dude. We're all probably a bit odd. He obviously fires from the hip as well. So we collectively fired the right set of shots that created some popular interest. The South Australian government came to the party in a big way, very quickly - which they should be given big credit for. I love Jay [Weatherill, former SA Labor premier]. I'm disappointed he got voted out. The way he and [federal environment and energy minister Josh] Frydenberg got in that big fight ??? If anything, the feds have been so wishy-washy. There is no clear position on where they stand, it seems to change. At least in South Australia, they had a very clear position of what they wanted, and they were willing to put money on the line and experiment with stuff and try stuff that might be unpopular. It worked, and for politicians that showed quite a lot of guts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It seems you saw a problem and the solution appeared logical to you, but for the politicians it was divided along tribal lines, which bogged down their attempts to fix it.</emphasis></p><p>Yes. For me, there are two problems with politics. One is, people start with a given position. They can't apply logic to it, they can't sit there and go, \"What is the best solution here? Let's go with that,\" because there are interest groups, there's how does that decision affect all sorts of other people. Someone asked me the other day, \"What's the biggest thing you would do if you were prime minister for a day?\" I'd say get rid of one level of government. We're a nation of 25 million people. It's insane, that's smaller than some US states, yet we have three tiers of government.</p><p>So the South Australia solution, on every scientific basis, totally obvious. And I'm really glad that it's been proven by three different groups to be working beyond everyone's expectations. It's not only that we thought it would be good, it's doing way better than people thought it would.</p><p>The second problem with politics is government's inability to experiment. Government is unable to say, \"Here's an idea. Let's try it.\" They have to be, \"Here's a plan. It's going to work.\" And then it has to work. That's where business and government are quite different. We experiment with lots of things. It fails. We learn. We sit and ask, \"Why did it fail?\" We try something else. Experimentation in government is really, really hard to do because you get voted out, or the other guys are like, \"Oh look at those idiots, that was never going to work.\" And that's really tough. I don't know how you change that other than somehow the population accepting that we can get stuff wrong - that's what experimentation is. But if everything has to work, then it requires so much upfront planning and costs and everything else that it's just crazy hard.</p><p>Think about the entirety of what start-ups are: lots of experiments going on constantly that work or don't work and then flame out. We all learn something, then we try to build another one. The other thing that's tricky for government is it's very hard to do long-term planning. I don't know if we should change three-year terms to four-year terms, but it's very hard for them to do real long-term planning.</p><p>I'm always worried about politics where you get people who are trying to push an agenda. I feel comfortable that our agenda is a country-led agenda rather than anything else. We've fought hard to be here for a long time and are pretty passionately Australian. [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/missed-opportunity-atlassian-and-the-australian-marketss-tech-headache-20171011-gyywmb.html\">Atlassian shares are listed on the US Nasdaq exchange</url>, and the company is officially domiciled in the United Kingdom. But its biggest office remains in Sydney, with more than 1000 staff.]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I've heard you're going to be spending more time in the US. </emphasis></p><p>Not more time, just differently. I went there 11 times last year for less than a week, which is pretty disruptive to families. I'm going to do one or two bigger blocks and one or two smaller blocks to make it less disruptive. So we'll see if that works.</p><p>It's just constantly trying to find the right strategy. I don't particularly want to move there. There's an obvious gravity to move. Neither Scott nor I have a desire to live there full-time, but work has certain requirements and constraints so we try to operate within those. Technology is built by people. It's still a people equation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are some of the bad decisions you think we're making as a country? </emphasis></p><p>Immigration. I just feel very bad about the whole situation, personally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you support a \"Big Australia\"? </emphasis></p><p>I do. That's where it gets politicised [Laughs]. Do we have the natural resources for a bigger population? Yes. Do we have a successful history of growing a bigger pie for everybody in Australia by immigration? Yes. Has it always been easy? No. It's always been hard! It just feels like we've gotten more successful as a nation, so we've tried to sort of shut the door a bit more. In a weird way, it becomes racial. It's not an economic or philosophical argument. The challenge there, too, is it requires forward planning. I was just in China for a few weeks, and again there are a lot of good things about China, and a lot of not so good things about China. It's a complicated place, but one of the things that's amazing is their ability to do long-term planning and stick to it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Would you attach a label to your political view - say, libertarian?</emphasis></p><p>Nah, libertarian seems like it gets into anarchist territory. No rules, total personal survival. They want, as far as I understand it - and I'm no expert - almost no government. Self-sufficiency. I think regulation has a totally valid place and there should be regulations for a whole lot of things for consumer protection.</p><p>A lot of government policies are quite sensible. They give you a platform to build on top of. So I'm not at all suggesting they should be torn down. If you look at, you know, public schooling and public health care, public welfare, those are necessary common goods. And that can only happen by lots of people paying tax and a small group of people saying, \"Hey, I'm going to take a piece of that tax revenue and put it towards this benefit for everybody.\"</p><p>I don't understand the world of, \"I just work for myself and everybody else works for themselves.\" It's almost like believing you don't need insurance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I'm fascinated by the politics of the tech industry. In the US, most people in the industry would support the Democratic Party. That's why billionaire venture capitalist and early Facebook backer Peter Thiel revealing himself to be a Trump supporter was such a shock. Although there do seem to be more techno-libertarians emerging over there now.</emphasis></p><p>I don't think there's any point in choosing a political side and sticking with it. That's part of the problem. If anything I'm a swing voter, and I think more people should be swing voters. Sometimes you agree with parts and disagree with parts. [But] it's probably not a very good way to be if you want to become a politician. I look at some of the politicians, and I'm very disappointed in their inability to be able to speak their minds. Having known a lot of them personally, I'm like, \"You really think that?\" And they say, \"No, I think the opposite, but the party position is this.\" On both sides. I find that a hard concept.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is it hypocritical for you and Scott to be weighing in on all these policy issues when Atlassian doesn't pay company tax in Australia? </emphasis></p><p>It's pretty simple. It's the job of any citizen to say when they understand things aren't going the way they think that they should. We certainly have some viewpoints on things like immigration and energy that I believe aren't going in the right direction as a democracy, in our country. And I'm happy to say and share my views when I think that, and debate other people who think differently.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you make of Elon Musk squabbling with the media? [Musk recently attacked journalists who criticised Tesla, and said he was planning to set up a crowd-sourced site to rank journalists and media outlets based on trustworthiness, called Pravda.] </emphasis></p><p>He's trying to do an incredibly hard thing [Tesla is trying to mass-produce electric cars. Musk's other main company, SpaceX, is developing reusable rockets for space travel]. And yeah, he probably needs as many supporters as he can in each of these businesses. I can sympathise with trying to be very careful about not being stretched too thin, because it's not a healthy place to be. He's an incredibly talented individual. They are a big customer [of Atlassian] and they have been really, really good to us, and it's kind of cool to know that we're a part of almost everything they build, in some small way.</p><p>The people you meet from Tesla, they want to change the planet. It's not just a company out to make money selling cars or roof tiles or batteries. They really believe that decarbonising the planet is the mission they're on. But it still has commercial reality. No doubt they're burning more cash than people ever thought possible - and does it work, or not work, at the end of the day? That's a whole separate interesting bet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You spend a lot of time in the US. The dark side of the tech industry seems to be a big theme there.</emphasis></p><p>Totally true. And I'm always surprised that people suddenly realise there's a dark side to it. But I'm very close to it all. There's no doubt if you zoom out to a philosophical level, technology is the single biggest driver of human progress. But none of that human progress, of any kind, is a linear path. It comes with ups and downs, rivers and valleys, and that's hard. Generally, humanity gets it right. We generally err on the side of improving things more than we make them worse. But it's not always three steps forward. It's sometimes two forward, one back. Moderation is important.</p><p>Pick sugar, pick technology, pick sports. Moderation is important in any of those things. If you entertain your kid 24 hours a day with an iPad, they are probably not going to turn out so great. But at the same time, technology is important. So we're obviously bullish on the learning of technology and understanding it in some way, and you kind of only get that through some form of playing with it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Many tech billionaires are trying to change the world through \"moonshot\" experiments, truly ambitious projects with potentially revolutionary results, such as exploring space and eradicating malaria. You put $100 million of your own money into Zoox, a company founded by another Australian that's trying to build an electric-powered, autonomous taxi. You also agreed to join its board. You must have a lot of conviction about it. </emphasis></p><p>My time is pretty precious, so if I'm going to put effort and money behind something, I want it to be something that I'm pretty passionate about helping bring to existence. Zoox is one of the most ambitious companies I've come across, and that makes it more exciting. The logic of the model, taking the biggest three transformations hitting the auto industry [electrification, autonomy and ride-sharing] and putting them all together at the same time, taking them to the limit of human visibility today - that's the way it should be done.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Five of the world's most valuable companies - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft - are from the tech sector, the biggest and most powerful on the planet.</emphasis></p><p>It's going to be fascinating to see what society does about Big Tech, because it's only getting bigger. It's growing faster than the biggest industry ever has. There's no doubt those five companies are particularly powerful. The interesting game to watch over the next 10 years will be whether those companies get into other industries faster than those other industries get into technology.</p><p>Does Netflix become HBO before HBO becomes Netflix? That tech versus old industry battle is going to be fascinating.</p><p>To read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend\">The Sydney Morning Herald</url> or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\">The Age.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520050892</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T43-NWX1-JBJ7-N2JK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2859\"/><timeReceived>05:15 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

That was when he leapt out of the business pages and into mainstream consciousness after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/mike-cannonbrookes-concedes-battery-bet-with-elon-musk-20171124-gzsj25.html\">a Twitter bet</url> with an even more prominent tech entrepreneur, Tesla founder Elon Musk, over South Australia's energy crisis. The bet resulted in the world's biggest lithium-ion battery being built in the state. It also thrust Cannon-Brookes head-first into the culture wars, winning him praise from clean energy advocates and criticism from sceptics who saw it as a publicity stunt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since then, the co-founder of software giant <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/atlassian-customer-growth-hits-record-high-revenue-up-40-per-cent-20180420-h0z0pf\">Atlassian - Australia's biggest tech success story</url> - has voluntarily appeared at a Senate hearing on the future of work and opined on social issues ranging from immigration to education. In so doing, the 38-year-old billionaire has become Australia's proxy for the tech moguls who increasingly stride the world stage - and a spokesman not just for his own industry, but for a new global economy.</p><p>The day we meet at Atlassian's offices near Sydney's Martin Place offers some delicious symbolism. Less than a block away, Telstra, an icon of a bygone corporate era, announces plans to slash 8000 jobs. The scene inside Atlassian couldn't be more different. Everyone seems young and upbeat, plants adorn the foyer, almost every wall is a whiteboard - lest an impromptu team meeting be required - and nobody has a permanent office.</p><p>I'm ushered past the company's other co-founder, co-CEO and co-billionaire Scott Farquhar, who is working at a standing desk, and into a boardroom overlooking the historic General Post Office.</p><p>There, a heavily unshaven, barefoot Cannon-Brookes, wearing a baseball cap and white T-shirt, is seated. \"Hey,\" he says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You're now effectively a celebrity in Australia, and a hero to many in the tech and start-up communities. Is it weird to be famous?</emphasis></p><p>It certainly comes out in odd occasions. People know your name and come up and start chatting to you, and you think, \"F..., have I forgotten this person, or met this person?\" If I don't know anything about someone and they seem to know everything about me, it's an odd experience. I mean, you get used to it. I find it bizarre when people take surreptitious photos. I always wonder what they're going to do with that photo. You quickly get a radar for people treating you differently, but I try not to be defensive about the whole thing. I don't want to put up walls.</p><p>We've had our fair share of odd experiences at home: people wandering around sticking their heads over walls, stuff like that. [Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie have four children.] You have to kind of roll through it, though. Your alternative is to become a hermit and hide, and that's not going to make you very happy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you find that discussion of your wealth is awkward? </emphasis></p><p>I find it very, very strange that it's people's definition of success. Success for me is not defined by a number in a bank account, but for a lot of other people it is. Well, I don't know if it is, or if it's just the easiest thing to judge. It's a scoreboard, it's countable. People never talk about jobs created, or products created, or the impact those products have had on the rest of the world, or any of that sort of thing. Whenever the rich lists come out it's the worst time of the year. It's great if it motivates people to go and start a company, but yes, the constant discussion of wealth doesn't help. There's no upside, only downside. Unless you want to kind of show off in a weird way. But then buy a freakin' billboard, right?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How did you get interested in politics? Were you interested in public policy growing up?</emphasis></p><p>I had zero interest in public policy or politics! I've been asked that a lot. Like, are you going to run for prime minister? No effing way. Are you going to join politics? No. Were you in the Young Liberals or Young Labor? Neither. I had stuff to do in university. They [student politicians] just seemed to sit around and talk a lot. Ha, that's a bit unfair. But, no. I had no desire to do any of that stuff.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So what got you interested? </emphasis></p><p>A lot of issues that I'm interested in happen to require politics to solve them. Which means you have to learn something about that shadowy, dark world of Canberra. But it is not an interest area; the process in itself is not interesting to me. I think it's what you have to do to get things done. If you look at the few times we've gone through the front door, and the times we've just broken a side wall down, sometimes breaking the side wall down is the easier way to get shit done. You can't just constantly be turning up with a tank and blowing holes and stuff, it's not going to get you very many friends, but we just try to call it like it is.</p><p>Public policy does not interest me. The country making some shitty decisions that should be changed? That interests me. How do we get the country to change those decisions? Unfortunately you have to get involved with politicians sometimes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tell me about the bet with Elon Musk. Did you know him before those exchanges?</emphasis></p><p>There is always a conspiracy theory that it was concocted in the back room, which is kind of hilarious. Sometimes those things spiral.</p><p>That's one of the weird parts about Twitter. I still haven't met him in person. We spoke on a phone call. It was super brief.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What was he like?</emphasis></p><p>A bit odd. I mean, he's a fascinating dude. We're all probably a bit odd. He obviously fires from the hip as well. So we collectively fired the right set of shots that created some popular interest. The South Australian government came to the party in a big way, very quickly - which they should be given big credit for. I love Jay [Weatherill, former SA Labor premier]. I'm disappointed he got voted out. The way he and [federal environment and energy minister Josh] Frydenberg got in that big fight ??? If anything, the feds have been so wishy-washy. There is no clear position on where they stand, it seems to change. At least in South Australia, they had a very clear position of what they wanted, and they were willing to put money on the line and experiment with stuff and try stuff that might be unpopular. It worked, and for politicians that showed quite a lot of guts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It seems you saw a problem and the solution appeared logical to you, but for the politicians it was divided along tribal lines, which bogged down their attempts to fix it.</emphasis></p><p>Yes. For me, there are two problems with politics. One is, people start with a given position. They can't apply logic to it, they can't sit there and go, \"What is the best solution here? Let's go with that,\" because there are interest groups, there's how does that decision affect all sorts of other people. Someone asked me the other day, \"What's the biggest thing you would do if you were prime minister for a day?\" I'd say get rid of one level of government. We're a nation of 25 million people. It's insane, that's smaller than some US states, yet we have three tiers of government.</p><p>So the South Australia solution, on every scientific basis, totally obvious. And I'm really glad that it's been proven by three different groups to be working beyond everyone's expectations. It's not only that we thought it would be good, it's doing way better than people thought it would.</p><p>The second problem with politics is government's inability to experiment. Government is unable to say, \"Here's an idea. Let's try it.\" They have to be, \"Here's a plan. It's going to work.\" And then it has to work. That's where business and government are quite different. We experiment with lots of things. It fails. We learn. We sit and ask, \"Why did it fail?\" We try something else. Experimentation in government is really, really hard to do because you get voted out, or the other guys are like, \"Oh look at those idiots, that was never going to work.\" And that's really tough. I don't know how you change that other than somehow the population accepting that we can get stuff wrong - that's what experimentation is. But if everything has to work, then it requires so much upfront planning and costs and everything else that it's just crazy hard.</p><p>Think about the entirety of what start-ups are: lots of experiments going on constantly that work or don't work and then flame out. We all learn something, then we try to build another one. The other thing that's tricky for government is it's very hard to do long-term planning. I don't know if we should change three-year terms to four-year terms, but it's very hard for them to do real long-term planning.</p><p>I'm always worried about politics where you get people who are trying to push an agenda. I feel comfortable that our agenda is a country-led agenda rather than anything else. We've fought hard to be here for a long time and are pretty passionately Australian. [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/missed-opportunity-atlassian-and-the-australian-marketss-tech-headache-20171011-gyywmb.html\">Atlassian shares are listed on the US Nasdaq exchange</url>, and the company is officially domiciled in the United Kingdom. But its biggest office remains in Sydney, with more than 1000 staff.]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I've heard you're going to be spending more time in the US. </emphasis></p><p>Not more time, just differently. I went there 11 times last year for less than a week, which is pretty disruptive to families. I'm going to do one or two bigger blocks and one or two smaller blocks to make it less disruptive. So we'll see if that works.</p><p>It's just constantly trying to find the right strategy. I don't particularly want to move there. There's an obvious gravity to move. Neither Scott nor I have a desire to live there full-time, but work has certain requirements and constraints so we try to operate within those. Technology is built by people. It's still a people equation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are some of the bad decisions you think we're making as a country? </emphasis></p><p>Immigration. I just feel very bad about the whole situation, personally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you support a \"Big Australia\"? </emphasis></p><p>I do. That's where it gets politicised [Laughs]. Do we have the natural resources for a bigger population? Yes. Do we have a successful history of growing a bigger pie for everybody in Australia by immigration? Yes. Has it always been easy? No. It's always been hard! It just feels like we've gotten more successful as a nation, so we've tried to sort of shut the door a bit more. In a weird way, it becomes racial. It's not an economic or philosophical argument. The challenge there, too, is it requires forward planning. I was just in China for a few weeks, and again there are a lot of good things about China, and a lot of not so good things about China. It's a complicated place, but one of the things that's amazing is their ability to do long-term planning and stick to it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Would you attach a label to your political view - say, libertarian?</emphasis></p><p>Nah, libertarian seems like it gets into anarchist territory. No rules, total personal survival. They want, as far as I understand it - and I'm no expert - almost no government. Self-sufficiency. I think regulation has a totally valid place and there should be regulations for a whole lot of things for consumer protection.</p><p>A lot of government policies are quite sensible. They give you a platform to build on top of. So I'm not at all suggesting they should be torn down. If you look at, you know, public schooling and public health care, public welfare, those are necessary common goods. And that can only happen by lots of people paying tax and a small group of people saying, \"Hey, I'm going to take a piece of that tax revenue and put it towards this benefit for everybody.\"</p><p>I don't understand the world of, \"I just work for myself and everybody else works for themselves.\" It's almost like believing you don't need insurance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I'm fascinated by the politics of the tech industry. In the US, most people in the industry would support the Democratic Party. That's why billionaire venture capitalist and early Facebook backer Peter Thiel revealing himself to be a Trump supporter was such a shock. Although there do seem to be more techno-libertarians emerging over there now.</emphasis></p><p>I don't think there's any point in choosing a political side and sticking with it. That's part of the problem. If anything I'm a swing voter, and I think more people should be swing voters. Sometimes you agree with parts and disagree with parts. [But] it's probably not a very good way to be if you want to become a politician. I look at some of the politicians, and I'm very disappointed in their inability to be able to speak their minds. Having known a lot of them personally, I'm like, \"You really think that?\" And they say, \"No, I think the opposite, but the party position is this.\" On both sides. I find that a hard concept.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is it hypocritical for you and Scott to be weighing in on all these policy issues when Atlassian doesn't pay company tax in Australia? </emphasis></p><p>It's pretty simple. It's the job of any citizen to say when they understand things aren't going the way they think that they should. We certainly have some viewpoints on things like immigration and energy that I believe aren't going in the right direction as a democracy, in our country. And I'm happy to say and share my views when I think that, and debate other people who think differently.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you make of Elon Musk squabbling with the media? [Musk recently attacked journalists who criticised Tesla, and said he was planning to set up a crowd-sourced site to rank journalists and media outlets based on trustworthiness, called Pravda.] </emphasis></p><p>He's trying to do an incredibly hard thing [Tesla is trying to mass-produce electric cars. Musk's other main company, SpaceX, is developing reusable rockets for space travel]. And yeah, he probably needs as many supporters as he can in each of these businesses. I can sympathise with trying to be very careful about not being stretched too thin, because it's not a healthy place to be. He's an incredibly talented individual. They are a big customer [of Atlassian] and they have been really, really good to us, and it's kind of cool to know that we're a part of almost everything they build, in some small way.</p><p>The people you meet from Tesla, they want to change the planet. It's not just a company out to make money selling cars or roof tiles or batteries. They really believe that decarbonising the planet is the mission they're on. But it still has commercial reality. No doubt they're burning more cash than people ever thought possible - and does it work, or not work, at the end of the day? That's a whole separate interesting bet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You spend a lot of time in the US. The dark side of the tech industry seems to be a big theme there.</emphasis></p><p>Totally true. And I'm always surprised that people suddenly realise there's a dark side to it. But I'm very close to it all. There's no doubt if you zoom out to a philosophical level, technology is the single biggest driver of human progress. But none of that human progress, of any kind, is a linear path. It comes with ups and downs, rivers and valleys, and that's hard. Generally, humanity gets it right. We generally err on the side of improving things more than we make them worse. But it's not always three steps forward. It's sometimes two forward, one back. Moderation is important.</p><p>Pick sugar, pick technology, pick sports. Moderation is important in any of those things. If you entertain your kid 24 hours a day with an iPad, they are probably not going to turn out so great. But at the same time, technology is important. So we're obviously bullish on the learning of technology and understanding it in some way, and you kind of only get that through some form of playing with it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Many tech billionaires are trying to change the world through \"moonshot\" experiments, truly ambitious projects with potentially revolutionary results, such as exploring space and eradicating malaria. You put $100 million of your own money into Zoox, a company founded by another Australian that's trying to build an electric-powered, autonomous taxi. You also agreed to join its board. You must have a lot of conviction about it. </emphasis></p><p>My time is pretty precious, so if I'm going to put effort and money behind something, I want it to be something that I'm pretty passionate about helping bring to existence. Zoox is one of the most ambitious companies I've come across, and that makes it more exciting. The logic of the model, taking the biggest three transformations hitting the auto industry [electrification, autonomy and ride-sharing] and putting them all together at the same time, taking them to the limit of human visibility today - that's the way it should be done.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Five of the world's most valuable companies - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft - are from the tech sector, the biggest and most powerful on the planet.</emphasis></p><p>It's going to be fascinating to see what society does about Big Tech, because it's only getting bigger. It's growing faster than the biggest industry ever has. There's no doubt those five companies are particularly powerful. The interesting game to watch over the next 10 years will be whether those companies get into other industries faster than those other industries get into technology.</p><p>Does Netflix become HBO before HBO becomes Netflix? That tech versus old industry battle is going to be fascinating.</p><p>To read more from Good Weekend magazine, visit our page at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend\">The Sydney Morning Herald</url> or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\">The Age.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNBTOL-1520050892</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNBTOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T43-NWX1-JBJ7-N2JD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437139</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2859\"/><timeReceived>05:15 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

That was when he leapt out of the business pages and into mainstream consciousness after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/mike-cannonbrookes-concedes-battery-bet-with-elon-musk-20171124-gzsj25.html\">a Twitter bet</url> with an even more prominent tech entrepreneur, Tesla founder Elon Musk, over South Australia's energy crisis. The bet resulted in the world's biggest lithium-ion battery being built in the state. It also thrust Cannon-Brookes head-first into the culture wars, winning him praise from clean energy advocates and criticism from sceptics who saw it as a publicity stunt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since then, the co-founder of software giant <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/atlassian-customer-growth-hits-record-high-revenue-up-40-per-cent-20180420-h0z0pf\">Atlassian - Australia's biggest tech success story</url> - has voluntarily appeared at a Senate hearing on the future of work and opined on social issues ranging from immigration to education. In so doing, the 38-year-old billionaire has become Australia's proxy for the tech moguls who increasingly stride the world stage - and a spokesman not just for his own industry, but for a new global economy.</p><p>The day we meet at Atlassian's offices near Sydney's Martin Place offers some delicious symbolism. Less than a block away, Telstra, an icon of a bygone corporate era, announces plans to slash 8000 jobs. The scene inside Atlassian couldn't be more different. Everyone seems young and upbeat, plants adorn the foyer, almost every wall is a whiteboard - lest an impromptu team meeting be required - and nobody has a permanent office.</p><p>I'm ushered past the company's other co-founder, co-CEO and co-billionaire Scott Farquhar, who is working at a standing desk, and into a boardroom overlooking the historic General Post Office.</p><p>There, a heavily unshaven, barefoot Cannon-Brookes, wearing a baseball cap and white T-shirt, is seated. \"Hey,\" he says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You're now effectively a celebrity in Australia, and a hero to many in the tech and start-up communities. Is it weird to be famous?</emphasis></p><p>It certainly comes out in odd occasions. People know your name and come up and start chatting to you, and you think, \"F..., have I forgotten this person, or met this person?\" If I don't know anything about someone and they seem to know everything about me, it's an odd experience. I mean, you get used to it. I find it bizarre when people take surreptitious photos. I always wonder what they're going to do with that photo. You quickly get a radar for people treating you differently, but I try not to be defensive about the whole thing. I don't want to put up walls.</p><p>We've had our fair share of odd experiences at home: people wandering around sticking their heads over walls, stuff like that. [Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie have four children.] You have to kind of roll through it, though. Your alternative is to become a hermit and hide, and that's not going to make you very happy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you find that discussion of your wealth is awkward? </emphasis></p><p>I find it very, very strange that it's people's definition of success. Success for me is not defined by a number in a bank account, but for a lot of other people it is. Well, I don't know if it is, or if it's just the easiest thing to judge. It's a scoreboard, it's countable. People never talk about jobs created, or products created, or the impact those products have had on the rest of the world, or any of that sort of thing. Whenever the rich lists come out it's the worst time of the year. It's great if it motivates people to go and start a company, but yes, the constant discussion of wealth doesn't help. There's no upside, only downside. Unless you want to kind of show off in a weird way. But then buy a freakin' billboard, right?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How did you get interested in politics? Were you interested in public policy growing up?</emphasis></p><p>I had zero interest in public policy or politics! I've been asked that a lot. Like, are you going to run for prime minister? No effing way. Are you going to join politics? No. Were you in the Young Liberals or Young Labor? Neither. I had stuff to do in university. They [student politicians] just seemed to sit around and talk a lot. Ha, that's a bit unfair. But, no. I had no desire to do any of that stuff.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So what got you interested? </emphasis></p><p>A lot of issues that I'm interested in happen to require politics to solve them. Which means you have to learn something about that shadowy, dark world of Canberra. But it is not an interest area; the process in itself is not interesting to me. I think it's what you have to do to get things done. If you look at the few times we've gone through the front door, and the times we've just broken a side wall down, sometimes breaking the side wall down is the easier way to get shit done. You can't just constantly be turning up with a tank and blowing holes and stuff, it's not going to get you very many friends, but we just try to call it like it is.</p><p>Public policy does not interest me. The country making some shitty decisions that should be changed? That interests me. How do we get the country to change those decisions? Unfortunately you have to get involved with politicians sometimes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tell me about the bet with Elon Musk. Did you know him before those exchanges?</emphasis></p><p>There is always a conspiracy theory that it was concocted in the back room, which is kind of hilarious. Sometimes those things spiral.</p><p>That's one of the weird parts about Twitter. I still haven't met him in person. We spoke on a phone call. It was super brief.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What was he like?</emphasis></p><p>A bit odd. I mean, he's a fascinating dude. We're all probably a bit odd. He obviously fires from the hip as well. So we collectively fired the right set of shots that created some popular interest. The South Australian government came to the party in a big way, very quickly - which they should be given big credit for. I love Jay [Weatherill, former SA Labor premier]. I'm disappointed he got voted out. The way he and [federal environment and energy minister Josh] Frydenberg got in that big fight ??? If anything, the feds have been so wishy-washy. There is no clear position on where they stand, it seems to change. At least in South Australia, they had a very clear position of what they wanted, and they were willing to put money on the line and experiment with stuff and try stuff that might be unpopular. It worked, and for politicians that showed quite a lot of guts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It seems you saw a problem and the solution appeared logical to you, but for the politicians it was divided along tribal lines, which bogged down their attempts to fix it.</emphasis></p><p>Yes. For me, there are two problems with politics. One is, people start with a given position. They can't apply logic to it, they can't sit there and go, \"What is the best solution here? Let's go with that,\" because there are interest groups, there's how does that decision affect all sorts of other people. Someone asked me the other day, \"What's the biggest thing you would do if you were prime minister for a day?\" I'd say get rid of one level of government. We're a nation of 25 million people. It's insane, that's smaller than some US states, yet we have three tiers of government.</p><p>So the South Australia solution, on every scientific basis, totally obvious. And I'm really glad that it's been proven by three different groups to be working beyond everyone's expectations. It's not only that we thought it would be good, it's doing way better than people thought it would.</p><p>The second problem with politics is government's inability to experiment. Government is unable to say, \"Here's an idea. Let's try it.\" They have to be, \"Here's a plan. It's going to work.\" And then it has to work. That's where business and government are quite different. We experiment with lots of things. It fails. We learn. We sit and ask, \"Why did it fail?\" We try something else. Experimentation in government is really, really hard to do because you get voted out, or the other guys are like, \"Oh look at those idiots, that was never going to work.\" And that's really tough. I don't know how you change that other than somehow the population accepting that we can get stuff wrong - that's what experimentation is. But if everything has to work, then it requires so much upfront planning and costs and everything else that it's just crazy hard.</p><p>Think about the entirety of what start-ups are: lots of experiments going on constantly that work or don't work and then flame out. We all learn something, then we try to build another one. The other thing that's tricky for government is it's very hard to do long-term planning. I don't know if we should change three-year terms to four-year terms, but it's very hard for them to do real long-term planning.</p><p>I'm always worried about politics where you get people who are trying to push an agenda. I feel comfortable that our agenda is a country-led agenda rather than anything else. We've fought hard to be here for a long time and are pretty passionately Australian. [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/missed-opportunity-atlassian-and-the-australian-marketss-tech-headache-20171011-gyywmb.html\">Atlassian shares are listed on the US Nasdaq exchange</url>, and the company is officially domiciled in the United Kingdom. But its biggest office remains in Sydney, with more than 1000 staff.]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I've heard you're going to be spending more time in the US. </emphasis></p><p>Not more time, just differently. I went there 11 times last year for less than a week, which is pretty disruptive to families. I'm going to do one or two bigger blocks and one or two smaller blocks to make it less disruptive. So we'll see if that works.</p><p>It's just constantly trying to find the right strategy. I don't particularly want to move there. There's an obvious gravity to move. Neither Scott nor I have a desire to live there full-time, but work has certain requirements and constraints so we try to operate within those. Technology is built by people. It's still a people equation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are some of the bad decisions you think we're making as a country? </emphasis></p><p>Immigration. I just feel very bad about the whole situation, personally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you support a \"Big Australia\"? </emphasis></p><p>I do. That's where it gets politicised [Laughs]. Do we have the natural resources for a bigger population? Yes. Do we have a successful history of growing a bigger pie for everybody in Australia by immigration? Yes. Has it always been easy? No. It's always been hard! It just feels like we've gotten more successful as a nation, so we've tried to sort of shut the door a bit more. In a weird way, it becomes racial. It's not an economic or philosophical argument. The challenge there, too, is it requires forward planning. I was just in China for a few weeks, and again there are a lot of good things about China, and a lot of not so good things about China. It's a complicated place, but one of the things that's amazing is their ability to do long-term planning and stick to it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Would you attach a label to your political view - say, libertarian?</emphasis></p><p>Nah, libertarian seems like it gets into anarchist territory. No rules, total personal survival. They want, as far as I understand it - and I'm no expert - almost no government. Self-sufficiency. I think regulation has a totally valid place and there should be regulations for a whole lot of things for consumer protection.</p><p>A lot of government policies are quite sensible. They give you a platform to build on top of. So I'm not at all suggesting they should be torn down. If you look at, you know, public schooling and public health care, public welfare, those are necessary common goods. And that can only happen by lots of people paying tax and a small group of people saying, \"Hey, I'm going to take a piece of that tax revenue and put it towards this benefit for everybody.\"</p><p>I don't understand the world of, \"I just work for myself and everybody else works for themselves.\" It's almost like believing you don't need insurance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I'm fascinated by the politics of the tech industry. In the US, most people in the industry would support the Democratic Party. That's why billionaire venture capitalist and early Facebook backer Peter Thiel revealing himself to be a Trump supporter was such a shock. Although there do seem to be more techno-libertarians emerging over there now.</emphasis></p><p>I don't think there's any point in choosing a political side and sticking with it. That's part of the problem. If anything I'm a swing voter, and I think more people should be swing voters. Sometimes you agree with parts and disagree with parts. [But] it's probably not a very good way to be if you want to become a politician. I look at some of the politicians, and I'm very disappointed in their inability to be able to speak their minds. Having known a lot of them personally, I'm like, \"You really think that?\" And they say, \"No, I think the opposite, but the party position is this.\" On both sides. I find that a hard concept.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is it hypocritical for you and Scott to be weighing in on all these policy issues when Atlassian doesn't pay company tax in Australia? </emphasis></p><p>It's pretty simple. It's the job of any citizen to say when they understand things aren't going the way they think that they should. We certainly have some viewpoints on things like immigration and energy that I believe aren't going in the right direction as a democracy, in our country. And I'm happy to say and share my views when I think that, and debate other people who think differently.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you make of Elon Musk squabbling with the media? [Musk recently attacked journalists who criticised Tesla, and said he was planning to set up a crowd-sourced site to rank journalists and media outlets based on trustworthiness, called Pravda.] </emphasis></p><p>He's trying to do an incredibly hard thing [Tesla is trying to mass-produce electric cars. Musk's other main company, SpaceX, is developing reusable rockets for space travel]. And yeah, he probably needs as many supporters as he can in each of these businesses. I can sympathise with trying to be very careful about not being stretched too thin, because it's not a healthy place to be. He's an incredibly talented individual. They are a big customer [of Atlassian] and they have been really, really good to us, and it's kind of cool to know that we're a part of almost everything they build, in some small way.</p><p>The people you meet from Tesla, they want to change the planet. It's not just a company out to make money selling cars or roof tiles or batteries. They really believe that decarbonising the planet is the mission they're on. But it still has commercial reality. No doubt they're burning more cash than people ever thought possible - and does it work, or not work, at the end of the day? That's a whole separate interesting bet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You spend a lot of time in the US. The dark side of the tech industry seems to be a big theme there.</emphasis></p><p>Totally true. And I'm always surprised that people suddenly realise there's a dark side to it. But I'm very close to it all. There's no doubt if you zoom out to a philosophical level, technology is the single biggest driver of human progress. But none of that human progress, of any kind, is a linear path. It comes with ups and downs, rivers and valleys, and that's hard. Generally, humanity gets it right. We generally err on the side of improving things more than we make them worse. But it's not always three steps forward. It's sometimes two forward, one back. Moderation is important.</p><p>Pick sugar, pick technology, pick sports. Moderation is important in any of those things. If you entertain your kid 24 hours a day with an iPad, they are probably not going to turn out so great. But at the same time, technology is important. So we're obviously bullish on the learning of technology and understanding it in some way, and you kind of only get that through some form of playing with it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Many tech billionaires are trying to change the world through \"moonshot\" experiments, truly ambitious projects with potentially revolutionary results, such as exploring space and eradicating malaria. You put $100 million of your own money into Zoox, a company founded by another Australian that's trying to build an electric-powered, autonomous taxi. You also agreed to join its board. You must have a lot of conviction about it. </emphasis></p><p>My time is pretty precious, so if I'm going to put effort and money behind something, I want it to be something that I'm pretty passionate about helping bring to existence. Zoox is one of the most ambitious companies I've come across, and that makes it more exciting. The logic of the model, taking the biggest three transformations hitting the auto industry [electrification, autonomy and ride-sharing] and putting them all together at the same time, taking them to the limit of human visibility today - that's the way it should be done.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Five of the world's most valuable companies - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft - are from the tech sector, the biggest and most powerful on the planet.</emphasis></p><p>It's going to be fascinating to see what society does about Big Tech, because it's only getting bigger. It's growing faster than the biggest industry ever has. There's no doubt those five companies are particularly powerful. The interesting game to watch over the next 10 years will be whether those companies get into other industries faster than those other industries get into technology.</p><p>Does Netflix become HBO before HBO becomes Netflix?

That was when he leapt out of the business pages and into mainstream consciousness after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/mike-cannonbrookes-concedes-battery-bet-with-elon-musk-20171124-gzsj25.html\">a Twitter bet</url> with an even more prominent tech entrepreneur, Tesla founder Elon Musk, over South Australia's energy crisis. The bet resulted in the world's biggest lithium-ion battery being built in the state. It also thrust Cannon-Brookes head-first into the culture wars, winning him praise from clean energy advocates and criticism from sceptics who saw it as a publicity stunt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since then, the co-founder of software giant <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/atlassian-customer-growth-hits-record-high-revenue-up-40-per-cent-20180420-h0z0pf\">Atlassian - Australia's biggest tech success story</url> - has voluntarily appeared at a Senate hearing on the future of work and opined on social issues ranging from immigration to education. In so doing, the 38-year-old billionaire has become Australia's proxy for the tech moguls who increasingly stride the world stage - and a spokesman not just for his own industry, but for a new global economy.</p><p>The day we meet at Atlassian's offices near Sydney's Martin Place offers some delicious symbolism. Less than a block away, Telstra, an icon of a bygone corporate era, announces plans to slash 8000 jobs. The scene inside Atlassian couldn't be more different. Everyone seems young and upbeat, plants adorn the foyer, almost every wall is a whiteboard - lest an impromptu team meeting be required - and nobody has a permanent office.</p><p>I'm ushered past the company's other co-founder, co-CEO and co-billionaire Scott Farquhar, who is working at a standing desk, and into a boardroom overlooking the historic General Post Office.</p><p>There, a heavily unshaven, barefoot Cannon-Brookes, wearing a baseball cap and white T-shirt, is seated. \"Hey,\" he says.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You're now effectively a celebrity in Australia, and a hero to many in the tech and start-up communities. Is it weird to be famous?</emphasis></p><p>It certainly comes out in odd occasions. People know your name and come up and start chatting to you, and you think, \"F..., have I forgotten this person, or met this person?\" If I don't know anything about someone and they seem to know everything about me, it's an odd experience. I mean, you get used to it. I find it bizarre when people take surreptitious photos. I always wonder what they're going to do with that photo. You quickly get a radar for people treating you differently, but I try not to be defensive about the whole thing. I don't want to put up walls.</p><p>We've had our fair share of odd experiences at home: people wandering around sticking their heads over walls, stuff like that. [Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie have four children.] You have to kind of roll through it, though. Your alternative is to become a hermit and hide, and that's not going to make you very happy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you find that discussion of your wealth is awkward? </emphasis></p><p>I find it very, very strange that it's people's definition of success. Success for me is not defined by a number in a bank account, but for a lot of other people it is. Well, I don't know if it is, or if it's just the easiest thing to judge. It's a scoreboard, it's countable. People never talk about jobs created, or products created, or the impact those products have had on the rest of the world, or any of that sort of thing. Whenever the rich lists come out it's the worst time of the year. It's great if it motivates people to go and start a company, but yes, the constant discussion of wealth doesn't help. There's no upside, only downside. Unless you want to kind of show off in a weird way. But then buy a freakin' billboard, right?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How did you get interested in politics? Were you interested in public policy growing up?</emphasis></p><p>I had zero interest in public policy or politics! I've been asked that a lot. Like, are you going to run for prime minister? No effing way. Are you going to join politics? No. Were you in the Young Liberals or Young Labor? Neither. I had stuff to do in university. They [student politicians] just seemed to sit around and talk a lot. Ha, that's a bit unfair. But, no. I had no desire to do any of that stuff.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">So what got you interested? </emphasis></p><p>A lot of issues that I'm interested in happen to require politics to solve them. Which means you have to learn something about that shadowy, dark world of Canberra. But it is not an interest area; the process in itself is not interesting to me. I think it's what you have to do to get things done. If you look at the few times we've gone through the front door, and the times we've just broken a side wall down, sometimes breaking the side wall down is the easier way to get shit done. You can't just constantly be turning up with a tank and blowing holes and stuff, it's not going to get you very many friends, but we just try to call it like it is.</p><p>Public policy does not interest me. The country making some shitty decisions that should be changed? That interests me. How do we get the country to change those decisions? Unfortunately you have to get involved with politicians sometimes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tell me about the bet with Elon Musk. Did you know him before those exchanges?</emphasis></p><p>There is always a conspiracy theory that it was concocted in the back room, which is kind of hilarious. Sometimes those things spiral.</p><p>That's one of the weird parts about Twitter. I still haven't met him in person. We spoke on a phone call. It was super brief.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What was he like?</emphasis></p><p>A bit odd. I mean, he's a fascinating dude. We're all probably a bit odd. He obviously fires from the hip as well. So we collectively fired the right set of shots that created some popular interest. The South Australian government came to the party in a big way, very quickly - which they should be given big credit for. I love Jay [Weatherill, former SA Labor premier]. I'm disappointed he got voted out. The way he and [federal environment and energy minister Josh] Frydenberg got in that big fight ??? If anything, the feds have been so wishy-washy. There is no clear position on where they stand, it seems to change. At least in South Australia, they had a very clear position of what they wanted, and they were willing to put money on the line and experiment with stuff and try stuff that might be unpopular. It worked, and for politicians that showed quite a lot of guts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It seems you saw a problem and the solution appeared logical to you, but for the politicians it was divided along tribal lines, which bogged down their attempts to fix it.</emphasis></p><p>Yes. For me, there are two problems with politics. One is, people start with a given position. They can't apply logic to it, they can't sit there and go, \"What is the best solution here? Let's go with that,\" because there are interest groups, there's how does that decision affect all sorts of other people. Someone asked me the other day, \"What's the biggest thing you would do if you were prime minister for a day?\" I'd say get rid of one level of government. We're a nation of 25 million people. It's insane, that's smaller than some US states, yet we have three tiers of government.</p><p>So the South Australia solution, on every scientific basis, totally obvious. And I'm really glad that it's been proven by three different groups to be working beyond everyone's expectations. It's not only that we thought it would be good, it's doing way better than people thought it would.</p><p>The second problem with politics is government's inability to experiment. Government is unable to say, \"Here's an idea. Let's try it.\" They have to be, \"Here's a plan. It's going to work.\" And then it has to work. That's where business and government are quite different. We experiment with lots of things. It fails. We learn. We sit and ask, \"Why did it fail?\" We try something else. Experimentation in government is really, really hard to do because you get voted out, or the other guys are like, \"Oh look at those idiots, that was never going to work.\" And that's really tough. I don't know how you change that other than somehow the population accepting that we can get stuff wrong - that's what experimentation is. But if everything has to work, then it requires so much upfront planning and costs and everything else that it's just crazy hard.</p><p>Think about the entirety of what start-ups are: lots of experiments going on constantly that work or don't work and then flame out. We all learn something, then we try to build another one. The other thing that's tricky for government is it's very hard to do long-term planning. I don't know if we should change three-year terms to four-year terms, but it's very hard for them to do real long-term planning.</p><p>I'm always worried about politics where you get people who are trying to push an agenda. I feel comfortable that our agenda is a country-led agenda rather than anything else. We've fought hard to be here for a long time and are pretty passionately Australian. [<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/missed-opportunity-atlassian-and-the-australian-marketss-tech-headache-20171011-gyywmb.html\">Atlassian shares are listed on the US Nasdaq exchange</url>, and the company is officially domiciled in the United Kingdom. But its biggest office remains in Sydney, with more than 1000 staff.]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I've heard you're going to be spending more time in the US. </emphasis></p><p>Not more time, just differently. I went there 11 times last year for less than a week, which is pretty disruptive to families. I'm going to do one or two bigger blocks and one or two smaller blocks to make it less disruptive. So we'll see if that works.</p><p>It's just constantly trying to find the right strategy. I don't particularly want to move there. There's an obvious gravity to move. Neither Scott nor I have a desire to live there full-time, but work has certain requirements and constraints so we try to operate within those. Technology is built by people. It's still a people equation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are some of the bad decisions you think we're making as a country? </emphasis></p><p>Immigration. I just feel very bad about the whole situation, personally.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do you support a \"Big Australia\"? </emphasis></p><p>I do. That's where it gets politicised [Laughs]. Do we have the natural resources for a bigger population? Yes. Do we have a successful history of growing a bigger pie for everybody in Australia by immigration? Yes. Has it always been easy? No. It's always been hard! It just feels like we've gotten more successful as a nation, so we've tried to sort of shut the door a bit more. In a weird way, it becomes racial. It's not an economic or philosophical argument. The challenge there, too, is it requires forward planning. I was just in China for a few weeks, and again there are a lot of good things about China, and a lot of not so good things about China. It's a complicated place, but one of the things that's amazing is their ability to do long-term planning and stick to it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Would you attach a label to your political view - say, libertarian?</emphasis></p><p>Nah, libertarian seems like it gets into anarchist territory. No rules, total personal survival. They want, as far as I understand it - and I'm no expert - almost no government. Self-sufficiency. I think regulation has a totally valid place and there should be regulations for a whole lot of things for consumer protection.</p><p>A lot of government policies are quite sensible. They give you a platform to build on top of. So I'm not at all suggesting they should be torn down. If you look at, you know, public schooling and public health care, public welfare, those are necessary common goods. And that can only happen by lots of people paying tax and a small group of people saying, \"Hey, I'm going to take a piece of that tax revenue and put it towards this benefit for everybody.\"</p><p>I don't understand the world of, \"I just work for myself and everybody else works for themselves.\" It's almost like believing you don't need insurance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I'm fascinated by the politics of the tech industry. In the US, most people in the industry would support the Democratic Party. That's why billionaire venture capitalist and early Facebook backer Peter Thiel revealing himself to be a Trump supporter was such a shock. Although there do seem to be more techno-libertarians emerging over there now.</emphasis></p><p>I don't think there's any point in choosing a political side and sticking with it. That's part of the problem. If anything I'm a swing voter, and I think more people should be swing voters. Sometimes you agree with parts and disagree with parts. [But] it's probably not a very good way to be if you want to become a politician. I look at some of the politicians, and I'm very disappointed in their inability to be able to speak their minds. Having known a lot of them personally, I'm like, \"You really think that?\" And they say, \"No, I think the opposite, but the party position is this.\" On both sides. I find that a hard concept.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is it hypocritical for you and Scott to be weighing in on all these policy issues when Atlassian doesn't pay company tax in Australia? </emphasis></p><p>It's pretty simple. It's the job of any citizen to say when they understand things aren't going the way they think that they should. We certainly have some viewpoints on things like immigration and energy that I believe aren't going in the right direction as a democracy, in our country. And I'm happy to say and share my views when I think that, and debate other people who think differently.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What do you make of Elon Musk squabbling with the media? [Musk recently attacked journalists who criticised Tesla, and said he was planning to set up a crowd-sourced site to rank journalists and media outlets based on trustworthiness, called Pravda.] </emphasis></p><p>He's trying to do an incredibly hard thing [Tesla is trying to mass-produce electric cars. Musk's other main company, SpaceX, is developing reusable rockets for space travel]. And yeah, he probably needs as many supporters as he can in each of these businesses. I can sympathise with trying to be very careful about not being stretched too thin, because it's not a healthy place to be. He's an incredibly talented individual. They are a big customer [of Atlassian] and they have been really, really good to us, and it's kind of cool to know that we're a part of almost everything they build, in some small way.</p><p>The people you meet from Tesla, they want to change the planet. It's not just a company out to make money selling cars or roof tiles or batteries. They really believe that decarbonising the planet is the mission they're on. But it still has commercial reality. No doubt they're burning more cash than people ever thought possible - and does it work, or not work, at the end of the day? That's a whole separate interesting bet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">You spend a lot of time in the US. The dark side of the tech industry seems to be a big theme there.</emphasis></p><p>Totally true. And I'm always surprised that people suddenly realise there's a dark side to it. But I'm very close to it all. There's no doubt if you zoom out to a philosophical level, technology is the single biggest driver of human progress. But none of that human progress, of any kind, is a linear path. It comes with ups and downs, rivers and valleys, and that's hard. Generally, humanity gets it right. We generally err on the side of improving things more than we make them worse. But it's not always three steps forward. It's sometimes two forward, one back. Moderation is important.</p><p>Pick sugar, pick technology, pick sports. Moderation is important in any of those things. If you entertain your kid 24 hours a day with an iPad, they are probably not going to turn out so great. But at the same time, technology is important. So we're obviously bullish on the learning of technology and understanding it in some way, and you kind of only get that through some form of playing with it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Many tech billionaires are trying to change the world through \"moonshot\" experiments, truly ambitious projects with potentially revolutionary results, such as exploring space and eradicating malaria. You put $100 million of your own money into Zoox, a company founded by another Australian that's trying to build an electric-powered, autonomous taxi. You also agreed to join its board. You must have a lot of conviction about it. </emphasis></p><p>My time is pretty precious, so if I'm going to put effort and money behind something, I want it to be something that I'm pretty passionate about helping bring to existence. Zoox is one of the most ambitious companies I've come across, and that makes it more exciting. The logic of the model, taking the biggest three transformations hitting the auto industry [electrification, autonomy and ride-sharing] and putting them all together at the same time, taking them to the limit of human visibility today - that's the way it should be done.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Five of the world's most valuable companies - Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Microsoft - are from the tech sector, the biggest and most powerful on the planet.</emphasis></p><p>It's going to be fascinating to see what society does about Big Tech, because it's only getting bigger.

Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felonySection 2:Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felonyIts short length and broad implications ('Every contract in restraint of trade is declared to be illegal') didn't give the courts much to go on in terms of textualism[2]. As for originalism[3], the legislative history of the Sherman Act is mixed, and no consensus[4] currently exists among experts. In practice, that means enforcement of the antitrust laws in the US has been a product of the evolutionary[5] common law[6] process (and has changed over time[7] due to economic learning).Over the last fifty years, academics, judges, and practitioners have generally converged on the consumer welfare standard[8] as the best approach for protecting market competition. </p><p>Although some early supporters of aggressive enforcement (e.g., Brandeis[9] and, more recently, Pitofsky[10]) advocated for a more political conception of antitrust, that conception of the law has been decisively rejected[11] by the courts as the contours of the law have evolved through judicial decisionmaking.In the last few years, however, a movement has reemerged to expand antitrust beyond consumer welfare to include political and social issues, ranging from broadly macroeconomic matters like rising income inequality and declining wages, to sociopolitical concerns like increasing political concentration, environmental degradation, a struggling traditional news industry, and declining localism.Although we at ICLE are decidedly in the consumer welfare camp, the contested 'original intent' of the antitrust laws and the simple progress of evolving interpretation could conceivably support a broader, more-political interpretation. It is, at the very least, a timely and significant question whether and how political and social issues might be incorporated into antitrust law. Yet much of the discussion of politics and antitrust has been heavy on rhetoric and light on substance; it is dominated by non-expert, ideologically driven opinion.In this blog symposium we seek to offer a more substantive and balanced discussion of the issue. To that end, we invited a number of respected economists, legal scholars, and practitioners to offer their perspectives.The symposium comprises posts by Steve Cernak[12], Luigi Zingales and Filippo Maria Lancieri[13], Geoffrey A. Manne and Alec Stapp[14], Valentin Mircea[15], Ramsi Woodcock[16], Kristian Stout[17], and Cento Veljanoski[18].Both Steve Cernak[19] and Zingales and Lancieri[20] offer big picture perspectives. Cernak sees the current debate as, 'an opportunity to explain the benefits and limits of antitrust enforcement and the competitive process it is meant to protect.' He then urges 'regulatory humility' and outlines what this means in the context of antitrust. Zingales and Lancieri[21] note that 'simply 'politicizing' the current antitrust regime would be very dangerous for the economic well-being of nations.' More specifically, they observe that 'If used without clear and objective standards, antitrust remedies could easily add an extra layer of uncertainty or could even outright prohibit perfectly legitimate conduct, which would depress competition, investment, and growth.' Nonetheless, they argue that nuanced changes to the application of antitrust law may be justified because, 'as markets become more concentrated, incumbent firms become better at distorting the political process in their favor.'Manne and Stapp[22] question the existence of a causal relationship between market concentration and political power, noting that there is little empirical support for such a claim. Moreover, they warn that politicizing antitrust will inevitably result in more politicized antitrust enforcement actions to the detriment of consumers and democracy.Mircea[23] argues that antitrust enforcement in the EU is already too political and that enforcement has been too focused on 'Big Tech' companies. The result has been to chill investment in technology firms in the EU while failing to address legitimate antitrust violations in other sectors.Woodcock[24] argues that the excessive focus on 'Big Tech' companies as antitrust villains has come in no small part from a concerted effort by 'Big Ink' (i.e. media companies), who resent the loss of advertising revenue that has resulted from the emergence of online advertising platforms. Woodcock suggests that the solution to this problem is to ban advertising. (We suspect that this cure would be worse than the disease but will leave substantive criticism to another blog post.)Stout[25] argues that while consumers may have legitimate grievances with Big Tech companies, these grievances do not justify widening the scope of antitrust, noting that 'Concerns about privacy, hate speech, and, more broadly, the integrity of the democratic process are critical issues to wrestle with. But these aren't antitrust problems.'Finally, Veljanovski[26] highlights potential problems with per se rules against cartels, noting that in some cases (most notably regulation of common pool resources such as fisheries), long-run consumer welfare may be improved by permitting certain kinds of cartel. However, he notes that in the case of polluting firms, a cartel that raises prices and lowers output is not likely to be the most efficient way to reduce the harms associated with pollution. This is of relevance given the DOJ's case against certain automobile manufacturers, which are accused of[27] colluding with California to set emission standards that are stricter than required under federal law.It is tempting to conclude that U.S. antitrust law is not fundamentally broken, so does not require a major fix. Indeed, if any fix is needed, it is that the CWS should be more widely applied both in the U.S. and internationally. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fthe-politicization-of-antitrust-blog-symposium%2F...kname=The%20Politicization%20of%20Antitrust%20Blog%20Symposiumhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fthe-politicization-of-antitrust-blog-symposium%2F...kname=The%20Politicization%20of%20Antitrust%20Blog%20Symposiumhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fthe-politicization-of-antitrust-blog-symposium%2F...kname=The%20Politicization%20of%20Antitrust%20Blog%20Symposiumhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fthe-politicization-of-antitrust-blog-symposium%2F...le=The%20Politicization%20of%20Antitrust%20Blog%20SymposiumThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fthe-politicization-of-antitrust-blog-symposium%2F...kname=The%20Politicization%20of%20Antitrust%20Blog%20Symposiumhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fthe-politicization-of-antitrust-blog-symposium%2F...kname=The%20Politicization%20of%20Antitrust%20Blog%20Symposiumhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fthe-politicization-of-antitrust-blog-symposium%2F...kname=The%20Politicization%20of%20Antitrust%20Blog%20Symposiumhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2019%2F12%2F30%2Fthe-politicization-of-antitrust-blog-symposium%2F...le=The%20Politicization%20of%20Antitrust%20Blog%20SymposiumThe</url> post The Politicization of Antitrust Blog Symposium[28] appeared first on Truth on the Market[29].

Nor is there any clear sign that they know what to do with it. For a variety of motives, both obvious and obscure, they have begun entering into platform consortia with rivals. That's problem enough and costly. Worse, though, is when a platform seems to be biting the hands that feed it.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As he switches back from his other call, the banker curses. \"That was a call about exactly what you're ringing up to discuss,\" he tells Euromoney. \"Consortia platforms. They are the single biggest bloody headache of the job.\" He should know. As the head of e-commerce strategy at a major European investment bank, he's joined a few.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It turns out the call was from a peer at another institution, and the two had been part of an OTC derivatives consortium that never saw the light of day. \"And there are several more of those that were stillborn,\" he says. Is it, asks Euromoney, because you just can't rely on bankers from rival institutions to trust each other enough to get the job done? Because the egos on the board are just too large to allow for effective decision-making? Because there are too many disagreements?</p><p>\"That's certainly part of it\" he replies. \"Although often we don't even get that far. Just getting us all together in one place is tough enough.\" Once that happens, the negotiations start: who's in, who's out, what exactly is the aim, who sits on the board, who runs it, what sort of oversight committee is there, who talks to clients, who decides on strategy. That's when things start to fall apart. \"You start off with mutual suspicion,\" continues the banker. \"You are all competitors after all. We spend an inordinate amount of time getting over those hurdles, and you can't help but walk away with the feeling that some of these people actually don't want to achieve much at all.\"</p><p>Welcome to the wonderful world of web consortia, a world that has come to dominate investment-banking strategy over the past year. It's been driven by a desire to offer clients what some have been demanding for several years now: quotes from several banks displayed in one place. But don't be fooled into thinking that these consortia are serving clients' needs. Instead, they are artificial constructs focused on single products, which is hardly how their clients operate. For example, credit market platforms can trade either government bonds or corporate bonds, but never both, despite the fact that when an investor buys a corporate bond he will also more often than not be selling government bonds, and vice versa.</p><p>Focus is the excuse given: better to get one product right than several products wrong. In reality, the platforms are managed for the benefit of their founding banks. The trouble is that lots of banks in one room means lots of politics. This is making the consortia hostages to the shareholder structures and governance nightmares that the banks have imposed on them. And that has already caused one merger between two such platforms to fall through.</p><p>Market Axess and BondClick were trying to tie the knot over the summer. A merger would have joined a price give-up model for US and European corporate bonds with the nascent European government bond trading answer to TradeWeb.</p><p>Why did it fail? \"You get into really ridiculous arguments over valuations and relative shareholder stakes over two companies that don't even really exist yet,\" says an e-commerce banker who is on the board of one of the companies. \"You start to protect shareholders rather than develop the business.\"<table><tgroup cols=\"4\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"240\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\" colwidth=\"192\"/><tbody valign=\"bottom\"><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Independence &amp; neutrality of leading multi-bank and non-bank sites</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Ownership</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Management/board</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Operational policies</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Examples</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">No supply-side ownership</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Independent management and board</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Fair policies</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Muniauction, Blackbird, Bloomberg</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">&lt;20% supply side ownership (\"relevant share\")</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Independent management and board</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Fair policies</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Currenex, LIMITrader, CreditTrade, Equavant</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Significant supply-side ownership</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Independent management and board</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Fair policies</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">CFOWeb</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Significant supply-side ownership</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mixed management and board (supply side andindependent)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Fair policies</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Tradepoint, Archipelago, Creditex, Municenter, TradeWeb, Atriax</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Significant supply-side ownership</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Not independent management and board (supply side)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Mostly fair policies</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">BondClick, Market Axess, BondBook, FXall, Atriax Brokertec, SwapsWire, TradeWeb</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Significant supply-side ownership</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Not independent management and board (supply side)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Biased policies</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">FX Connect, BondClick, Market Axess, BondBook, FXall, Atriax, SwapsWire</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Note: We have put some sites in more than one category because their exact status is as yet unclear</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>There might also have been issues with some rather intriguing power play tactics from Deutsche Bank. Having helped to set up BondClick last January and joined the board of Market Axess in the spring, Deutsche suddenly turned up in late summer first as the newest board member on TradeWeb and then in October as the fifth founding member of BondBook, the anonymous would-be bond exchange set up by Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in June, with SalomonSmith Barney joining in August. (Deutsche is the only non-US bank on either platform.)</p><p>Whether it was simply a case of Deutsche hedging its bets, or trying to use its investments to force itself into a position of power to drive through its own agenda is a moot point. Clearly, though, a combined Market Axess-BondClick board would not have been amused at seeing one of its apparently biggest supporters also hobnobbing with the competition. Either way, the interests of the end user were clearly not central to discussions.</p><p>Estimates from those setting them up put the money being spent on these platforms at $75 million to $250 million per consortium and there are dozens and dozens of them.</p><p>What's more, they tie up more staff and resources than many had expected. Bankers are already beginning to talk about finite resources and the possibility of cutting back on commitments to many more new ventures. And yet most sites announced are focused on single products and are heavily concentrated in the US; so to some it feels as if the surface of possibilities has hardly been scratched.</p><p>So pervasive and so high profile have these consortia become that at the end of November the US Department of Justice anti-trust division sent civil investigative demands to five multi-bank platforms - BondBook, Market Axess, Bond Desk, FXall and Atriax, as well as to most of the member firms.</p><p>We shouldn't be expecting a Microsoft-style anti-trust lawsuit just yet, though. For a start, none of the platforms is trading significant volumes, if any at all, so it's impossible for them to be anti-competitive.Avoiding unpleasant surprises</p><p>It does, though, signal the DoJ's concern that technology is changing the way banks think about operating so much that they have to investigate further to satisfy themselves that there are no anti-competitive surprises to be found later on, intentional or otherwise. The consortia say there aren't, indeed that their business plans would fail if there were. But regulators can't take that at face value.</p><p>And the banks and consortia themselves have given more than enough reason for concern. Just a year ago, most were floundering for an internet strategy. Today they still are, but feel surer of their ground - in 2000 the empire struck back. And they have been using a powerful weapon: liquidity.</p><p>Markets can't function without it, and the investment banks have done a good job trying to convince us that they are the only ones that can provide it on any meaningful basis.</p><p>So well have they done this that the liquidity issue has become the battleground for the debate between bank-run and independent platforms. And the banks are prepared to defend their turf aggressively. \"This is a business we developed,\" says Ben Wolkowitz, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's head of e-fixed income. \"That a third party should be able to tell us what to do with our clients makes us all very uncomfortable.\"</p><p>There couldn't be a clearer warning signal to the anti-trust lawyers. While it shows that banks are prepared to defend their turf, it raises the very real prospect that their collaborative efforts to do so could be restrictive and anti-competitive.</p><p>Speaking at a recent conference, a lawyer specializing in anti-trust cases sketched the outline in the table above, which he uses as a rule of thumb to determine if and when anti-competitive practices might become an issue. He describes the sixth row as the go-to-jail card, with rows three and onwards demanding some form of regulatory oversight. The examples of bank consortia in the right-hand column have been added by us.</p><p>There are other matters to consider, such as who runs the platform and the role of a buy-side advisory board, but it is clear from this that in theory at least all the major bank-run consortia need to make a convincing case to the Department of Justice.</p><p>What officials from the DoJ must bear in mind, though, is that this new-found love of the banks for collaboration was anathema a year ago. As Lars Olesen, Citigroup's head of e-forex, says about his involvement with Atriax: \"If I had spent this much time with my competitors last year, I'd have been sacked.\"</p><p>It's easy to attach conspiracy theories to banks' plans, but looks can be deceiving. The rush to announce consortia indicates that banks' priorities appear to be that they should be seen to be taking part, to be parting with cash to buy in to any number of multi-bank and non-bank platforms. It's the easiest way to show that you are keeping up with change and not being left behind by new technology.</p><p>But the reality of working as part of a multi-bank platform is very different, and certainly far removed from the way investment bankers usually operate. That is in silos within their own organizations, as political operators conditioned to protect their turf both internally and externally, and with long-term considerations entirely subordinate to getting the next deal done and the bonus increased.</p><p>So when these same bankers start to spend a greater proportion of their time concentrating on longer-term strategies, and doing so in collaboration with fierce rivals, it's scarcely surprising that things don't run smoothly.</p><p>There are now dozens of internet trading systems and research sites being set up by two or more banks, and though it is true that a lot of clients have been demanding these commingled offerings, it's a different matter entirely to make them a success.</p><p>Not that you'll find many willing to admit there are serious issues. \"When firms enter into multi-bank joint ventures,\" says Steve Mnuchin, managing director and head of e-commerce at Goldman Sachs. \"they do so as partners who work together towards the success of the enterprise.\" It's a fantastic ideal to hold dear, but experience shows it's not realistic for any protracted period of time.</p><p>Ben Cohen, head of e-commerce fixed income at CSFB, says: \"The really crucial part of any such venture is in getting the first 10% to 15% decided upon.\" Effectively that includes initial governance structures and exact business strategy. There then follows a relatively calm period of building and executing, when Mnuchin's partnership comment largely holds true. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's head of fixed-income e-commerce, Ben Wolkowitz, describes this as a \"fairly protracted period of good faith and cordial professional negotiation where the various owners have got over their initial caution and reserve\". In other words, the platform runs at its smoothest when it is in execution mode and requires little or no input or decisions from the board members.</p><p>Before and after this period of relative indolence, though, such ventures require long-term planning and near-total mutual openness with partners that are typically close competitors. No amount of roles as joint lead manager on a deal is going to prepare you for that. In short, it's anathema to the archetypal banker.</p><p>Dan Marowitz, chief operating officer of Deutsche Bank's e-GCI division, is one of the few who is more open about the challenges facing the banks. \"E-commerce goes against the grain of what bankers do for a living. It requires them extensively to reshape the way they think about how they do business.\" His perspective is definitely atypical, but then so is his background. He joined e-GCI last February, and it is his first banking job. Before that he worked at iVillage and before that at Dow Jones. \"I was surprised at how willing many of the bankers are to adapt, but it's not an overnight process,\" he continues.</p><p>Yet some of his counterparts still continue to pretend that matters are otherwise. \"This is not a new development for us investment banks,\" says one e-commerce banker. \"We've all been involved in several projects which have been a success.\" Asked to elaborate, he cannot. Any examples he could have given would have been qualified successes at best in any case.</p><p>For the banking world's track record of joint ventures involving new technology is not that great. There are three platforms of note that banks have set up in the past: EBS, Liberty Brokerage, and TradeWeb. All have been perceived as nothing more than facilitators and cost-saving mechanisms by the member banks, if not by their separately appointed CEOs.</p><p>Liberty has effectively closed up shop, having decided in the autumn to shut down its attempt at an electronic brokerage and use Garban's instead. EBS's CEO, Peter Bartko, has found his attempts to break into swaps and FRAs for the inter-dealer market vetoed by one or more board member. Any hopes to break into the broker-customer camp may be in vain. TradeWeb, though a success now, will find its plans for expansion difficult to get past a seven-member board that has already made a series of conflicting investments in newer consortia, pre-empting CEO Jim Toffey's moves.</p><p>TradeWeb's trials are detailed below. Meanwhile anyone tempted to claim that over the past 12 months bankers have demonstrated that they get the net and are ready to embrace open architecture platforms that e-commerce creates need only look back to the other two businesses.</p><p>Were bankers truly willing to embrace technology, much more would have been made of Liberty and EBS. Brokertec, for example, which went live trading US government securities on the inter-dealer market in the summer, really should not have been necessary, as it does exactly what Liberty was intended to do.</p><p>As for EBS, if Bartko had got his way there would have been no need for FXall and Atriax to exist. He would have long since expanded his business from inter-dealer forex market-making and into dealing with the end client. EBS, which stands for electronic broking system, has the liquidity to do so, but lacked the institutional willpower. What's more, the power of the CEO was emasculated by the governance structure, which somehow managed to model itself on the UN Security Council since any one member (of 15 on EBS) could veto a project. Instead, two competing sets of banks, representatives of most of which sit on the board of EBS, are now pouring roughly $100 million each into developing two new platforms that won't be up and running until the middle of this year.</p><p>Commitment, an efficient governance structure, and some might say effective management were all lacking to a greater or lesser degree in both. Mix that with most bankers' inbred desire to retain as much control as possible and the likelihood of building a successful jointly-owned business diminishes rapidly.</p><p>And that accounts just for comparatively simple inter-dealer platforms where the initial emphasis is on cost savings. Little was learnt from these earlier forays. Brokertec, for example, although now going strong, initially set up a cumbersome management structure where each shareholder has a vote. There are 12 banks on the board, from Europe and the US, and just getting them together to discuss matters has proved problematic, and was one of the reason why its launch was delayed for some months beyond initial projections. As an indication of how protracted Brokertec's development has been, says one insider, the legal bills \"equal the GDP of a small country\".</p><p>The big theme of 2000 has been how to extend inter-dealer coverage to the end user, which for consortia sites usually means to the institutional buy side. The reason why consortium sites are being attempted now is not because the banks want to launch them, nor because they have learnt wisely from their forays with inter-dealer consortia, but because clients have demanded it.</p><p>But before the myth develops, let's scotch any idea that these sites provide a great example of banks listening to clients and responding to their needs - for a certain degree of self-congratulation does creep in here.</p><p>It was only a year ago that investment bankers were fretting about whether their businesses would be amazoned - a reference to the startling success of online books vendor Amazon.com in stealing a march in service and cost over incumbent bricks-and-mortar rivals such as Barnes &amp; Noble.</p><p>Now, after the big tech and internet stock shakeout on the stock markets, and the failure of dozens of previously lauded start-ups, the old-economy leaders have struck back, whether in books, airlines or finance. And that has created a greater sense of security than was present in 1999.Clients want e-capability</p><p>For all that, banks cannot ignore the internet challenge. First, some of the bigger and more aggressive clients have been demanding electronic multi-bank research, pricing, execution and settlement for some time now. When State Street started letting other banks onto its FX Connect platform in March it was after nearly two years' growing client pressure.</p><p>Bank of New York can claim an even earlier genesis. \"When we first began to devise IFX Manager three years ago,\" says head of e-foreign exchange Richard Estes, \"we knew it had to be a multi-bank-capable system or else clients wouldn't want to use it in the long term.\" Even then, though, it was only in early 2000 that Bank of New York started to explore opening up that facet of the platform.</p><p>Jim Toffey, TradeWeb's CEO, was presenting his multi-bank idea for US treasuries trading to his bosses at CSFB back in 1996. And in the early 1990s there were two attempts to create multi-bank bond systems: one by</p><p>JP Morgan that was ditched following a concerted effort to ignore it by rivals, and one independent company called InterVest, which ended up suing some of the big brokers for actively undermining its business.</p><p>That puts the lie to the claim of many bankers that the technology wasn't there until recently for such multibank systems. There is nothing overly complicated in TradeWeb's system, for example. It uses bog-standard mid-1990s' technology from CSFB, souped-up occasionally to keep it current.</p><p>Competitive juices are easily stirred among the leading banks now professing their keenness to be partners. Let's not forget that these are the same banks that were frantically rushing around at the start of last year to compete with Goldman Sach's WebET system for issuing and trading bonds, at the time thought to be streets ahead of everyone else. There followed a massive smoke-and-mirrors exercise by all concerned, with almost all the orders logged as e-orders actually being taken over the phone and inputted online by sales staff. Only some were better at the game than others.</p><p>It was a little different at the end of the year. Gain Capital, for example, is an online independent forex provider in the retail and small institutional market. It aggregates all its orders into larger chunks to send to one or more of its six big market-makers, three of them among the top-five investment banks, according to CEO and founder Mark Galant. Only two of them can handle orders over the internet. The other four do business with Gain over the phone.</p><p>The generally ill-prepared state of banks' proprietary systems and the evidence of institutional stubbornness and inertia throughout the 1990s are more than enough proof that banks are hardly hellbent on driving change for the sheer intellectual rigour of it all.</p><p>As one head of e-commerce at a US investment bank puts it: \"Do we all wish the internet never happened? Well of course we do. The old way of doing business, if inefficient at times, is a cosy world that many of us have done well in. But it has happened, and we have to make sure we keep on top of it.\"</p><p>There are various reasons why banks are now deciding to instigate or join consortium platforms. On the one hand, there is the natural extension of the inter-dealer market platform - a desire to cut costs, whether on sales staff, office space, technology, back-office processing - usually a mixture of all these.</p><p>There is also the defensive aspect. In 1999 the fear of being amazoned ran deep. Rather than wait around for it to be done to them, the bankers went out to find ways of doing it to themselves.</p><p>But fear runs deeper than just that with bankers. There is also the fear of being left out of any new venture set up by rivals. Better to pay up for a seat at the table than to sit by and watch as your business model is destroyed by a new entity you have not even got a stake in.</p><p>Sometimes a bank will describe its investments in certain vehicles as a hedge - as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch did in 1999 when they rapidly invested in several competing electronic commission networks. These ECNs had rapidly won over 30% of the trading volume on Nasdaq, and were setting their sights on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Then there are the more subversive reasons for investing.</p><p>One is to get a better look at someone else's technology, either to copy it or reassure oneself that one's own technology is superior, or at least up to scratch. The CEO of one US equity market start-up was concerned that this was exactly the motive that prompted one of the major investment banks to ring him up and ask for a demo. \"They have been banging on about the superiority of their technology for much of the last two years,\" the CEO told Euromoney in early autumn. \"Yet now they want to come and look at ours. I'm deeply suspicious about their motives.\" In the end he turned them down.Investment as sabotage?</p><p>Another is much more scandalous: investing in e-finance start-ups as a way of trying to ensure their failure. Rumours circulate all the time about banks that might be up to this, and the big US banks are often at the top of the list. Perhaps the suspicion follows from the sheer number of consortia that they have invested in. Mnuchin at Goldman Sachs, when we tell him that his firm gets mentioned more than any in this regard, says: \"That is absolutely not the case. Our investments are based on the merits of the business opportunity with the goal of enhancing the services we provide our clients.\"</p><p>Perhaps that is the case. But the treasurer of one of the largest capital markets issuers and traders told Euromoney in the summer that this was his conclusion after pushing banks to progress more quickly with consortia derivatives platforms. Certain banks, he insisted, had joined these platforms with a view to slowing down their development so as to protect margins in their established businesses for a little longer.</p><p>It's the kind of claim that keeps a conspiracy theorist alive, although rather more difficult to prove. One e-commerce banker in Europe actually thinks that far from being the ones to scupper consortia, Goldman, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are more dangerous as the drivers. \"They know exactly what they want, and they push hard for it. And more fool you if you let them.\"</p><p>The flipside is that there are also banks and bankers who don't know what they're doing. \"I've sat in on some of these initial discussions, and I've come away with the distinct impression that some people are there who don't know what they want,\" says one e-banker.</p><p>A more subtle twist is that the downside to the banks is limited to the investments they've made. If an entity such as BondBook or Market Axess were to fail, at least the brokers involved could tell their clients, those who have for years been urging them to offer such a service, that they gave it their best shot. \"We might lose the money,\" says one e-commerce head. \"But we still have the old way of doing business, which can be extremely lucrative in part because of its inefficiency.\"</p><p>But it is virtually impossible to discern whether a firm or group of firms belongs to the camp of those really trying to drive markets forward or to those trying to slow down new developments or, more simply, are reacting out of fear.</p><p>BondClick and SwapsWire could easily fall into this latter category. Both belong to what one e-commerce banker dubs \"management by committee\".</p><p>Announced in January 2000, BondClick was touted as the Europeans' answer to TradeWeb, the multi-bank electronic system that is successfully winning business in trading US government bonds, and was known to be looking at expanding across the pond. Six banks, all European bar JP Morgan (which was not involved in TradeWeb), invested in BondClick and gained seats on the board.</p><p>For four months, nothing happened. All that sat on the internet site was the initial press release. In April, its future was so unclear that when Euromoney spoke to two board members, one said they were about to announce a CEO, which surprised the other one, who had no idea what was going on.</p><p>The first banker was right. In May the firm announced that Eloi Duverger, the JP Morgan government bond trader who represented</p><p>JP Morgan on the fledgling board, would become CEO. Talking about the period before he took on the role, Duverger admits that \"it was not the easiest period. But it's very difficult to make headway without dedicated resources.\" And it wasn't just a lack of resources, but also a lack of commitment on the part of the member banks that held progress back. \"Some of the banks were sceptical to start with,\" Duverger says. \"Yes, they were shareholders, but they were also competitors, and it took some time for all of them to get comfortable with that notion. And each had a different agenda. Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan were the driving force behind it, while others were not always so sure.\"</p><p>As for SwapsWire, since its announcement all that has happened is that the founder members have been besieged by calls from competitors, angry at being left out of the process, forcing a slew of announcements on yet another bank joining the consortium.</p><p>The initial troubles at these two consortia smack more of inertia caused by inadequate management than of a concerted attempt to scuttle a new business.</p><p>Where the sabotage theory may be more valid is with the ECNs in the US. Again it arises from banks investing in several similar entities. How can an investment bank be expected to commit the proper time, resources and order flow to a new venture if it is also an investor in three of its major competitors?David and Goliath</p><p>At the end of November, one of the large foreign exchange users made an announcement that left many in the market utterly shocked. Energy multinational RoyalDutch/Shell had decided to invest $11.5 million in Currenex, an independent trading platform.</p><p>The week before, several board members of the two bank consortia FXall and Atriax were bordering on the smug when discussing Currenex's prospects now that the big banks had jumped into the breach. \"You've got to question their business prospects now that we're out with our plans,\" was the common refrain. One banker said: \"Clients want liquidity, and that's what we provide. Independent platforms like Currenex are going to have a rough time of it.\" Another commented: \"I only ever hear about Currenex from journalists, not from my clients.\"</p><p>Battle will soon be joined between bank-sponsored platforms - both multibank and single bank - and independent platforms.</p><p>It seems likely that independent platforms will struggle to succeed. Blackbird, an electronic swaps broker, and high-yield platforms Limitrader and Trading Edge have seen only small business flow, despite being two or three years ahead of the major banks. Likewise some of the other non-bank bond trading platforms have failed to take off.</p><p>But there are reasons for that, aside from independence issues. \"A lot of them simply didn't have the right models to start with,\" says Justin Bull, head of e-commerce at Barclays Capital. \"Trading platforms for illiquid bonds, for example, are systems ahead of their time as far as many investors are concerned.\" A terrible market for high-yield paper doesn't help much either.</p><p>As for Blackbird, says Simon Lack, Chase's e-commerce head and formerly the bank's head of swaps trading: \"It is a great system and fun to trade on. But swaps is already such a competitive market that those of us already in it saw no reason to let in yet another broker to take business away from us.\"</p><p>And there are other developments that appear to call into question the prospects for neutral systems. The most obvious is the appearance of several big initiatives in the foreign exchange and credit markets that are run exclusively by member banks: FXall, Market Axess, BondBook, BondClick and to a lesser extent Atriax. With each announcement comes an extra concession by multi-bank platforms to their customers. Market Axess was the first non-treasuries platform to offer joint pricing. FXall announced a plan to have a sell-side advisory board; as did BondBook. BondBook also offers anonymous pricing, something that hands back to the market one of the banks' biggest advantages: knowledge of market flow, and the ability to trade off it.</p><p>BondClick, once it finally got started, made rapid progress, and is getting good feedback for spending more time with potential clients asking what they want and how they want it delivered.</p><p>But only Atriax has an independent CEO, Dan Morehead, formerly CFO at Tiger Asset Management, although one of the reasons he got the job was because of his experience in forex at Deutsche Bank, a founding partner, where he had impressed the investment bank's head, Edson Mitchell.</p><p>Consortium sites are increasingly keen to show some aspect of independence from the banks and an inclusion of end customers. But their board members are all from the member banks, which own the vast majority of the equity (some is left over for the staff, but not a huge amount).</p><p>There is some justification for leaving buy-side clients off the board, as BondBook's co-CEO, James Pellicane, explains. \"It is politically much more of a minefield choosing a few buy-side participators. There are so many of them, and so many different strategies. And it's sometimes more difficult for buy-side firms, in their role as fiduciaries, to participate as equity stakeholders.\"The end of independence</p><p>It's all a far cry from the heady days of 1999 when banks were simply happy to own a stake - any stake - in anything that might conceivably threaten their business. It even carried over into 2000. But with each successive new announcement of a multi-bank platform, the arguments of the independents that they should be preferred by end customers have sounded weaker. \"Anyone preaching independence as a virtue now is doing so more out of necessity that anything else,\" says one banker.</p><p>In their search for liquidity, greater market recognition, and possibly because they, too, feared losing out to the march of the brokers, several of the independent platforms began to court, and take, investments from the established players.</p><p>Equavant, for example, entered into a partnership with FleetBoston in October to develop its bank loan trading system. Currenex allowed Barclays Capital to come on board that same month. In November 1999, Jeffries took a stake in Limitrader, CSFB in Trading Edge, and Chase in CreditTrade.</p><p>Of all of them, Equavant has undergone the biggest change in its approach to its equity and governance structure. It was set up towards the end of 1999, originally called ereorg, by Ronald DeKoven, a good-humoured lawyer who spent much of his career advising on many of the world's major debt default negotiations.</p><p>His idea was to set up an internet platform to trade distressed debt and bank debt, and the plan from the start was to run it as a wholly independent platform. When Euromoney first visited his office in November 1999 he had just taken a call from one of the top five US commercial banks looking to buy a stake. He turned them down flat.</p><p>But by May he had resigned as CEO, with the rumour being that his approach had so alienated the banks that they refused to cooperate at all. He still remains as chairman, though, and retains a seat on the board.</p><p>Phil Andryc, president since last January, took over as CEO. This former chief technology officer at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter commands a good deal of respect in the markets. And he has adopted a more inclusive approach to building the business than his predecessor. \"The idea that if you build it they will come has evolved into a recognition that while it's all well and good to build it, you need to get flow onto the system. And to get that means partnering with and giving equity stakes to the liquidity providers.\"</p><p>Thus far, though, just one bank has signed up, FleetBoston, in October, at the same time as ereorg changed its name to Equavant. As well as developing the bank debt trading platform, Fleet is also advising on Equavant's plans to set up a primary loan system as well.</p><p>But having just one bank invested in an independent platform is hardly ideal, as it leaves you open to the charge of being in that institution's pocket. It's a dilemma Simon Lack, Chase's e-commerce head, pondered before investing his firm's money in CreditTrade. \"Yes, I was concerned that we would be the only bank on the platform, but we had studied the options and decided that CreditTrade offered us the best model. While more banks would have been preferable, we only have one board seat, and they don't need to rely solely on us for liquidity since they acquired the Prebon Yamane credit derivatives brokers.\"</p><p>Liquidity isn't an issue for Equavant yet as it has not started to trade. But Andryc is sensitive to the situation. \"Our vision is to have between four and six partners. And Fleet has made it very clear that whoever joins does so on a wholly equal basis.\"</p><p>For now, though, Fleet is there on its own, and that has got observers talking. Rumour has it that Andryc has been looking for other partners without success. That could be because banks are still reacting against DeKoven's earlier intransigence, or because the banks are not so keen on the platform as it stands. \"An online auction-based model for distressed debt works just fine,\" says one banker. \"It's simply transferring the phone model onto the web. But loan trading doesn't operate that way.\"</p><p>That, surely, would be an argument for getting in now, early, while the model is being developed and while the valuation is low.</p><p>In any event, all Fleet has so far is an equity stake and two seats on the fledgling advisory board. Even with another five banks as partners, says Andryc, \"we will maintain the majority holding and the majority of seats on the executive committee\". At present Fleet has no seats on the executive board. They belong to Andryc, DeKoven and another employee, two venture capitalists from backers Warburg Pinkus, and two for the angel investors. Any changes will still leave banks in the minority. \"We all agree the last thing we need is a UN-style board where nothing gets done,\" says Andryc. \"So although we will allow them onto the board in due course, they will be in the minority. And their seats will come from a mixture of vacancies as the angel investors pull out, and expanding the overall number.\" And what if there are more banks than seats? \"We've been pondering rotating the bank-assigned seat.\"</p><p>Another start-up that is feeling the need to adapt is Creditex, which was founded in April 1999 as an online credit derivatives trading market by co-CEOs John McEvoy and Sunil Hirani after they left Deutsche Bank. Creditex is the only purely electronic credit derivatives platform in the market, and to date over $1.5 billion in notional volume has been traded since it went live in March.</p><p>Creditex is neither a full multi-bank platform nor entirely independent but a hybrid. It has some big banks as investors, including JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank, its first two strategic investors, and it has other, non-bank, end-users with stakes as well, something none of the pure multi-banks have ventured to do.</p><p>But the founders have retained a majority stake for themselves. Although coy about the exact details of their board, they do say that their main concern was to keep it small - so most investors are pure equity holders and not board members.</p><p>Theoretically, it is the ideal mix: an independent management team with a big stake in the company as an incentive on the one hand, and on the other a good crop of the major liquidity providers in the market.</p><p>So it might come as a surprise to learn that McEvoy and Hirani are setting up a sister company, an online secondary loan-trading platform. Not only is it to be a separate company, but they are also giving the banks as a group a 51% stake. Why are they giving up what appeared to be one of their main advantages? Because the banking empire is striking back. \"We have four of the six largest loan traders invested in Creditex, so we could have kept it as one company,\" says McEvoy. \"But banks want the valuation associated with just one product on each platform at a time. And the environment is nothing like as favourable to start-ups as it was last year. Banks don't feel anywhere near as threatened by them, so feel they have a stronger hand to play.\"A corporate fan club</p><p>Yet just as the advantage appeared to be shifting back to the banks, along comes Shell with its investment in Currenex. They are at pains to point out that it is not an exclusive arrangement, and that there is nothing to stop them using FXall or Atriax, but they chose to invest in Currenex after studying the market options for nearly 12 months.</p><p>The independent platform appears to appeal especially to corporates - MasterCard is another fan of Currenex - and it was pressure from such clients that persuaded Barclays Capital to invest as well - at the time taken as yet another slap in the face for independence. \"Our clients wanted us to join, pure and simple,\" says Bull at Barclays Capital. \"About half a dozen told us that they liked the site, and liked its independence and wanted us to put our prices on it.\"</p><p>With Shell and Barclays, Currenex is the only platform to have both buy and sell side in equal measure - not the greatest boast when there's just one from each side - but it is a balance the company's CEO, Lori Mirek, has been striving hard to keep. \"There were no problems from other banks in having just Barclays join,\" she says. \"We've made it very clear to all of them from the start that we want all of them to take part in some form or other. And we're being very careful to keep the platform wholly independent. Neither buy nor sell side can get more than a 10% stake in total, and we're not giving them a seat on the board.\"</p><p>If that seems reckless, given what fellow independent platforms have gone through, there are a few points to remember in Currenex's favour. It is already up and running, and has liquidity. The leading forex banks have invested in their own consortia. But clients like the independence of Currenex, which is why they use it. If players like MasterCard, Shell and the Inter-American Development Bank decide they want to use such a platform, the banks will sit up and listen.Who do you want to use them?</p><p>It sounds like a na\u00efve question, but there really is no consensus on who exactly is being targeted by some of these platforms. Euromoney asked a board member of one of the forex consortia which customers his bank wanted to target through the platform. Rather shockingly, there was silence, followed by some mumbling about corporates and fund managers.</p><p>Another member of the same platform also found it shocking. \"We've all submitted names to the CEO, so we all ought to know who we're targeting.\"</p><p>But there's disagreement on who will do the marketing of the platform. Some feel that the consortium won't be hiring enough marketing staff so the banks will do it for them, yet others say that this would present too much of a conflict as the new business develops, and in any case would be counterproductive for the consortium not to do it.</p><p>A common line is that these platforms are being developed as a response to client demand, that the big funds want to see commingled prices. That may be true. But do banks really want to see their biggest clients move that way?</p><p>\"This is a very high-contact business,\" says an e-commerce representative from one of the major investment banks. \"And bankers want to keep those relationships. If they start going electronic, there's a bigger chance of losing them. Basically, online platforms, for now at least, are largely designed to deal with the smaller clients who you never cared about before. If you can get 95% of them online, you're providing them with a better service than they had before, and you rid yourself of an uneconomic irritation. If mid-sized clients go on, it's a help, but some of those are your next big clients, so you don't want them all to go electronic.</p><p>\"As for the top clients, they're the last people you want to get online as they pay most of your bonuses. If they want to buy a stock on the New York Stock Exchange and want to go there in person on an elephant with the queen of Sheba, you'll do it for them. Internet trading's good for about 5% of their orders - the small, easy tickets. The rest you really want to be doing person to person.\"</p><p>In the end it is what investors choose to do that will resolve many of the issues that are plaguing the development of the independent, proprietary and multi-bank platforms. Thus far they don't seem to care all that much. Average trade sizes on TradeWeb, for example, are below the average for the treasuries market.</p><p>Most platforms still haven't launched yet, though investors are being bombarded with information about over 120 platforms, if not more. Large investors are none too impressed.</p><p>Most will only tackle one part of what an investor needs, which is usually the ability to see prices from several banks and then trade off it, completely ignoring the fact that most investors rarely trade in such a void.</p><p>And while each platform's members struggle to find the right partners, the right strategy and the right technology, the investors can sit back and watch, continuing to do business the old-fashioned way. Once the mergers between platforms begin, and succeed, and once most are operational, investors will start looking more seriously at which might benefit them. And by that stage we'll be on to the next new new thing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4PTM-KB00-TXWJ-00KP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7107\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2001 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"01\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>January 2001 </dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002NG2</classCode><className>EUROPEAN INVESTMENT BANK</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Consortia platforms</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>bankers</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

His composed manner is the result of increasingly broad recognition that he has helped build what is thus far the only successful multi-bank brokerto-client trading consortium. Back in the mid-1990s he and Lee Olesky, now Europe CEO of Brokertec, persuaded their employer, Credit Suisse First Boston, to allow them to set up an electronic platform to trade US government bonds.</p><p>Four years on, he holds success in his hands, and has done so by staying focused and by including several of the big Wall Street firms in his plans as equity owners and board members. By his own admission, there was also a bit of luck. His business now accounts for over 12% of volume of all US treasuries traded in the secondary market.</p><p>He's now expanding into agency bonds, and plans to get into municipal bonds and other liquid credits soon thereafter, including European government bonds. Few would doubt his success, and yet there are few who relish his position.</p><p>For Toffey's TradeWeb now faces its first major challenges as a going concern. And those challenges are going to come from the very firms he has sitting on his board vetting his every move. As much as it has been the bellwether for the rise and rise of institutional</p><p>electronic trading, so it may well now become the textbook case on the politics of multi-bank consortia.</p><p>Back in May the firm was advertising for a foreign exchange product development manager. On the face of it, this was a nobrainer, as any attempt to trade government bonds outside of the US would require some form of forex service. \"Investors are portfolio buyers, not just players in the treasuries market,\" says Toffey. \"They might trade mortgage bonds or agencies against them, as well as European government bonds.\" Services such as forex and swaps are crucial to a company trying to service all those needs.</p><p>But something happened the week the advert started running: FXall was announced, a dedicated foreign exchange trading platform set up by seven leading players. Three of them sat on TradeWeb's board: CSFB, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. One other board member, SalomonSmith Barney, a division of forex giant Citigroup, was notable by its absence, as was Deutsche Bank, at that time just a provider of prices to TradeWeb but soon promoted to be the seventh board member, In October, these two partnered</p><p>with Chase Manhattan and Reuters to form a rival to FXall called Amax.</p><p>Five of TradeWeb's seven board members and investors thus belong to two separate online forex trading platforms, to which they have contributed a significant deal of cash and resources. Toffey does not regard it as a problem. \"We can build our own forex service as a complement to our core business. There's no need for us to have to go to another consortium for it.\" But how likely is it that they will be prepared to allow Toffey to develop a rival service for a sub-set of clients using their money?</p><p>The second, and arguably greater, challenge arrived just a couple of weeks after FXall. Another group of TradeWeb's shareholders, this time Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, announced their intention to build a non-treasuries bond trading platform, BondBook, which they hoped would to all intents and purposes become a bond exchange. Initially it will accommodate trading in US corporate and municipal bonds.</p><p>At first sight it doesn't appear to be a threat. TradeWeb deals in government securities, while BondBook plans to create a market place for less liquid bonds. Investors don't all make the same distinction, however; many will use treasuries or agencies as a hedge against corporate bonds, or want to sell out of the latter into treasuries when markets get rocky. At present they can do all that through a phone call or two to their chosen bank. Doing it on two separate platforms would be cumbersome, slow, and potentially costly. That's what initially drove the failed merger talks between BondClick and Market Axess.</p><p>TradeWeb is also the litmus test for one of the other big questions being asked at present. Are these bank consortia for-profit organizations or just utilities? With the collapse of the internet boom, that issue has been debated more than it was when many were first planned.</p><p>Only one of them is definitely one or the other, TheMarkets.com. It's a portal for distributing US equities research, and contains most of the usual suspects as partners. Research, of course, is basically free for most investors, so any thought of TheMarkets.com trying to turn a profit would be misplaced.</p><p>As for the others, few know the answer, although some think they do. \"We are definitely a for-profit company,\" says Toffey. \"It's not a question of either planning an IPO exit or being a utility. We are a</p><p>for-profit independent private company.\" For-profit companies, quoted or private, are supposed to grow earnings, either by increasing margin or volumes. What happens when your competitors for market share own you?</p><p>You hear a different line to Toffey's from the banks that sit on the</p><p>TradeWeb board. They view it as a fantastic way to cut costs and maybe reach a few more clients. \"TradeWeb's success is a result of having a trading model which is based on the standard way of buying treasuries, and using technology to allow several dealers to quote at once,\" says Ben Wolkowitz, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's head of fixed-income e-commerce. \"It expedited the process for a highly commoditized market, helping to cut costs, increase competition and as a result improve service to the clients.\"</p><p>That would seem to imply a utility. And in the end, no matter what Toffey says, ultimately TradeWeb is only as independent as the seven banks want it to be. And all of them have invested in other models: five are in BondBook (Deutsche, Goldman, Merrill, Morgan Stanley, Salomon) and the other two, CSFB and Lehman, are in Market Axess. And most are also in one of the two forex platforms.</p><p>That limits Toffey's scope for expansion</p><p>considerably, effectively to the highly liquid commoditized markets where spreads are thin: the charge for trading treasuries is down to as low as $5 per $i million. It does charge the seven non-board member banks to list prices - somewhere between $1.5 million and $z million is the entry fee per year - but combined these two revenue streams leave little to invest with.</p><p>Whether a BondBook or Market Axess turns a tidy profit is not clear either, but both state that they are for-profit models. \"We have a very interesting economic model here,\" says James Pellicane, coCEO of BondBook, intimating that there isa good chance for it to make good money, although he usually tries to deflect attention away</p><p>from the potential for profit. \"We're trying to address the fundamental problems which the bond markets suffer from, such as illiquidity, decentralization and very little price transparency.</p><p>\"This is a market structure play. That's where the real benefits to the market makers come from - increasing liquidity, improving</p><p>straight-through processing and clearing. I doubt the potential contained in the equity stake is foremost in our investors' minds.\"</p><p>Perhaps for those sitting on the board already, but for those that do not have a stake there is real concern. \"Having a stake in BondBook or Market Mess is a way of replacing money which we made on market making but which will be lost once it goes electronic,\" explains one head of investment banking e-commerce at a US investment bank. \"That's why we run them as for-profit businesses. But if an anonymous platform such as BondBook succeeds, it will kill market-making profits for everyone. So if you're not an equity holder, you lose revenues and you get no compensation for it.\" That might explain the strange tactic of launching with three banks only, and then adding first Salomon and then Deutsche two and four months later. Salomon especially was rumoured to be verv annoyed at beine left out of the</p><p>discussions leading up to the launch, and pushed hard, and successfully, to be let in. Deutsche's admittance was no doubt held up by its earlier investment in rival platform Market Axess.</p><p>It's not clear that a for-profit model can be maintained on any of the dealing platforms set up by the banks, or by the independents. \"It's somewhat naive to assume that there's a lot of upside in having an equity capital stake in these platforms,\" says Justin Bull, head of ecommerce at Barclays Capital. \"If the technology really does have the ability to make it an open platform, any liquidity provider can be plugged in, then as traffic increases, the costs investors pay go down, and the value of the equity stake is small if anything at all.\"</p></bodyText></section><p>\"That's certainly part of it\" he replies. \"Although often we don't even get that far. Just getting us all together in one place is tough enough.\" Once that happens, the negotiations start: who's in, who's out, what exactly is the aim, who sits on the board, who runs it, what sort of oversight committee is there, who talks to clients, who decides on strategy. That's when things start to fall apart. \"You start off with mutual suspicion,\" continues the banker. \"You are all competitors after all. We spend an inordinate amount of time getting over those hurdles, and you can't help but walk away with the feeling that some of these people actually don't want to achieve much at all.\"</p><p>Welcome to the wonderful world of web consortia, a world that has come to dominate investment-banking strategy over the past year. It's been driven by a desire to offer clients what some have been demanding for several years now: quotes from several banks displayed in one place. But don't be fooled into thinking that these consortia are serving clients' needs. Instead, they are artificial constructs focused on single products, which is hardly how their clients operate. For example, credit market platforms can trade either government bonds or corporate bonds, but never both, despite the fact that when an investor buys a corporate bond he will also more often than not be selling government bonds, and vice versa.</p><p>Focus is the excuse given: better to get one product right than several products wrong. In reality, the platforms are managed for the benefit of their founding banks. The trouble is that lots of banks in one room means lots of politics. This is making the consortia hostages to the shareholder structures and governance nightmares that the banks have imposed on them. And that has already caused one merger between two such platforms to fall through.</p><p>Market Axess and BondClick were trying to tie the knot over the summer. A merger would have joined a price give-up model for US and European corporate bonds with the nascent European government bond trading answer to TradeWeb.</p><p>Why did it fail? \"You get into really ridiculous arguments over valuations and relative shareholder stakes over two companies that don't even really exist yet,\" says an ecommerce banker who is on the board of one of the companies. \"You start to protect shareholders rather than develop the business.\"</p><p>There might also have been issues with some rather intriguing power play tactics from Deutsche Bank. Having helped to set up BondClick in January and joined the board of Market Axess in the spring, Deutsche suddenly turned up in late summer first as the newest board member on TradeWeb and then in October as the fifth founding member of BondBook, the anonymous would-be bond exchange set up by Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in June, with SalomonSmith Barney joining in August. (Deutsche is the only non-US bank on either platform.)</p><p>Whether it was simply a case of Deutsche hedging its bets, or trying to use its investments to force itself into a position of power to drive through its own agenda is a moot point. Clearly, though, a combined Market Axess-BondClick board would not have been amused at seeing one of its apparently biggest supporters also hobnobbing with the competition. Either way, the interests of the end user were clearly not central to discussions.</p><p>Estimates from those setting them up put the money being spent on these platforms at $75 million to $250 million per consortium. Starting on page 36, we list 36 of the more prominent platforms. We will almost certainly have overlooked some. But a very rough calculation puts the industry's pure venture equity investment at close to $6 billion.</p><p>What's more, it ties up more staff and resources than many had expected. Bankers are already beginning to talk about finite resources and the possibility of cutting back on commitments to many more new ventures. And yet most sites announced are focused on single products and are heavily concentrated in the US; so to some it feels as if the surface of possibilities has hardly been scratched.</p><p>So pervasive and so high profile have these consortia become that at the end of November the US Department of Justice anti-trust division sent civil investigative demands to five multi-bank platforms - BondBook, Market Axess, Bond Desk, FXall and Atriax, as well as to most of the member firms.</p><p>We shouldn't be expecting a Microsoft-style anti-trust lawsuit just yet, though. For a start, none of the platforms is trading significant volumes, if any at all, so it's impossible for them to be anti-competitive.</p><p>Avoiding unpleasant surprises</p><p>It does, though, signal the DoJ's concern that technology is changing the way banks think about operating so much that they have to investigate further to satisfy themselves that there are no anti-competitive surprises to be found later on, intentional or otherwise. The consortia say there aren't, indeed that their business plans would fail if there were. But regulators can't take that at face value. And the banks and consortia themselves have given more than enough reason for concern. Just a year ago, most were floundering for an internet strategy. Today they still are, but feel surer of their ground - in 2000 the empire struck back. And they have been using a powerful weapon: liquidity.</p><p>Markets can't function without it, and the investment banks have done a good job trying to convince us that they are the only ones that can provide it on any meaningful basis.</p><p>So well have they done this that the liquidity issue has become the battleground for the debate between bank-run and independent platforms. And the banks are prepared to defend their turf aggressively. \"This is a business we developed,\" says Ben Wolkowitz, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's head of e-fixed income. \"That a third party should be able to tell us what to do with our clients makes us all very uncomfortable.\"</p><p>There couldn't be a clearer warning signal to the anti-trust lawyers. While it shows that banks are prepared to defend their turf, it raises the very real prospect that their collaborative efforts to do so could be restrictive and anti-competitive.</p><p>Speaking at a recent conference, a lawyer specializing in anti-trust cases sketched the outline in the table above, which he uses as a rule of thumb to determine if and when anticompetitive practices might become an issue. He describes the sixth row as the go-to-jail card, with rows three and onwards demanding some form of regulatory oversight. The examples of bank consortia in the right-hand column have been added by us.</p><p>There are other matters to consider, such as who runs the platform and the role of a buyside advisory board, but it is clear from this that in theory at least all the major bank-run consortia need to make a convincing case to the Department of Justice.</p><p>What officials from the DoJ must bear in mind, though, is that this new-found love of the banks for collaboration was anathema a year ago. As Lars Olesen, Citigroup's head of e-forex, says about his involvement with Amax: \"If I had spent this much time with my competitors last year, I'd have been sacked.\" Keeping up with the herd</p><p>It's easy to attach conspiracy theories to banks' plans, but looks can be deceiving. The rush to announce consortia indicates that banks' priorities appear to be that they should be seen to be taking part, to be parting with cash to buy in to any number of multi-bank and nonbank platforms. It's the easiest way to show that you are keeping up with change and not being left behind by new technology.</p><p>But the reality of working as part of a multi-bank platform is very different, and certainly far removed from the way investment bankers usually operate. That is in silos within their own organizations, as political operators conditioned to protect their turf both internally and externally, and with longterm considerations entirely subordinate to getting the next deal done and the bonus increased.</p><p>So when these same bankers start to spend a greater proportion of their time concentrating on longer-term strategies, and doing so in collaboration with fierce rivals, it's scarcely surprising that things don't run smoothly.</p><p>There are now dozens of internet trading systems and research sites being set up by two or more banks, and though it is true that a lot of clients have been demanding these commingled offerings, it's a different matter entirely to make them a success.</p><p>Not that you'll find many willing to admit there are serious issues. \"When firms enter into multi-bank joint ventures,\" says Steve Mnuchin, managing director and head of ecommerce at Goldman Sachs. \"they do so as partners who work together towards the success of the enterprise.\" It's a fantastic ideal to hold dear, but experience shows it's not realistic for any protracted period of time.</p><p>Ben Cohen, head of e-commerce fixed income at CSFB, says: \"The really crucial part of any such venture is in getting the first 10% to 15% decided upon.\" Effectively that includes initial governance structures and exact business strategy. There then follows a relatively calm period of building and executing, when Mnuchin's partnership comment largely holds true. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's head of fixed-income e-commerce, Ben Wolkowitz, describes this as a \"fairly protracted period of good faith and cordial professional negotiation where the various owners have got over their initial caution and reserve\". In other words, the platform runs at its smoothest when it is in execution mode and requires little or no input or decisions from the board members.</p><p>Before and after this period of relative indolence, though, such ventures require longterm planning and near-total mutual openness with partners that are typically close competitors. No amount of roles as joint lead manager on a deal is going to prepare you for that. In short, it's anathema to the archetypal banker.</p><p>Dan Marowitz, chief operating officer of Deutsche Banks e-GCI division, is one of the few who is more open about the challenges facing the banks. \"E-commerce goes against the grain of what bankers do for a living. It requires them extensively to reshape the way they think about how they do business.\" His perspective is definitely atypical, but then so is his background. He joined e-GCI in February, and it is his first banking job. Before that he worked at iVillage and before that at Dow Jones. \"I was surprised at how willing many of the bankers are to adapt, but it's not an overnight process,\" he continues.</p><p>Yet some of his counterparts still continue to pretend that matters are otherwise. \"This is not a new development for us investment banks,\" says one e-commerce banker. \"We've all been involved in several projects which have been a success.\" Asked to elaborate, he cannot. Any examples he could have given would have been qualified successes at best in any case. For the banking world's track record of joint ventures involving new technology is not that great. There are three platforms of note that banks have set up in the past: EBS, Liberty Brokerage, and TradeWeb. All have been perceived as nothing more than facilitators and cost-saving mechanisms by the member banks, if not by their separately appointed CEOs.</p><p>Liberty has effectively closed up shop, having decided in the autumn to shut down its attempt at an electronic brokerage and use Garban's instead. EBS's CEO, Peter Bartko, has found his attempts to break into swaps and FRAs for the inter-dealer market vetoed by one or more board member. Any hopes to break into the broker-customer camp may be in vain. TradeWeb, though a success now, will find its plans for expansion difficult to get past a seven-member board that has already made a series of conflicting investments in newer consortia, pre-empting CEO Jim Toffeys moves.</p><p>TradeWeb's trials are detailed below. Meanwhile anyone tempted to claim that over the past 12 months bankers have demonstrated that they get the net and are ready to embrace open architecture platforms that e-commerce creates need only look back to the other two businesses.</p><p>Were bankers truly willing to embrace technology, much more would have been made of Liberty and EBS. Brokertec, for example, which went live trading US government securities on the inter-dealer market in the summer, really should not have been necessary, as it does exactly what Liberty was intended to do.</p><p>As for EBS, if Bartko had got his way there would have been no need for FXall and Atriax to exist. He would have long since expanded his business from inter-dealer forex marketmaking and into dealing with the end client. EBS, which stands for electronic broking system, has the liquidity to do so, but lacked the institutional willpower. What's more, the power of the CEO was emasculated by the governance structure, which somehow managed to model itself on the UN Security Council since any one member (of 15 on EBS) could veto a project. Instead, two competing sets of banks, representatives of most of which sit on the board of EBS, are now pouring roughly $too million each into developing two new platforms that won't be up and running until the middle of next year.</p><p>Commitment, an efficient governance structure, and some might say effective management were all lacking to a greater or lesser degree in both. Mix that with most bankers' inbred desire to retain as much control as possible and the likelihood of building a successful jointly-owned business diminishes rapidly.</p><p>And that accounts just for comparatively simple inter-dealer platforms where the initial emphasis is on cost savings. Little was learnt from these earlier forays. Brokertec, for example, although now going strong, initially set up a cumbersome management structure where each shareholder has a vote. There are 12 banks on the board, from Europe and the US, and just getting them together to discuss matters has proved problematic, and was one of the reason why its launch was delayed for some months beyond initial projections. As an indication of how protracted Brokertec's development has been, says one insider, the legal bills \"equal the GDP of a small country\".</p><p>The big theme of zooo has been how to extend inter-dealer coverage to the end user, which for consortia sites usually means to the institutional buy side. The reason why consortium sites are being attempted now is not because the banks want to launch them, nor because they have learnt wisely from their forays with inter-dealer consortia, but because clients have demanded it.</p><p>But before the myth develops, let's scotch any idea that these sites provide a great example of banks listening to clients and responding to their needs - for a certain degree of self-congratulation does creep in here.</p><p>It was only a year ago that investment bankers were fretting about whether their businesses would be amazoned - a reference to the startling success of online books vendor Amazon.com in stealing a march in service and cost over incumbent bricks-and-mortar rivals such as Barnes &amp; Noble.</p><p>Now, after the big tech and internet stock shakeout on the stock markets, and the failure of dozens of previously lauded start-ups, the old-economy leaders have struck back, whether in books, airlines or finance. And that has created a greater sense of security than was present in 1999.</p><p>Clients want e-capability</p><p>For all that, banks cannot ignore the internet challenge. First, some of the bigger and more aggressive clients have been demanding electronic multi-bank research, pricing, execution and settlement for some time now. When State Street started letting other banks onto its FX Connect platform in March it was after nearly two years' growing client pressure.</p><p>Bank of New York can claim an even earlier genesis. \"When we first began to devise IFX Manager three years ago,\" says head of eforeign exchange Richard Estes, \"we knew it had to be a multi-bank-capable system or else clients wouldn't want to use it in the long term.\" Even then, though, it was only in early 2000 that Bank of New York started to explore opening up that facet of the platform.</p><p>Jim Toffey, TradeWeb's CEO, was presenting his multi-bank idea for US treasuries trading to his bosses at CSFB back in 1996. And in the early 1990s there were two attempts to create multi-bank bond systems: one by JP Morgan that was ditched following a concerted effort to ignore it by rivals, and one independent company called InterVest, which ended up suing some of the big brokers for actively undermining its business.</p><p>That puts the lie to the claim of many bankers that the technology wasn't there until recently for such multibank systems. There is nothing overly complicated in TradeWeb's system, for example. It uses bog-standard mid1990s' technology from CSFB, souped-up occasionally to keep it current.</p><p>Competitive juices are easily stirred among the leading banks now professing their keenness to be partners. Let's not forget that these are the same banks that were frantically rushing around at the start of the year to compete with Goldman Sach's WebET system for issuing and trading bonds, at the time thought to be streets ahead of everyone else. There followed a massive smoke-and-mirrors exercise by all concerned, with almost all the orders logged as e-orders actually being taken over the phone and inputted online by sales staff. Only some were better at the game than others.</p><p>It's little different at the end of the year. Gain Capital, for example, is an online independent forex provider in the retail and small institutional market. It aggregates all its orders into larger chunks to send to one or more of its six big market-makers, three of them among the top-five investment banks, according to CEO and founder Mark Galant. Only two of them can handle orders over the internet. The other four do business with Gain over the phone.</p><p>The generally ill-prepared state of banks' proprietary systems and the evidence of institutional stubbornness and inertia throughout the 1990s are more than enough proof that banks are hardly hellbent on driving change for the sheer intellectual rigour of it all.</p><p>As one head of e-commerce at a US investment bank puts it: \"Do we all wish the internet never happened? Well of course we do. The old way of doing business, if inefficient at times, is a cosy world that many of us have done well in. But it has happened, and we have to make sure we keep on top of it.\"</p><p>There are various reasons why banks are now deciding to instigate or join consortium platforms. On the one hand, there is the natural extension of the inter-dealer market platform - a desire to cut costs, whether on sales staff, office space, technology, back-office processing - usually a mixture of all these.</p><p>There is also the defensive aspect. In i999 the fear of being amazoned ran deep. Rather than wait around for it to be done to them, the bankers went out to find ways of doing it to themselves.</p><p>But fear runs deeper than just that with bankers. There is also the fear of being left out of any new venture set up by rivals. Better to pay up for a seat at the table than to sit by and watch as your business model is destroyed by a new entity you have not even got a stake in.</p><p>Sometimes a bank will describe its investments in certain vehicles as a hedge - as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch did in 1999 when they rapidly invested in several competing electronic commission networks. These ECNs had rapidly won over 30% of the trading volume on Nasdaq, and were setting their sights on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Then there are the more subversive reasons for investing.</p><p>One is to get a better look at someone else's technology, either to copy it or reassure oneself that one's own technology is superior, or at least up to scratch. The CEO of one US equity market start-up was concerned that this was exactly the motive that prompted one of the major investment banks to ring him up and ask for a demo. \"They have been banging on about the superiority of their technology for much of the last two years,\" the CEO told Euromoney in early autumn. \"Yet now they want to come and look at ours. I'm deeply suspicious about their motives.\" In the end he turned them down.</p><p>Investment as sabotage?</p><p>Another is much more scandalous: investing in e-finance start-ups as a way of trying to ensure their failure. Rumours circulate all the time about banks that might be up to this, and the big US banks are often at the top of the list. Perhaps the suspicion follows from the sheer number of consortia that they have invested in. Mnuchin at Goldman Sachs, when we tell him that his firm gets mentioned more than any in this regard, says: \"That is absolutely not the case. Our investments are based on the merits of the business opportunity with the goal of enhancing the services we provide our clients.\"</p><p>Perhaps that is the case. But the treasurer of one of the largest capital markets issuers and traders told Euromoney in the summer that this was his conclusion after pushing banks to progress more quickly with consortia derivatives platforms. Certain banks, he insisted, had joined these platforms with a view to slowing down their development so as to protect margins in their established businesses for a little longer.</p><p>It's the kind of claim that keeps a conspiracy theorist alive, although rather more difficult to prove. One e-commerce banker in Europe actually thinks that far from being the ones to scupper consortia, Goldman, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are more dangerous as the drivers. \"They know exactly what they want, and they push hard for it. And more fool you if you let them.\"</p><p>The flipside is that there are also banks and bankers who don't know what they're doing. \"I've sat in on some of these initial discussions, and I've come away with the distinct impression that some people are there who don't know what they want,\" says one e-banker.</p><p>A more subtle twist is that the downside to the banks is limited to the investments they've made. If an entity such as BondBook or Market Axess were to fail, at least the brokers involved could tell their clients, those who have for years been urging them to offer such a service, that they gave it their best shot. \"We might lose the money,\" says one e-commerce head. \"But we still have the old way of doing business, which can be extremely lucrative in part because of its inefficiency.\"</p><p>But it is virtually impossible to discern whether a firm or group of firms belongs to the camp of those really trying to drive markets forward or to those trying to slow down new developments or, more simply, are reacting out of fear.</p><p>BondClick and SwapsWire could easily fall into this latter category. Both belong to what one e-commerce banker dubs \"management by committee\".</p><p>Announced in January 2000, BondClick was touted as the Europeans' answer to TradeWeb, the multi-bank electronic system that is successfully winning business in trading US government bonds, and was known to be looking at expanding across the pond. Six banks, all European bar JP Morgan (which was not involved in TradeWeb), invested in BondClick and gained seats on the board.</p><p>For four months, nothing happened. All that sat on the internet site was the initial press release. In April, its future was so unclear that when Euromoney spoke to two board members, one said they were about to announce a CEO, which surprised the other one, who had no idea what was going on.</p><p>The first banker was right. In May the firm announced that Eloi Duverger, the JP Morgan government bond trader who represented JP Morgan on the fledgling board, would become CEO. Talking about the period before he took on the role, Duverger admits that \"it was not the easiest period. But it's very difficult to make headway without dedicated resources.\" And it wasn't just a lack of resources, but also a lack of commitment on the part of the member banks that held progress back. \"Some of the banks were sceptical to start with,\" Duverger says. \"Yes, they were shareholders, but they were also competitors, and it took some time for all of them to get comfortable with that notion. And each had a different agenda. Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan were the driving force behind it, while others were not always so sure.\"</p><p>As for SwapsWire, since its announcement. all that has happened is that the founder members have been besieged by calls from competitors, angry at being left out of the process, forcing a slew of announcements on yet another bank joining the consortium.</p><p>The initial troubles at these two consortia smack more of inertia caused by inadequate management than of a concerted attempt to scuttle a new business.</p><p>Where the sabotage theory may be more valid is with the ECNs in the US. Again it arises from banks investing in several similar entities. How can an investment bank be expected to commit the proper time, resources and order flow to a new venture if it is also an investor in three of its major competitors?</p><p>David and Goliath</p><p>At the end of November, one of the large foreign exchange users made an announcement that left many in the market utterly shocked. Energy multinational RoyalDutch/Shell had decided to invest $11.5 million in Currenex, an independent trading platform.</p><p>The week before, several board members of the two bank consortia FXall and Atriax were bordering on the smug when discussing Currenex's prospects now that the big banks had jumped into the breach. \"You've got to question their business prospects now that we're out with our plans,\" was the common refrain. One banker said: \"Clients want liquidity, and that's what we provide. Independent platforms like Currenex are going to have a rough time of it.\" Another commented: \"I only ever hear about Currenex from journalfists, not from my clients.\"</p><p>Battle will soon be joined between banksponsored platforms - both multibank and single bank - and independent platforms.</p><p>It seems likely that independent platforms will struggle to succeed. Blackbird, an electronic swaps broker, and high-yield platforms Limitrader and Trading Edge have seen only small business flow, despite being two or three years ahead of the major banks. Likewise some of the other non-bank bond trading platforms have failed to take off.</p><p>But there are reasons for that, aside from independence issues. \"A lot of them simply didn't have the right models to start with,\" says Justin Bull, head of e-commerce at Barclays Capital. \"Trading platforms for illiquid bonds, for example, are systems ahead of their time as far as many investors are concerned.\" A terrible market for high-yield paper doesn't help much either.</p><p>As for Blackbird, says Simon Lack, Chase's e-commerce head and formerly the bank's head of swaps trading: \"It is a great system and fun to trade on. But swaps is already such a competitive market that those of us already in it saw no reason to let in yet another broker to take business away from us.\"</p><p>And there are other developments that appear to call into question the prospects for neutral systems. The most obvious is the appearance of several big initiatives in the foreign exchange and credit markets that are run exclusively by member banks: FXall, Market Axess, BondBook, BondClick and to a lesser extent Atriax. With each announcement comes an extra concession by multi-bank platforms to their customers. Market Axess was the first non-treasuries platform to offer joint pricing. FXall announced a plan to have a sellside advisory board; as did BondBook. BondBook also offers anonymous pricing, something that hands back to the market one of the banks' biggest advantages: knowledge of market flow, and the ability to trade off it.</p><p>BondClick, once it finally got started, made rapid progress, and is getting good feedback for spending more time with potential clients asking what they want and how they want it delivered.</p><p>But only Atriax has an independent CEO, Dan Morehead, formerly CFO at Tiger Asset Management, although one of the reasons he got the job was because of his experience in forex at Deutsche Bank, a founding partner, where he had impressed the investment bank's head, Edson Mitchell.</p><p>Consortium sites are increasingly keen to show some aspect of independence from the banks and an inclusion of end customers. But their board members are all from the member banks, which own the vast majority of the equity (some is left over for the staff, but not a huge amount).</p><p>There is some justification for leaving buyside clients off the board, as BondBook's coCEO, James Pellicane, explains. \"It is politically much more of a minefield choosing a few buy-side participators. There are so many of them, and so many different strategies. And it's sometimes more difficult for buy-side firms, in their role as fiduciaries, to participate as equity stakeholders.\"</p><p>The end of independence</p><p>It's all a far cry from the heady days of 1999 when banks were simply happy to own a stake - any stake - in anything that might conceivably threaten their business. It even carried over into 2000. But with each successive new announcement of a multi-bank platform, the arguments of the independents that they should be preferred by end customers have sounded weaker. \"Anyone preaching independence as a virtue now is doing so more out of necessity that anything else,\" says one banker.</p><p>In their search for liquidity, greater market recognition, and possibly because they, too, feared losing out to the march of the brokers, several of the independent platforms began to court, and take, investments from the established players.</p><p>Equavant, for example, entered into a partnership with FleetBoston in October to develop its bank loan trading system. Currenex allowed Barclays Capital to come on board that same month. In November 1999, Jeffries took a stake in Limitrader, CSFB in Trading Edge, and Chase in CreditTrade.</p><p>Of all of them, Equavant has undergone the biggest change in its approach to its equity and governance structure. It was set up towards the end of 1999, originally called ereorg, by Ronald DeKoven, a goodhumoured lawyer who spent much of his career advising on many of the world's major debt default negotiations.</p><p>His idea was to set up an internet platform to trade distressed debt and bank debt, and the plan from the start was to run it as a wholly independent platform. When Euromoney first visited his office in November 1999 he had just taken a call from one of the top five US commercial banks looking to buy a stake. He turned them down flat.</p><p>But by May he had resigned as CEO, with the rumour being that his approach had so alienated the banks that they refused to cooperate at all. He still remains as chairman, though, and retains a seat on the board.</p><p>Phil Andr yc, president since January, took over as CEO. This former chief technology officer at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter commands a good deal of respect in the markets. And he has adopted a more inclusive approach to building the business than his predecessor. \"The idea that if you build it they will come has evolved into a recognition that while it's all well and good to build it, you need to get flow onto the system. And to get that means partnering with and giving equity stakes to the liquidity providers.\"</p><p>Thus far, though, just one bank has signed up, FleetBoston, in October, at the same time as ereorg changed its name to Equavant. As well as developing the bank debt trading platform, Fleet is also advising on Equavant's plans to set up a primary loan system as well.</p><p>But having just one bank invested in an independent platform is hardly ideal, as it leaves you open to the charge of being in that institution's pocket. It's a dilemma Simon Lack, Chase's e-commerce head, pondered before investing his firm's money in CreditTrade. \"Yes, I was concerned that we would be the only bank on the platform, but we had studied the options and decided that CreditTrade offered us the best model. While more banks would have been preferable, we only have one board seat, and they don't need to rely solely on us for liquidity since they acquired the Prebon Yamane credit derivatives brokers.\"</p><p>Liquidity isn't an issue for Equavant yet as it has not started to trade. But Andryc is sensitive to the situation. \"Our vision is to have between four and six partners. And Fleet has made it very clear that whoever joins does so on a wholly equal basis.\"</p><p>For now, though, Fleet is there on its own, and that has got observers talking. Rumour has it that Andryc has been looking for other partners without success. That could be because banks are still reacting against DeKoven's earlier intransigence, or because the banks are not so keen on the platform as it stands. \"An online auction-based model for distressed debt works just fine,\" says one banker. \"It's simply transferring the phone model onto the web. But loan trading doesn't operate that way.\"</p><p>That, surely, would be an argument for getting in now, early, while the model is being developed and while the valuation is low.</p><p>In any event, all Fleet has so far is an equity stake and two seats on the fledgling advisory board. Even with another five banks as partners, says Andryc, \"we will maintain the majority holding and the majority of seats on the executive committee\". At present Fleet has no seats on the executive board. They belong to Andryc, DeKoven and another employee, two venture capitalists from backers Warburg Pinkus, and two for the angel investors. Any changes will still leave banks in the minority. \"We all agree the last thing we need is a UNstyle board where nothing gets done,\" says Andryc. \"So although we will allow them onto the board in due course, they will be in the minority. And their seats will come from a mixture of vacancies as the angel investors pull out, and expanding the overall number.\" And what if there are more banks than seats? \"We've been pondering rotating the bankassigned seat.\"</p><p>Another start-up that is feeling the need to adapt is Creditex, which was founded in April 1999 as an online credit derivatives trading market by co-CEOs John McEvoy and Sunil Hirani after they left Deutsche Bank. Creditex is the only purely electronic credit derivatives platform in the market, and to date over $1.5 billion in notional volume has been traded since it went live in March.</p><p>Creditex is neither a full multi-bank platform nor entirely independent but a hybrid. It has some big banks as investors, including JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank, its first two strategic investors, and it has other, non-bank, end-users with stakes as well, something none of the pure multi-banks have ventured to do.</p><p>But the founders have retained a majority stake for themselves. Although coy about the exact details of their board, they do say that their main concern was to keep it small - so most investors are pure equity holders and not board members.</p><p>Theoretically, it is the ideal mix: an independent management team with a big stake in the company as an incentive on the one hand, and on the other a good crop of the major liquidity providers in the market.</p><p>So it might come as a surprise to learn that McEvoy and Hirani are setting up a sister company, an online secondary loan-trading platform. Not only is it to be a separate company, but they are also giving the banks as a group a 51% stake. Why are they giving up what appeared to be one of their main advantages? Because the banking empire is striking back. \"We have four of the six largest loan traders invested in Creditex, so we could have kept it as one company,\" says McEvoy. \"But banks want the valuation associated with just one product on each platform at a time. And the environment is nothing like as favourable to start-ups as it was last year. Banks don't feel anywhere near as threatened by them, so feel they have a stronger hand to play.\"</p><p>A corporate fan club</p><p>Yet just as the advantage appeared to be shifting back to the banks, along comes Shell with its investment in Currenex. They are at pains to point out that it is not an exclusive arrangement, and that there is nothing to stop them using FXall or Atriax, but they chose to invest in Currenex after studying the market options for nearly 12 months.</p><p>The independent platform appears to appeal especially to corporates - MasterCard is another fan of Currenex - and it was pressure from such clients that persuaded Barclays Capital to invest as well - at the time taken as yet another slap in the face for independence. \"Our clients wanted us to join, pure and simple,\" says Bull at Barclays Capital. \"About half a dozen told us that they liked the site, and liked its independence and wanted us to put our prices on it.\"</p><p>With Shell and Barclays, Currenex is the only platform to have both buy and sell side in equal measure - not the greatest boast when there's just one from each side - but it is a balance the company's CEO, Lori Mirek, has been striving hard to keep. \"There were no problems from other banks in having just Barclays join,\" she says. \"We've made it very dear to all of them from the start that we want all of them to take part in some form or other. And we're being very careful to keep the platform wholly independent. Neither buy nor sell side can get more than a io% stake in total, and we're not giving them a seat on the board.\"</p><p>If that seems reckless, given what fellow in independent platforms have gone through, there are a few points to remember in Currenex's favour. It is already up and running, and has liquidity. The leading forex banks have invested in their own consortia. But clients like the independence of Currenex, which is why they use it. If players like MasterCard, Shell and the Inter-American Development Bank decide they want to use such a platform, the banks will sit up and listen. Who do you want to use them?</p><p>It sounds like a naive question, but there really is no consensus on who exactly is being targeted by some of these platforms. Euromoney asked a board member of one of the forex consortia which customers his bank wanted to target through the platform. Rather shockingly, there was silence, followed by some mumbling about corporates and fund. managers.</p><p>Another member of the same platform also found it shocking. \"We've all submitted names to the CEO, so we all ought to know who we're targeting.\"</p><p>But there's disagreement on who will do the marketing of the platform. Some feel that the consortium won't be hiring enough marketing staff so the banks will do it for them, yet others say that this would present too much of a conflict as the new business develops, and in any case would be counterproductive for the consortium not to do it.</p><p>A common line is</p><p>that these platforms are being developed as a response to client demand, that the big funds want to see commingled prices. That may be true. But do banks really want to see their biggest clients move that way?</p><p>\"This is a very highcontact business,\" says an e-commerce representative from one of the major investment banks. \"And bankers want to keep those relationships. If they start going electronic, there's a bigger chance of losing them. Basically, online platforms, for now at least, are largely designed to deal with the smaller clients who you never cared about before. If you can get 95% of them online, you're providing them with a better service than they had before, and you rid yourself of an uneconomic irritation. If mid-sized clients go on, it's a help, but some of those are your next big clients, so you don't want them all to go electronic.</p><p>\"As for the top clients, they're the last people you want to get online as they pay most of your bonuses. If they want to buy a stock on the New York Stock Exchange and want to go there in person on an elephant with the queen of Sheba, you'll do it for them. Internet trading's good for about 5% of their orders - the small, easy tickets. The rest you really want to be doing person to person.\"</p><p>In the end it is what investors choose to do that will resolve many of the issues that are plaguing the development of the independent, proprietary and multi-bank platforms. Thus far they don't seem to care all that much. Average trade sizes on TradeWeb, for example, are below the average for the treasuries market.</p><p>Large investors have little incentive at the moment. First and foremost because most still haven't launched, but also because they are being bombarded with information about over izo platforms, if not more.</p><p>Most will only tackle one part of what an investor needs, which is usually the ability to see prices from several banks and then trade off it, completely ignoring the fact that most investors rarely trade in such a void.</p><p>And while each platforms members struggle to find the right partners, the right strategy and the right technology, the investors can sit back and watch, continuing to do business the old-fashioned way. Once the mergers between platforms begin, and succeed, and once most are operational, investors will start looking more seriously at which might benefit them.

Worse, though, is when a platform seems to be biting the hands that feed it. In the end it is what investors choose to do that will resolve many of the issues that are plaguing the development of the independent proprietary and multi-bank platforms.

Is it, asks Euromoney, because you just can't rely on bankers from rival institutions to trust each other enough to get the job done? Because the egos on the board are just too large to allow for effective decision-making? Because there are too many disagreements?</p><section sectionType=\"sidebar\"><heading><title>SIDEBAR</title></heading><bodyText><p>Could TradeWeb unravel from inside?</p><p>Jim Toffey takes a seat in the conference room of his 5ist floor offices in the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan. His composed manner is the result of increasingly broad recognition that he has helped build what is thus far the only successful multi-bank broker-- to-client trading consortium. Back in the mid-igos he and Lee Olesky, now Europe CEO of Brokertec, persuaded their employer, Credit Suisse First Boston, to allow them to set up an electronic platform to trade US government bonds.</p><p>Four years on, he holds success in his hands, and has done so by staying focused and by including several of the big Wall Street firms in his plans as equity owners and board members. By his own admission, there was also a bit of luck. His business now accounts for over 12% of volume of all US treasuries traded in the secondary market.</p><p>He's now expanding into agency bonds, and plans to get into municipal bonds and other liquid credits soon thereafter, including European government bonds. Few would doubt his success, and yet there are few who relish his position.</p><p>For Toffey's TradeWeb now faces its first major challenges as a going concern. And those challenges are going to come from the very firms he has sitting on his board vetting his every move. As much as it has been the bellwether for the rise and rise of institutional electronic trading, so it may well now become the textbook case on the politics of multi-bank consortia.</p><p>Back in May the firm was advertising for a foreign exchange product development manager. On the face of it, this was a nobrainer, as any attempt to trade government bonds outside of the US would require some form of forex service. \"Investors are portfolio buyers, not just players in the treasuries market,\" says Toffey. \"They might trade mortgage bonds or agencies against them, as well as European government bonds.\" Services such as forex and swaps are crucial to a company trying to service all those needs.</p><p>But something happened the week the advert started running: FXall was announced, a dedicated foreign exchange trading platform set up by seven leading players. Three of them sat on TradeWeb's board: CSFB, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. One other board member, SalomonSmith Barney, a division of forex giant Citigroup, was notable by its absence, as was Deutsche Bank, at that time just a provider of prices to TradeWeb but soon promoted to be the seventh board member. In October, these two partnered with Chase Manhattan and Reuters to form a rival to FXall called</p><p>Atriax.</p><p>Five of TradeWeb's seven board members and investors thus belong to two separate online forex trading platforms, to which they have contributed a significant deal of cash and resources. Toffey does not regard it as a problem. \"We can build our own forex service as a complement to our core business. There's no need for us to have to go to another consortium for it.\" But how likely is it that they will be prepared to allow Toffey to develop a rival service for a sub-set of clients using their money?</p><p>The second, and arguably greater, challenge arrived just a couple of weeks after FXall. Another group of TradeWeb's shareholders, this time Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, announced their intention to build a non-treasuries bond trading platform, BondBook, which they hoped would to all intents and purposes become a bond exchange. Initially it will accommodate trading in US corporate and municipal bonds.</p><p>At first sight it doesn't appear to be a threat, TradeWeb deals in government securities, while BondBook plans to create a market place for less liquid bonds. Investors don't all make the same distinction, however; many will use treasuries or agencies as a hedge against corporate bonds, or want to sell out of the latter into treasuries when markets get rocky. At present they can do all that through a phone call or two to their chosen bank. Doing it on two separate platforms would be cumbersome, slow, and potentially costly. That's what initially drove the failed merger talks between BondClick and Market Axess.</p><p>TradeWeb is also the litmus test for one of the other big questions being asked at present. Are these bank consortia for-profit organizations or just utilities? With the collapse of the internet boom, that issue has been debated more than it was when many were first planned.</p><p>Only one of them is definitely one or the other, TheMarkets.com. It's a portal for distributing US equities research, and contains most of the usual suspects as partners. Research, of course, is basically free for most investors, so any thought of TheMarkets.com trying to turn a profit would be misplaced.</p><p>As for the others, few know the answer, although some think they do. \"We are definitely a for-profit company,\" says Toffey. \"It's not a question of either planning an IPO exit or being a utility. We are a for-profit independent private company.\" For-profit companies, quoted or private, are supposed to grow earnings, either by</p><p>increasing margin or volumes. What happens when your competitors for market share own you?</p><p>You hear a different line to Toffey's from the banks that sit on the TradeWeb board. They view it as a fantastic way to cut costs and maybe reach a few more clients. \"TradeWeb's success is a result of having a trading model which is based on the standard way of buying treasuries, and using technology to allow several dealers to quote at once,\" says Ben Wolkowitz, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's head of fixed-income e-commerce. \"It expedited the process for a highly commoditized market, helping to cut costs, increase competition and as a result improve service to the clients.\"</p><p>That would seem to imply a utility. And in the end, no matter what Toffey says, ultimately TradeWeb is only as independent as the seven banks want it to be. And all of them have invested in other models: five are in BondBook (Deutsche, Goldman, Merrill, Morgan Stanley, Salomon) and the other two, CSFB and Lehman, are in Market Axess. And most are also in one of the two forex platforms.</p><p>That limits Toffey's scope for expansion</p><p>considerably, effectively to the highly liquid commoditized markets where spreads are thin: the charge for trading treasuries is down to as low as $5 per $1 million. It does charge the seven non-board member banks to list prices - somewhere between $1.5 million and $2 million is the entry fee per year - but combined these two revenue streams leave little to invest with.</p><p>Whether a BondBook or Market Axess turns a tidy profit is not clear either, but both state that they are for-profit models. \"We have a very interesting economic model here,\" says James Pellicane, coCEO of BondBook, intimating that there isa good chance for it to make good money, although he usually tries to deflect attention away from the potential for profit. \"We're trying to address the</p><p>fundamental problems which the bond markets suffer from, such as illiquidity, decentralization and very little price transparency.</p><p>\"This is a market structure play. That's where the real benefits to the market makers come from - increasing liquidity, improving straight-through processing and clearing. I doubt the potential contained in the equity stake is foremost in our investors' minds.\"</p><p>Perhaps for those sitting on the board already, but for those that do not have a stake there is real concern. \"Having a stake in BondBook or Market Axess is a way of replacing money which we made on market making but which will be lost once it goes electronic,\" explains one head of investment banking e-commerce at a US investment bank. \"That's why we run them as for-profit businesses. But if an anonymous platform such as Bond$ook succeeds, it will kill market-making profits for everyone. So if you're not an equity holder, you lose revenues and you get no compensation for it.\" That might explain the strange tactic of launching with three banks only, and then adding first Salomon and then Deutsche two and four months</p><p>later. Salomon especially was rumoured to be very annoyed at being left out of the discussions leading up to the launch, and pushed hard, and successfully, to be let in. Deutsche's admittance was no doubt held up by its earlier investment in rival platform Market Access.</p><p>It's not clear that a for-profit model can be maintained on any of the dealing platforms set up by the banks, or by the independents. \"It's somewhat naive to assume that there's a lot of upside in having an equity capital stake in these platforms,\" says Justin Bull, head of ecommerce at Barclays Capital. \"If the technology really does have the ability to make it an open platform, any liquidity provider can be plugged in, then as traffic increases, the costs investors pay go down, and the value of the equity stake is small if anything at all.\"</p></bodyText></section><p>\"That's certainly part of it\" he replies. \"Although often we don't even get that far. Just getting us all together in one place is tough enough.\" Once that happens, the negotiations start: who's in, who's out, what exactly is the aim, who sits on the board, who runs it, what sort of oversight committee is there, who talks to clients, who decides on strategy. That's when things start to fall apart. \"You start off with mutual suspicion,\" continues the banker. \"You are all competitors after all. We spend an inordinate amount of time getting over those hurdles, and you can't help but walk away with the feeling that some of these people actually don't want to achieve much at all.\"</p><p>Welcome to the wonderful world of web consortia, a world that has come to dominate investment-banking strategy over the past year. It's been driven by a desire to offer clients what some have been demanding for several years now: quotes from several banks displayed in one place. But don't be fooled into thinking that these consortia are serving clients' needs. Instead, they are artificial constructs focused on single products, which is hardly how their clients operate. For example, credit market platforms can trade either government bonds or corporate bonds, but never both, despite the fact that when an investor buys a corporate bond he will also more often than not be selling government bonds, and vice versa.</p><p>Focus is the excuse given: better to get one product right than several products wrong. In reality, the platforms are managed for the benefit of their founding banks. The trouble is that lots of banks in one room means lots of politics. This is making the consortia hostages to the shareholder structures and governance nightmares that the banks have imposed on them. And that has already caused one merger between two such platforms to fall through.</p><p>Market Axess and BondClick were trying to tie the knot over the summer. A merger would have joined a price give-up model for US and European corporate bonds with the nascent European government bond trading answer to TradeWeb.</p><p>Why did it fail? \"You get into really ridiculous arguments over valuations and relative shareholder stakes over two companies that don't even really exist yet,\" says an ecommerce banker who is on the board of one of the companies. \"You start to protect shareholders rather than develop the business.\"</p><p>There might also have been issues with some rather intriguing power play tactics from Deutsche Bank. Having helped to set up BondClick last January and joined the board of Market Axess in the spring, Deutsche suddenly turned up in late summer first as the newest board member on TradeWeb and then in October as the fifth founding member of BondBook, the anonymous would-be bond exchange set up by Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in June, with SalomonSmith Barney joining in August. (Deutsche is the only non-US bank on either platform.)</p><p>Whether it was simply a case of Deutsche hedging its bets, or trying to use its investments to force itself into a position of power to drive through its own agenda is a moot point. Clearly, though, a combined Market Axess-BondClick board would not have been amused at seeing one of its apparently biggest supporters also hobnobbing with the competition. Either way, the interests of the end user were clearly not central to discussions.</p><p>Estimates from those setting them up put the money being spent on these platforms at $75 million to $250 million per consortium and there are dozens and dozens of them.</p><p>What's more, they tie up more staff and resources than many had expected. Bankers are already beginning to talk about finite resources and the possibility of cutting back on commitments to many more new ventures. And yet most sites announced are focused on single products and are heavily concentrated in the US; so to some it feels as if the surface of possibilities has hardly been scratched.</p><p>So pervasive and so high profile have these consortia become that at the end of November the US Department of Justice anti-trust division sent civil investigative demands to five multi-bank platforms - BondBook, Market Axess, Bond Desk, FXall and Atriax, as well as to most of the member firms.</p><p>We shouldn't be expecting a Microsoft-style anti-trust lawsuit just yet, though. For a start, none of the platforms is trading significant volumes, if any at all, so it's impossible for them to be anti-competitive.</p><p>Avoiding unpleasant surprises</p><p>It does, thought signal the DoJ's concern that technology is changing the way banks think about operating so much that they have to investigate further to satisfy themselves that there are no anti-competitive surprises to be found later on, intentional or otherwise. The consortia say there aren't, indeed that their business plans would fail if there were. But regulators can't take that at face value.</p><p>And the banks and consortia themselves have given more than enough reason for concern. Just a year ago, most were floundering for an internet strategy. Today they still are, but feel surer of their ground - in 2ooo the empire struck back. And they have been using a powerful weapon: liquidity.</p><p>Markets can't function without it, and the investment banks have done a good job trying to convince us that they are the only ones that can provide it on any meaningful basis.</p><p>So well have they done this that the liquidity issue has become the battleground for the debate between bank-run and independent platforms. And the banks are prepared to defend their turf aggressively. \"This is a business we developed,\" says Ben Wolkowitz, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's head of e-fixed income. \"That a third party should be able to tell us what to do with our clients makes us all very uncomfortable.\"</p><p>There couldn't be a clearer warning signal to the anti-trust lawyers. While it shows that banks are prepared to defend their turf, it raises the very real prospect that their collaborative efforts to do so could be restrictive and anti-competitive.</p><p>Speaking at a recent conference, a lawyer specializing in anti-trust cases sketched the outline in the table above, which he uses as a rule of thumb to determine if and when anticompetitive practices might become an issue. He describes the sixth row as the go-to-jail card, with rows three and onwards demanding some form of regulatory oversight. The examples of bank consortia in the right-hand column have been added by us.</p><p>There are other matters to consider, such as who runs the platform and the role of a buyside advisory board, but it is clear from this that in theory at least all the major bank-run consortia need to make a convincing case to the Department of justice.</p><p>What officials from the DoJ must bear in mind, though, is that this new-found love of the banks for collaboration was anathema a year ago. As Lars Olesen, Citigroup's head of e-forex, says about his involvement with Atriax: \"If I had spent this much time with my competitors last year, I'd have been sacked.\" It's easy to attach conspiracy theories to banks' plans, but looks can be deceiving. The rush to announce consortia indicates that banks' priorities appear to be that they should be seen to be taking part, to be parting with cash to buy in to any number of multi-bank and non-bank platforms. It's the easiest way to show that you are keeping up with change and not being left behind by new technology.</p><p>But the reality of working as part of a multi-bank platform is very different, and certainly far removed from the way investment bankers usually operate. That is in silos within their own organizations, as political operators conditioned to protect their turf both internally and externally, and with long-term considerations entirely subordinate to getting the next deal done and the bonus increased.</p><p>So when these same bankers start to spend a greater proportion of their time concentrating on longer-term strategies, and doing so in collaboration with fierce rivals, it's scarcely surprising that things don't run smoothly.</p><p>There are now dozens of internet trading systems and research sites being set up by two or more banks, and though it is true that a lot of clients have been demanding these commingled offerings, it's a different matter entirely to make them a success.</p><p>Not that you'll find many willing to admit there are serious issues. \"When firms enter into multi-bank joint ventures,\" says Steve Mnuchin, managing director and head of ecommerce at Goldman Sachs. \"they do so as partners who work together towards the success of the enterprise.\" It's a fantastic ideal to hold dear, but experience shows it's not realistic for any protracted period of time.</p><p>Ben Cohen, head of e-commerce fixed income at CSFB, says: \"The really crucial part of any such venture is in getting the first to% to 15% decided upon.\" Effectively that includes initial governance structures and exact business strategy. There then follows a relatively calm period of building and executing, when Mnuchins partnership comment largely holds true. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's head of fixed-income e-commerce, Ben Wolkowitz, describes this as a \"fairly protracted period of good faith and cordial professional negotiation where the various owners have got over their initial caution and reserve\". In other words, the platform runs at its smoothest when it is in execution mode and requires little or no input or decisions from the board members.</p><p>Before and after this period of relative indo- II lence, though, such ventures require longterm planning and near-total mutual openness with partners that are typically close competitors. No amount of roles as joint lead manager on a deal is going to prepare you for that. In short, it's anathema to the archetypal banker.</p><p>Dan Marowitz, chief operating officer of Deutsche Bank's e-GCI division, is one of the few who is more open about the challenges facing the banks. \"E-commerce goes against the grain of what bankers do for a living. It requires them extensively to reshape the way they think about how they do business.\" His perspective is definitely atypical, but then so is his background. He joined e-GCI last February, and it is his first banking job. Before that he worked at iVillage and before that at Dow Jones. \"I was surprised at how willing many of the bankers are to adapt, but it's not an overnight process,\" he continues.</p><p>Yet some of his counterparts still continue to pretend that matters are otherwise. \"This is not a new development for us investment banks,\" says one e-commerce banker. \"We've all been involved in several projects which have been a success.\" Asked to elaborate, he cannot. Any examples he could have given would have been qualified successes at best in any case.</p><p>For the banking world's track record of joint ventures involving new technology is not that great. There are three platforms of note that banks have set up in the past: EBS, Liberty Brokerage, and TradeWeb. All have been perceived as nothing more than facilitators and cost-saving mechanisms by the member banks, if not by their separately appointed CEOs.</p><p>Liberty has effectively closed up shop, having decided in the autumn to shut down its attempt at an electronic brokerage and use Garban's instead. EBS's CEO, Peter Bartko, has found his attempts to break into swaps and FRAs for the inter-dealer market vetoed by one or more board member. Any hopes to break into the broker-customer camp may be in vain. TradeWeb, though a success now, will find its plans for expansion difficult to get past a seven-member board that has already made a series of conflicting investments in newer consortia, pre-empting CEO Jim Toffey's moves.</p><p>TradeWeb's trials are detailed below. Meanwhile anyone tempted to claim that over the past 12 months bankers have demonstrated that they get the net and are ready to embrace open architecture platforms that e-commerce creates need only look back to the other two businesses.</p><p>Were bankers truly willing to embrace technology, much more would have been made of Liberty and EBS. Brokertec, for example, which went live trading US government securities on the inter-dealer market in the summer, really should not have been necessary, as it does exactly what Liberty was intended to do.</p><p>As for EBS, if Bartko had got his way there would have been no need for FXall and Atriax to exist. He would have long since expanded his business from inter-dealer forex marketmaking and into dealing with the end client. EBS, which stands for electronic broking system, has the liquidity to do so, but lacked the institutional willpower. What's more, the power of the CEO was emasculated by the governance structure, which somehow managed to model itself on the UN Security Council since any one member (of 15 on EBS) could veto a project. Instead, two competing sets of banks, representatives of most of which sit on the board of EBS, are now pouring roughly $100 million each into developing two new platforms that won't be up and running until the middle of this year.</p><p>Commitment, an efficient governance structure, and some might say effective management were all lacking to a greater or lesser degree in both. Mix that with most bankers' inbred desire to retain as much control as possible and the likelihood of building a successful jointly-owned business diminishes rapidly.</p><p>And that accounts just for comparatively simple inter-dealer platforms where the initial emphasis is on cost savings. Little was learnt from these earlier forays. Brokertec, for example, although now going strong, initially set up a cumbersome management structure where each shareholder has a vote. There are ra banks on the board, from Europe and the US, and just getting them together to discuss matters has proved problematic, and was one of the reason why its launch was delayed for some months beyond initial projections. As an indication of how protracted Brokertec's development has been, says one insider, the legal bills \"equal the GDP of a small country\".</p><p>The big theme of 2000 has been how to extend inter-dealer coverage to the end user, which for consortia sites usually means to the institutional buy side. The reason why consortium sites are being attempted now is not because the banks want to launch them, nor because they have learnt wisely from their forays with inter-dealer consortia, but because clients have demanded it.</p><p>But before the myth develops, let's scotch any idea that these sites provide a great example of banks listening to clients and responding to their needs - for a certain degree of self-congratulation does creep in here.</p><p>It was only a year ago that investment bankers were fretting about whether their businesses would be amazoned - a reference to the startling success of online books vendor Amazon.com in stealing a march in service and cost over incumbent bricks-and-mortar rivals such as Barnes &amp; Noble.</p><p>Now, after the big tech and internet stock shakeout on the stock markets, and the failure of dozens of previously lauded start-ups, the old-economy leaders have struck back, whether in books, airlines or finance. And that has created a greater sense of security than was present in 1999. Clients want e-capability</p><p>For all that, banks cannot ignore the internet challenge. First, some of the bigger and more aggressive clients have been demanding electronic multi-bank research, pricing, execution and settlement for some time now. When State Street started letting other banks onto its FX Connect platform in March it was after nearly two years' growing client pressure.</p><p>Bank of New York can claim an even earlier genesis. \"When we first began to devise IFX Manager three years ago,\" says head of e-- foreign exchange Richard Estes, \"we knew it had to be a multi-bank-capable system or else clients wouldn't want to use it in the long term.\" Even then, though, it was only in early 2000 that Bank of New York started to explore opening up that facet of the platform.</p><p>Jim Toffey, TradeWeb's CEO, was presenting his multi-bank idea for US treasuries trading to his bosses at CSFB back in 1996. And in the early 1990s there were two attempts to create multi-bank bond systems: one by JP Morgan that was ditched following a concerted effort to ignore it by rivals, and one independent company called InterVest, which ended up suing some of the big brokers for actively undermining its business.</p><p>That puts the lie to the claim of many bankers that the technology wasn't there until recently for such multibank systems. There is nothing overly complicated in TradeWeb's system, for example. It uses bog-standard mid1990s' technology from CSFB, souped-up occasionally to keep it current.</p><p>Competitive juices are easily stirred among the leading banks now professing their keenness to be partners. Let's not forget that these are the same banks that were frantically rushing around at the start of last year to compete with Goldman Sachs WebET system for issuing and trading bonds, at the time thought to be streets ahead of everyone else. There followed a massive smoke-and-mirrors exercise by all concerned, with almost all the orders logged as e-orders actually being taken over the phone and inputted online by sales staff. Only some were better at the game than others.</p><p>It was a little different at the end of the year. Gain Capital, for example, is an online independent forex provider in the retail and small institutional market. It aggregates all its orders into larger chunks to send to one or more of its six big market-makers, three of them among the top-five investment banks, according to CEO and founder Mark Galant. Only two of them can handle orders over the internet. The other four do business with Gain over the phone.</p><p>The generally ill-prepared state of banks' proprietary systems and the evidence of institutional stubbornness and inertia throughout the 1990s are more than enough proof that banks are hardly hellbent on driving change for the sheer intellectual rigour of it all.</p><p>As one head of e-commerce at a US investment bank puts it: \"Do we all wish the internet never happened? Well of course we do. The old way of doing business, if inefficient at times, is a cosy world that many of us have done well in. But it has happened, and we have to make sure we keep on top of it.\"</p><p>There are various reasons why banks are now deciding to instigate or join consortium platforms. On the one hand, there is the natural extension of the inter-dealer market platform - a desire to cut costs, whether on sales staff, office space, technology, back-office processing - usually a mixture of all these.</p><p>There is also the defensive aspect. In 1999 the fear of being amazoned ran deep. Rather than wait around for it to be done to them, the bankers went out to find ways of doing it to themselves.</p><p>But fear runs deeper than just that with bankers. There is also the fear of being left out of any new venture set up by rivals. Better to pay up for a seat at the table than to sit by and watch as your business model is destroyed by a new entity you have not even got a stake in.</p><p>Sometimes a bank will describe its investments in certain vehicles as a hedge - as Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch did in 1999 when they rapidly invested in several competing electronic commission networks. These ECNs had rapidly won over 30% of the trading volume on Nasdaq, and were setting their sights on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Then there are the more subversive reasons for investing.</p><p>One is to get a better look at someone else's technology, either to copy it or reassure oneself that one's own technology is superior, or at least up to scratch. The CEO of one US equity market start-up was concerned that this was exactly the motive that prompted one of the major investment banks to ring him up and ask for a demo. \"They have been banging on about the superiority of their technology for much of the last two years,\" the CEO told Euromoney in early autumn. \"Yet now they want to come and look at ours. I'm deeply suspicious about their motives.\" In the end he turned them down.</p><p>Investment as sabotage?</p><p>Another is much more scandalous: investing in e-finance start-ups as a way of trying to ensure their failure. Rumours circulate all the time about banks that might be up to this, and the big US banks are often at the top of the list. Perhaps the suspicion follows from the sheer number of consortia that they have invested in. Mnuchin at Goldman Sachs, when we tell him that his firm gets mentioned more than any in this regard, says: \"That is absolutely not the case. Our investments are based on the merits of the business opportunity with the goal of enhancing the services we provide our clients.\"</p><p>Perhaps that is the case. But the treasurer of one of the largest capital markets issuers and traders told Euromoney in the summer that this was his conclusion after pushing banks to progress more quickly with consortia derivatives platforms. Certain banks, he insisted, had joined these platforms with a view to slowing down their development so as to protect margins in their established businesses for a little longer.</p><p>It's the kind of claim that keeps a conspiracy theorist alive, although rather more difficult to prove. One e-commerce banker in Europe actually thinks that far from being the ones to scupper consortia, Goldman, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley are more dangerous as the drivers. \"They know exactly what they want, and they push hard for it. And more fool you if you let them.\"</p><p>The flipside is that there are also banks and bankers who don't know what they're doing. \"I've sat in on some of these initial discussions, and I've come away with the distinct impression that some people are there who don't know what they want,\" says one e-banker.</p><p>A more subtle twist is that the downside to the banks is limited to the investments they've made. If an entity such as BondBook or Market Axess were to fail, at least the brokers involved could tell their clients, those who have for years been urging them to offer such a service, that they gave it their best shot. \"We might lose the money,\" says one e-commerce head. \"But we still have the old way of doing business, which can be extremely lucrative in part because of its inefficiency.\"</p><p>But it is virtually impossible to discern whether a firm or group of firms belongs to the camp of those really trying to drive markets forward or to those trying to slow down new developments or, more simply, are reacting out of fear.</p><p>BondClick and SwapsWire could easily fall into this latter category. Both belong to what one e-commerce banker dubs \"management by committee\".</p><p>Announced in January zooo, BondClick was touted as the Europeans' answer to TradeWeb, the multi-bank electronic system that is successfully winning business in trading US government bonds, and was known to be looking at expanding across the pond. Six banks, all European bar JP Morgan (which was not involved in TradeWeb), invested in BondClick and gained seats on the board.</p><p>For four months, nothing happened. All that sat on the internet site was the initial press release. In April, its future was so unclear that when Euromoney spoke to two board members, one said they were about to announce a CEO, which surprised the other one, who had no idea what was going on.</p><p>The first banker was right. In May the firm announced that Eloi Duverger, the JP Morgan government bond trader who represented JP Morgan on the fledgling board, would become CEO. Talking about the period before he took on the role, Duverger admits that \"it was not the easiest period. But it's very difficult to make headway without dedicated resources.\" And it wasn't just a lack of resources, but also a lack of commitment on the part of the member banks that held progress back. \"Some of the banks were sceptical to start with,\" Duverger says. \"Yes, they were shareholders, but they were also competitors, and it took some time for all of them to get comfortable with that notion. And each had a different agenda. Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan were the driving force behind it, while others were not always so sure.\"</p><p>As for SwapsWire, since its announcement all that has happened is that the founder members have been besieged by calls from competitors, angry at being left out of the process, forcing a slew of announcements on yet another bank joining the consortium.</p><p>The initial troubles at these two consortia smack more of inertia caused by inadequate management than of a concerted attempt to scuttle a new business.</p><p>Where the sabotage theory may be more valid is with the ECNs in the US. Again it arises from banks investing in several similar entities. How can an investment bank be expected to commit the proper time, resources and order flow to a new venture if it is also an investor in three of its major competitors?</p><p>David and Goliath</p><p>At the end of November, one of the large foreign exchange users made an announcement that left many in the market utterly shocked. Energy multinational RoyalDutch/Shell had decided to invest $11.5 million in Currenex, an independent trading platform.</p><p>The week before, several board members of the two bank consortia FXall and Atriax were bordering on the smug when discussing Currenex's prospects now that the big banks had jumped into the breach. \"You've got to question their business prospects now that we're out with our plans,\" was the common refrain. One banker said: \"Clients want liquidity, and that's what we provide. Independent platforms like Currenex are going to have a rough time of it.\" Another commented: \"I only ever hear about Currenex from journalists, not from my clients.\"</p><p>Battle will soon be joined between bank-- sponsored platforms - both multibank and single bank - and independent platforms.</p><p>It seems likely that independent platforms will struggle to succeed. Blackbird, an electronic swaps broker, and high-yield platforms Limitrader and Trading Edge have seen only small business flow, despite being two or three years ahead of the major banks. Likewise some of the other non-bank bond trading platforms have failed to take off.</p><p>But there are reasons for that, aside from independence issues. \"A lot of them simply didn't have the right models to start with,\". says Justin Bull, head of e-commerce at Barclays Capital. \"Trading platforms for illiquid bonds, for example, are systems ahead of their time as far as many investors are concerned.\" A terrible market for high-yield paper doesn't help much either.</p><p>As for Blackbird, says Simon Lack, Chase's e-commerce head and formerly the bank's head of swaps trading: \"It is a great system and fun to trade on. But swaps is already such a competitive market that those of us already in it saw no reason to let in yet another broker to take business away from us.\"</p><p>And there are other developments that appear to call into question the prospects for neutral systems. The most obvious is the appearance of several big initiatives in the foreign exchange and credit markets that are run exclusively by member banks: FUI, Market Axess, BondBook, BondClick and to a lesser extent Atriax. With each announcement comes an extra concession by multi-bank platforms to their customers. Market Axess was the first non-treasuries platform to offer joint pricing. FXall announced a plan to have a sellside advisory board; as did BondBook. BondBook also offers anonymous pricing, something that hands back to the market one of the banks' biggest advantages: knowledge of market flow, and the ability to trade off it.</p><p>BondClick, once it finally got started, made rapid progress, and is getting good feedback for spending more time with potential clients asking what they want and how they want it delivered.</p><p>But only Atriax has an independent CEO, Dan Morehead, formerly CFO at Tiger Asset Management, although one of the reasons he got the job was because of his experience in forex at Deutsche Bank, a founding partner, where he had impressed the investment banks head, Edson Mitchell.</p><p>Consortium sites are increasingly keen to show some aspect of independence from the banks and an inclusion of end customers, But their board members are all from the member banks, which own the vast majority of the equity (some is left over for the staff, but not a huge amount).</p><p>There is some justification for leaving buyside clients off the board, as BondBook's coCEO, James Pellicane, explains. \"It is politically much more of a minefield choosing a few buy-side participators. There are so many of them, and so many different strategies. And it's sometimes more difficult for buy-side firms, in their role as fiduciaries, to participate as equity stakeholders.\"</p><p>The end of independence</p><p>It's all a far cry from the heady days of 1999 when banks were simply happy to own a stake - any stake - in anything that might conceivably threaten their business. It even carried over into 2000. But with each successive new announcement of a multi-bank platform, the arguments of the independents that they should be preferred by end customers have sounded weaker. \"Anyone preaching independence as a virtue now is doing so more out of necessity that anything else,\" says one banker.</p><p>In their search for liquidity, greater market recognition, and possibly because they, too, feared losing out to the march of the brokers, several of the independent platforms began to court, and take, investments from the established players.</p><p>Equavant, for example, entered into a partnership with FleetBoston in October to develop its bank loan trading system. Currenex allowed Barclays Capital to come on board that same month. In November 1999, Jeffries took a stake in Limitrader, CSFB in Trading Edge, and Chase in CreditTrade.</p><p>Of all of them, Equavant has undergone the biggest change in its approach to its equity and governance structure. It was set up towards the end of 1999, originally called ereorg, by Ronald DeKoven, a good-- humoured lawyer who spent much of his career advising on many of the world's major debt default negotiations.</p><p>His idea was to set up an internet platform to trade distressed debt and bank debt, and the plan from the start was to run it as a wholly independent platform. When Euromoney first visited his office in November 1999 he had just taken a call from one of the top five US commercial banks looking to buy a stake. He turned them down flat.</p><p>But by May he had resigned as CEO, with the rumour being that his approach had so alienated the banks thats they refused to cooperated at all. He still remains as chairman, though, and retains a seat chairman the board.</p><p>Phil Andryc, president since the last January, took over as CEO. This former chief technology officer at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter commands a good deal of respect in the markets. And he has adopted a move inclusive approach to building the business than his predecessor. \"The idea that if you build it they will come has evolved into a recognition that while it's all well and good to build it t, you need to get flow onto the system. And to get that means partnering with and giving equity stakes to the liquidity providers.\"</p><p>Thus far, though, just one bank has signed up, FleetBoston, in October, at same time as erorg changed its name to Equavant. As well as developing the bank debt trading platform, Fleet is also as advising on Equavant's plans to set up a primary loan bank invested in an independent platform is hardly ideal, as it leaves you open to the charge of being in that institution's pocket. lt's a dilemma Simon Lack, Chase's e-commerce head, pondered before investing his firm's money in CreditTrade. \"Yes, I was concerned that we would be the only bank on the platform, but we had studied the options and decided that Credit Trade offered us the best model preferable, we only have one board seat, and they don't need to rely solely on us for liquidity since they acquired the Prebon Yamane credit derivatives brokers.\"</p><p>Liquidity isn't an issue for Equavant yet as it has not started to trade. But Andryc is sensitive to the situation. \"Our vision is to have between four and six partners. And Fleet has made it very clear that whoever joins does so on a wholly equal basis.\"</p><p>For now, though, Fleet is there on its own, and that has got observers talking. Rumour has it that Andryc has been looking for other partners without success. That could be because banks are still reacting against DeKoven's earlier intransigence, or because the banks are not so keen on the platform as it stands. \"An online auction-- based model for distressed debt works just fine,\" says one banker. \"It's simply transferring the phone model onto the web. But loan trading doesn't operate that way.\"</p><p>That, surely, would be an argument for getting in now, early, while the model is being developed and white the valuation is low.</p><p>In any event, all Fleet has so far is an equity stake and two seats on the fledgling advisory board, Even with another five banks as partners, says Andryc, \"we will maintain the majority holding and the majority of seats on the executive committee\". At present Fleet has no seats on the executive board. They belong to Andryc, DeKoven and another employee, two venture capitalists from backers Warburg Pinkus, and two for the angel investors. Any changes will still leave banks in the minority. \"We all agree the last thing we need is a UNstyle board where nothing gets done,\" says Andryc. \"So although we will allow them onto the board in due course, they will be in the minority. And their seats will come from a mixture of vacancies as the angel investors pull out, and expanding the overall number.\" And what if there are more banks than seats? \"We've been pondering rotating the bankassigned seat.\"</p><p>Another start-up that is feeling the need to adapt is Creditex, which was founded in April 1999 as an online credit derivatives trading market by co-CEOs John McEvoy and Sunil Hirani after they left Deutsche Bank. Creditex is the only purely electronic credit derivatives platform in the market, and to date over $L5 billion in notional volume has been traded since it went live in March.</p><p>Creditex is neither a full multi-bank platform nor entirely independent but a hybrid. It has some big banks as investors, including JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank, its first two strategic investors, and it has other, non-bank, end-users with stakes as well, something none of the pure multi-banks have ventured to do.</p><p>But the founders have retained a majority stake for themselves. Although coy about the exact details of their board, they do say that their main concern was to keep it small - so most investors are pure equity holders and not board members.</p><p>Theoretically, it is the ideal mix: an independent management team with a big stake in the company as an incentive on the one hand, and on the other a good crop of the major liquidity providers in the market.</p><p>So it might come as a surprise to learn that McEvoy and Hirani are setting up a sister company, an online secondary loan-trading platform. Not only is it to be a separate company, but they are also giving the banks as a group a 51% stake. Why are they giving up what appeared to be one of their main advantages? Because the banking empire is striking back. \"We have four of the six largest loan traders invested in Creditex, so we could have kept it as one company,\" says McEvoy. \"But banks want the valuation associated with just one product on each platform at a time. And the environment is nothing like as favourable to start-ups as it was last year. Banks don't feel anywhere near as threatened by them, so feel they have a stronger hand to play.\"</p><p>A corporate fan club</p><p>Yet just as the advantage appeared to be shifting back to the banks, along comes Shell with its investment in Currenex. They are at pains to point out that it is not an exclusive arrangement, and that there is nothing to stop them using FXall or Atriax, but they chose to invest in Currenex after studying the market options for nearly 12 months.</p><p>The independent platform appears to appeal especially to corporates - MasterCard is another fan of Currenex - and it was pressure from such clients that persuaded Barclays Capital to invest as well - at the time taken as yet another slap in the face for independence. \"Our clients wanted us to join, pure and simple,\" says Bull at Barclays Capital. \"About half a dozen told us that they liked the site, and liked its independence and wanted us to put our prices on it.\"</p><p>With Shell and Barclays, Currenex is the only platform to have both buy and sell side in equal measure - not the greatest boast when there's just one from each side - but it is a balance the company's CEO, Lori Mirek, has been striving hard to keep. \"There were no problems from other banks in having just Barclays join,\" she says. \"We've made it very clear to all of them from the start that we want all of them to take part in some form or other. And we're being very careful to keep the platform wholly independent. Neither buy nor sell side can get more than a to% stake in total, and we're not giving them a seat on the board.\"</p><p>If that seems reckless, given what fellow independent platforms have gone through, there are a few points to remember in Currenex's favour. It is already up and running, and has liquidity. The leading forex banks have invested in their own consortia. But clients like the independence of Currenex, which is why they use it. If players like MasterCard, Shell and the Inter-American Development Bank decide they want to use such a platform, the banks will sit up and listen.</p><p>Who do you want to use them?</p><p>It sounds like a naive question, but there really is no consensus on who exactly is being targeted by some of these platforms. Euromoney asked a board member of one of the forex consortia which customers his bank wanted to target through the platform. Rather shockingly, there was silence, followed by some mumbling about corporates and fund managers.</p><p>Another member of the same platform also found it shocking. \"We've all submitted names to the CEO, so we all ought to know who we're targeting.\"</p><p>But there's disagreement on who will do the marketing of the platform. Some feel that the consortium won't be hiring enough marketing staff so the banks will do it for them, yet others say that this would present too much of a conflict as the new business develops, and in any case would be counterproductive for the consortium not to do it.</p><p>A common line is that these platforms are being developed as a response to client demand, that the big funds want to see commingled prices. That may be true. But do banks really want to see their biggest clients move that way?</p><p>\"This is a very high-contact business,\" says an e-commerce representative from one of the major investment banks. \"And bankers want to keep those relationships. If they start going electronic, there's a bigger chance of losing them. Basically, online platforms, for now at least, are largely designed to deal with the smaller clients who you never cared about before. If you can get 95% of them online, you're providing them with a better service than they had before, and you rid yourself of an uneconomic irritation. If mid-sized clients go on, it's a help, but some of those are your next big clients, so you don't want them all to go electronic.</p><p>\"As for the top clients, they're the last people you want to get online as they pay most of your bonuses. If they want to buy a stock on the New York Stock Exchange and want to go there in person on an elephant with the queen of Sheba, you'll do it for them. Internet trading's good for about 5% of their orders - the small, easy tickets. The rest you really want to be doing person to person.\"</p><p>In the end it is what investors choose to do that will resolve many of the issues that are plaguing the development of the independent, proprietary and multi-bank platforms. Thus far they don't seem to care all that much. Average trade sizes on TradeWeb, for example, are below the average for the treasuries market.</p><p>Most platforms still haven't launched yet, though investors are being bombarded with information about over 120 platforms, if not more. Large investors are none too impressed.</p><p>Most will only tackle one part of what an investor needs, which is usually the ability to see prices from several banks and then trade off it, completely ignoring the fact that most investors rarely trade in such a void.</p><p>And while each platform's members struggle to find the right partners, the right strategy and the right technology, the investors can sit back and watch, continuing to do business the old-fashioned way. Once the mergers between platforms begin, and succeed, and once most are operational, investors will start looking more seriously at which might benefit them. And by that stage we'll be on to the next new new thing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">67914309 ABI</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:42HF-F1X0-0109-N4PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">148636</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8507\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Bell &amp;

The manner in which Indian-Americans led superbly productive lives indicates the distance that policymakers in India need to traverse before they create an environment that will reward rather than punish excellence. Control of the citizen by the state is the foundational tenet of colonialism, and just as British-era laws, practices and regulations have been faithfully adhered to, even while several politicians (including those who send their children to study and stay in the US, Australia or the UK) in India continue to ensure that the teaching of English is confined to the upper reaches of society by restricting the teaching of that language in government schools in a manner that perpetuates the Digital Divide between income classes in India. </p><p>Given the overhang of colonial mindsets in India, the coming to power of a man descended from humble roots as the Prime Minister of India has resulted in a change in the situation. Even during the campaign for winning a majority in the Lok Sabha in 2014, Narendra Damodardas Modi spoke of \"Minimum Government\". He did away with such archaic practices as having a gazetted officer mandatorily attest each certificate, as though the word of a citizen were not enough to establish its genuineness. More and more processes are coming within the purview of the digital drive. However, care must be taken to see that a few do not succeed in extinguishing the livelihoods of the many as a consequence of their actions. The way in which the US Trade Representative has been seeking to force the Government of India to roll back even the limited number of restraints that have been imposed on mega enterprises betray a callous-indeed cruel-disregard for tens of millions of individuals who rank among the most needy in the world. Already the livelihoods of millions of small artisans and craftsmen have been destroyed by the flood of cheap Chinese replacements for goods made by them. Stopping the flood through taxation or checks at the border would be less effective than schemes that would ensure funding and logistics for small craftspersons and artisans in India. The country needs not just a single Khadi &amp;#38; Village Industries Commission but several such organisations, including in the private sector. In much the same manner, millions of jobs in small and tiny retail are in danger of being lost forever, were the giant companies headquartered in the west coast of the US to retain a monopoly in the way that is happening now. First it was small shopkeepers who were driven out of business as a consequence of shopping malls proliferating across the country. Next it was the impact of internet retailing by Amazon and others that, if unchecked, will lead to immense human misery.</p><p>Efforts by giant US and European pharmaceutical companies to remove competition from India and its generic drugs industry need to be countered. From funding the writing of books against Indian pharma to bankrolling multiple fake news items about the quality of the medicines produced in India, the relentless effort of the USTR has been to use methods such as absurdly expanded versions of IPR protection laws and regulations to choke into irrelevance the generic drugs industry in India. Use has also been made of legal processes to entrap Indian companies in litigation for years, often in the US, but very often in India as well. Protection of the poor is the responsibility of any government that regards the ordinary citizen as needing help, rather than the millionaire or the billionaire class getting treated as the only segment of society that merits their indulgence. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal needs to stand firm on such issues, so that the livelihoods of the poor do not get impacted. At the same time, there needs to be a system in place that can incentivise investments, especially in manufacturing. The relationship between the US and India is comprehensive and complex, but needed for global stability and overall economic progress. Such policies should improve the lives of the poor, and not add yet more zeroes to the wealth of a few Big Tech or Big Pharma barons. India can and hopefully will go the extra mile in working with the US to ensure stability and security in sensitive zones, including in South Asia and in the Middle East. However, this does not mean that policies designed to protect the livelihoods of tens and indeed hundreds of millions should be abandoned, as demanded by USTR.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Sunday Guardian.

The landscape is dotted with wild yellow mustard in the spring and pumpkins in the fall. A popular place for day-trippers to picnic, go wine-tasting, and shop at roadside farm stands, the region-affectionately nicknamed \"the Slowcoast\" for its unhurried pace-is a balm to the busyness nearby in Silicon Valley, to the east, and San Francisco, to the north.</p><p><br/><br/>Home to fewer than 3,000 people, the South Coast is the least densely populated part of the Bay Area. While it feels like a region unto itself, it is part of San Mateo County, which is where-just over the Santa Cruz Mountains-several big tech companies, such as Facebook and Oracle, are based. South of those firms' campuses (in Santa Clara County) are the well-known tech hubs of Mountain View, Cupertino, and Palo Alto. San Mateo County is also the home of some of the wealthiest tech executives: The city of Atherton, about a 30-mile drive from the South Coast, was, according to Forbes, the country's most expensive zip code <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/betsyschiffman/2015/11/10/full-list-most-expensive-zip-codes-in-2015/#5bc907583693\">in 2015</url> and the third-most expensive       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/samanthasharf/2016/12/08/full-list-americas-most-expensive-zip-codes-2016/\">in 2016</url>. The countywide median price for a single-family home       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/06/22/bay-area-homes-prices-up-sales-down-from-2015/\">reached $1.2 million</url> last year.<br/>The coast, whose heritage is defined by farming rather than tech, has become more expensive by proximity, but the area shares little in Silicon Valley's wealth. As a recent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://flipflashpages.uniflip.com/2/88537/377983/pub/html5.html\">report</url> from the Mountain View-based nonprofit Silicon Valley Community Foundation (SVCF) described, \"The affluence of Silicon Valley-located just 'over the hill,' as many residents say-has not touched [people on the South Coast] except by making their lives more expensive: fog rolls over from the coast and cost rolls the other way.\"<br/>The report profiles local families, including one couple and their three school-age children who live in a rusted, insect-infested trailer that has a leaky roof and no heat. The parents make less than $11 an hour working for a local flower nursery and pay $1,100 a month for their housing. According to the report, the family's situation isn't an exception-it's the reality for hundreds of South Coast residents, mostly Latino farmworker families. \"We have people living in Third World conditions in the heart of the First World, affluent prosperity that comes with Silicon Valley,\" says Erica Wood, the chief of community impact for the foundation, which last year had a budget of $22.4 million.<br/>The report also focused on how the coast's four tiny, unincorporated towns-Pescadero, La Honda, San Gregorio, and Loma Mar-are remarkably isolated considering how close they are to Silicon Valley. These communities have no public transit linking them together and lack basic infrastructure, such as a sewer system, drainage ditches, or internet service. They have no laundromat, emergency room, medical professionals, or licensed daycare centers, and-even though many residents work in the fields-little to no access to affordable food. The water at two of the area's three schools is too contaminated to drink, although one is hoping to turn its faucets back on soon. Many families drive to Watsonville, over an hour's drive to the south, to do laundry and shop for food.<br/>The road from Highway 1 to downtown Pescadero passes the Pescadero Marsh, a picturesque 235-acre nature preserve. One recent soggy Monday afternoon, on the town's main strip, cyclists in spandex with expensive bikes congregated in front of a hip coffee shop and tourists stopped to buy artichoke bread and taste local wine. This small patch of development-which is home to about a dozen businesses and 250 residents-is one of only two small areas that benefit from county water services, and has Pescadero's lone corner of broadband internet availability.<br/>On the outskirts of town, next to Pescadero Elementary and set against a backdrop of cows grazing on rolling hills, is Puente de la Costa Sur, or simply \"Puente,\" the community center that has come to provide many of residents' basic needs. (In English, its name means \"South Coast Bridge.\") Puente, founded in 1998 and funded by the county, private foundations, and individual donors, tries to fill in some of the gaps in necessities. For example, the South Coast has no hospitals, doctors, nurses, dentists, pediatricians, or ob-gyns, so Puente hosts a health clinic for two hours once a week.<br/>Perhaps the area's most urgent problem is a shortage of affordable places to live. Housing prices and rents have famously skyrocketed across the Bay Area in recent years due, in part, to spillover effects of restrictive housing policies in San Francisco. The consequences of those policies, which have limited density and the addition of affordable housing units, have been felt       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/25/alviso-small-town-caught-in-silicon-valleys-real-estate-rat-race/\">even in communities</url> that don't offer the same booming economies as, say, Mountain View or San Francisco. For instance, demand for housing from people working in Silicon Valley has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/california-homelessness-santa-cruz-housing-affordability\">helped make</url> Santa Cruz, where residents who work locally now find it hard to compete with tech commuters for housing, the \"least affordable city in California,\" and, some have argued, contributed to a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/13/california-homelessness-silicon-valley-tech-commuters\">rise in homelessness</url> in California's Central Valley. Rents on the South Coast have similarly spiked: Last October, a five-person family that Puente works with lost their housing and, unable to find a new home, slept in their SUV throughout the winter. Rita Mancera, Puente's executive director, helped by scouring rental listings for them, but small two-bedrooms were asking $2,500 a month, which was out of reach on the parents' farmworker incomes.<br/>As housing prices have swelled, incomes on the South Coast haven't risen accordingly. In San Mateo County, the median household income for a family of four is currently $115,300, according to the county's Department of Housing. For South Coast farmworker families, according to SVCF, it's $26,000. A third of the area's farmworkers live in employer-provided farmworker housing-much of which is badly in need of improvement or replacement-and the rest must compete for extremely limited market-rate housing. As a result, hundreds of families end up crowding into rundown trailers, where children often sleep on couches and floors.<br/>If history had unfolded differently, it's possible that the South Coast would now look like much of Southern California, where development canvasses the land right up to the seaside bluffs. Things seemed to be heading that way in the 1970s, when Silicon Valley expanded to cover a larger swath of the Bay Area. But a small group of activists made sure the sprawl didn't continue west: \"[They said], 'We don't want our coastline to look like Orange County, filled with starter mansions and big subdivisions and a ton of population,'\" says Marti Tedesco, the vice president of marketing for the Peninsula Open Space Trust, or POST. The nonprofit was founded in 1977 and has protected 75,000 acres in the years since, 24,000 of which are within the boundaries of the school district covering La Honda and Pescadero. Typically, POST transfers ownership of the land it buys to a public agency, such as a local, state, or national park. Still, with about 12,000 acres currently in its ownership, it is the largest landowner on the South Coast.<br/>Other private land trusts and The Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District, an independent, voter-formed group that has preserved more than 63,000 acres in the Bay Area in the past 45 years, contribute to the vast network of protected acreage along the coast. Over the years, these organizations have purchased swaths of farmland from private landowners in order to prevent development, often then selling or leasing it back to local farmers at lower prices. Some of Silicon Valley's richest residents have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/16/silicon-valley-discovers-the-south-coast-the-peninsulas-final-frontier/\">already bought up thousands of acres</url> of land themselves, often to use for ranches. As more look into doing the same, POST has launched an initiative to protect 2,250 additional acres of land.<br/>Don Horsley, the county supervisor whose district includes the South Coast, is pleased with such efforts. \"There are wealthy people who look at the South Coast and think, 'Oh my, it's bucolic and beautiful and wonderful and I think I'm going to buy this land, and there's this farmer on it so I want him off,'\" he says. \"Land that's traditionally agricultural gets bought up by wealthy people who don't see any value in it, and just want it to be an estate. ... That's the value of having these [preservation groups] grabbing up those farms.\"<br/>Compared to the economic output of San Mateo County's most well-known industry, agriculture's barely registers. \"The amount of money that's generated is somewhere around about $140 million annually, which sounds like a lot-but when you have Facebook with billions, it's not a lot,\" Horsley says.<br/>He adds that that $140 million is worth safeguarding, but money is just one reason locals and other officials like him want to preserve the coast's agriculture. Farming has been a way of life on the coast for hundreds of years, and for the last several decades, protecting land from development has kept the region's beauty, culture, and history intact. \"We've been able to preserve our coastside in San Mateo County, I think, like no other,\" says Horsley. \"It is good stewardship of the land, [and] it preserves our agricultural heritage in the county.\" And although San Mateo County's food output is smaller than that of many other California counties-the produce for sale at the Bay Area's farmers' markets is grown throughout the region-Horsley says the growing demand for local and organic foods provides further grounds for conserving a local source of meat, fruits and vegetables.<br/>Farmland, however, is of limited use without enough workers to tend to it. The South Coast's lack of affordable housing makes it hard to support a population of farmworkers, without whom the county's already struggling agriculture sector would collapse. Agricultural production in the county suffered a record loss of $20 million in 2015, and POST has found that the county has lost 35 percent of its farmland over the last 30 years. This decline is due to competition from overseas (particularly cheap flowers), a lack of readily available water, and the state's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-farms-immigration/\">worsening farm-labor shortage</url>.<br/>Based on a county assessment released last fall, more than 1,000 units of farmworker housing are needed to remedy the coast's housing situation. So that families don't have to compete with other residents for market-rate housing, the need could be met through on-site housing provided by the growers or independent housing intended only for farmworker families (and funded by county loans set aside for these developments). The latter is the preferred solution, because, with the former, Horsley explains, \"If you decided you wanted to go work for someone else, you might lose your housing.\"<br/>Puente is making some headway on this problem. It is planning a program that matches farmworkers with empty vacation rentals. POST too is trying to help, by facilitating a project, with funding from the county, that will upgrade the housing available on a farm in San Gregorio.<br/>But there are serious obstacles to building new housing on the South Coast. \"The land is one thing. But does it have water and does it have septic?\" asks Horsley. Everything from the possibility of adding affordable housing to the likelihood of building a laundromat hinges on that question and the answer, most often, is no. There is the additional complication that Pescadero, the largest of the four unincorporated communities on the South Coast, is close to marshland and thus prone to flooding, which means that some of the complaints townspeople have brought up-including needs described in the SVCF report such as sidewalks and new buildings-would be difficult and expensive to address. And even the area's dedication to open space-the thing that gives it its characteristic appeal-to some extent stands in the way to building housing: Open-space districts aren't in the business of allowing new development, including housing, on their lands.<br/>Add in an \"astonishing number of state and federally protected species,\" says Kellyx Nelson, the executive director of the San Mateo County Resource Conservation District, and getting anything done on the South Coast becomes even more difficult; regulations there have evolved in a piecemeal fashion, with a throng of agencies, from the California Coastal Commission to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, staking out jurisdiction.<br/>Nelson and others on the South Coast hope that people in Silicon Valley will be moved to pitch in. \"There have been tremendous changes and pressures on a place that to a visitor looks like Brigadoon-that's sort of captured in time. It looks quaint. It's rural,\" she says. \"But that belies the tremendous accelerated changes and pressures on that area.\"<br/>Mancera, the director of Puente, remains focused on the gap between the South Coast and the thriving economy just over the hills. She hopes tech companies or their employees might consider investing in broadband in the area or setting up internship programs for local high-schoolers. If the workers at the biggest tech companies' campuses, located about 20 miles east as the crow flies, deserve laundry facilities (and, for some, even employer-provided laundry service), she thinks, the farmworkers of the South Coast should have access to a laundromat that isn't more than an hour's drive away.<br/>Read       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/06/silicon-valley-pescadero/531423/\">The Poverty Just Over the Hills From Silicon Valley</url> on theatlantic.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-thepovertyjustoverthehillsfromsiliconvalley531423</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NWH-STC1-DYY9-J441-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2267\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

It reflected the power of the US Congress as a co-equal branch of government in a presidential system. The four CEOs - Sundar Pichai, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos - technology and management titans in their own right, behaved with obvious deference, aware of the power of Congress and diligent Congressmen, to impact on their business through exhortation and new regulation.   In a unique display of 'bipartisanship' for the current Congress, the companies were criticised by both the Republicans and the Democrats, though for different reasons.   The Democrats faulted them for their monopolistic practices, buying up potential rivals, disadvantaging competitors on their platforms, negatively impacting small business, using data generated by rivals for developing their own competing products, and deriving profit from user data, often without explicit consent, not paying for news content carried on their sites.   The Republican criticism was focused more on perceived censorship of conservative viewpoints, with the West Coast-based companies seen as influenced by Left-of-Centre views of their employees. Google had at one stage walked back from participating in Pentagon's Project Maven (use of AI for drone strikes), on account of employee backlash. Facebook was criticised for not doing enough to control proliferation of fake accounts, nearly 6.5 billion every year, since investors and advertisers were lured by user base.   David Cicilline, the chair of the subcommittee, in his remarks, said that because \"these companies are so central to our modern life, their business practices and decisions have an outsized effect on our economy and our democracy. Any single action by any one of these companies can affect hundreds of millions of us in profound and lasting ways....Their ability to dictate terms, call the shots, upend entire sectors, and inspire fear represent the powers of a private government\".   In his summation, he concluded that the companies enjoyed unacceptable power, and there was a need to break them up or regulate them further. Instances were cited of railroad and steel companies in US, in an earlier era, the Rockefellers and Carnegies of yore that had used their monopoly to derive huge profits, and squelch competition.   There could be more regulations on these companies, particularly on their use of data. Beyond privacy, there is talk of bulk anonymised data to be put in public domain for competitor use, or to spur further innovation. There is a similar ongoing debate in India regarding non-personal data, and its use for public purpose, beyond private profit and market power of the data aggregator.   In case, there is attempt to unravel some of the acquisitions of these companies, there could be opportunities also for Indian companies. Restrictions on Amazon from using competitor data from its platform, reminds of restrictions in India on their inventory-based model.   Other countries are also taking various measures. Australia has given Google and Facebook three months to negotiate with Australian media for fair pay for news content. In Europe, several measures are under consideration, such as: making it illegal for Amazon and Apple to give their own products preferential treatment; requiring Google to share search data with smaller competitors, and Facebook to make its services work more easily with rival social networks; enforcing a digital tax to enable revenue for government and society where data is being generated, and then used for profit.   In a COVID-19 impacted world, with digital making further inroads, the power of these companies will come for further scrutiny, even as Europe will want to promote competition through its own champions, and China will have to assess impact on its companies as the world wakes to the security and data privacy challenges.   The hearings clearly reflected the power of democracy, of smaller businesses and consumers having their voices and concerns heard through their representatives, despite the technological and financial dominance of the companies. However, breaking them up or regulating them effectively will not be easy. They have tremendous power of lobbying Congressmen and Senators, and will make a case for needing size and flexibility to meet the technological challenge from China.   Many of the regulations imposed on banks and financial companies in the US after the 2008 financial crisis, have since been eased. In India too, there is talk of needing national champions in various sectors to stand up to competition from China, South Korea, the US, Europe and others.
